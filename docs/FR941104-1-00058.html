The Service supported the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, both at the Standing Committee meeting of March, 1994, and in writing to the CITES Secretariat. The Service remains strongly supportive of increasing the role of law enforcement in the CITES context, both through networks among the Parties and through increased training of appropriate enforcement officials. It is the Service's understanding that the item is already on the agenda for COP9, and that one or more Parties may have already submitted resolutions on the subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the possible resolutions that the Service may consider submitting were also received from the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), the Hawthorn Corporation, and one private individual. The CIEL requested that the United States submit a resolution that clarifies the relationship between CITES and other international agreements related to the management of species. The CIEL's suggestions can be considered to be incorporated into the resolution discussed below, regarding the implementation of Article XIV of the Convention, which deals with the relationship between CITES and treaties regulating the management of marine species. The Hawthorn Corporation provided comments on the issue of trade in tiger parts and products, and requested that trade in captive-bred tigers for circuses and other live animal exhibitions be differentiated from concerns about trade in tiger parts and products and related poaching of wild tigers. The Service agrees that tigers that are part of a U.S. traveling circus are not part of the trade problem related to the poaching of wild specimens. Circus tigers, born in the United States, are certified as captive-bred under CITES by the Service and are eligible for a certificate from the Service's Office of Management Authority. The private individual provided comments on various issues related to trade in artificially propagated plants, which the Service will take into consideration when reviewing resolutions pertaining to that trade, upon their receipt from the CITES Secretariat. In addition, the Service's Office of Scientific Authority has been working with the CITES Nomenclature Committee to consolidate and update the previous resolutions dealing with nomenclatural issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following presents the background and sense of the three resolutions submitted by the United States for consideration at COP9. (The Service's tentative positions on resolutions and agenda items, including those discussed in this notice as well as on the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, were presented in a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of October 4, 1994 (59 FR 50609)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Resolutions Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Article XIV Implementation. The provisions of CITES apply to all species of wild fauna and flora, including marine species. The management of many marine species comes under the jurisdiction or competence of another international treaty, convention, or agreement. International trade in any species of marine fauna or flora is also within the purview and competence of CITES. Therefore, even if a marine species is subject to management under another international treaty, convention, or agreement, and if it is listed in any CITES Appendix, then international trade and introduction from the sea in the species is also regulated by CITES. CITES made special provisions for Appendix II marine species that are regulated under another treaty extant when CITES came into force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article XIV, paragraph 4, of the Convention provides that a State party to CITES, which is also a party to any other treaty, convention, or international agreement which was in force at the time of the coming into force of CITES, and under the provisions of which protection is afforded to marine species included in Appendix II, is relieved of the obligations imposed on it under CITES with respect to trade in specimens included in Appendix II that are taken by ships registered in that State and in accordance with the provisions of such other treaty, convention, or international agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Article XIV, paragraph 5 requires that Parties exempted from the usual CITES obligations under Article XIV, paragraph 4, must nevertheless issue certificates stipulating that the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of the other treaty, convention, or international agreement in question. This provision of the Convention has never been used, and standards for its implementation have not been developed. Currently no marine species whose management is under the competence of another treaty, convention, or agreement is listed in Appendix II (this relief from CITES obligations does not apply to specimens of species included in Appendix I).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has determined that it would be wise to plan for the need to implement Article XIV, by specifying requirements for certificates issued pursuant to Article XIV, paragraph 5, of the Convention, even if its use is not necessary at this time. The Service notes that Appendix II allows for international commercial trade. The draft resolution was written in consultation with NMFS. The Service's goal in submitting this resolution is to clarify how an Appendix II listing could be implemented expeditiously for a marine species whose management was under the competency of a pre-CITES treaty. The draft resolution would provide for the utilization, as a valid certificate under Article XIV, paragraph 5, of a certificate of origin or statistical document issued on the authority of the other treaty, convention, or international agreement, with certain stipulations of minimum information and validation as required by CITES. Such certificates would only be an option for CITES Parties that are also parties to the other treaty, convention, or agreement, and if the specimens are taken by ships registered by the Party country. Export permits or introduction from the sea certificates are required in all other situations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Ruling safeguards lift-truck jobs THE FUTURE of manufacturing in the UK by Lancer Boss Group, the biggest British-owned lift-truck producer, was secured yesterday after two years of uncertainty caused by a green-belt planning row. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has granted Boss planning permission for a project to consolidate manufacturing on one site in the company's home town of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Boss manufactures in seven sites scattered across the town, and Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman, had warned that objections to the consolidation plan might have forced the company to relocate its manufacturing operations overseas. Mr Howard's decision safeguards 600 jobs in Boss's manufacturing and related departments at Leighton Buzzard. It could also mean the creation of 500 jobs in the town by boosting the company's status as an efficient, high-volume producer. Boss has manufactured lift trucks in Leighton Buzzard since 1959, and two years ago announced the consolidation plan to remain competitive in the cut-throat global lift-truck industry and to take advantage of growth markets such as the Far East. The plan involves a 37,000 sq metre extension of one of the Boss factories, which would encroach on the green belt by 95 metres. Local planning permission was granted last year but objections from Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, and a local preservation society led the environment department to call in the plan, and Boss was asked to submit a review of possible alternatives. Mr Howard yesterday said: 'I have had to balance the benefits to the national and local economy against the harm that will be done to the green belt. 'I have carefully considered the evidence relating to the availability of alternative sites, but concluded that none has been identified which would be suitable for the purpose and available within the required timescale.' The decision will be an immense relief for Boss employees and components suppliers in the UK. Over the past decade Boss has bought manufacturers of lift trucks in Spain, Germany and Italy, all of which could have provided immediate production capacity at the expense of running down the British plant. Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw, vice-chairman, said the uncertainty over the plans would delay the start of the extension, as other Boss European factories have had to be given priority while the planning permission was being reviewed. Boss expects to finalise the extension plan towards the end of next year.</p>

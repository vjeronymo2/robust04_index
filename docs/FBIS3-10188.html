There is little to commemorate in the first  real military NATO action, the consequence of which was the  destruction of four Serbian fighter planes, besides the  unprecedented characteristic of the event, and the fact that the  Serbs now know that the ultimatums issued by the NATO in the  name of the United Nations are backed by the force of weapons  and the will to use them. The incident served to demonstrate  that NATO will not hesitate to use its operational superiority  to maintain the exclusion zones established by the UN peace  forces free from air strikes. In other words, the determination  of one of the parties to comply with the public threats it has  made is now known. What is not known is how far the other party  will go in this confrontation of wills.    Since World War II the Yugoslav Armed Forces, made up mostly  of Serbs, have prepared themselves for low-intensity war. This  is what the Serbian militias have been doing in Bosnia, never  engaging in a frontal battle against a superior enemy and never  hurrying to close the siege. The policy followed by the Serbian  leader in Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, is in keeping with this  military doctrine. Even Russia expressed support for the NATO  action -- without, however, condemning its traditional Serbian  allies. Karadzic went to Moscow to hold a meeting with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. They agreed to open as of 7  March the airport of the besieged Muslim city of Tuzla for  humanitarian missions. Karadzic is playing the game well. He  obeys the NATO ultimatum which had established that date to open  the airport; has offered the Russians the chance to once again  emerge as a decisive and essential player in any  political-diplomatic arrangement in the Balkans; and at the same  time he is telling his followers that it is yet not time to end  the fight -- to the point that after the downing of the four  Serbian airplanes Karadzic's militias bombed Tuzla, aiming at a  hospital, a grocery store, an ammunition factory, and one of the  landing strips of the airport.    The downing of four Serbian airplanes boosts the credibility  of President Clinton's foreign policy, but does not represent a  guarantee that there is a solution at hand for the Bosnian  problem. After two years of hesitation, the Western world powers  agreed on something in imposing restrictions on Serbian forces.  These restrictions, however, are mild, and do not stop the  massacre or the taking over of territory, and much less do they  guarantee free traffic for the UN peace forces in Bosnia. There  is not enough basic will to impose conditions for a minimally  fair and lasting solution to guarantee peace in Europe.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Move on Mexican killing Mexico's Attorney-General's office said yesterday it was seeking to remove congressional immunity from Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a deputy from the state of Taumilpas, so as to charge him in connection with the killing last week of Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the ruling party. Mr Munoz Rocha was implicated by Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, who is reported to have confessed to participating in the crime and claims Mr Munoz Rocha believed Mr Ruiz Massieu's death could block political reforms aimed at introducing more democracy into Mexico's political system.</p>

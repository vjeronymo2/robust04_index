Under the various sections of Title II of the National Housing Act, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is authorizing to insure mortgage loans upon certain multifamily rental housing projects and health care facilities (nursing homes, extended care facilities, board and care homes and hospitals). Under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended, and section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, as amended, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to make capital advance for supportive housing for the elderly and supportive housing for persons with disabilities. Generally, the mortgages are defined as those ``commonly given'' in the various States; therefore, State and local law govern virtually the entire mortgage insurance transaction from the formation of the mortgagor entity to the making and securitization of the loan to the construction of the project is accord with local law. Consequently, prior to the making of a capital advance or endorsement of a mortgage note for insurance in connection with a multifamily rental project or a health care facility, it is imperative that HUD know the precise legal status of the mortgagor entity and of the realty and personalty which will comprise the security property. Inasmuch as the transaction is largely coordinated by the counsel to the mortgagor or owner (in the case of the section 202 and 811 programs), HUD has looked to such counsel for an opinion which provides comfort to the insured mortgagee and HUD regarding virtually all legal aspects of the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24 CFR 200.150 provides the regulatory authority for the collection of ``all supporting documents'' and ``other exhibits as required by the terms of the commitment'' once the conditions of the commitment for mortgage insurance have been met and the mortgage note is presented for endorsement by HUD. Similarly, 24 CFR 889.415 and 890.415 provide the regulatory authority for the requirements prior to initial closing and the preparation of the necessary documents including the attorney's opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it is unclear that the rendering of a legal opinion is within the ambit of ``the collection of information,'' HUD has determined that the more conservative approach is to treat the opinion as such and let OMB make a definitive determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The opinion is designed to provide HUD and the mortgagee with assurance that the mortgagor or owner entity has been validly formed, lawfully exists and that the security property and the construction thereupon comply with appropriate local laws such as building codes, zoning, etc. Further, the loan documents must comport with local law and practice and only an attorney licensed in the jurisdiction can complete such documents and provide HUD with the requisite assurance. It would be an enormous burden for HUD and the mortgagee, which often is a national entity, to perform such a legal analysis of the mortgagor or owner entity, the documents and the transaction. It is clear that without the assurance provide by the opinion, HUD and the mortgagee would be performing duplicative legal work and would extend considerably greater time and resources than the mortgagor's or owner's counsel, who would be conducting the analysis as a matter of course in representing the client/mortgagor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. None_The form passes from counsel to the mortgagor or owner to HUD and the mortgagee. We are not aware of any new technology which could be employed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Since this is the only legal opinion required by HUD in connection with the transaction, we can find no evidence of duplication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Only counsel for the mortgagor or owner is in a position to render the necessary opinion. HUD counsel do not have access to the mortgagor or owner entity in a fashion that would provide HUD counsel with all of the data and knowledge available to the mortgagor's or owner's counsel. Further, HUD counsel are not in a time management or bar membership position to legally opine as to organizations, real and personal property, local law, etc. which comprise a mortgage loan transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. HUD generally requires that the mortgagor or owner entity be a sole asset entity and sometimes the HUD-approved mortgagee might also be a small business; however, no burden falls upon these entities. The entire burden is upon the counsel to the mortgagor or owner to represent its client in the mortgage loan transaction. A small portion of such representation involves rendering a legal opinion which can be relied upon by HUD and the mortgagee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Not applicable_The legal opinion, if collected at all, has to be collected prior to endorsement of the mortgage note by HUD. In the case of capital advances, the legal opinion has to be collected prior to initial closing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Not applicable_It is questionable whether obtaining a legal opinion is really a collection of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

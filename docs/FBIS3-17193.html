Pishchayev, including </F> recorded comment by Yuriy Shafranik, Russian minister for fuel  and power engineering; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Shafranik] We think that in the actual fuel and  energy crisis...[pauses] in the fuel complex, there is no crisis  and never was.    [Pishchayev] That is how Yuriy Shafranik described the  situation in the fuel and energy complex at a news conference at  Government House. Incidentally, he pointed out that there was,  nevertheless, a slump in production, but it was caused by a  fall-off in demand. There was a general downturn in production  in the country's industry in 1993 of up to 16 percent, but in  the fuel and energy complex it was no higher than seven,  although in other sectors of the national economy the slump was  considerably higher.    In the minister's view, the main reason for the difficulty  lay in the crisis of the financial system and in the insolvency  of consumers. They owed the fuel and energy complex a total of  some 16 trillion rubles. As in other sectors of the national  economy, the way out of the situation is seen as being through  the consumer's initiating direct ties with the producer and, in  the actual fuel and energy complex, through assigning priority  to payments for fuel and energy resources and strict sanctions  against nonpayers. If the question of nonpayment were settled,  Yuriy Shafranik remarked, the lowering of fuel prices would be  guaranteed.    Trying to persuade journalists that everything was well in  the fuel and energy complex, the minister announced that checks  had been made into the financial activities of organizations,  including Rosugol [Russia Coal], that make up the fuel and  energy complex. No serious irregularities were found there.</p>

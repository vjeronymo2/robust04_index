			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL BENEFIT REPEAL TO BOOST COSTS FOR SOME;  </P> <P> HEALTH: REJECTION OF CATASTROPHIC CARE PLAN COULD ADD TO PRIVATE INSURANCE  PREMIUMS, STATES' FINANCIAL BURDEN.  </P> <P> The repeal of the catastrophic care law will force millions of people to pay  more for their supplemental medical insurance and impose a major new financial  burden on state governments.  </P> <P> Repeal will also bring bigger hospital bills to some of the sickest elderly,  but provide substantial tax savings for senior citizens in higher income  brackets.  </P> <P> By abolishing the catastrophic provisions of Medicare, Congress decided to end  the virtually unlimited days of hospital care now available to Medicare  beneficiaries under which patients pay $560 for the first day and receive the  next 364 days free.  </P> <P> This benefit will continue for the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries until the  end of the year. But on Jan. 1, Medicare returns to the old system. Under that  plan, patients pay $592 for the first day in the hospital, nothing the next 59  days, then $138 a day.  </P> <P> Fewer than about 500,000 Medicare patients a year are hospitalized more than 60  days.  </P> <P> Congress' action Wednesday ends the controversial surtax that would have meant  higher payments in April for the 40% of Medicare beneficiaries who pay federal  income taxes. The surtax would have ranged from $22 to $800 a year for a single  taxpayer, a maximum of $1,600 for a couple filing jointly. Those who have paid  any part of the surtax will get a refund.  </P> <P> The surtax sparked a nationwide wave of protest that culminated with the votes  for repeal in Congress. Anger over the surtax overshadowed any enthusiasm among  senior citizens for the largest expansion of health benefits since Medicare was  created in 1965.  </P> <P> The surtax was designed to provide two-thirds of the money needed to pay for  the new benefits, which included a ceiling on out-of-pocket spending for doctor  bills and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. One-third of the money  needed for the program was to come from a $4 monthly premium paid by all  beneficiaries under the Medicare insurance program for doctor bills.  </P> <P> The $4 catastrophic premium will be collected from Social Security checks for  the last time in December. Next year, the total premium for Medicare coverage  of doctor bills will be $29 a month.  </P> <P> Insurance companies will be raising their premiums in January for so-called  Medi-gap insurance, which covers the bills Medicare does not pay. These  companies had adjusted their premiums because, under the catastrophic law,  Medicare would be paying some expenses previously covered by private insurance.  With the catastrophic law eliminated, more of the burden of coverage shifts  back to private insurance.  </P> <P> Private insurance premiums in 1990 will rise by an estimated 15.4% because of  the repeal of the catastrophic law, according to a recent study by the General  Accounting Office. The average private insurance premium will go from $58.71 a  month this year for Medi-gap coverage to $69.35 a month.  </P> <P> The expenses of state governments will increase at least $500 million next year  as more of the burden of providing health care for the poor shifts to the  states.  </P> <P> A separate federal program was started in October to provide economic security  for the spouses of people in nursing homes. Instead of spending all but a tiny  part of family income and assets for nursing home costs, the family member at  home will be permitted to keep at least $768 a month from any earnings,  pensions or other family income. Moreover, the spouse at home must be allowed  to keep the first $12,000 of the family's assets and half of what remains, up  to a maximum of $60,000.  </P> <P> While the new federal law is a boon to elderly residents of most states, it  represents a disadvantage to California couples whose assets are greater than  $120,000. Currently, California law allows the spouse at home to keep half of  all the assets held by the couple. California has an exemption from the new law  until January.  </P> <P> The states and the federal government share the costs of Medicaid (called  Medi-Cal in California), a federal welfare program for the poor, which pays for  nursing homes when families have exhausted their assets.  </P> <P> But, because families are permitted under the new law to preserve more of their  assets, state governments will be forced to contribute more to nursing home  costs. State governments this year have shifted payments for large numbers of  nursing home patients to the federal government under the catastrophic care  law. Those payments now will shift back to state governments.  </P></p>

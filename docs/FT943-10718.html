			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pargesa emerges from the gloom under a new guise - The Swiss group's investment strategy is now concentrated on francophone Europe Pargesa, the large Swiss investment group controlled by Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian financier, and Canada's Mr Paul Desmarais, has emerged from nearly four years of purdah following the noisy departure of Mr Gerard Eskenazi, former chairman, in 1990. Today's Pargesa bears little resemblance to the high-flying financial and industrial combine of the 1980s with stakes in Drexel Burnham Lambert, the failed US junk bond specialist, and Henry Ansbacher, the ill-starred UK merchant bank, and a plethora of other companies in sectors from tobacco to railway sleeping carriages. The new Pargesa, according to Mr Aimery Langlois-Meurinne, chief executive, is concentrating on 10 industrial and financial holdings in francophone Europe. The most important are CLT Multimedia, owner of the RTL television and radio networks, and Petrofina, the Belgian oil group. It aims to hold and exert strategic control over its investments rather than have an uncertain influence with smallish minority stakes. The idea is to convince investors that Pargesa is a value-adding corporate governor for the long term, worthy of a better fate than having its shares trade at a 25 per cent discount off net asset value. All this is a long way from the secretive group that was set up in Geneva in 1981 by Mr Eskenazi, then deputy managing director of Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, and Mr Frere to prevent the Swiss and Belgian subsidiaries of Paribas from being nationalised by the French government. Within a few months of its launch, Pargesa pulled off its most important coup, buying a blocking minority position in the venerable Groupe Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium for BFr2.6bn (Dollars 77.4m). GBL's main holdings - Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Petrofina, the Tractebel electric utility, CLT and Royale Belge, the insurer - remain among Pargesa's core assets. Through the 1980s, Pargesa expanded rapidly, with Mr Frere following industrial opportunities, mainly in Belgium, and Mr Eskenazi buying up banks in Luxembourg, the UK and the US. By 1989, the group had consolidated equity of SFr1.9bn (Dollars 1.4bn). Tensions developed as Mr Eskenazi, who dreamed of creating an international federation of banks, tried to associate Pargesa more closely with the re-privatised Paribas. Mr Frere and Mr Desmarais, who had been brought in as a core investor in Pargesa in 1982 by Mr Eskenazi, saw their influence would wither under such a scheme. So they joined forces, raised their combined stake to more than 50 per cent and pushed Mr Eskenazi out. Since then, all Pargesa's bank holdings have been sold, with the notable exceptions of Paribas and Banque Bruxelles Lambert (although BBL was the subject of a failed bid by ING of Holland last year). Investments in the French Schneider electrical engineering group, in Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits and Rinsoz &amp; Ormond Tabacs have gone. On the other hand, Pargesa's stakes in GBL and its French and Swiss sub-holding companies have been raised to effective controlling levels, and last year the group purchased a 6 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the French packaging group. Mr Langlois-Meurinne concedes the group's portfolio has no sectoral logic, but neither is Pargesa a traditional conglomerate in that it will not shift resources from one subsidiary to another. He would not like the number of core holdings to be much larger than 10. Geographically, Pargesa has pulled in its wings from the US and the UK. 'We are trying to understand Germany and German-speaking Switzerland, but we start from a low base,' he said. Mr Heinrich-Horst Wiemer, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich, says many of Pargesa's holdings are structured in the French style, reflecting complex alliances that are difficult for outsiders to appreciate fully. For example, the controlling 52.4 per cent stake in Royale Belge is held jointly by GBL and UAP, the French insurance group. To help keep relations with UAP sweet, Pargesa joined the group of core investors when the insurer was privatised last year, buying a 2.2 per cent stake for over FFr1bn. In another series of links, Paribas still holds 15 per cent of Pargesa and Pargesa holds 5 per cent of Paribas. Meanwhile, Paribas and UAP both have stakes in CLT. It is still too early to judge the performance of the new Pargesa. Net earnings have been on a downward trend, to SFr159.4m last year from a 1990 peak of SFr197.9m. But this is due to the decline in capital gains from disposals. Aggregate earnings of core holdings have been rising briskly, as has the net asset value - now just above SFr2,000 per share compared with SFr1,483 at the end of 1990. Investors have long appreciated Pargesa's high dividend payout ratio, and Mr Langlois-Meurinne says this will continue. There has been nervousness about the possibility that Mr Frere and Mr Desmarais, both aggressive entrepreneurs, might steer Pargesa too closely towards their other interests. Mr Langlois-Meurinne notes that a few institutional shareholders have acquired significant minority stakes, and Mr Desmarais and Mr Frere know they are being watched carefully. The Public Institution for Social Security of Kuwait has 5 per cent and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, the Caisse des Depot et Placements du Quebec, and a large UK pension fund each have 3 per cent. Individual investors should look at the rollercoaster ride of Pargesa in the past decade. The shares peaked in 1987 at SFr2,426 then more than halved in the autumn crash of that year. After climbing back to SFr1,900 in early 1990, they plunged again in the wake of the Drexel collapse and Mr Eskenazi's departure to a low of SFr889 in early 1991. They began to recover late in 1992 and have been on a rising trend ever since.</p>

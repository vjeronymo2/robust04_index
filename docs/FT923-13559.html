			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Major firmly rules out devaluation THE government's determination to maintain its economic strategy was underlined by Mr John Major at the weekend as he gave unequivocal backing to the chancellor's refusal to consider a devaluation of sterling. In an acerbic side-swipe against Lady Thatcher, the prime minister also dismissed as 'fantasy fears' the warnings from Tory Euro-sceptics that the Maastricht Treaty on European union would create a centralist European state. Some Tory MPs, however, continued to voice fears that sterling's place in the European exchange rate mechanism was jeopardising hopes of economic recovery. Mr Major's insistence that he would not be panicked into moves to 'kick-start' the economy came as senior Conservatives acted to quell the latest outbreak of dissent among a small group of the party's MPs. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs, rejected complaints that the composition of the new Commons select committees to be established this week had been 'fixed' by party managers to exclude those ready to challenge the government. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the former chairman of the select committee on health, will tonight seek backing from fellow Tory MPs to overturn his exclusion from the new committee. His complaint, supported by some colleagues and a number of Labour MPs, is expected to prompt angry exchanges in the Commons, but most MPs are likely to back the view that Mr Winterton and several other long-serving committee members should stand down. Mr Major's decision to put the full weight of his authority behind Mr Norman Lamont's economic strategy was designed to quash any suggestion that the Treasury's hard line against devaluation was being questioned in 10 Downing Street. Several Tory MPs repeated calls for the government to consider a sterling realignment in the ERM unless the pace of economic recovery picked up. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, was among those predicting that if the economy was not showing signs of recovery by the beginning of next year, there would be intense pressure for devaluation. Mr Townend said on BBC television that a majority of Tory MPs would now favour a general ERM realignment, involving a realignment of the D-Mark against all currencies. Mr Major acknowledged that the economy would not emerge rapidly from recession, but insisted in a newspaper interview that devaluation would be counter-productive. As senior Whitehall officials dismissed talk of a more general ERM realignment as 'unrealistic', the prime minister said he was determined to put Britain in a position where the businessman, investor and saver knew the government would not devalue.

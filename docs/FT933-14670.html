			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: AG Barr hit by sugar price AG BARR, the soft drinks company which bills its best known product as being made in Scotland from girders, was hit by high sugar prices in the half year to May 1 and pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.1m. Mr Robin Barr, chairman of the company which makes Irn-Bru and Tizer, said that by February 1993 the fall in the value of the Green Pound, following the UK's departure from the ERM in September, resulted in an 18 per cent increase in the price of sugar. He said the decline in profits was exacerbated because comparative figures included a Pounds 409,000 surplus on the sale of the investment in Taverners, a confectionery company. Group turnover fell to Pounds 42m (Pounds 42.4m), an increase in sales of Barr's brands being offset by a decrease of retailers' own label products. Mr Barr said turnover in the nine weeks since May 1 had been well below last year, when the weather was exceptionally favourable. The 'better spell of weather' recently was encouraging, he added. Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 3.27m) and interest charges dropped to Pounds 389,000 (Pounds 624,000). Mr Barr said: 'We borrowed less money. We did borrow money from the bank some five years ago to fund an acquisition. We are always cash generative each year and we have gradually paid the bank loan.' The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p payable from reduced earnings of 7.67p (10.74p) per share.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Allied Dunbar covenants to face High Court test FOUR FORMER sales asso-ciates of Allied Dunbar, the financial services company, will today mount a High Court challenge to the company's attempts to prevent them from soliciting business from its clients. The hearing is seen as a test case for the use of restrictive covenants by which companies prevent former employees or associates taking business with them when they leave. Covenants are common in the insurance sector and in other service industries. Although former employees or associates frequently challenge them, cases are normally settled out of court. The Allied Dunbar case arises from the departure from the company in 1990 of Sir Mark Weinberg, Mr Mike Wilson and Mr Keith Carby, chairman, chief executive and managing director respectively, and their subsequent creation of J. Rothschild Assurance (JRA), a rival life company. Allied says JRA has recruited 200 of its 5,000 self-employed sales associates, all of whom had signed contracts with restrictive covenants of a year. Four of the 200 will today seek a declaration that the covenants are unlawful. Allied fears that JRA will recruit more of its associates if the four win their case. Counsel for the four - Ms Pat Miller, Mr Ken Clark, Mr Paul Rothwell and Mr Nigel Cousins - will argue that the covenants are in restraint of trade. However Ms Denise Kingsmill, a partner with DJ Freeman acting for Allied Dunbar, said Allied would say it was protecting a reasonable commercial interest and that the covenant was reasonable. 'There has been a significant investment in training,' she said. 'Twelve months is reasonable in the insurance business.' JRA began recruiting former Allied sales associates at the end of last year. If the High Court hearing lasts several months, the effect on the complainants will be limited since the year-long restrictive covenants will expire shortly afterwards.</p>

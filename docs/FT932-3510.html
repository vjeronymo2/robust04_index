			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / People: Hurd adviser crosses fence The discreet world of the political lobbyists has recruited a fresh disciple. Edward Bickham, one of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's most trusted advisers, has decided to cross the parliamentary divide and join Hill and Knowlton, one of the top three public affairs consultancies. Bickham, 36, replaces Tom McNally, the former Labour MP and adviser to Jim Callaghan, who left in April to head the lobbying arm of Shandwick. Bickham joins early next month as managing director, public affairs and corporate policy. Although Bickham's title suggests his brief will be somewhat wider than an old political hand like McNally, his arrival at Hill and Knowlton completes a series of high-profile changes at the top of an industry where success often depends on getting a client's ideas heard in the right places. At the end of 1992, Des Wilson, former campaign manager of the Liberal Democrats, joined Burston-Marsteller, the other big player. It has long been rumoured that Hurd plans to quit politics before the next election. But Bickham, who has not ruled out standing for Parliament at some stage, stresses that his decision to leave Hurd's side does not mean his old boss will also head for the private sector shortly. Having been special adviser to the Home Secretary and in Northern Ireland, Bickham had never intended a second stint in Whitehall when he left to join British Satellite Broadcasting in 1988. But he was called back into service by Hurd at the time of the Gulf War and has acquired a reputation as one of the most effective of the current crop of parliamentary advisers. Bickham differs from Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former press secretary who is also on the Hill and Knowlton payroll, in that he is not an old-style political fixer. Instead he believes in knowing his way around the ever-changing regulatory undergrowth. Companies need to 'anticipate trends in regulation when developing business plans rather than reacting late in the day in an atmosphere of crisis.'</p>

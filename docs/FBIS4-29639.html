			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Australian Deputy Prime  Minister Brian Howe called on Japan on Monday [20 June] to  participate in an international conference this year to discuss  problems of cities in the Asia-Pacific region, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    Howe, also minister for housing and regional development,  made the call in a 20-minute meeting with Japanese Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa.    Giving high marks to Japan's contributions in the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),  Howe said he hopes Japan would participate in the "International  Conference on Cities and New Global Economies," to be co-hosted  by Australia and the OECD in Melbourne in November.    He also expressed hope that Australia and Japan could  cooperate at another international conference on social  development scheduled for next March in Denmark, they said.    Kakizawa told Howe he is interested in problems concerning  housing and city development and said Japan would like to take  part in the conference, according to the officials.    Kakizawa said he hopes Japan and Australia could continue to  cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region and coordinate aid policies  for the South Pacific islands.    He also voiced hope that summit meetings of the leaders of  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will continue  to be held in the future, they said.    An informal summit of APEC leaders was held in Seattle last  November and another summit is to be held this year in Indonesia.    Howe arrived in Japan last Friday to hold talks with  Japanese  Government officials on regional development and ask for Japan's  participation in the conference.    He is to meet Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata later Monday.</p>

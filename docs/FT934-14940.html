			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Oil drilling to start in Poole Bay AN OIL drilling rig is expected to be towed into Poole Bay, Dorset, this week to start six to eight weeks of exploration in the environmentally sensitive area. The rig, which will be about 8km off the coast, will drill into a rock structure about 2,000 metres beneath the sea bed. Elf Enterprise, a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled French group, and Enterprise Oil, the UK independent exploration and production company, stressed that 'safety of people and the environment will be our first priority'. Previous explorations in Poole Bay triggered protests by environmentalists and the local fishing industry, which last year organised demonstrations against a large-scale seismic survey of the area. Elf Enterprise said it had made elaborate arrangements to protect marine life. A pollution control vessel will be stationed near the rig throughout the drilling programme and Southampton University will study the state of marine life before and after the drilling. New techniques, such as horizontal drilling under the bay from an onshore site, have been used to meet environmental objections. The site being drilled by Elf Enterprise, however, is just beyond the reach of such techniques, the company said. But it might be used for production if recoverable quantities of oil were found. Support for a Pounds 300m link between the UK gas distribution system and that of the Continent is strong enough to justify additional studies, according to a survey released yesterday. An industry study group of British-based and Norwegian producers said it hoped to have worked out details by the middle of next year. The proposed interconnector would run from Bacton in Suffolk to Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>

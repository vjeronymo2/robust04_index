			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ICD rejects request for seats on board INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company, has rejected requests from PSB Group for two seats on the ICD board. PSB, the direct marketing company, owns 1.93 per cent of the ordinary shares of ICD, yet has voting rights over 22.61 per cent. ICD has also denied that another deal it has been pursuing has fallen through. The ICD board representation was requested by Mr Jonathan Self, PSB deputy chairman, who and asked for one seat for himself and one for Mr John Porter, who is thought to own 5 per cent of ICD's equity. Mr Porter is son of Dame Shirley Porter, erstwhile leader of Westminster's Conservative group. Mr Self said: 'In discussions, Mr (David) Cicurel (ICD chairman) confirmed that the major advertising agency who he had hoped would undertake a reverse takeover of ICD had now withdrawn from discussions.' For his part, Mr Cicurel, the company doctor who has restored ICD to profitability, strongly denied that he confirmed to Mr Self the nature of the transaction, and that he had told Mr Self that the deal was off. Indeed, Mr Cicurel stressed that talks with the possible merger partner were continuing. Mr Self said that PSB intended 'to place ourselves in a position where we can request an EGM' to gain representation on the ICD board.</p>

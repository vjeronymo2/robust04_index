			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Technology: Check-in for the Channel rail link - A new passenger ticketing system When the Channel tunnel train services between London, Paris and Brussels start this summer, they are expected to compete primarily with the airlines. So it is appropriate that airline-style technology has been adopted at London's Waterloo international station and the other terminals. The control system at Waterloo is claimed to be the first fully automated check-in system in use at a main line railway station. The automatic gates will not only validate travellers' tickets but will also provide train crews with a list of passengers, their seat reservations and meal requirements for the journey. Careful control of passenger flows at Waterloo will be necessary to prevent congestion. For all the praise it has won for its striking design, the new terminal has had to be sandwiched into a very restricted site alongside the existing station. European Passenger Services, which will operate the trains, is counting on most passengers spending just 30 minutes in its Waterloo departures lounge. With seating for 700 people and standing room for a further 1,100, the terminal has just enough space for two full train-loads of passengers. Passengers booking through EPS's telesales office or one of the main terminals will receive a machine-readable ticket conforming to the boarding pass standard (ATB2) being introduced for airline tickets. This technology is also being adopted by the ferry companies and is in use at Dover and Calais by P&amp;O European Ferries. On arrival at the terminal, passengers feed their ticket into the check-in mechanism, similar to that used on the London Underground, which automatically opens the entry gate and stores the encoded data. Passengers without machine-readable tickets will pass through separate channels to manned desks. In the early stages, half of all passengers will have the advanced tickets, rising to 80 per cent in five years. The installation at Waterloo forms part of a Pounds 4m contract carried out by ICL, the computer group, for EPS, SNCF of France and SNCB of Belgium. Similar computerised local networks will be installed at Brussels Midi, Paris Gare du Nord, Lille and Frethun near Calais, all linked to the central booking system in Lille. One feature of the system is that it allows the fares to be shared out fairly between the three railways. One problem faced by ICL was that each railway used a different networking system, so the application software written by British Rail Computing in Microfocus Cobol and Dialog has been ported to other systems. The automatic check-in gates were provided by Dassault Automatismes et Telecommunications, part of the French electronics and defence group. Each gate contains a small visual display unit, a ticket reader, a personal computer and a programmable controller for the sensors which record the presence of a traveller or luggage trolley. The system has been designed to withstand the relatively hostile environment of a station entrance, says Dassault. Automatic passenger control will allow EPS to offer travellers a 20-minute check-in time and, it hopes, give it a competitive advantage over the airlines.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Leng Mou (0397 4188): "Jiang Zemin Performs an </F> Operation on the Armed Forces in Order To Provide a Guarantee  for National Security"]    [Text] According to the instruction of Jiang Zemin,  chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Central  Military Commission and the General Political Department of the  People's Liberation Army [PLA] made arrangements for all  military units to train officers in rotation by running courses  to study the third volume of "The Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" during this year. Reportedly, the CPC top leadership  holds that it is necessary to improve the style of the armed  forces through such study activities. Jiang Zemin stressed the  need to link the theoretical study with reality and to send the  officers to grass-roots units for investigations and studies so  that they can work out solutions for existing problems.    General Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, recently pointed out when inspecting the troops from  the three services in Shandong, that the primary tasks for the  armed forces at present are to defend the party's basic line, to  defend the socialist system, and to "obey the orders of the  party central leading body, with Jiang Zemin at the core, at all  times." Zhang Zhen's remarks showed that a major aim of the  current efforts to improve the style of the troops was to guide  them in consciously following and serving the party's "overall  work arrangements" [gong zuo da ju 1562 0155 1129 1444] and  prompt them into faithfully defending the central leadership  with Jiang Zemin at the core. This year is crucial for the  mainland's reform and opening and because many major reform  measures will be adopted, the country's socioeconomic and  political stability will face tests in many aspects. This year,  reform will enter the stage of dealing with some of the most  difficult issues and will thus be rather risky. In such  circumstances, the armed forces will have to provide effective  security guarantees for the advances of reform.    Zhang Zhen said that in order to follow and serve the  party's  overall work arrangements, the armed forces should act according  to the general requirements put forward by Jiang Zemin, that is,  "measuring up to standard politically, perfectly mastering  military skills, keeping the fine style of work, being  well-disciplined, and ensuring effective logistics support."  Zhang Zhen told the troops of the three services in Shandong to  put all of the five requirements set by Jiang Zemin into  practice in a down-to-earth manner, with political integrity  being of primary importance.    In the third volume of Deng Xiaoping's works, one can find  that Deng mentioned "Jiang Zemin as the core" of the central  leadership on many occasions. This is of special importance for  the authority of the third-generation leading body headed by  Jiang Zemin.    Jiang Zemin required that leading cadres at all levels  reduce  dining and other social activities to a minimum so that they  will have more time to study the third volume of Deng's works.  Jiang also required that while they themselves study in  earnest, they should also organize their immediate subordinates  to study properly; and that party cadres and officers at and  above the county and regimental level should all attend the  study classes in rotation within two to three years. He said  that the means of propaganda, such as newspapers, radio and  television broadcasts, and publications, should be used fully;  experience should be summed up in good time and spread widely;  and teaching materials about the theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics should be compiled for political  education.    Jiang Zemin said that the theoretical study in the armed  forces should also be closely linked with the reality of the  troops and should serve the purpose of promoting the enhancement  of the overall quality of leading bodies and the comprehensive  development of the troops.    On 26 April, Liu Huaqing held a discussion meeting with the  commanders and political commissars of six military regions, who  were attending the Third Theoretical Study Class for Principal  Provincial and Ministry Leaders in the Central Party School, on  the issue of studying the third volume of Deng's works and using  Deng's theory to guide the work of the armed forces in all  aspects. Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, members of  the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting. Liu  Huaqing told the six military region leaders Li Xinliang, Liu  Jingsong, Song Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong that  the troops should be commanded rigorously and officers at all  levels should go deep into the realities of life and effectively  enhance the military training for the troops. At present, it is  particularly necessary to intensify the routine management of  the troops and senior officers should set a good example for the  troops they command.    The establishment and development of the market economy will  inevitably cause a range of new conditions and new problems for  the management of the troops in China. The work of troop  management and education will face a new challenge. In order to  solve such issues, it is not enough to merely rely on  ideological education and administrative and economic means.  Only by relying on the legal system and intensifying troop  management through enforcing the military rules and regulations  can we effectively maintain good order inside the military units.    In the last few years, Jiang Zemin has repeatedly stressed  that leaders at all levels must attach importance to employing  the rules and regulations for improving troop management. He  instructed the PLA to "give priority to troop management" this  year by rigorously commanding the troops according to the  established military rules and regulations and rigorously  enforcing military discipline in practice.    Since the beginning of this year, the Central Military  Commission has taken the work of strengthening and improving  troop management as an important point in its work plan. Pilot  schemes for improving troop management in various aspects and at  various levels in the new period have been carried out. The  primary aim is to enhance the quality of officers who are in  charge of the troops and emphasis was laid on rectifying the  style and enforcing discipline. Not long ago, the directors of  the troop affairs and equipment departments of all military  regions were summoned to Beijing. They analyzed the situation  regarding the implementation of the instructions on "giving  priority to troop management" and found that the key to  improving troop management in the next stage lay in the rigorous  enforcement of the rules and regulations.    Zhang Zhen recently said that in the course of improving  troop management, it was necessary to implement the Program for  Consolidating Grass-Roots Military Units effectively. He said:  This is not only a task for the combat companies, the roles of  grass-roots officers, backbone soldiers, and military personnel  committees should all be brought into play. Zhang Zhen said:  "In a combat company, people are squad, platoon, or company  leaders, or Communist Party members, or Communist Youth League  members, or at least revolutionary soldiers. So, everyone  should play a role in troop management and should be subject to  management. Thus, troop management as a whole can be ensured."    In the study classes for military officers on Deng's works,  people summed up five major demonstrations of unhealthy  "formalism" conduct among the troops at present:    First, meetings were taken as a criterion for measuring the  degree of importance being attached by leaders and for assessing  work performances. Meetings were even taken as concrete action  in implementing the instructions from the upper leading organs.  As a result, innumerable meetings were held and leaders had to  attend many meetings and deal with immense amounts of paperwork.    Second, the speeches by leaders of the Central Military  Commission, the military regions, the army corps, the armies,  the divisions, and the brigades were relayed from top to bottom  to the letter without regard to the contents of the instructions  and the specific conditions of those listening to the  instructions. Professional systems also had to relay  instructions to the corresponding organs at the lower level.  Sometimes, the spirit of one meeting or one document was  relayed repeatedly on different occasions.    Third, there were excessive comparisons and examinations  adding burdens to the grass-roots units and adding too much  pressure on the rank and file.    Fourth, a number of officers and leaders at various levels  were sent to grass-roots units as a measure to carry forward the  style of going deep into the realities of life and they  intervened excessively in the work at grass-roots level and set  back the initiative of the grass-roots units.    Fifth, some leaders liked to take expedient measures which  might achieve quick and superficial results so that they would  win a good name and would also save effort.    Lieutenant General Li Xinliang, political commissar of the  Shenyang Military Region, recently called for rectifying the  work style among the troops and creating a new situation in the  work of the military units. He said that "a major breakthrough  can be made in the aspect of improving the work style of the  troops."    Recently, the Shenyang Military Region took the lead in the  whole Army to improve the style of troops. The concrete  requirements were laid down in the form of an official document.  The specific rules include: Meetings and activities to be held  by the military region and attended by army-level leaders and  department heads should first be approved by the commander or  the political commissar; and meetings to be held in subordinate  military units should be approved by the party committee of the  military region or by the military region leader's conference.  When leaders of the military region inspect subordinate units,  the unit leaders should not leave the barracks to meet the  military region leaders or see them off. No security vehicles  should be used if there are no major activities and no  videotapes or photos should be taken. No welcoming ceremonies  and welcoming banners or streamers should be arranged to  greeting military leaders.    Li Xinliang also set three requirements for more than 100  senior officers at and above the division level who attended the  Deng's works study class: Make more visits to those units which  have a weak foundation and cannot acquire advanced experience  easily; do more things which may not bring fame but can bring  solid benefits to the troops; and do more things that may not  bring fame and benefit to the leaders but will enhance the  combat effectiveness of the troops.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A senior official of the Russian Space Agency (RSA)  in an interview with INTERFAX has described as groundless a  recent statement by Commander of Military Space Forces (MSF)  General Vladimir Ivanov about Moscow's plans to build a new  cosmodrome (space center) in the Far East by the year 2000.    He said that building such a facility was not MSF's job but  that of a special branch of the industry which is in Ukraine and  elsewhere after the break-up of the Soviet Union.    On the prospect of a Far Eastern project, the RSA official  said that although his agency had no objections, billions of  rubles would have to be raised to implement it by the year 2000,  something that Moscow could not afford at the moment.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker forms joint venture with Labatt LABATT, the Canadian brewer, and Pubmaster, Brent Walker's public house operation, yesterday announced the creation of a joint venture company to acquire and run a national estate of 1,000 pubs, writes Philip Rawstorne. Houses run by the new company, Maple Leaf Inns, will stock Labatt's beer brands which will also be distributed through Pubmaster's existing estate of 1,974 pubs. The agreement - which follows similar deals by Labatt with Eldridge Pope, the Dorset brewer, and Paramount Inns in northern England - is expected to increase the Canadian brewer's sales in the UK by about 25 per cent to 500,000 barrels a year. 'Labatt has shown very rapid growth since its UK launch four years ago,' said Mr Bruce Peer, president of the group's European operations. 'Our job now is to consolidate our position as one of the UK market's leading brands before expanding elsewhere in continental Europe, where we already own the Moretti brewery in Italy,' he added. Pubmaster, which has increased its estate by 80 per cent this year through leasing deals with Allied-Lyons and Whitbread to become the UK's largest independent pub operator, will manage the joint venture houses under its Threshold Inns and Tap &amp; Spile banners. 'Our intention is to continue growing the Pubmaster estate beyond 3,000 pubs, creating further business opportunities for Labatt,' said Mr John Brackenbury, Pubmaster's chairman.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Lloyd's must be resolved without bitterness, abuse and rancour Sir, In the wake of your article, 'Multiple damages on Lloyd's' (February 19), I wish to correct an impression that I have been promoting 'allegations. . . which must be treated with considerable caution'. I have striven not to say things that were either gratuitously damaging or spread rumours which seemed to be travelling quite fast enough without my help. And, in any event, there are enough problems for my membership to cope with without me having to invent more. Inter alia, I have not alleged that malpractice is rife. Nor have I said that I thought Lloyd's faced a solvency crisis. On numerous occasions last week I was asked my views on these matters and I have either refused to comment or I have denied the rumour that the questioner hoped to confirm. Then I was repeatedly asked whether I was calling for Mr Coleridge's resignation. I said that I thought he was doing well in dreadful circumstances and what good would his resignation do anyway? Then I was asked if I thought that self regulation should give way to outside regulation? I said that I thought the present governance should change but outside regulation might make matters even worse. None of my replies was printed or broadcast. Perhaps those who are sought by the media to comment would reflect that competent soldiers always seek to ensure that the bits they shell do not land back on to their own heads. And that explosions, flashes and smoke presently generated might present a pretty spectacle for a time but the reality is they obscure the real battleground. We need quietly to settle down and work out what we are going to do about the fact that 100 per cent of the losses have descended on to 25 per cent of the membership. In such quantity, they face possible ruin now and certain ruin in the next three years. The fact these losses have fallen on those Names appears to be arbitrary. Often, sufferers were not told of the risks attendant on the spiral syndicates, nor could they tell a good agent from the not so good. They trusted too much. This is seen by everyone (except the 75 per cent of the membership who share cheques for around Pounds 500m) as manifestly unfair and the engine for the current hysteria. But mutualisation has already started in the Warrilow and Outhwaite settlements. It must continue without bitterness, abuse and rancour and without the process being towed endlessly through the courts and the media.

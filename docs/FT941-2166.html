			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Citic Pacific in line with forecasts at HKDollars 1.89bn Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company, yesterday reported an 81 per cent advance in net earnings to HKDollars 1.89bn (USDollars 244m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 1.04bn in 1992. The results were in line with market expectations. Profits were swollen by a string of acquisitions during the year and partially funded by a HKDollars 7.1bn placement which went towards the 12 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom and the controlling interest in two mainland power stations bought from parent Citic Hong Kong last January. Taken on a per share basis, earnings grew 24 per cent to 108.2 cents, from 87.4 cents. Dah Chong Hong, the motor trading group which became a wholly-owned subsidiary in April 1992, was an important factor in last year's growth, contributing around 35 per cent of total profits - ahead of the 30 cent from Hongkong Telecom. However, increased competition in the motor sector eroded margins, while the macro-economic measures adopted in China hit sales there, said Mr Larry Yung, chairman. This year the contribution from Dah Chong Hong is likely to shrink to around 25 per cent, reflecting the increased contributions from other parts of the group. Of the two power plants, one started operation during 1993 and the 56 per cent-owned Ligang Power Plant has been running since January 1. , The group will also start to benefit in 1994 from the 50 per cent interest in the development of Discovery Bay, a residential complex on Lantau Island which was bought by Citic for HKDollars 3.4bn earlier this year. Road and tunnel projects will provide earnings further down the line, with the Western Harbour Tunnel, in which Citic has a 10 per cent interest, expected to be completed in mid-1997. Profits on the aviation side benefited from increased flights at Dragon Air, the airline jointly owned with Cathay Pacific. The group also owns 12 per cent of Cathay Pacific - which is expected to turn in flat profits this year - and, since last November, 10 per cent of Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. The directors are proposing a final dividend of 28 cents, making a total payout of 38 cents. This represents an increase of 26 per cent over 1992's total dividend of 30.2 cents.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Customs probe 'bent' banana trade BRITISH Customs officers investigating an alleged Pounds 1.6m 'banana laundering' fraud have 'detained' 53 tonnes of bananas shipped from the Netherlands to Felixstowe. They have also removed documents from an importing company in Hull. Officers said the 'bent' bananas are believed to have been bought at low Latin American prices, and that importers allegedly intended to relabel them to be sold in Britain at prices which include European Community subsidies. 'We believe this is very similar to frauds which exploit the EC's Common Agricultural Policy,' UK Customs and Excise said. There have been mounting fears of 'banana running' into the UK as the establishment of the single European market approaches on January 1. This is because of a 15 per cent price difference between cheap 'dollar' bananas from Latin America freely available in Germany, Belgium and Denmark, and more expensive bananas which have protected access to markets including France, the UK, Spain and Portugal. The expensive bananas come from former French and British colonies or overseas territories (mainly in the Caribbean), and from Madeira, the Canaries and Cyprus. Efforts to reform the EC banana import regime have been deadlocked for more than a year. Germany is unwilling to pay more for bananas, while countries such as France and the UK will not renege on Lome Convention commitments to protect livelihoods in former colonies. This paralysis has left the door open to 'banana running'. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, warned yesterday that there could be 'chaos' if EC member states did not know by January 1 how the regime was going to be reformed. 'Although I agree we are going to have to put some intermediate measures in place, it will be very much better if we can get the broad shape of an agreement at the December meeting (of EC farm ministers),' he said. Investigation of the alleged Humberside fraud began a year ago. Customs said there had been no arrests or charges and stressed the bananas had been 'detained' rather then 'seized'. The company being investigated had not been 'raided', although searches were carried out under warrant last Friday at the Hull headquarters of the importer concerned, and at the home of the company's managing director. The bananas are understood to have come from Nicaragua, and to have been hidden under 22 tonnes of bananas from the Caribbean island of Dominica, a former British colony. The bananas concerned are understood to be ripening in detention and may have to be destroyed. Protection planned for banana suppliers, Page 30</p>

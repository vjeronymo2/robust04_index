			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Internal control of India's central bank to be revamped INDIA'S finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, yesterday announced that the 'internal control mechanism' of India's central bank would be revamped and its board reconstituted 'very soon' to prevent misuse of funds by banks in securities transactions. Mr Singh, who was questioned for nearly four hours by a parliamentary committee investigating the Rs37bn (Pounds 784m) Bombay securities scandal that broke last year, admitted failure of the Reserve Bank's supervisory machinery, and said that the bank had failed to take 'prompt corrective action'. However, the minister fiercely defended the former Reserve Bank governor, Mr S Venkitaramanan, saying he had 'done his duty well' despite the 'tremendous pressure of the foreign exchange crisis' that India suffered in 1991. Mr Singh insisted that neither he nor his ministry had been aware that the funds that fuelled the artificial escalation of the Bombay stock market last year came from banks 'in an illegal or clandestine manner' as suggested by the investigating committee. The finance ministry found it hard to believe the state bank of India would engage in such illegal activities. Mr Singh rejected an allegation by investigating MPs that he had taken credit for the stock market boom instead of action to regulate it. The finance minister emerged from the gruelling afternoon of questioning looking relaxed and saying that he had 'enjoyed every minute of it'.</p>

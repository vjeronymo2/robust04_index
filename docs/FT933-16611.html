			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eurocamp hit by sharp downturn in bookings  -Shares fall 28p on warning of full year setback A 15 per cent fall in the market for self-drive camping and caravanning holidays from the UK to France has hit Eurocamp, which warned yesterday that annual pre-tax profits would fall by 30 to 35 per cent from the Pounds 9.4m recorded in 1992. In the half year ended April, Eurocamp, the market leader, saw pre-tax losses up slightly from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 5.12m. The shares dropped 28p to 203p on the news, although the interim dividend is held at 3.45p and the group said it would be cash neutral during the year. Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said that booking volumes were 5 per cent down for the 1993 summer season. Earlier in the year the group decided to maintain its capacity in hope of a late booking surge, but this had not happened with the consequence that occupancy rates fell by 6 per cent. Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said sales for June and July had been particularly poor. Holidaymakers had been put off by the fall in the pound against the French franc, and the poor weather in France in 1992. Mr Gordon Harman, finance director, said the fall in UK bookings had been partly offset by a 5 per cent rise in bookings from the Netherlands and Belgium and a 10 per cent increase from Germany and Switzerland. The fall in occupancy rates had a 'material effect on profits' Mr Harman said. However, he added that at 96 nights out of a 115 night season, the occupancy level was still high by industry standards. The break-even rate was 35 nights, he said. The forecast fall in profits would leave margins at about 11 per cent against 15.5 per cent last year. Mr Harman said that it was now unrealistic to expect to regain the group's historical level of margins, although some recovery was looked for in 1994. Mr Atkinson said the group was looking at cost control, though it did not want to compromise on its standards of tents and mobile homes which are higher than its competitors. It would have to address customers looking for value, though would not chase those only concerned with the lowest price. Operating losses were Pounds 4.87m (Pounds 4.57m) and net interest costs were down from Pounds 392,000 to Pounds 266,000. Losses per share were 13.2p (12.9p). COMMENT Eurocamp has found the competition tougher in a declining market and will have to demonstrate a strong response before investors can become enthusiastic about the shares. The lead times in the business mean that it will be next March before there are firm signs about 1994 bookings. Before then Eurocamp has to fix its brochure prices, with a structure tailored to address the problem of poor mid-season bookings. The forecast fall in profits suggests an outcome of about Pounds 6.35m, and a prospective p/e of 12.5. Unless everything is gloomy the final dividend should be maintained giving a yield of 6.4 per cent covered 1.6 to 1.7 times.</p>

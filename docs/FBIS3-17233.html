			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Crimeans Vote for General </F> Morozov and Admiral Kozhyn"]    [Text] Former Defense Minister Colonel General Kostyantyn  Morozov and former commander of Naval Forces Vice Admiral Borys  Kozhyn are well known in Sevastopol, as they were the ones who  started the building of the Ukrainian Fleet. At present, both  K. Morozov and B. Kozyn are candidates for deputies of Ukraine's  Supreme Council. A few days ago, the Coordination Council of  the Congress of Sevastopol Ukrainians appealed to residents of  Kiev and Rozhnyativ who had nominated these military figures,  and called upon them to give support to K. Morozov and B. Kozhyn  at the elections. In particular, the Sevastopol Ukrainians'  appeal reads that it is precisely Kostyantyn Morozov who "did  everything he could not to allow the conclusion of the  scandalous agreement on leasing out Sevastopol for 99 years or  selling the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia.  General Morozov has been and continues to be an authoritative  and well-respected person not only in the Army." That is why  the Coordination Council of the Congress of Sevastopol  Ukrainians called upon the voters of Kiev Constituency No. 1 to  vote for the former defense minister of Ukraine. Sevastopol  Ukrainians turned with an identical appeal to residents of the  town of Rozhnyativ in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast where former  commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces is registered as a candidate  for Ukraine's people's deputy. The elections will show whether  the electorate has heeded the appeal by the Coordination Council  of Sevastopol Ukrainians.</p>

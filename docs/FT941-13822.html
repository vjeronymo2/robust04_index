			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Tories find low-tax flagship not so watertight It never rains but it pours. The government must feel as exposed to the political downpour as the British people have been to the weather. Now the reputation of the Tories as the low-tax party is being swept away by the flood. A written parliamentary reply released on Friday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, showed that in 1994-95 a single man on average pay will lose 28.6 per cent of earnings in income tax and national insurance contributions, up from 27.6 per cent in 1992-93. If value added and other indirect taxes - but neither the community charge nor council tax - are included, then the total burden upon that same man will be as high as 41.4 per cent of income in 1994-95, up from 39.8 per cent in 1992-93. How will the burden in 1994-95 compare with that in 1978-79, the last year the Labour party was in power? Badly, is the answer. In that year the burden of income tax, national insurance, VAT and other indirect taxes upon a married man with two children on average earnings, for example, was 32.2 per cent of income. In 1992-93 it was virtually the same, at 32.7 per cent, but by 1994-95 it will have jumped to 35 per cent. For a married man on three-quarters of average income the increase will be from 27.4 per cent of income in 1978-79 to 31.2 per cent in 1994-95. But, in keeping with Tory philosophy, the rise will be smaller for someone on 1 1/2 times average earnings, from 36.1 per cent of income in 1978-79 to 37.7 per cent in 1994-95. Still more pain is to come. Chancellors Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke have raised taxes in 1994-95 by Pounds 8.4bn (1 1/4 per cent of gross domestic product) above their level in 1992-93 (from an indexed base). Only these increases are reflected in the above calculations. But between 1994-95 and 1996-97 a further Pounds 8bn in extra taxes is to be imposed. The proper start for discussion of the fiscal burden is not with taxation, but spending. In the short term governments may borrow, rather than tax. In the long term, revenue will have to be raised, either to service debt or in the form of the inflation tax. General government spending - excluding privatisation proceeds - is forecast to be 43 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The share was virtually identical, at 44 per cent, in 1978-79. It is hardly surprising that overall tax burdens in the two years are also similar, with non-North Sea taxes, social security contributions and community charge, as a share of non-North Sea GDP, at 34 3/4 per cent in 1978-79 but forecast at 35 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. Comparisons of just two years will not do. A peacetime spending peak was reached, under Labour, at 49 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1975-76: the figures for 1978-79 followed subsequent spending cuts. The post-1975-76 trough was reached under the Tories in 1988-89 at 39 1/4 per cent of GDP: the forecast for 1994-95 reflects subsequent sharp increases. This gives some credibility to the Conservative argument that it is the low-spending and therefore the low-tax party. But an increase in the ratio of public spending to GDP of almost six percentage points in five years also discredits that claim. In 1994-95 the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at 5 1/2 per cent of GDP, down from 7 3/4 per cent in 1993-94. In 1978-79 the PSBR was the same. So, almost identical spending burdens should result in similar tax burdens. Indeed, they do. But the overall tax burden is expected to be slightly higher in 1994-95 than in 1978-79. One reason is the changed structure of general government receipts. In 1978-79 9.4 per cent of government revenue was not taxes, but 'other receipts'. This category is forecast to be down to 6.4 per cent by 1994-95. The government has lost income from rent, interest and dividends, which has fallen from 8.6 per cent of general government receipts in 1978-79 to 3.8 per cent in 1994-95, in large part because of privatisation. This is a minor point. If spending and deficits are the same, taxation is almost entirely a matter of shifting taxes around. The share of income tax in receipts has been falling, but that of social security and indirect taxation - particularly value added tax - has been rising. Marginal rates of income tax have been falling, but the value of allowances has been sharply eroded. As a result of these changes, the burden of taxation on income has also been shifted from those on higher incomes. Even between 1992-93 and 1994-95 a married man with two children on 10 times average earnings will see the burden of his income tax and national insurance rise only from 37.3 to 37.7 per cent of income. During the period of Conservative government, the tax burden has been shifted from visible to less visible taxes and from more visible forms of income taxation to less visible forms of income taxation. The attention paid to the basic rate of tax has been the outstanding example of this technique. Lowering the marginal rate while sustaining the average rate of tax is good for incentives. But the overall tax burden can be lowered only if the burden of spending is also reduced. It may be cheeky for Labour to complain, since it has also protested incessantly about all the spending 'cuts'. But how can the Conservatives respond convincingly? They are, after all, not supposed to be the party of high public spending.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ge Xiquan (5514 6007 0538) and Duan Mingxuan </F> (3008 2494 6513): "The State Council Has Approved Our Province  To Experiment With the Method of Directly Linking Cotton  Production With Marketing"]    [Text] Provincial Governor Ye Liansong and Vice Governor Gu  Erxiong recently conducted an inspection tour to Hengshui  Prefecture. On 12 April, after listening to briefings given by  leaders of Hengshui Prefectural party committee and the  administrative office, they particularly touched on the issue of  cotton production. The provincial leaders stressed: The State  Council has approved our province to experiment with the method  of directly linking cotton production with marketing this year.  This is the State Council's important measure for supporting  Hebei to work hard to bring about an upsurge in cotton  production.    They said: Directly linking the cotton production with  marketing does not mean to decontrol the management. It is to  link up the production and marketing under the situation of  maintaining the role of the county supply and marketing  cooperative as the main business channel and through making  cotton textile enterprises sign contracts with the county cotton  and flax companies, making the county cotton and flax companies  sign contracts with township cotton stations (plants), and  making the township cotton stations (plants) sign contracts with  peasants. In this way, the cotton circulation links between the  province and cities (prefectures) can be reduced, and the funds  used for cotton circulation can be saved and returned to  peasants. At the same time, based on the state stipulated  price, cotton textile enterprises will give a certain amount of  funds to peasants to support cotton production. Thus, the  returns in growing cotton will be greatly enhanced. The  relevant provincial departments are stepping up their efforts to  make an estimate and to draft the "method on experimenting with  the plan of directly linking cotton production with marketing,"  which will be issued for implementation after being studied and  decided by the provincial party committee and the provincial  government. It is necessary to quickly give the peasants this  information and make them give up the idea that planting cotton  will suffer losses.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: BT given the problems Sir, Mercury finally appears to have given up its pretensions of providing a full international phone service. I am trying to obtain a full list of city dialling codes in the former Soviet Union. After a series of calls to Mercury, being referred from one department to another, I was finally advised that they could not help and that I should contact BT. I wonder if it refers all of its customers' difficult inquiries to BT? Barrie Bain, director, Fertecon, 520 Gessner, Suite 1380, Houston, Texas, US</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mutual Understanding Enhanced"] </F>   [Text] The five-day official friendly visit of State Law  and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] Chairman Senior General  [Than Shwe] and delegation to the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR] at the invitation of the President of the LPDR,  His Excellency Nouhak Phoumsavan, must be hailed as highly  successful and has helped enhance mutual understanding. What is  significant is that the two leaders and the two leaderships were  able to have a cordial exchange of views which bespeak the  longstanding cordial relations which have existed between the  leaders and peoples of our two nations.    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and President Nouhak Phoumsavan had a  friendly and fruitful discussion on bilateral and international  matters of common interest in a cordial atmosphere. In the same  spirit, the high-level officials of the two friendly nations  were able to hold discussions on matters of common interest and  sign agreements of related matters.    The fruitful talks led to the signing of the following  agreements:    1. Agreement between the Government of the Union of Myanmar  [Burma] and the Government of the LPDR on the fixed  International Boundary between the two countries in the Mekong  River.    2. Agreement on the establishment of a Joint Commission for  Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of the Union of  Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR.    3. Agreement on Tourism Cooperation between the Government  of the Union of Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR.    Moreover, the senior general, Madame Than Shwe, and the  delegation were able to absorb the historical and cultural  aspects of Lao life which are common to both sides, for we had  to suffer unfortunate circumstances although we are both  independent sovereign nations. The grace and charm of the Lao  artistes who performed traditional dances for the benefit of the  guests also reflect similarities between the cultures of our two  nations.    We share much of the Buddhist heritage and the senior  general  and Madame Than Shwe as well as members of the entourage were  able to visit pagodas and pay obeisance to the senior Lao sangha  [Buddhist monk], present offertories and share merits.    It is heartening to summarize that the two sides were able  to  highly evaluate the success of the state visit which serves as  firm basis for the enhancement of the friendly and  good-neighborly relations and cooperation between the two  countries in the future, thus contributing to the promotion of  peace, stability, and cooperation for the development of the  region.</p>

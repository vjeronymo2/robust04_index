			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a national securities rating firm, has upgraded  its evaluation of certificates of deposit at Downey Savings &amp; Loan and two  industrial revenue bonds totaling $6 million that are secured by loan  agreements with the Newport Beach institution.  </P> <P> The higher rating reflects Downey's "conservative asset mix, excellent asset  quality, strong capital levels and good profitability," S &amp; P said.  </P> <P> The bonds are issued by two Arizona counties.  </P> <P> Downey has been an active construction lender and real estate investor,  primarily in neighborhood shopping centers in California and Arizona. Those  activities have raised its risk profile but also have contributed increasingly  to its net income. Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Food sales show no sign of slowing: Clothing sector reports cold weather boost for autumn fashion ranges Cold weather and competitive pricing helped boost sales of new autumn fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best month for the financial year, while food sales continued to show no signs of slowing down, the British Retail Consortium said yesterday. The good news arrived as the Central Statistical Office reported that retail sales volumes grew by an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between August and September and 3.7 per cent in the previous 12 months. According to the BRC women's clothing and footwear were star performers as overall volume sales by clothing and footwear retailers increased 1.2 per cent between August and September. On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to trends, the growth in sales by food retailers, where competition is fierce, far exceeded those in any other sector and the retail sector as a whole. In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers were only 0.1 per cent higher. Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the official figures were perhaps misrepresenting total activity in the food market because the CSO surveys all large retailers while it only obtains figures from a sample of small businesses. He said: 'I think they are fully capturing the gains made by big retailers, but I do not think they are capturing the loss of market share by small food retailers.' Household goods stores also saw a boost in sales volumes as a result of aggressive pricing, rising 0.9 per cent in September compared with August. According to the BRC, however, the depressed housing market took its toll on furniture and carpets retailers. The dull housing market subdued sales by DIY retailers. While the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail sales after a fall in August, many analysts pointed out that consumer spending was not increasing so dramatically. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at broker Salomon Brothers, said: 'If volumes are growing steadily, normally you would say that consumer spending is relatively buoyant, but it is hard to read it that way because the values are slowing.'</p>

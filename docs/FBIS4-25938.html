A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said that Rong and Qian,  who is also foreign minister, exchanged views with ghani on the  current situation in Yemen.    Rong said China pays much attention to the development of  the  situation there and is deeply concerned about the large  casualties and damage to life and production facilities caused  by the massive military conflicts there.    He said China hopes that the parties concerned, putting the  people's interests first, will cease firing as soon as possible  and seek settlement of the problem through peaceful negotiations.    Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Told 'Abd-al-Ghani  that China, having good relations with Yemen, hopes to see  unity, stability, prosperity and development in Yemen.

He believed that the Yemeni people will be able to solve  their problem peacefully through negotiations, and restore peace  and stability at an early date.    'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the Yemeni Presidential Council,  arrived in Beijing yesterday.    In the meetings today, he briefed the Chinese leaders on the  latest developments in his country.    He was quoted by the Chinese Foreign Ministry official as  saying that Yemen hopes to solve its own problem by itself and  in a peaceful way so as to maintain Yemen's unification.</p>

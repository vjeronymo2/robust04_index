			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Microchip success spurs Acorn share price SHARES IN Acorn Computers, the Cambridge-based workstation manufacturer in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority stake, have risen by about 40 per cent in the past few days. Throughout December, the price hovered around the 40p mark; yesterday it closed at 56p, having soared over 70p earlier in the week. The likely cause is news that a microprocessor chip developed by a subsidiary is to be used for a series of new US consumer electronics products. Acorn issued a statement yesterday denying knowledge of any factors which could have caused the share price movement. Mr Sam Wauchope, Acorn managing director, said there was nothing beneath the surface which had not been made public. Acorn, which made its reputation in the UK supplying computers to schools, holds a 49 per cent stake in Advanced Risc Machines, a semiconductor design house. The other partners are Apple Computers, one of the largest personal computer manufacturers, and VLSI Technology, a US semiconductor manufacturer. ARM has designed a family of powerful, but low-cost, microprocessors for use in hand-held computers, smart cards and consumer electronic products. Last year it was announced that ARM chips would be used in the Apple 'Newton', a personal electronic assistant functioning as diary, address book and organiser, which will accept handwritten instructions. This news coincided with the beginning of a rise in Acorn's share price  - from 6p to 40p - over six months. This week's rise coincides with the news that an ARM chip will be used in a revolutionary video graphics and video games machine announced in the US by 3DO Company. A later version of 3DO's 'interactive multiplayer' will play music CDs and photo CDs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 30 SAPA -- Ninety-six per cent of  potential voters already have identification documents enabling  them to vote in next month's election, the Department of Home  Affairs said on Wednesday [30 March].    In a statement the department said 21,850,116 of an  estimated  total of 22,709,152 voters as determined by the Central  Statistical Services had their documents by last Friday.    During the preceeding week 153,520 ID documents and 152,301  temporary voters' cards had been issued and the department would  continue its efforts to sustain this trend.    The department reminded the public that its regional and  district offices would be open on Family Day (April 4) and  Founders Day (April 6) enabling them to apply for the necessary  documents.    "Reports from various quarters indicate that the rush at the  department's offices is diminishing."    The department warned that the loss or theft of ID documents  constituted a "very real" security risk.</p>

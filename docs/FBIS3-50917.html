The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the  government headed by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will  continue to discuss the topic of human rights at a meeting  scheduled for the second half of February. Sources close to the  negotiations told NOTIMEX that the delegations agreed to restart  the discussion of the agenda of Mexico, which contains  substantive and operative topics whose discussion precedes the  signing of a peace agreement.    The agenda includes the analysis of substantive topics such  as the human rights situation, economic-social and  technical-cultural aspects, the problem of land ownership,  displaced population, and the constitutional reforms. The  operative topics regard the cease-fire, the demobilization of  the rebels, and their integration into legal life, according to  the same sources.    The parts also agreed to ask the Episcopal Conference to  appoint Rodolfo Quezada, bishop of Zacapa, as president of an  assembly of civilian sectors that would ratify all the  agreements reached by the government and guerrillas.    Another one of the agreements reached today was the  appointment of UN representative Jean Arnault as coordinator of  the five days of discussions and mediator and overseer of the  negotiation process. The URNG and the Guatemalan Government  began on 6 January at a hotel in the Mexican capital preliminary  meetings convoked by the United Nations to discuss and frame  agreement to allow restarting the peace negotiations.    The signing of the agreement is scheduled for 1230 local  (1830 GMT) on 10 January.    The Government Commission was headed by Hector Rosada and  was  made up by Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, deputy chief of staff of  the Army; Victor Argueta, commander of the "Honor Guard"  military base; and Victor Ventura, director of the technical  school. The Government Commission also included Maximiliano  Kestler, Mario Permuth, Antonio Arenales, and Victor Viteri.    The URNG delegation was made up by Commanders Pablo  Monsanto,  Gaspar Ilom, and Rolando Moran, as well as members of the  Political-Diplomatic Commission: Luis Becker, Miguel Angel  Sandoval, and adviser Vinicio Castaneda.    UN Under Secretary General Marrack Goulding also  participated  in the discussions.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / West loses hope in Russian reform THE main western states have given up hope that economic reform in Russia can be carried through in the near future, and further assistance is now unlikely to be offered this year, according to foreign diplomats and officials in Moscow. A mission from the International Monetary Fund is due in Moscow later this month to review progress on the reform programme - but is likely to confirm its view, already made known to the Russian leadership, that payment of the next Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) tranche of its transformation facility, or any other payments, cannot be made this year. Besides the Dollars 1.5bn, the World Bank has ceased negotiations on a Dollars 600m rehabilitation loan - designed to support the budget - because of the deterioration of the reform programme. However, a Dollars 610m loan to the oil industry, signed in Moscow a month ago, will go through. At the same time, the Russian government is convulsed by a debate about economic policy, as two rival conceptions of reform battle for the approval of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister, has privately presented a document to Mr Yeltsin calling for a greatly loosened macro-economic policy. It argues that the tight policy pursued by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, has both forced down production and pushed up inflation. 'Such a course only discredits the policy of reform,' he says, urging increased investment in key industries and an end to the system of privatisation by vouchers. Mr Fyodorov has pushed through a strategy which would restore a 7 per cent cut in VAT, levy new excise taxes on imported goods, put up local sales taxes, cut the indexation of wages and reduce the price which the state pays for grain. These measures are expected to bring in Rbs5-6,000bn - but involve a direct contradiction of decisions taken by parliament. The west's financiers would find it hard to support policy which has not been subjected to a parliamentary vote. While Mr Fyodorov's policy has been approved 'in principle' by the government, the line of argument being pushed by Mr Lobov - a close friend of Mr Yeltsin's, who outranks Mr Fyodorov in the government - is attracting more support.</p>

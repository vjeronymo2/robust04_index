			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tough times ahead for copper THE COPPER market has a 'rough patch' immediately ahead, according to Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge of the US, the world's second-largest copper producer, writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent. Weakness in demand from Europe and Japan had forced the group to revise its forecasts, he said in London. Phelps now expected a copper supply surplus of 200,000 tonnes this year, compared with a previously-forecast 150,000 tonnes. Mr Yearley said there might even be a surplus in 1994 whereas his company earlier this year expected a deficit. Consequently, the copper price would probably trade in a range between 70 cents a lb (Dollars 1,543 a tonne) and 85 cents (Dollars 1,873 a tonne). The sharp fall in the price in April was 'a wake-up call' to the industry, which it should still heed despite a slight recovery since then. However, once recovery arrived - whenever that might be - demand for copper might grow by 10 per cent to 15 per cent in only two years as it made up for recent minimal growth, said Mr Yearley. 'That gives a lot of upside (for the price) and not a lot of downside.' On average annual copper demand could be expected to increase by 2 to 2.5 per cent, requiring at least an extra 200,000 tonnes of the metal a year. Also 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of capacity was disappearing each year as mines became depleted.</p>

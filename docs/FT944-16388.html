			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: SGS profits rise by 5.5% Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world's largest inspection and testing group, said its pre-tax profits in the first eight months were up 5.5 per cent on a 3 per cent rise in fee income. Mrs Elisabeth Salina, chairman of the Geneva based group, said operating profits should continue to show 'satisfactory growth' in the full year, although net income would rise to a lesser extent. No figures were given. In the first eight months, fee income was up 10.5 per cent, expressed in local currencies, of which 8 per cent came from internal growth. Fee income rose 9.2 per cent in Europe and 18.4 per cent in North America. The operating margin was in line with the 9 per cent achieved in the whole of 1993. Net income rose in spite of lower financial revenues and a SFr10m (Dollars 7.70m) provision for unrealised losses on securities.</p>

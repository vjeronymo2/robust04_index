			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Free Democratic Party [FDP] has decided to wage  a campaign against Britain due to that country's stand toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus.    In a statement he issued today, FDP leader Ismet Kotak said  that his party wants Britain, which is on the side of the  wrongdoers in Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to get up and leave  the bases in Cyprus. Kotak urged the Turkish Cypriot people to  take a stand against every British action in Cyprus, stressing  that there is no room for a third state in Cyprus.    The FDP leader pointed out that the world must condemn the  stand before clear massacres of those who are opposed to the  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. He urged the world to  protest the present British Government.</p>

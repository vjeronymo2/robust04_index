			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic  Party (DP) voiced optimism Monday that the inter-Korean summit  would be realized at an early date after ministerial-level  working contacts in June or July.    The party's planning and management section submitted a  report on the current political situation to the Supreme Council  stating that since the inter-Korean summit has been agreed in  principle by both sides' presidents, it is likely that  procedures for the summit will progress rapidly.    "If South and North Korea broad-mindedly push for the  summit,  it is highly likely that all the procedures for realization of  the summit may make rapid progress," the report said.    North Korean leader Kim Il-song has conveyed his hope to  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam of an early summit "at any  time, any place and without any preconditions" through former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Kim Yong-sam in turn welcomed the  offer.    It added that the ministerial-level working contacts for the  summit would probably be held in June or July and that the  summit could occur this year -- that is, if things go well and  if North Korean-U.S. talks also make progress.    Considering the historical significance of the first  inter-Korean summit, the two sides are expected to meet in Seoul  and Pyongyang, according to the report.    The summit is expected to address all issues pending between  South and North Korea including the standoff over Pyongyang's  nuclear program.    "Especially, the meeting will deal with the two basic  agreements concluded at the sixth high-level inter-Korean talks  in February 1992 -- the South-North denuclearization  declaration, disarmament and unification," the report predicted.    The report said the summit's chances of coming off are good,  citing the former U.S. President's mediation between the two  sides and both presidents' emphasis on meeting without any  preconditions.    Both Seoul and Pyongyang are in a difficult situation  because  of the nuclear dispute, the report pointed out, and the  agreement to hold a summit was made with the world closely  watching, the report added.    "The inter-Korean summit will act as great momentum to  change  overall inter-Korean relations, including the North Korean  nuclear situation, and to clear away the national history of  hostility and antagonism over the past 50 years."    The report suggested that the DP actively support the  government so that the mood can change from sanctions to  dialogue and so inter-Korean relations can be normalized.</p>

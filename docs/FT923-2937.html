			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Four European builders set up joint venture FOUR of Europe's biggest construction groups are to form a joint venture to bid for European infrastructure projects, they said yesterday. It is the latest in a series of cross-border acquisitions and joint ventures involving European contractors forming strategic alliances before the removal of EC trade barriers at the end of this year. The four companies, GTM-Entrepose of France, John Laing of the UK, NCC of Sweden and Strabag Bau of Germany, will form Societe Europeenne de Construction, a joint venture company based in Brussels. The four groups have a combined annual turnover of more than Dollars 11.8bn and employ about 90,000 workers. Mr John Armitt, joint managing director of John Laing Construction, who will chair the new company, said individually the companies might find it difficult to take on some large high-risk road and rail projects planned in Europe. 'By pooling our resources we will provide a more secure financial and technical base to bid for infrastructure contracts,' he said. 'This will become even more important with governments increasingly looking to the private sector to finance and operate some of these developments - particularly if construction companies promoting these schemes are to be expected to take an equity stake in the projects.' Mr Armitt said he hoped the venture would generate at least one Pounds 100m project within the next 12 months. It would pursue contracts anywhere in the world but was mainly looking at eastern and western Europe. It was investigating building and perhaps financing part of the improved road network for eastern Germany. The company was also examining schemes to build privately financed toll motorways in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Laing and GTM-Entrepose are already partners for a privately financed Pounds 350m toll bridge being built across the River Severn. Strabag and Laing have bid jointly for commercial projects in Germany. The new company would be expected to identify other opportunities for joint ventures, said Mr Armitt. Mr Torsten Eriksson, NCC's managing director, said the alliance would allow the Swedish-based company to become involved in foreign projects, which would compensate for the downturn of demand in the domestic construction market.</p>

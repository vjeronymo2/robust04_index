			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Indian MPs end boycott Indian opposition parties yesterday ended a two-week boycott of both houses of parliament, after the government backed down in a dispute over the findings of a parliamentary inquiry into the Dollars 1.28bn Bombay stock market scandal. The opposition walked out three weeks ago over what it alleged was a cover-up after the government partly rejected the recommendations of an all-party report on the scandal. Mr Sivraj Patil, speaker of the lower house, said the government had agreed to 'revise, modify and resubmit' its 'Action Taken Report' which was its response to the parliamentary inquiry. Mr Vidya Charan Shukla, minister for parliamentary affairs, said the government would present a supplementary report to the Action Taken Report only after discussions 'inside or outside parliament'. Mr Shukla said the opposition would give in writing specific issues or 'points' that needed to be reconsidered. The opposition had demanded that the government accept the committee's recommendations and take action against three ministers - including Finance Minister Manmohan Singh - criticised in the report. Other demands include action against top bureaucrats and officials of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. The opposition also insists on further penal action against foreign banks implicated in the scandal.</p>

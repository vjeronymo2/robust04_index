			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Personal View: Dilemma over charges lies downstream In just four weeks, the UK water industry regulator, Ofwat, will reveal its decision on allowed price increases for individual water companies. The publicity surrounding current price negotiations for the 31 water utilities of England and Wales has overshadowed a far more important issue which customers and companies should be addressing - the basis on which charges are actually calculated. The main preoccupation so far has been with the 'K factors' - the rate above inflation by which water companies will be allowed to increase water and sewerage charges over the next five to 10 years. As the increases are to be applied annually, more than 300 figures will be published by Ofwat in one day. The K factors are regarded as important primarily for company planners and City analysts, who try to make forecasts for future profits of the individual companies. Yet the basis of calculation is equally significant, and has not been consistently addressed. Water companies have long depended on the old rating system as a second-hand, low-cost way of fixing water bills for 18m households. However, time is running out. The former UK prime minister, the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was determined to replace the old rates system - which based water bills on property values - with the poll tax. As part of the poll tax programme, her government in 1988 passed a law making it illegal to base water bills on any system derived from old rateable values after the year 2000. This means that water companies have just five more years to come up with new ways of charging customers. The privatised companies have been reluctant to face such troublesome changes or to give up such an easy way of getting much of their income. Less than 10 per cent of bills have been put on any new basis so far. Some 16m households must be reviewed in the next five years. The debate over what is the best method to calculate charges rages, even as the price increases are being set. A few companies see metering as the way forward, but want to stretch out the change, and fear the heavy cost. Some who favour metering also argue that it could penalise those who can least afford price increases  - for example, large families in small houses, versus small families in large houses. Others still hope to climb aboard the council tax system, much as they rode on the back of the rates system. But council tax is riddled with rebates and exemptions, which companies will not want to concede. The water industry will not be allowed to pick the parts of the system that suit it. The oddest idea being considered is a flat-rate licence fee in some areas, bringing large increases or reductions in bills, still quite unrelated to usage. The essence of a utility is that it should be paid according to the volume of its service to customers. This is in line with the National Rivers Authority's insistence that water resources need to be conserved in some parts of England, and new charging methods could and should promote that. Meanwhile, the main focus is likely to remain on the more immediately understandable K factor discussions. These are not as simple as they first appear. The procedures have several faults. Most importantly, customers have little idea of what goes into the pricing decisions: for example, how much of the price increases are to finance future investment and so forth. There is also no certainty over the rate of price increase - even with the K factor - since nobody can accurately predict inflation. Perhaps a greater fault is that this procedure over-dramatises the work of Ofwat. Companies are already paying too much attention to its heavyweight style of regulation. This could further isolate customers, who still worry about water quality, dirty rivers and polluted beaches, as well as about future water bills. Neither the water company managements nor City analysts should make too much of Ofwat's July decisions. Their worry should be that, as the companies invest in providing better services, they have yet to settle a long-term way of calculating bills and gathering money from domestic customers. They have only five years to solve this problem and, more important, to explain their solution to the customers. The author is a former research fellow of Nuffield College Oxford and one of several advisers to Mr Nicholas Ridley, secretary of state at the time of water privatisation. His book 'Coming Clean' will be published by Penguin in July</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / General thwarts dismissal move General Alexander Lebed, an outspoken and popular Russian officer, yesterday scotched Moscow's efforts to disband his army and send him to another posting. Gen Lebed's successful defiance of his superiors in the ministry of defence is another sign of the weakness of Russia's top brass, which has been dogged this week by allegations of corruption. Over the past few weeks the ministry of defence has attempted several times to detach Gen Lebed from the loyal troops of the 14th army which he commands in Moldova and send him to a remote outpost, most recently the central Asian republic of Tajikistan. But the 42-year-old general, who became the darling of the officer corps earlier this year when he publicly suggested that Russia follow the example of Pinochet's military dictatorship, has publicly refused to obey. After a meeting in Moscow yesterday between Gen Lebed and Gen Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, the ministry appeared to back down. A spokesman said that, having turned down the offer to command Russian troops in war-torn Tajikistan, Gen Lebed would remain in charge of the 14th army. Gen Grachev made a further, explicit effort at reconciliation, issuing a statement insisting that the ministry, which has announced Gen Lebed's dismissal from his post at least twice earlier this month, was not trying to oust him. The defence ministry, which has been hotly denying allegations in the Russian press of high-level corruption, yesterday announced that a senior office had been caught taking a Dollars 2,000 bribe from a private business which was renting space from the army.</p>

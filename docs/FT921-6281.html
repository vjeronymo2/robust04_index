			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac plans to redeem some Amps TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials concern, was yesterday the latest company to announce plans to redeem some of its auction market preferred stock (Amps). The announcement follows the decision by ECC Group, the china clay company, to redeem Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m) of Amps financed by a rights issue. Tarmac's credit rating is currently under review by the US agencies and analysts expect it to fall. Mr Terence Mason, finance director, said that since the review was announced, dividends set on its Amps through the regular auctions has risen to as high as 120 per cent of US commercial paper rates. With its current single A rating Tarmac's Amps have a maximum dividend of 125 per cent of commercial paper rates, but if its rating fell to BBB the maximum would be 175 per cent. Tarmac plans to repay Dollars 150m of the Dollars 300m it issued in October 1990 when it bought out the minority of Lone Star Industries, its US subsidiary. The group has sufficient unused dollar borrowing facilities to cover the redemption and will pay lower interest rates on it. The other Dollars 150m is connected to a long-term swap transaction and will not be redeemed. Tarmac's shares rose 1p to 119p yesterday.</p>

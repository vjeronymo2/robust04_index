Mrs.  Chamorro issued an appeal to the irregulars, urging them to lay  down their weapons and work in peace and tranquillity.    During the ceremony at Santo Tomas inaugurating six blocks  which had been newly paved, President Chamorro said her  government is currently studying the proposal presented by poet  Pablo Antonio Cuadra and Cardinal Obando y Bravo in connection  with the situation prevailing in the northern part of the  country. She said similar proposals were presented in due time  by the government and, in fact, it has offered various  amnesties. Nevertheless, she said, certain groups are still up  in arms.    [Begin Chamorro recording] I ask them to lay put down their  weapons and seek a way to work in peace and tranquillity. [end  recording]    Referring to the Army's presence in the northern part of the  country, Mrs. Chamorro said that farmers have requested this.    [Begin Chamorro recording] I know many of the farmers -- for  example, local farmers -- have asked me to send the Army, to  send people to control the situation so they may work, produce,  ship their coffee harvest, and ship everything. That is why the  Army is there and that is why the police and everyone else are  there -- so that farmers may ship their harvests. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

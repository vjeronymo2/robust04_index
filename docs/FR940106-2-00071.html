Funds awarded will be used to: (l) Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b) support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family medicine training programs under section 747(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Funding Experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 50 competing applications for the Grants for Departments of Family Medicine program.

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Pirelli to cut 700 car tyre jobs PIRELLI, the tyre manufacturer, is to cut 700 car tyre production jobs at its Burton-on-Trent plant and re-locate production to other plants, primarily that in Carlisle, the company's other UK manufacturing site, Lisa Wood writes. The company said the redundancies were in response to the 'considerable deterioration in demand in the European tyre market'. Pirelli, as part of a big restructuring programme in Europe, is concentrating different types of tyre production into single specialised manufacturing sites in national markets in order to reduce costs. Since 1991 the group has shed nearly 6,000 jobs in Italy, Germany, Spain and Greece. The Burton-on-Trent plant will retain about 600 jobs in the continued production of truck tyres and head office activities.</p>

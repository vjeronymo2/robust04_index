			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Developing a strategy for quality research - Some of the problems faced in remaining flexible in the search for solutions THE LATEST four-year strategy from the Research Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales unveiled this week, highlights key questions in the nature of accounting research. An important purpose of accounting research is to contribute to the solution of practical problems by enhancing understanding of their causes and consequences. Such problems may be those faced by accountants - how best to account for brands, for example - or those caused by accountants or accounting - like whether current costing techniques result in the best management decisions. Expecting all research to produce short and medium-term benefits is to misunderstand its purposes and potential. Some of the benefits will be long-term. Others will not accrue to the accountancy profession at all. So who should fund it? In a capitalist economy, costs will normally be borne by those who benefit. Research designed to help accountants should generally be funded by individual firms or by professional bodies. The funding of research about accountants and accountancy is less clear. If the regulation of the profession is of interest to society at large, then the government should support it. But since the UK accountancy profession is largely self-regulated and wishes to remain so, it might be expected to bear the cost. Responsibility for funding will depend also on the focus of the research. There is little incentive for individual firms or even particular industrial or professional sectors to fund basic research as the benefits are long-term, sometimes speculative and widely spread, such as the effects of the increasing internationalisation of capital markets. So basic research in accounting is often funded by the government. But reductions in public sector grants during the past decade raise the possibility that the accountancy bodies should attempt to make good some of the deficit, as part of their duty as learned professional bodies. Applied accounting research normally produces results which are valuable to the accountancy profession as a whole, such as standard setting, auditing practices or corporate governance. It is an area where there is an obvious need for the professional bodies to provide support. Accounting development, or technical work, such as the development of a management accounting system for a particular firm, will often provide benefits which are peculiar to particular organisations or firms. So it is reasonable to expect those who benefit from the research to fund it. The new research board strategy document reflects these arguments. The primary objective is to assist the Institute to fulfil its principal object: 'To advance the theory and practice of accountancy in all its aspects, including in particular auditing, financial management and taxation'. In the last four years, the board has invested over Pounds 750,000 in research, sponsored almost 100 new projects and published 37 books and monographs. Much has influenced policy making. For example, projects or publications supported during the past two years which helped the Accounting Standards Board include goodwill and other intangibles, depreciation, the accuracy of property valuations, the information content of cash flow disclosures under FRS 1, reductions in disclosure requirements, segment reporting, summary financial statements, marking to market, discounting in financial reporting, accounting for acquisitions and mergers, and the future shape of financial reports. Of interest to the Auditing Practices Board have been topics such as the audit expectations gap, audit committees in large UK companies, the expanded audit report, the impact of audit regulation, and a survey of auditing in the UK. The board's achievements have extended further. Projects have included the use of accounting information in bank lending decisions, accounting systems in the context of changing management practice, the hidden costs of tax compliance, financial risk in capital budgeting, the development of an environmental research agenda, Housing Association accounting, financial reporting and management accounting in the regulated industries, and a project funded jointly with the Economic and Social Research Council on the extent to which UK and US share prices reflect accounting earnings. The board has also sponsored three joint projects with the Centre de Recherche et de Documentation of the Ordre des Experts Comptables, into comparative French and English treatments of pensions, goodwill and depreciation, published a book on financial reporting in Japan, and commissioned a series of 12 books on financial reporting in Europe. The new strategy document - which offers up to Pounds 275,000 a year - seeks broadly to continue and develop previous successes. But it differs from its predecessors in one important respect. The board is interested in high quality research in all the main areas of the discipline and, in the face of some opposition from those who believe that it should define a detailed research agenda, it has decided not to dictate a detailed programme of priority areas for research. Such a programme may be unduly inflexible and would quickly become outdated. The board will continue to seek suggestions from the Accounting Standards Board, the Auditing Practices Board and relevant institute committees as to research relevance. The board will continue with five principal activities: Sponsoring research projects. Projects may range from a few hundred pounds to Pounds 50,000 or more. Although there is no detailed programme of priority areas, the current agenda includes accountability within the business community and the public sector, the national and international reform of financial reporting, the role of accounting and auditing in regulation, the use of accounting information to support management decision-making, improving environmental accountability and the development of a fairer and more efficient system of taxation and social security. Disseminating research findings. The board attaches the greatest importance to making findings as accessible to as wide an audience as possible, through books, research monographs and articles in academic and professional journals. Organising and sponsoring conferences, seminars and workshops. The board will continue a programme on major subject areas and on themes which are multi-disciplinary. Developing the infrastructure for accounting research. Accounting and finance is a relatively young discipline in UK universities and it requires support. Existing help includes the Institute Academic Fellowships Scheme, which contributes to bridging the difference between academic and commercial salaries for leading young academics, a database group which collects information about the range of databases available and their potential uses, archives for the Accounting Standards Committee and the Auditing Practices Committee, and sponsoring the British Accounting Association's annual doctoral colloquium and summer school for younger academics. Organising specialist groups to advise on particular subject areas. Currently these offer advice on developing the research base in auditing, taxation, and international affairs, and identify areas of relevance to the profession. The board is entrusted with research funds which are substantial by accounting standards. It hopes to invest them as productively in the next four years as it has in the past.

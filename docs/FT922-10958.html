			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Food retailers' property 'overvalued' The big food retailers are overvaluing their property portfolios and should adopt more prudent accounting policies by depreciating freehold and long leasehold land and buildings acquired since 1987, a stockbroker's report suggests. Such a change would have a drastic impact on projected earnings per share for the year to spring 1993, reducing Tesco's by 21 per cent, J Sainsbury's by 15 per cent and Argyll Group's by 11 per cent, according to estimates by Credit Lyonnais Laing. CLL said it was previously acceptable for food retailers not to depreciate because inflation offset decreases in their underlying value. But the carrying value of their recently-acquired assets is now uncomfortably high given the current low inflation.</p>

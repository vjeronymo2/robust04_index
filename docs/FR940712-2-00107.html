The EIS will investigate the expansion of the existing Kinston Regional Jetport to accommodate the GTP. The proposed improvements consist of providing for the construction and operation of a new 11,500-foot runway, together with related taxiways, and other related facilities, along with land acquisition and land use planning. The proposed project also includes other primary infrastructure, such as roadway improvements, areas for industrial development and a central cargo facility to move products in and out of the complex. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EIS is anticipated to address impacts on wetlands, historic properties, and so forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will also evaluate cumulative impacts anticipated to occur as a result of the implementation of other foreseeable improvements at the GTP in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The North Carolina Global TransPark Authority (Authority) issued a Request For Proposals inviting local governments and other public and/or private groups interested in being the site for GTP to present written proposals of their qualifications of the site and surrounding area. The RFP requested that the proponent furnish information on environmental factors as well as services, quality of life, zoning and permitting, and financial participations on the site and area. Eleven proposals were received and, following an extensive review, the Lenoir County site (Kinston Regional Jetport) was identified as the preferred site. An Airport Master Plan was developed for the GPT which investigated several runway layouts and a draft environmental assessment was prepared and coordinated with Federal and state environmental agencies for their review and comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> PUBLIC SCOPING: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will hold a scoping meeting to solicit input from Federal, state and local agencies which have jurisdiction by law or have specific expertise with respect to any environmental impacts associated with the project.

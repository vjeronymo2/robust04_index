			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Watchdog fails to bite: Electrical goods retailing falls outside his power IF IT achieved nothing else, yesterday's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, highlighted the huge size of the electricity companies' losses on their high-street retailing operations - a total of Pounds 105m over the last three years. But will it do anything to shake up the intensely competitive electrical and electronic goods market? Neither the electricity regulator nor the Office of Fair Trading - which also looked into Dixons' allegations - found any evidence to support its claim that the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales had engaged in unfair cross-subsidisation of their retail businesses, or in anti-competitive practices. Dixons had charged that regional electricity companies helped their electrical goods retailers in a variety of ways, for example, by bearing part of their advertising and marketing costs, providing cheap accommodation, providing capital at no charge, and joint billing services. This help enabled them to increase market share by 2 percentage points to around 13 per cent, Dixons said. Most of Prof Littlechild's recommendations for clearer and more consistent accounting treatment of retailing operations have already been adopted by several companies. And there is little more that he can do. These are non-core businesses outside his direct control. He can only ensure that these losses do not harm the regulated side of the business, which delivers electricity to people's homes, and that the companies comply with the law, for example by not using a householder's bill-paying record to make decisions on advancing credit on purchases from showrooms. But if yesterday's reports do not raise wider issues, they could have an impact by turning the spotlight on the companies difficulties in the high street. This might hasten the retreat many are already beating from the retailing market. For example, Prof Littlechild's report looks beyond the profit-and-loss account to comment that the companies' returns on capital employed have been, on average, negative, and in all cases low by the standards proposed by Dixons. But he also points out that the losses the companies are making in this business are at the expense of the shareholder, not the electricity consumer, who is protected by the official price tariff. 'Whether it is commercially sensible to incur such losses is a matter for shareholders,' he says. Only one company, Norweb, could be described as on a strongly expansionary course in retailing. London Electricity and Swalec in south Wales, have pulled out of the business, and others have decided to join forces rather than continue on their own. For example, Eastern, Southern and Midlands have formed E&amp;S Retail. A small number are still operating on their own, for example Seeboard, which has opted for building superstores. However, Mr John Weight, the director responsible for retailing, stressed yesterday that expansion was 'measured and controlled'. Some companies have also indicated that they are only prepared to remain in the business for a limited period because of the intensity of competition, and the difficulty of getting costs down. Mr Nick Pink, an analyst who follows the electricity companies at Warburg Securities, said yesterday: 'They've put the baby in the deep end to see if it can swim, and if it can't they'll have to let it drown.' Part of the difficulty the companies face in deciding what to do about lossmaking retail activities is that shutting down such a labour-intensive operation leads to a huge redundancy bill. When London Electricity sold out earlier this year, it took a Pounds 20m charge to cover this expense. Shareholders will also be able to make more informed judgments about the retailing activities because more of them will be publishing detailed results. This is not because of an agreement with the regulator, but because more of the companies now have these operations in separate subsidiaries or in jointly owned companies which produce their own sets of accounts. The presence of the electricity distributors in the retail market is a British phenomenon. French and German power companies, for example, do not have a high-street presence. But the UK regulatory framework gives electricity companies an incentive to sell as much electricity as possible, and they therefore see appliance sales as a useful way of boosting revenues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Nadashkevich] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 1 Jun -- A high-ranking spokesman for the  Russian Foreign Ministry today called a contract for the sale to  Malaysia of 18 MiG-29 fighters expected to be signed in Kuala  Lumpur on Tuesday "the deal of the century". "We are in the  South-East Asia arms market for the first time after 30 years'  absence, having cut it all back after the events in Indonesia in  1965," he said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent.    According to Anatoliy Khmelnitskiy, deputy director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry Second Department for Asia, the  contract was finally agreed "literally just a few hours ago" and  there are no outstanding issues. It remains only to sign the  document, which will happen on 7 June. The first Russian  fighter will be supplied in April next year. Full  implementation of the project is calculated to take 25 years, as  it concerns creating a broad infrastructure in Malaysia.    There has been a fierce struggle since 1992 among major  foreign arms producing companies for the Malaysia contract,  which Russia has won. Now, after Malaysia, there are specific  proposals coming from other countries in the region, Anatoliy  Khmelnitskiy said. We need to be quick, the market is full of  offers, the Russian diplomat stressed.</p>

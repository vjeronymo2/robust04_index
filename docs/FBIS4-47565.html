V. </F> Kirpichnikova, Uralsk Forestry Engineering Institute; UDC  630.425]    [Abstract] A comparative analysis of the effect of air  pollution young pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and spruce  (Picea obovata L.) trees of the Central Urals focused  on releases from the primary source of pollution of the  Revdinsk- Pervouralsk Industrial Center -- the Sreduralmedzavod,  a copper- processing plant. The principal components of the  pollution over the past 50 years have been compounds of sulfur,  nitrogen, copper, arsenic, and lead. The study involved six  sectors -- three with stands of the pine, three with stands of  the spruce. The sectors were 4, 15, and 25 km from the plant.  Biometric characteristics of the stands fell the closer the  study was to the plant. The atmospheric pollution was found to  have a greater effect on the growth processes of the spruce.  Electrophysiological studies indicated that the conductive  properties of the trees were reduced and that the membrane  system for the transport of water and ions in the tree trunks  (the site of placement of the electrodes) was poorly developed.  Overall, the spruce appeared to be more sensitive to the  pollution than did the pine. References 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

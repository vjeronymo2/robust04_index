			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through the use of this high level language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments, and others). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Specifications. FIPS Ada specifications are the language specifications contained in American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994 standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994 standard document specifies the form of a program written in Ada, the effect of translating and executing a program, predefined library entities that must be supplied, and detection of compilation and/or link errors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results when the rules of the standard fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control of programs, or the means of transforming programs for processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Implementation. The implementation of FIPS Ada involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition of Ada processors, interpretation of FIPS Ada, and validation of processors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.1&blank;Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective ninety (90) days after the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Ada Processors acquired for Federal use after this date should conform to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A transition period provides time for industry to produce Ada language processors conforming to the standard. The transition period begins on the effective date and ends March 1, 1997. The provisions of FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 apply to orders placed after the effective date of this publication. If, during the transition period, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 119 may be acquired for interim use during the transition period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This transition period is intended to give implementations that conform to FIPS PUB 119 time to make the enhancements necessary to enable conformance to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1. No further transitional period is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.2&blank;Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS Ada should be considered whether Ada processors are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology for procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index, Chapter 4 Part 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.3&blank;Interpretation of FIPS Ada. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution of questions (see FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS Ada Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, FAX: 301&hyph;948&hyph;6213, e-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.4&blank;Validation of Ada Processors. Implementations of FIPS Ada shall be validated in accordance with the NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS Ada. Recommended procurement terminology for validation of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation, Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Validated Products List  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for information about the validation status of Ada products. This information may be used to specify validation time frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the Ada implementation offered. The criteria for applicability of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require that the offered version/release of the Ada implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter settings; e.g., the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

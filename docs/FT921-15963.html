			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Gilts sales of Pounds 1.32bn recorded THE Bank of England sold Pounds 1.32bn of government gilt-edged securities in November, according to official figures released yesterday, Peter Norman writes. This prompted City analysts to suggest that the government is close to funding the public sector borrowing requirement for 1991-92. The Bank's final monetary statistics for November showed large purchases of Pounds 1.1bn of gilts by the non-bank private sector. According to Mr Don Smith, an economist for Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged, the government may have to sell only a further Pounds 500m of gilts to fully fund the Pounds 10.5bn PSBR for 1991-92 forecast in the Treasury's Autumn Statement.</p>

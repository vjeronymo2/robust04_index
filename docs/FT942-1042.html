			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Grand Metropolitan sells low margin wine brands Two of the leading wine brands in the US are to change hands in a proposed deal between a US subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan and one of the country's leading wine producers. Heublein, a GrandMet subsidiary, has signed a letter of intent to sell Almaden and Inglenook wines, as well as several Californian wineries, to Canandaigua Wine Company of New York. The Almaden and Inglenook brands are the third and sixth largest selling wine brands in the US with more than 13 per cent of the overall market. GrandMet is selling the brands as part of its focus on higher margin products. Almaden and Inglenook are cheaper, higher volume wines, with lower margins. The businesses recorded net sales in the year ended September 30 of Dollars 235m (Pounds 155m) and were profitable, GrandMet said. The price has not been disclosed, and the deal must wait for regulatory approval. It is thought the agreement will be closely examined as Canandaigua is the second largest wine producer in the US, with brands such as Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars.</p>

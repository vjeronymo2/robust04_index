			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Premeditated Military Buildup </F> Maneuvers"]    [Text] The U.S. imperialists' military buildup maneuvers  to provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula have become more  unscrupulous. According to a report on the testimony at a  subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 18  April, (Rowen), assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of  Defense, revealed that the United States would deploy anew to  South Korea one brigade of military equipment, including tanks,  howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers.    Stating that the United States is pushing ahead with a new  strategy of deploying various types of firing instruments and  combat equipment on naval ships in South Korean waters and in  the waters surrounding it, (Rowen) babbled that, through this  strategy, the United States could more quickly deploy stronger  ground forces to battles and that it was correcting the problem  of a lengthy deployment of tanks and other heavy weaponry to  battle sites, as took place during the Persian Gulf war.    This is part of the premeditated military buildup maneuvers  designed to take a preemptive attack on our republic and openly  reveals the U.S. criminal attempt to ignite a nuclear war.    A tense situation still prevails on the Korean peninsula.  This is totally because of the treacherous acts by the United  States. As everyone knows well, the United States made it clear  domestically and internationally through a DPRK-U.S. joint  statement that it wants to resolve the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula peacefully, that it will not use force of arms,  including nuclear weapons, against the other side, and that it  will not even threaten the other side with such a force of arms.    Completely overturning the agreement made at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York, however, the United States is concentrating  its large-scale aggression Armed Forces in South Korea and in  the area surrounding it, babbling that it will not rule out a  preemptive attack against us and that it will suspend the  North's nuclear development even at the risk of a war, and,  thus, staging every day a provocative war exercise for a  northward invasion.    Following the recent deployment of offensive-purpose Apache  helicopters to South Korea, Patriot missiles arrived in Pusan on  18 April. It is also said that aggression forces and missile  equipment loaded on other transport ships will arrive in South  Korea soon to complete the deployment of the Patriot missile  unit to the frontline area.    In addition, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South  Korea and had a conspiratorial war conference with puppet  military bosses. His junket to South Korea was not only a junket  for frontline command [ilson chihwi haenggak] designed to  convert the puppets' plan for a northward invasion into  practice, but is also a junket to conspire to organize combined  armed forces against us, which is a phenomenon that we can see  usually on the eve of a war.    The fact that at this juncture the assistant secretary of  the  U.S. Department of Defense revealed the United States would  deploy military equipment, including tanks, howitzers, and  multiple rocket launchers, to South Korea vividly shows that the  U.S. imperialists are attempting to further reinforce their  force of arms on the Korean peninsula in order to provoke a war  of Northward invasion at any cost. This also clearly proves  that it is none other than the United States who is leading the  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and that  they have no intention at all to solve the nuclear issue by  means of dialogue.    It is evident to everyone that when, following the  deployment  of Patriot missiles, heavy weaponry such as tanks, howitzers,  and multiple rocket launchers are deployed to South Korea, the  situation on the Korean peninsula will be further aggravated.    The U.S. imperialists are busily moving in order to provoke  a  war of northward invasion. The U.S. imperialists' inherent  nature of aggression has not changed at all. The United States,  which became the only superpower after the end of the cold war,  now acts more arrogantly, further strengthening its military  threat and blackmail against small countries and, particularly,  on those countries advancing toward independence. This finds  expression in the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers for arms buildup  and war on the Korean peninsula.    The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that they cannot  subdue or frighten our people with military threats or blackmail.    We are prepared for both dialogue and war. If someone  provokes us, our people and People's Army will retaliate on the  rascal a thousand-fold. Our people, who regard independence as  life, will sternly punish any aggressor and resolutely defend  the nation's sovereignty.    The South Korean puppets should not run wild  indiscriminately, fools rush in where angels fear to tread.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / People: Governor to join Scottish Hydro-Electric Lord Wilson, who recently retired as governor of Hong Kong, is to become chairman of Scottish Hydro-Electric, the privatised electricity company which serves the north of Scotland. It will be his first boardroom appointment and he will make it his major task. He will succeed Sir Michael Joughin on April 1 1993. Lord Wilson, who is 57, meets one of the obvious criteria for the job - being a Scot. He took his title, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, from the cottage in Aberdeenshire, at the heart of Hydro-Electric's area, where he spent his home leaves from Hong Kong. 'I have half grown up with Hydro-Electric,' he said yesterday, 'and walked an awful lot of the hills in the Hydro-Electric area.' However, having been either in government service or in academic life for all his life, mostly connected with Chinese affairs, he is not a businessman and says he will have a lot to learn. Hydro-Electric is an attractive animal as electricity companies go, with a rural image but a nimble performance in establishing markets and building a gas-fired power station in England. Joughin, who will be almost 67 when he steps down, was a farmer and broadcaster of Conservative persuasion who was made chairman of the old North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1983. His bluff manner belies the shrewdness which helped him persuade the government to privatise Scottish electricity as two companies rather than one (to the disappointment of ScottishPower). 'Electricity will always be a political commodity,' he says. Wilson is smoother but, from years of dealing with Chinese, no less politically acute. Wilson was approached by Hydro-Electric when Joughin read an 'Aberdeenshire man leaves Hong Kong' type article about Wilson in the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal. The efforts of headhunters had proved fruitless.</p>

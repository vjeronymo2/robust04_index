			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. DENIES PAYING PANAMA REBELS $1 MILLION  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today denied allegations by Panama's Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega that the United States paid $1 million to rebel officers to launch last  week's failed coup attempt.  </P> <P> "That's nonsense," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.  </P> <P> "Absurd," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in Gulfport, Miss., that  he would check the report out, but added, "I don't believe anything Noriega  says."  </P> <P> Noriega told reporters for The Times and the Boston Globe in an interview  Wednesday night that Panamanian investigators discovered a bank account in the  name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than  $1 million. (Story, Section A, Page 1.)  </P> <P> "There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian," Noriega was quoted as  saying. "Six zeroes. It was a million-dollar account."  </P> <P> Noriega also said Nicaraguan Contras delivered money and relayed messages  between U.S. officials and coup plotters.  </P> <P> "That's the first I've ever heard of something like that," Tutwiler said of the  accusation concerning the Contras.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has said previously that U.S. officials were notified  in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did not play a part in  planning it.  </P></p>

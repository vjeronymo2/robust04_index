			<p>CSO     [Text] Toyota Motor and Honda Motor respectively will  develop and locally produce "Asia Car," a low-price strategic  passenger car for the Southeast Asian market. Both companies  will develop them with existing 1300-cc to 1500-cc displacement  compact cars as the base, and they will achieve low prices  through local procurement of almost all parts in Asia. Toyota  will mass-produce it in Thailand beginning in 1998 and export it  to the Near and Middle East and Central and South America. Honda  will manufacture and sell it in Thailand and Indonesia by 1996.  Japanese automakers' shift of production to Asia is  accelerating, and an international division of labor system of  complementary parts and car types among many nations is  advancing further.    Toyota is manufacturing and selling small trucks for Asia in  Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, but it has not had an  "Asia car" passenger car. Besides future anticipated growth of  the passenger car market in Southeast Asia, the price of  Japanese cars that use materials imported from Japan is becoming  relatively high with the high yen, and Toyota is trying to  develop a low-price car suitable for the Asian market by  lowering manufacturing costs 5 to 10 percent from the existing  level.    It will be produced by "Toyota Motor Thailand," the  manufacturing company in Thailand beginning in 1998, using the  "Tercel" or "Starlet" compact car as the base.    Toyota will procure parts from Toyota-affiliated engine and  transmission plants in the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) such as Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and  Indonesia, and at the same time as increasing the part domestic  production rate in the region, it will also hold down production  costs using local products for materials such as steel plate and  resin.    Honda, on the other hand, is developing an "Asia car" with  the existing "Civic" as the base. It appears that the overall  size will be somewhat smaller than the "Civic." Honda will  procure all parts in the whole Asian region except for Japan.  Indonesia or Thailand is favored for the assembly plant.    The Asia car is a car developed especially for the Asian  market. ASEAN has concluded a reciprocal complementary agreement  regarding part imports within the region, and using this, they  will locally procure parts in many nations, assemble and  manufacture it, and sell it widely in the Asian region. Among  Japanese carmakers, Nissan Motor considers the "AD Resort,"  which is an improved "AD Van," a special car for Asia, but it  still does not have a full-scale passenger car "Asia car."</p>

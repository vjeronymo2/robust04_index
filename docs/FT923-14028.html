			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (2): Rationalisation required - Banks and building societies compete fiercely for business THERE is certainly no lack of choice in financial services in Ireland. There are over 30 licenced banks and building societies, with five retail banks and five building societies offering some form of nationwide service. Competition for customers is fierce, the range of products wide, standards of personal service high but falling as the relentless drive for newer and more sophisticated technology continues. A noticeable feature of the market over the last six years has been the blurring of the lines between banks and building societies as each invaded the other's traditional territory in the hunt for business. Until about 1986, banks stuck to banking and building societies to their traditional role as providers of mortgages and high-interest savings accounts. But as the banks sought new lending opportunities they too began offering mortgages, and they now account for some 35 per cent of the total mortgage market. Bank of Ireland, the country's second largest retail bank, stole a march on its rivals with the purchase of the ICS Building Society in 1986. Now the so-called Big Four banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish and Ulster - each offer their own mortgage packages, though ICS does not compete with Bank of Ireland's mortgage business. 'The banks realised they had no service to offer when customers were making one of the most important decisions of their lives - buying a house,' says Mr Brian Wilson, AIB's group general manager for Ireland. We were simply not capitalising on a very warm customer relationship.' AIB now claims between 15 and 20 per cent of the mortgage market. However, for the Irish banks the expansion of the 1980s has not all been smooth. With the economy sluggish and heavily dependent on a move out of recession in its two main export markets in the UK and US, bad debts have risen and huge losses have been incurred by some banks on badly timed overseas expansions. The Bank of Ireland may have pulled off a coup by buying the ICS Building Society, but nothing it has bought since has been so rewarding. It followed AIB into the US banking market by buying First New Hampshire Bank (FNH), but so far has not earned a penny in return. In 1991 alone FNH lost IRPounds 76.6 million, up from IRPounds 60 million the previous year. The cost of the FNH acquisition is put at some Dollars 500 million to the Bank of Ireland so far. AIB, the country's biggest bank, is one of the few European banks to have bought a successful US bank. It owns First Maryland Bancorp, based in the Washington DC area, where the stability of its customer base has ensured consistent profitability. Bank of Ireland and AIB were for years seen as peas in a pod. When one moved, the other was bound to emulate it. This has stopped since the Bank of Ireland's purchase of FNH. In the intervening five years, AIB has grown to be about twice as big as its nearest rival in terms of market capitalisation. National Irish Bank, part of the National Australia Bank group, and Ulster Bank, owned by National Westminster of the UK, have established large branch networks throughout the country and now challenge for business in most of Ireland's large towns. They have now been joined by a fifth, the TSB Bank, formed at the beginning of June from the merger of Trustee Savings Bank Dublin and the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank. There was a neat dovetail between the branch networks of the two banks, which included the capital and the important southern market, taking in Cork and the rich Golden Vale farming area. Management of the building societies has traditionally been viewed in banking circles as sleepy and lacking in sufficient experience to challenge the banks in their own markets. But the building societies have not been idle. Stung by the banks' move into their traditional markets, they have fought back aggressively with new products. The market is dominated by five big societies, the Irish Permanent, First National, Irish Nationwide, Educational and ICS. The Irish Permanent is the biggest, with a mortgage book estimated at IRPounds 1.2 billion. It has recently made some key appointments, including Mr Peter Ledbetter from GPA Group as executive director and Mr Roy Douglas from AIB as chief operating officer. 'Certainly the banks' move into the mortgage market made us react,' says Mr Gerry Murphy, assistant general manager at the First National. 'They had a product which suited their customers. But I think it helped us to get out of the mindset that there was no competition for mortgages. I think we have fought back very well and are now competing very aggressively.' Competition has now shifted to the area of savings. Mr Murphy describes the competition for resources over the last two years as 'vicious.' Bankers are among the first to acknowledge that Ireland is severely overbanked. Subsidiaries of international banks such as ABN Amro, Citibank and BNP are fighting the large domestic banks for a share of the fiercely competitive corporate sector. They have gained some market share, notably in the food industry, but have been badly hit by the collapse of Goodman International and United Meat Packers, Ireland's two largest beef processors, which collapsed in 1990 and 1992 respectively. Consolidation within the financial services industry is seen as both inevitable and desirable over the next few years. Of the commercial banks, Bank of Ireland is generally regarded as the most vulnerable, especially if it cannot turn around FNH. Profits in the year to the end of March rose from Pounds 54m to Pounds 77m, but for the second successive year it has had to dip into reserves to pay its dividend. AIB reported profits of Pounds 186 million. 'There has to be rationalisation,' says Mr Jim Lacey, chief executive of National Irish Bank. He claims that his bank's Australian parent is committed to maintaining its presence in Ireland, but as the smallest of the retail banks it is also vulnerable. Among the building societies the drive towards plc status is expected to continue, though there is a clause preventing holdings above 15 per cent for five years. Mr Tony O'Connell, managing director of ICS, sees Irish societies following the UK trend and forging mergers within the sector. 'I've always been surprised that there have not been more mergers among the societies, which could have been achieved by a simple transfer of engagements. Size is important and becoming more so,' he says.  -------------------------------------------------------       HOW THE BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES COMPARE  ------------------------------------------------------- Building                  Total          Pre-tax societies                assets           profit                        IR poundsm    IR poundsm, 1991  ------------------------------------------------------- Irish Permanent           1,800            14.7 First National            1,223            11.1 Educational               1,095            12.9 ICS                         833            14.3 Irish Nationwide            507            14.1 Banks AIB                      18,248           185.8 Bank of Ireland          14.797            76.8 Ulster bank               4,342            44.3* National Irish              850            10.1  ------------------------------------------------------- *figures in sterling; includes N Ireland  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

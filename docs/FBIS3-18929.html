The ministry announced this in Duesseldorf in  Wednesday.    On Thursday, about 100 refugees from what remains of  Yugoslavia are to be flown from Duesseldorf to the Romanian  border airport of Timisoara, and then taken by bus to the  Serbian border. Three additional special flights have been  agreed on with the Romanian state airline Tarom for this month.  About 500 asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, criminals, and  refugees with expired residence permits are to be deported from  North Rhine-Westphalia to Serbia.</p>

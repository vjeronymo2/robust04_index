			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Allegation contradicts reality Sir, I would like to make a few comments with regard to Mr Iwanciw's letter (March 8) commenting on your editorial, 'Russia's backyard' (March 2). The letter proved once again that lack of information or deliberate ignoring of facts is the fertile soil for unfounded accusation. When published they can seriously mislead readers. The allegation that Russia is 'illegally dismembering Moldova' contradicts not only the reality but the Financial Times editorial which was applauded by Mr Iwanciw. It said that Russian troops 'are keeping fragile peace in Moldova'. The FT editorial also correctly stated that 'Russia undoubtedly has an overriding interest in preventing the spread of conflict to its south and west'. Moreover, we are interested in ending all armed conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union. At the request of some governments of new independent states Russia took the burden of peace-keeping operations. By calling for a United Nations mandate we do not seek any rights to intervene or any other special powers. We just believe that the expenses of these peace-keeping efforts ought to be shared as is the case in other regional conflicts where the UN is involved. As to the human rights of the Russian-speaking population in some former Soviet republics I would say that this is not as big an issue in Russian-Ukrainian relations as it is in our relations with Estonia and Latvia. And it is up to 9m Ukrainians to create schools in their language in Russia. There are no legal or any other obstacles to this. We are interested in positive discussions and solutions of problems when they arise, not in propaganda. Those days are gone.

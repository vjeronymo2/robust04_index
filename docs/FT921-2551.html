			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / BCCI investigator calls on Bush to sack campaign deputy manager A SENIOR member of Congress investigating the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair yesterday called on President George Bush to sack Mr James Lake, the deputy manager of the Bush re-election campaign, Alan Friedman reports from New York. Mr Lake also serves as US public relations adviser to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the key investment vehicles used by Sheikh Zayed Sultan Nahyan to hold majority control of BCCI. Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who has led the US Congress's investigation of the BCCI affair, said: 'I have to question the propriety of the President of the United States' campaign being managed by someone who is simultaneously being paid over Dollars 200,000 every three months to represent BCCI's biggest shareholder.' Mr Kerry, who held a BCCI hearing yesterday, said he did not know what services Mr Lake was providing to Abu Dhabi, but he said there was 'an appearance of impropriety here' and called on Mr Bush to ask Mr Lake to resign his position in the Bush campaign immediately. As a precedent, the Senator cited the example of Mr Ed Rogers, the former deputy to Mr John Sununu, former White House chief of staff. President Bush moved to distance himself from Mr Rogers last October when it emerged that the former Sununu aide had accepted a Dollars 600,000 contract to represent Sheikh Kemal Adham, the former head of Saudi intelligence and a key figure in the BCCI affair. 'To be blunt, Mr Lake should not be sitting in on White House campaign strategy meetings while he is also providing strategy to Sheikh Zayed on how to deal with problems arising out of his ownership of BCCI.' Senator Kerry said his committee had not drawn any conclusions about Sheikh Zayed's role in the BCCI affair. Mr Mark Helmke, a deputy to Mr Lake, confirmed that the public relations firm of Robinson, Lake, Lehrer and Montgomery is a registered foreign agent for the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and has advised Abu Dhabi on how to deal with the US media on BCCI-related issues. Mr Helmke said that Mr Lake's Abu Dhabi connection was reviewed by Mr Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, and was considered to be irrelevant before Mr Lake was named to the Bush campaign two months ago. Mrs Linda Robinson, the president of Robinson, Lake who is married to Mr Jim Robinson, chairman of American Express, said through a spokesperson that the Abu Dhabi relationship was handled through the firm's Washington office.</p>

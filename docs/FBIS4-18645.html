			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean Peyrelevade, new president of Credit </F> Lyonnais, by Elisabeth Chavelet and Laurence Masurel: "S.O.S.  Credit Lyonnais"]    [Text] [PARIS MATCH] Do you not believe that public opinion  is justly shocked by the announcement of the 7-billion-franc  [Fr] deficit in your 1993 accounts and the Fr20 billion which  the government has promised to pay in order to eliminate your  debts?    [Peyrelevade] The Credit Lyonnais is a large company. Its  recovery is essential for its customers, its shareholders, its  staff, and for Paris' reputation as a financial center. As for  the government, to whom I have to render homage, it had in fact  no other reasonable solution than to support us. I would refer  you to the banking law. This provides that, whenever a bank is  in difficulty, its shareholder or shareholders must do their  duty. Why should the state be the only shareholder to escape  this obligation? Moreover, it was for the government the best  way of protecting its investment.    [PARIS MATCH] Despite the recession and the property crisis,  France's two other major banks, the BNP [National Bank of Paris]  and the Societe Generale, posted profits of Fr1 billion and  Fr3.6 billion respectively. How do you justify a deficit of  Fr6.9 billion and reserves of almost Fr18 billion?    [Peyrelevade] At the origin of our losses, there is of  course  the economic recession. But all banks on the market are  suffering from this. The other explanation, which is much more  important, is specific to the Credit Lyonnais. In recent years,  this bank has been involved in ventures most of which were  carried out via subsidiaries, and following procedures which  have escaped the normal central control system. Reserves have  accumulated. On property deals. But on other types of business  too. I am thinking of the many majority participations taken in  enterprises of every kind, from garments to the distribution  industry and to golf courses... One ends up with such large  amounts that the Credit Lyonnais obviously does not have the  capacity, through its own operation, to make good the cost of  the past.    [PARIS MATCH] The government has decided not to punish your  predecessor. Have you shown similar clemency toward the  presidents of Credit Lyonnais subsidiaries who "escaped the  central control system?"    [Peyrelevade] I am not a court judge. But to make the Credit  Lyonnais once again into an exemplary bank, I must choose the  best professionals wherever they are found. Jean-Francois Henin  has left Altus, now under the management of Dominique Bazy, who  was with me at UAP [Paris Insurance Union]. The president of  SDBO [expansion unknown] is going to change. Other departures  have already taken place. I will continue, calmly, as long as  is necessary.    [PARIS MATCH] The Credit Lyonnais has stacked up Fr43  billion  of doubtful property loans, almost Fr5 billion of them to the  Pelege group alone. Is it not a little facile to get rid of the  problem by creating a property company, with the state taking  care of the losses for five years? Is this not a game of  hide-and-seek?    [Peyrelevade] There are no conjuring tricks. What is  imperative is to restore the quality of Credit Lyonnais balance  sheet. To do this, we are setting up a "defeasance" [as  published] company, in which we are transferring our troublesome  property loans. It is true that it is the state which will be  picking up the losses. This is a customary technique. It has  been used by the state in Sweden for larger amounts than those  involved at the Credit Lyonnais, and in order to restore private  banks to health. In France it has been used by both public and  private banks -- such as Banque Worms, the BIMP [Private  Industrial and Tranferable Securities Bank], Pallas Stern, the  Banque des Travaux Publics [Public Works Bank], and the Comptoir  des Entrepreneurs [Entrepreneurs Bank] -- and for amounts often  proportionately larger than our own. Why is this technique  used? Because, in order to keep one's loans on the balance  sheet, one has to set up reserves. The fact is that it is  strictly impossible to know in what amount, given the  uncertainties surrounding the present and future property  markets. We are therefore acting with wisdom and prudence. I  would add that we have agreed to review the situation with the  government in two years' time. If the Credit Lyonnais recovers  faster than expected, we will take back over part of the burden  of this property company.    [PARIS MATCH] Are you talking about privatizing the Credit  Lyonnais? If so, when will it take place?    [Peyrelevade] Privatization is dependent on the bank  returning to profitability. 1996 seems a good date to me.    [PARIS MATCH] You have inherited the Tapie file and the  billion francs which Credit Lyonnais has granted him. Many  corporate heads are surprised that, while refusing to grant them  credit, you accord favorable treatment to Bernard Tapie.    [Peyrelevade] As soon as one mentions Mr. Tapie, passions  rise so high that the information becomes distorted. It is true  that Credit Lyonnais' SDBO subsidiary lent him in my view too  much money. Since 1 December 1993, not only have we not lent him  one more cent, but our outstandings to his group are going to  reduce, as we have demanded sales mandates on several of his  assets: Terraillan, La Vie Claire, and the "Phocea." And that  is not all. I was of the opinion that the guaranties previously  taken by Credit Lyonnais were not satisfactory. Henceforward,  we have a guaranty which is legally sound, on all of Mr Tapie's  assets, including his private mansion and his furniture. I do  not think we are giving him a gift!    [PARIS MATCH] Your fellow bankers consider it normal that  the  state do its duty, but publicly, like the president of Societe  Generale, they say that, before asking for taxpayers' money,  they would like to see the Credit Lyonnais make a special effort  to find its way back to profitability. What austerity cure are  you preparing?    [Peyrelevade] I have already told personnel that general  expenses will not increase in 1994 and 1995. We are also  talking with the trade unions, as staffing levels will have to  be cut by 10 percent, or more than 3,500 people, over the next  three years in France. I have asked the 20 members of the  general management committee to accept a 10-percent pay cut in  return for promises of Credit Lyonnais shares. This will  demonstrate their confidence in the bank's ability to turn  itself around. Finally, Credit Lyonnais will sell Fr20 billion  of assets from its industrial and commercial portfolio.    [PARIS MATCH] How do you expect to sell Fr20 billion of  assets in two years? It is true that your listed participations  are worth between Fr5 and 10 billion. But elsewhere experts  believe that you are "stuck" with unlisted participations in the  Arnault, Ballor, and Pinault holding companies, which are  unsalable.    [Peyrelevade] We are first of all going to sell what is  liquid. This involves in particular our major customers. I have  spoken personally with all the presidents involved, and met with  a high degree of understanding everywhere. When we will have  improved our situation, we will return to them.    [PARIS MATCH] One of the conditions for the Credit Lyonnais'  recovery is for it to grant more credit to retail customers and  corporations. This requires lower French interest rates. Is  the Bank of France not overly cautious?    [Peyrelevade] It is a pity we do not do everything in our  power to lower interest rates. In particular I regret that  steps have not been taken to bring down regulated rates faster,  whether on A savings accounts, savings banks accounts, or  building society accounts.    [PARIS MATCH] Is it not dangerous to lower our rates if we  want to defend a strong franc, of which you are an ardent  defender?    [Peyrelevade] I am a partisan of tying the franc and the  mark  tightly together, but there is no reason whatsoever for the  franc to weaken today. Nowadays, the German economy is less  competitive than the French one. That ought to be explained  better to the markets. One could then lower rates more rapidly.    [PARIS MATCH] You talk of the markets. They appear to be  worried at the increase in French public deficits. Are they  right?    [Peyrelevade] We are approaching the danger zone in terms of  government deficits. It would be dangerous to go further. We  have to steer a careful course and begin to reduce these  gradually as the recovery picks up.</p>

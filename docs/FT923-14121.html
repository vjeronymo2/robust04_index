			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / India plans fraud office on UK model THE Indian government is planning to establish a 'Special Bureau of Frauds,' apparently modelled on Britain's Serious Fraud Office, to deal with scandals in banks and other financial institutions. This was announced yesterday, on the first day of parliament's monsoon session, by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who sought to calm agitated members of the opposition with assurance that the government would spare no efforts to investigate the Rs35bn (Pounds 636m) Bombay financial scandal, and punish the guilty. Facing a no-confidence motion, to be debated on July 15 and 16, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao is also considering establishing a joint parliamentary committee to look into India's worst securities scandal. While stressing that the frauds were 'in no way due to financial liberalisation', Mr Singh said that on the contrary, 'over-regulation of bank interest rates and an excessive pre-emption of bank resources into low-interest assets had contributed to some extent to bank managements looking to non-traditional banking activity to bolster profits.' Mr Singh admitted for the first time since the scandal surfaced that 'in retrospect, the Reserve Bank of India's supervisory functions were not as effective as they should have been'. The opposition has been pressing for dismissal of central bank governor S. Venkitaramanan. The finance minister acknowledged that 'a serious failure of internal control systems' in the banks involved had allowed transactions 'in flagrant and deliberate violation' of established rules and guidelines. To remedy this, Mr Singh said that his government was considering setting up 'a high-powered supervisory board, with four to five full-time members, with the governor, Reserve Bank of India, as the chairman'. The board's advisory council with eminent persons from banking, auditing, law, economics and management, would co-ordinate the work of supervision of banks and financial agencies, and would include surprise inspections. Mr Singh's announcements seemed to underline the government's confidence that no cabinet minister is involved in the scandal. Opposition leaders have been brandishing a list of names of six ministers they allege are involved in the scandal but have so far not substantiated their claims. Meanwhile Standard Chartered Bank yesterday fired five senior officials for their alleged involvement in the Bombay scandal following an internal investigation. Mr David Gardiner, acting chief executive of Standard Chartered India, regretted it had been found necessary to remove the officials, but said the bank was determined that those they felt accountable should pay the price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature comprising comments by State Duma deputy Sergey </F> Yushenkov and Russian Federation Minister of Nationalities  Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, plus unattributed  "Stop Press" paragraph under the general heading "Spring.  Bursting Buds and Coup Rumors": "Cui Bono?"]    [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (State Duma deputy):    The destabilization of society currently benefits those who  one way or another found themselves excluded from the State Duma  on 12 December. They are dreaming of revenge following the  October events. I wish to say that dozens of similar coup  theories are currently in circulation.    Judge for yourself: Why would Chernomyrdin want a coup when  he has more power than anyone else in the country? As for  Skokov, he's a busted flush.... And in general the very  selection of "coup participants" is so inconsistent! When I  heard about this I went up to Poltoranin and said: "How could  you dare to prepare such a coup?" He laughed: "If I'd been  doing the organizing I'd have done it properly...."    Sergey Shakhray (Russian federation minister):    I'm inclined to regard this as well-organized  disinformation.  Skillfully done, but not corresponding to reality. I think that  the main purpose of the "leak" is to increase the president's  suspicion toward his last political support (representatives of  virtually all political forces have been lumped together in the  circle of "conspirators") and bring discord into their  relationship.    Another purpose is to stir up society and clear the way in  the public mind for a third force. The result has been  achieved. It was professionally done -- you can sense the hand  of the Security Ministry or the Main Intelligence Directorate.  In my view the president himself has no interest in such a  "leak."    Stop Press: KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sources in the White House  have informed us that, according to the official story, the  White House telephones are silent because of repairmen who  inadvertently broke a cable. In their view it will take another  two days to repair the line.</p>

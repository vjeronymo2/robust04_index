			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> CURBSIDE TRASH RECYCLING  </P> <P> Beginning in October, the city will collect recyclable materials from 90-gallon  containers at residential curbsides.  </P> <P> The collection plan was approved unanimously at Tuesday's City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Under the new system, which will be phased in across the city over a year,  residents will not be required to sort recyclable materials. Plastics, glass,  metals and paper will be stored in a single container that will be emptied by a  truck twice a month.  </P> <P> The city will contract with an undetermined facility to sort and sell the  recyclable waste.  </P> <P> About 40% of Claremont residents already have refuse containers that can be  picked up by a truck; they will be asked to use those containers for  recyclables. Eventually 4,500 new containers for recyclables will be  distributed at a cost to residents of $6.50 each.  </P> <P> The collection system is expected to pay for itself when it is fully in place.  A recycling fee of 90 cents will be added to monthly utility bills to cover the  purchase of a second truck.  </P></p>

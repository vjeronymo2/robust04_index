			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency has decided on a new defense  concept which will replace the "Outline of the Defense Program"  as the basic defense policy for Japan. The key point of the  concept is that Japan will seek to strengthen its missile  defense system, looking toward the theater missile defense (TMD)  system being developed by the United States to deal with  ballistic missiles. The concept also looks at the question of  Japan's international contributions, such as participation in UN  peacekeeping operations (PK0). With respect to the organization  of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF], it proposes reducing the  number of ground personnel to less than 150,000. Thus, the  agency wants to depart from its past strategy of attaching  importance to the northern areas and of assuming Russia to be a  hostile nation. It also proposes putting the three services of  the SDF -- ground, naval, and air force -- under a combined  operations system.    In the spring, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to  activate a private advisory panel charged with studying the new  defense concept. For its part, the Defense Agency is studying  the concept of maintaining "basic defense capabilities" wherein  the defense capabilities in peacetime are contained at a  minimum, but can be reinforced in case of emergency. In other  words, Japan's defense capabilities should be lowered when  disarmament makes progress throughout the world and when the  factors of instability diminish in surrounding countries.    Specifically in reference to the defense system, the key  point of the concept lies in its measures against missiles.  When the current "Outline" was adopted in 1976, there was no  threat to Japan from medium-range ballistic missiles; hence, the  air-defense measures were drawn up assuming an invasion by  aircraft only. However, since then the DPRK (North Korea) has  successfully test-fired its "Nodong-1" missile, which Japan has  no capabilities to counter. As such, Japan now wants to state  its needs in the new defense concept, and improve its  interception system.    It is not yet certain whether Japan will provide  technological cooperation to the U.S. TMD project. In the  future, it wants to adopt an interceptor missile system like the  "THAAD" [Theater High Altitude Area Defense"] system which is  far, far superior to the Patriot missile.    Provisions on the SDF's participation in PKO activities are  currently presented in a clause under the heading of  miscellaneous rules within Article 100 of the SDF Law. There  have been complaints saying "the troops' morale cannot be high  when they are employed under miscellaneous rules." Hence, the  agency wants to upgrade PKO missions in the law to the level of  primary missions by removing the provisions in Article 3 which  set forth the missions of the SDF. That being the case, the  agency also finds it necessary to make a clear statement on this  point in the new defense concept.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- During his testimony to the  first criminal division of Berlin Regional Court today, Bernd  Schmidbauer, state minister at the German Chancellery, said that  an attempt was made to prevent the trial surrounding the attack  that took place at the Mykonos restaurant. Schmidbauer said  Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian had made this  unreasonable request to him during talks in October 1993.  Schmidbauer, who is responsible for secret service  coordination, therefore confirmed the talks with Fallahian,  which he had previously disputed, on the background to an attack  on 17 September 1992 during a Socialist International congress,  in which four exiled Iranian politicians were murdered.    During persistent questioning Schmidbauer said he had  categorically rejected the Iranian's proposal as it was the job  of independent judges in Berlin to rule on the case. He had  also said there would be a period of frosty relations between  the two states if it emerged that Iran was behind the attack.  The case continues.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FCC CHAIRMAN WHO CAUSED STATIC WITH CONGRESS RESIGNS  </P> <P> Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dennis R. Patrick has submitted his  resignation to the White House but will remain in his post until a replacement  is named, the agency said today.  </P> <P> Patrick's resignation had been widely expected after the Bush Administration  came into office. The controversial former California attorney had battled  frequently with Congress on his deregulatory approach during his two years as  head of the commission.  </P> <P> A replacement for Patrick, 37, was not immediately announced.  </P> <P> FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said Patrick hand-carried the letter of  resignation to the White House on Tuesday. Patrick gave the letter to Chase  Untermeyer, who is White House personnel director.  </P> <P> A number of names have been mentioned as possible replacements for Patrick,  including Sherrie Marshall, a former Patrick aide at the FCC who was on loan to  the White House during the unsuccessful confirmation proceedings for Defense  Secretary-designate John Tower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Replacements  </P> <P> Washington attorneys Susan Wing and Jim Smith have also been mentioned, along  with Alfred Sikes, head of the Commerce Department's National  Telecommunications and Information Administration.  </P> <P> Patrick's term was to run until June, 1992. He was named an FCC commissioner in  December, 1983, after working in the White House personnel office. He succeeded  former FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler in April, 1987.  </P> <P> Since that time, the FCC has repealed the Fairness Doctrine that required  broadcasters to air programs on controversial issues, and it dramatically  changed the way in which the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. establishes  its long-distance rates.  </P> <P> Patrick more than two years ago proposed the so-called price cap plan for  AT&amp;T to replace the FCC's 20-year-old rate-of-return regulatory philosophy,  and he succeeded in having the commission adopt it last month after a steady  war of words with critics in Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deregulatory Approach  </P> <P> Under Patrick, the commission also has moved to change the way broadcasters are  licensed and generally has followed the deregulatory approach that was  established during the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> The commission has been at less than full strength since early last year.  Nominations to fill the vacant two seats on the five-member commission had been  held up because of Senate displeasure with Patrick's policies.  </P> <P> There was no immediate response to Patrick's resignation from fellow  Commissioners James H. Quello and Patricia Diaz Dennis.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kan Kato, chairman of the government Tax Commission  (prime minister's advisory panel), and Sakuei Matsumoto, deputy  chairman of the commission, paid a call on Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on the evening of 1 June, and urged him to go all  out for administrative reform to give a big push to the tax  system reform efforts. The prime minister showed strong  ambition of completing plans on administrative reform by the  target of the end of June, saying "We would like to come up with  objectives and target dates (for administrative reform of  central and local governments)."    In connection with the public utilities rates, a planned  hike  of which has recently been frozen by the government, the prime  minister said, "We have to review organizations." He is  believed to have made this remark in reference to Japan Highway  Public Corporation and other special status corporations. It is  likely that the question of making a drastic change of the  organization of the special status corporations will come on the  agenda of the government discussions with respect to the  administrative reform.    In a news conference following the meeting with Hata,  Chairman Kato said he had asked the prime minister, "Could you  not formulate administrative reform five-year plans for central  and local governments?" To that question, the prime minister  replied, "I would like to come up with some kind of policy by  the time the commission comes up with its recommendation." In  addition, according to Kato, the prime minister said, "There  should be no sacred areas (for administrative reform)." Hata  thus showed his willingness to study the question of  reorganizing the special status corporations and the issue of  the number of local government officials.    Asked further about the special status corporations,  Chairman  Kato said, "I would be lying if I said he did not quote specific  names." Prime Minister Hata apparently cited some names and  talked about the intention of taking actions to reorganize them.  Speaking on this issue, the prime minister also was quoted to  have said, "When the freeze on the public utility rates is  lifted eventually, we must ensure that the scale of a raise is  kept to a minimum." He thus indicated that he would take active  actions to study the question of reorganizing the special status  corporations, which had intended to raise their utility charges.    Regarding a tax system reform that will feature the easing  of  individuals' income taxes and the raising of consumption tax,  the government Tax Commission and the ruling parties'  Consultative Committee on Tax System Reform are due to complete  concrete plans by the end of June. It appears that Prime  Minister Hata wants to give a push to the tax reform program by  coming up with administrative reform plans by that time as well.</p>

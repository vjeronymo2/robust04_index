			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Islamic extremism haunts Egypt's elite: The deaths of 13 people have deepened concern about militancy ISLAMIC extremists in Egypt recently called for the demolition of Cairo's observation tower on Gezira island in the Nile on the grounds that it resembled a giant phallus and was therefore detrimental to public morality. Egypt's intellectuals chortle over these sorts of pronouncements and wonder whether the country's famed Pharonic obelisks may not be the next target of fundamentalist wrath. At the same time they worry about the restless Islamic tide that yields such strange views. Debate has sharpened in recent months in the dusty Nile-side salons of the bourgeoisie and on university campuses among a frustrated elite about the best way to combat the more irrational impulses of the Islamic tendency. Criticism of the government's handling of the problem is pervasive. Mr Milad Hannah, a professor of engineering at Ain Shams university in Cairo, decries official policy which seeks to co-opt the Islamic trend by making the government appear more Islamic than the Islamicists. Under government sponsorship, Mr Hannah says, 'Egypt is a very good candidate for Islamic fundamentalism. It is on the road to fundamentalism.' Increased anxiety among the elite stems particularly from the upheavals in Algeria after the success of an Islamic party in the polls; from the recent case in Egypt of a novelist sentenced to prison for blasphemy against Islam and also from a worrying incidence of Moslem attacks against Christians and Christian property, including the sectarian violence in Upper Egypt this week in which 13 people were killed. Mr Hannah, like other prominent Egyptian writers on the subject, believe that the government's information and education policies are playing into the hands of Islamic militants by allowing the public media to be used to 'sell Islam' in the hope that 'official Islam', what he describes as 'mufti Islam', will submerge the 'unofficial' version. At the same time, the authorities resort to oppression, including detention without trial under the emergency laws, to curb Islamic groups. This 'carrot and stick' approach has enabled the government thus far to keep the lid on Islamic militancy, but many Egyptian commentators question this strategy as a long-term panacea. Ms Hala Mustapha, an expert on Islam at Al Ahram Strategic Studies Centre, believes that fewer television hours should be devoted to Islamic themes; that the education system should be reformed to lessen emphasis on Islamic teaching; that the great Islamic teaching university of Al Azhar should be opened to more liberal ideas; and, perhaps most important, that real public debate should be allowed in the mass media between the Islamicists and secularists. Ms Mustapha cites the recent example of a stirring discussion between the two sides at the Cairo book fair where voices for and against the separation of church and state were raised in a spirited and for the most part good-natured debate; but barely a word of this discussion filtered into the government-controlled media. Mr Farag Foda, a participant in the book fair debate and a frequent and outspoken critic of Islamic militancy, believes that the best way for the government to combat the extremists is to open the air waves to debate. 'Media and education are the long-run way to avoid a confrontation,' he says. Mr Foda and others say the importance of radio and television in a country where the rate of illiteracy is 70 per cent cannot be underestimated, but broadcasting policy remains rooted in the past with the government apparently fearful of relaxing its vice-like grip on programming. Meanwhile, disaffected youth despairing of finding work - unemployment is above 20 per cent - seek solace in religion, but not the variety espoused officially: rather, they gravitate towards zawyias, literally 'corners' (rooms or areas set aside in private houses) where fundamentalists spread their message that militant Islam is 'the solution' to the country's ills. 'The zawyias are deep in the lanes and hearts of Egyptians,' says Mr Hannah. 'There, people listen to another type of Islam, fundamentalist Islam which preaches violence, hatred of Christians and Jihad (Holy War).' To the perennial question: whether militant Islam in Egypt is again on one of its periodic upswings there appears no consensus. Mr Foda believes it is not, but he cautions that the government cannot afford to be complacent, especially at a time when International Monetary Fund-inspired price increases are causing widespread hardship. Secularists have been heartened by the sterner tone adopted recently by President Hosni Mubarak towards Islamic extremists. They hope this reveals the beginning of an awareness of the real challenge faced by the authorities. The mainstream Islamic movement in Egypt, the Moslem Brotherhood, meanwhile bides its time, apparently convinced that it remains the only alternative to the established order.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Door to 1997 single currency left open EU finance ministers yesterday left open the door for a move to a single European currency in 1997 with a carefully-couched endorsement of the current wide fluctuation bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The 1997 date for the creation of a monetary union in Europe is still viewed as a remote possibility only, but the decision in Brussels yesterday underlined political commitment to the Emu project. The 15 per cent fluctuation bands were introduced as a temporary measure after the currency crisis in 1992-93 which forced several devaluations and the departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM. The wider bands have so far helped to deter similar speculative assaults. In a joint statement yesterday, EU finance ministers studiously avoided declaring that the present arrangements were 'normal'. One of the key provisions of the Maastricht treaty is that a currency seeking to join Emu must have been inside its so-called normal bands for at least two years. Instead, ministers agreed to endorse an opinion on the wide bands drawn up by the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the future European central bank which is supposed to supervise the single currency. The EMI noted that the wider bands had prevented big exchange rate depreciations and excessive exchange rate intervention with their potentially inflationary consequences. 'In the light of this experience and in the current circumstances, the EMI council considers it advisable to maintain the present arrangements.' Mr Waigel resolutely refused to say whether the 15 per cent bands would continue right up to the point of a decision on whether to move to a single currency, or whether ministers would support a progressive narrowing of the bands. Instead, he reaffirmed the need for price stability and sound public finances which would avoid exchange rate stability. The August 1993 decision to suspend intervention obligations and introduce 15 per cent fluctuation bands had succeeded, he said. The other important criteria for moving to a single currency are that government budget deficits fall to 3 per cent or less of gross domestic product, and that government debt falls consistently towards a target of 60 per cent of GDP. Though 1997 remains a highly ambitious target, many observers are reassessing the possibility of a move by a privileged few currencies led by the D-Mark to monetary union in 1999. However, public opinion in France, Germany and the UK among the main European economies remains divided. The European Commission pressed for a statement on the wide bands to keep hopes alive that the 1997 date for Emu could be met, arguing that it was important not weaken the provisions of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Making CGT work for you - Philip Coggan considers the pros and cons of a new tax-efficient investment trust THE ANNUAL capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 is one of the great unexploited tax breaks. Scottish fund management group Ivory &amp; Sime will launch a new investment trust in May which will use the CGT allowance to offer investors a 7 per cent tax-free income, paid monthly. Investors in the trust - Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS - will earn their income by monthly sales of shares. Over the long term, the stock market tends to rise at a rate greater than 7 per cent. Thus, Ivory &amp; Sime believes investors can receive their income without depleting their capital long term. If investors have not used up their CGT allowance elsewhere, this monthly income plan is highly tax-efficient. A basic-rate taxpayer who gets Pounds 5,800 of dividend income will pay Pounds 1,160 in tax; the higher rate-payer will pay Pounds 2,320. But there is no tax to pay on the first Pounds 5,800 of capital gains. Put another way, this 7 per cent income is equivalent to 9.33 per cent gross from the building society for basic rate-payers. Another point in favour of the monthly income plan is that there are no initial or annual charges; nor are there any dealing costs when selling shares. And the trust does not need to invest in high-yielding (and possibly low-quality) stocks for investors to earn their income. ISIS will buy growth stocks in the FT-SE 350 index and will have a below-average portfolio yield, giving scope for capital growth. One potential snag is that the steady sale of shares by income investors will create an ever-widening discount. But I&amp;S hopes to get round this through its monthly savings scheme, which will offer a loyalty bonus (in the form of warrants) for those who put money away for a full year. It hopes the added value provided by the warrants will lure enough people into the savings scheme to provide a regular demand for shares and eliminate the discount problem. Like the monthly income plan, there are no initial or annual charges. The savings plan does not pay income but, for those who are likely to pay CGT, there is a Pep option at no extra charge. Those who buy shares in the trust will receive no conventional dividend income. Instead, the future dividend income stream is being sold to institutions in the form of convertible annuity shares, with a seven-year life. There are two advantages to this structure. The first is that the sale of the future income stream generates cash up-front which immediately boosts the asset value of the ordinary shares. The second is that the annuity shares absorb Ivory &amp; Sime's annual management charge. It all sounds too good to be true, so what could go wrong? If there were to be a repeat of Black Monday, or a prolonged bear market, investors could find they were rapidly eating up capital to provide their income. This could also occur if I&amp;S managed the portfolio badly and underperformed the market substantially. The existence of the warrants will also have a dilutive effect on the net asset value per share performance - but Ivory &amp; Sime argues that, since the warrants are available only to monthly savings investors, the dilution will be small. Probably the biggest question is whether the structure will work and enough monthly savings plan investors will be found to buy the shares sold by the monthly income investors. If that does not happen, shares will have to be sold at a discount to pay the income, which could erode investors' capital. Still, this is an ingenious, low-cost and tax-efficient scheme. As Robin Angus of County NatWest has argued, investors should concentrate on total return rather than aiming for high income alone. This trust gives them a way of doing so. You could argue about whether it can be classified as a split capital trust. What is certainly true is that there are no classes of shares with a prior claim on its assets; thus, the ordinary shares represent a 'clean' investment. Full details of the trust will not be available until next month but a helpline is open on 0800-441 441.</p>

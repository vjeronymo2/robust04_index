			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (3): The route to Atlantic discounts - Case Study of Lilliput Lane FOR TOO many chief executives of small and medium-sized companies, a travel policy goes no further than asking a secretary to book a hotel and an aeroplane ticket. This is both inefficient and expensive. The competition currently gripping the airline and hotel industries has flushed out plenty of bargain deals aimed at businessmen, who have the reputation of being frequent travellers with generous budgets. Mr John Russell runs Lilliput Lane, a Penrith-based company with a turnover of Pounds 12m. Its business is manufacturing small model houses - English country cottages, Scottish castles and the like - for the gift and collectables market. There is a growing demand for such decorative accessories, especially in the US, and turnover has grown steadily in the 10 years of trading. Around 30 per cent of sales are overseas, mainly to the US, which means that Mr Russell travels the Atlantic every other month. Until 1989 travel was arranged on an ad hoc basis but then, through social contacts, he signed up with North Shields based specialists Dawson Sanderson, through which he now funnels all his travel and accommodation needs. Lilliput Lane gets discounts on its travel - and a much more efficient service personally handled by a senior executive in the travel agency. Lilliput Lane is a beneficiary of the arrival of new US carriers flying the Atlantic, in particular American Airlines. Since its arrival over two years ago, it has attempted to build up regular clients by offering companies like Lilliput Lane discount deals, which are unavailable on British Airways for companies of this size. Mr Russell spends around Pounds 150,000 of his total annual travel budget of Pounds 250,000 on crossing the Atlantic and touring the US, mainly flying from Manchester. By hitting fixed expenditure targets, he qualifies for discounts on American Airlines which can be taken in the form of free tickets. The fact that the deal covers travel inside the US helps boost his mileage. He could use the bonus for upgrades, but prefers to stay in business class. Sometimes junior executives fly economy on the bonus tickets. On routes to Europe and south-east Asia, where competition is less intense, there are fewer opportunities to save money. Mr Russell has discovered, through Dawson Sanderson, that discounts are readily available in hotels. So intense is the competition in the US that savings of up to 50 per cent can usually be found in the cities he visits on business. The agency uncovers the best room rates. Of course on arrival individual hotels, now often run on a franchise basis, would probably be prepared to offer even greater discounts if there are rooms available. But most businessmen do not want to get involved in haggling at the desk. Dawson Sanderson acts as a catalyst for Lilliput Lane. It is the go-between on the arrangement between the company and American Airlines, but Lilliput Lane also shares in the discounts that the travel agency obtains through its contacts and working arrangements with other carriers flying to Europe, south-east Asia and elsewhere. So there are one-to-one deals and general discounts to be gained from the relationship. Another tangible benefit for Lilliput Lane is that its employees can enjoy savings on their holiday travel by booking through Dawson Sanderson - the service covers the entire workforce. And all this costs nothing. Dawson Sanderson takes its profit from the carriers and the hotels. Indeed, Mr Russell is starting to receive discounts from the travel agency in recognition of the amount of business he is putting its way. Mr George Paton, who runs Dawson Sanderson, acknowledges that the business travel agency world is becoming as competitive as the transatlantic air trade and that loyal clients should enjoy some of the benefits from the deals available.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sir Teddy Taylor, British Conservative </F> member of Parliament, by Marc Rozen in London; date not given:  "On the British Veto Against Jean-Luc Dehaene"]    [Text] [Rozen] What is your reaction to John Major's veto?    [Taylor] John Major was right to oppose the offensive  launched by Germany and France. Messrs Kohl and Mitterrand  produced this candidate out of their hat at the last minute, a  few days before the opening of the Corfu summit. They wanted to  impose him on the other partners by presenting them with a fait  accompli.    We are seeing a growth in Euroskepticism in Great Britain.  The action of the European Union is being openly criticized,  its failure to solve major problems is obvious for all to see,  and its constant interference in the national life of my country  is contemptuous. John Major considered, and rightly so, that he  had to take a stand against such an imposition. He must again  use his veto if we are presented with a candidate such as  Dehaene, who is unacceptable.    [Rozen] Is not Great Britain totally isolated within the  Twelve?    [Taylor] No. The Community must be a free association, not  controlled by the center, and which encourages subsidiarity. If  we had to be helped to leave the Union, I am sure many people  would welcome this decision. The Community is a totally  discredited organization, incapable of meeting the major  challenges such as unemployment, encouraged by dangerous devices  such as the European Monetary System, its expenditure is out of  all control, its lifestyle extravagant, and its debt dramatic.    [Rozen] With his weak parliamentary majority, is not John  Major your virtual prisoner?    [Taylor] Our small group of Euroskeptics is no longer the  only one to be flying the anti-Maastricht flag. We represent a  majority within the Conservative party. The Europhiles, who  currently have fewer than 30 members in the Parliament, are in a  minority. They are keeping quiet. They have said nothing about  Mr. Major's veto. That is proof that our point of view has  finally won the day.    [Rozen] Is not Mr. Dehaene an ideal scapegoat for an  unpopular prime minister such as John Major?    [Taylor] At the Maastricht negotiations, the Belgians did  everything they could to prevent us from obtaining the monetary  and social opt-out clauses. They are unrepentant federalists  who want everything to be controlled from Brussels by a  nonelected Commission. We saw that under the Belgian presidency.    [Rozen] Who would fit the bill for the next Commission  president?    [Taylor] An accountant or an international businessman who  manages the extravagant expenditure of an organization which  squanders the money of the British taxpayer.    [Rozen] Why does Great Britain behave as if it was the black  sheep of the Twelve?    [Taylor] The latest European elections benefitted the  anti-Maastricht protest candidates. A dismal campaign has  produced resounding results, changing the landscape in the  principal countries. This was a striking and welcome example of  the crisis of a Europe which is reaping what it has sown.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, leader of the Krajina Serbs, </F> by Ratko Koprivica on 30 March; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Martic] We have truly invested the maximum effort  and honesty in this agreement, and we intend to observe it to  the maximum. If Croatia does the same....[pauses] However it  should not use the same things as it has used in the past, such  as not observing the Erdut Agreement, then I believe that we  shall soon be able to establish all other relations.    The next step would involve the demarcation line; therefore,  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] troops will be deployed along  the entire border; in those of our villages where UNPROFOR is  stationed we will have our police, our authority. Croatian  villages will be under Croatian authority. The demarcation line  will have a 1 km width. However, UNPROFOR also has the mandate  to control 20 km of territory within Croatia, and this is very  significant. It is very important that, in addition to the  UNPROFOR forces, we also have the involvement of U.S. and  Russian diplomacy, which is a guarantee that this agreement will  be fully observed.    [Koprivica] Since you have mentioned diplomacy, what does  the Zagreb agreement mean for the Krajina in an international  context?    [Martic] It means a lot. The fact that two of the most  powerful forces -- the United States and Russia -- are  participating in it, constitutes, in a certain way, the  recognition of the republic of Serbian Krajina, acceptance of us  as a reality, a state with its territory, authorities, and  population. What remains is international recognition, and I  believe that in the next phase we will be able to achieve this.  Therefore, it is no longer the case that we are being treated  only as local authorities -- which has been the case in the past  -- but as an equal party to a conflict, as in the case of two  states.</p>

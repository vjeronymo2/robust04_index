			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said yesterday  that Israel holds Iran responsible for the fate of captive  navigator Ron Arad. As recalled, in reply to a question posed  by an IDF radio correspondent, the Iranian foreign minister  denied that any Israeli prisoners are being held on Iranian  soil. Iran is now officially denying that its foreign minister  ever spoke to a Zionist correspondent. Our correspondent Eyal  Eisenstein spoke with Foreign Minister Peres:    [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres was skeptical with regard to Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati's statements on the issue of the Israeli POW's  and MIA's. Yesterday, Peres said that Israel still considers  Iran responsible for the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad.    [Peres] Iran's word carries no particular weight. Iran has  no problem with making up or denying stories, without any  foundation. Therefore, regardless of this or that statement, we  shall continue to regard Iran as the main party responsible for  the fate of Ron Arad. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dewhirst doubles to Pounds 7m and raises pay-out by 63% Dewhirst Group, the supplier of clothing to Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer, increased its interim pay-out to shareholders by 63 per cent yesterday as it announced profits had doubled to Pounds 7m. Mr Scott Beattie, finance director, said the profits growth was mainly the result of higher volumes and better productivity. This had helped to increase trading margins from 3.8 per cent to 6 per cent. 'Last year was a year of getting sales growth and this was a year of making use of it,' he said. Sales for the 26 weeks to July 15 rose by 23 per cent from Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 117m. As a result of the substantially improved performance, the dividend was increased from 0.4p to 0.65p. Earnings were almost doubled to 3.63p. Both the ladies' wear and men's wear divisions had performed strongly during the first half, said Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman. Reorganisation of the children's wear operation, which incurred losses last year, was now also largely complete. This business was expected to break even in 1994. Mr Dewhirst said prices were not expected to rise this year. There remained some uncertainty, however, given the pressure of hardening cotton prices. Mr Dewhirst said he was confident the company would continue to make progress in 1994. In the past 12 months, Dewhirst had increased its market share both on the high street and in Marks and Spencer, which accounts for about 85 per cent of its sales. 'Our efforts are focused at improving operating margins,' he said. Dewhirst has said it aims to get trading margins up to 7 per cent by 1996. Higher profits and improved cashflow helped Dewhirst to reduce its net interest payments from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds 121,000.</p>

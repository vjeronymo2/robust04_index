			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / People: Former Securiguard duo move into Business Technology Group Alan Baldwin, former chairman of Securiguard before it was acquired by Rentokil this summer, has been appointed chairman and chief executive of Business Technology Group, which sells and services office equipment. He succeeds Tony Berry, founder and former chairman of Blue Arrow, who has resigned from BTG to pursue private interests but retains his 8 per cent interest in the group. Baldwin says he and Peter Dunckley, former finance director of Securiguard who is also joining BTG, had been approached as a team by Tony Berry and his board. He says he sees BTG as a 'platform from which to develop in the service sector'. He will, however, be somewhat restricted in his areas of operation by an agreement with Rentokil which lasts until the end of 1994, but says 'there are opportunities'. Baldwin's defence against Rentokil's cash bid earned him a number of friends in City institutions who watched Securiguard's share price rise from 180p before the bid, to the 345p at which it was recommended. In July Baldwin accepted a Pounds 375,000 settlement from Rentokil after the Pounds 76m takeover and said it was his intention to acquire companies. A non-executive director, Bernard Goodall, has resigned and a replacement for him will be appointed in due course. BTG's share price rose 4p to 23p.</p>

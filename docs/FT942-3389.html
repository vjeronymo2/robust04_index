			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Clients lash out at professionals Professionals overcharge and provide a generally poor service to their clients, says a survey of companies' views published yesterday. Only half of nearly 200 small companies felt accountants provided a useful letter to management to accompany the annual audit, according to a survey sponsored by Levy Gee, the accountancy firm. Just 19 per cent of businesses felt their bankers offered value for money, while half expressed dissatisfaction over value from their solicitors and 43 per cent from their accountants. Few advisers explained adequately how their fees were calculated, and accountants' charges were singled out for the most criticism. One respondent said there were often 'too many round figures for comfort'. One company reported that accountants are 'patronisingly expensive and tend to try and blind one with jargon'. Another complained that they 'continually search for angles to overcharge'. Bankers and solicitors were criticised for failing to keep clients up-to-date with important developments. Three-quarters of companies surveyed believed that their bankers did not understand their business sector, compared with two-thirds for solicitors and 43 per cent for accountants. Two-fifths of bankers met expectations for quality and deadlines, compared with 62 per cent of solicitors and 70 per cent of accountants. Only three-quarters of the companies felt senior bankers were easily accessible. Nearly all felt that executives and partners in law and accountancy practices were easily accessible. Levy Gee concluded that advisers needed to anticipate what customers required and be more active in helping businesses develop plans. The firm urged professionals to be more open about fees and charges, and to adopt a flexible approach when companies are struggling.

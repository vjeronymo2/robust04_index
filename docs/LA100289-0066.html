			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ITALIAN COMPANY MAKING UP FOR LOST HALF-CENTURY  </P> <P> Although France is considered the cradle of ballet, the cornerstones of  classical dance were actually laid in Italy centuries before Louis XIV  established the Royal Academy of Dancing in Paris in 1661. A basic manual  written by Renaissance dance master Guglielmo Ebreo of Pesaro for the  15th-Century Italian courts still serves as a valuable primer for today's  dancers.  </P> <P> Ironically, Italian ballet has been almost dormant during the 20th Century.  Italy's reputation as the mecca for opera notwithstanding, the last place that  springs to mind for world-class ballet is the country of its origin. Italy's  first serious ballet company -- Aterballetto -- did not even take root until  1979, as the company's executive director, Roberto Giovanardi, acknowledged in  a recent telephone interview from Italy.  </P> <P> "Nothing was happening until this company started professional ballet. No one  was doing ballet outside of the opera companies or the (ballet) schools. There  was no permanent ballet company," he said.  </P> <P> Since then, Aterballetto's reputation in the international ballet world has  grown by leaps and bounds. Dance Magazine proclaimed it "Italy's first national  ballet." And when Clive Barnes reviewed the company's American debut in the New  York Post four years ago, he observed that it clearly revealed "the first signs  of another Italian renaissance." Nonetheless, the dance troupe has never  performed in Southern California.  </P> <P> Yet, that fact was no deterrent to the San Diego Foundation for the Performing  Arts, even after last year's disaster with "no-name" dance events. The local  arts organization will begin its 1989-90 season with a pair of performances by  Aterballetto at 8 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday at the Spreckels Theatre.  </P> <P> Why did the foundation decide to stage another possibly risky event, after the  poor response to last year's series nearly wiped out the organization? Founder  Danah Fayman answered emphatically.  </P> <P> "Everyone wants somebody else to take a chance," she said. "That's always a  problem. But before we decided, we called people who have presented them (in  America). Their recommendations were all unqualified. They all said they wanted  to bring Aterballetto back again, and the reviews have been good. You still  never know how they're going to do here, of course. You have to go on  instinct."  </P> <P> The 22-member troupe, sponsored by the Assn. of Theaters of the Emilia Romagna  region of northern Italy, was founded by Amedeo Amodio, who remains at the helm  after 10 years, although he retired as a dancer five years ago.  </P> <P> Like the Joffrey Ballet (to which the Aterballetto has been favorably compared  by American critics), the company has an eclectic repertory that draws from the  full spectrum of ballet styles. It also boasts a highly acclaimed group of  dancers, with an average age of only 20. According to Aterballetto's publicity  material, the company dances more than 130 concerts in Italy alone every year.  </P> <P> Even in its homeland, however, Aterballetto is eclipsed by its sister arts,  particularly the prestigious opera.  </P> <P> "Over the last 10 years, there has been some growth in regional (ballet)  companies, but the government spends its money first on the opera, then on  drama and concerts, and if something remains, it goes to the ballet,"  Giovanardi noted.  </P> <P> "Our income is around $2.5 million, but only about 10% comes from (government)  support," he pointed out, adding that most of the rest of the income comes from  performances. He said the opera receives a 90% subsidy and the symphony a 70%  subsidy.  </P> <P> In spite of the economic shortfall from public funding, Aterballetto continues  to make impressive strides and to aspire to even greater heights.  </P> <P> "We want to be a little company with big ballets," Giovanardi said with a  laugh. "We want to fill the gap between the great ballets -- the 'Giselles' --  and the Pina Bausch and Jerome Robbins. Italy missed 50 years of ballet, and we  want to make up for that." He said the company is trying to get "Fancy Free,"  the all-American masterpiece by Robbins.  </P> <P> In the early years, Aterballetto had to import half of its dancers. Now, nearly  all are home-grown. And the high standard of dancing in the troupe earns kudos,  even in major dance centers.  </P> <P> All but two of the seven works that will be performed in San Diego were  choreographed by Amodio, who was trained in Italy and has worked with ballet  greats like George Balanchine, Anthony Tudor and Glenn Tetley. His diverse  repertory includes works by Alvin Ailey, Kenneth MacMillan and Margo  Sappington.  </P> <P> The troupe is expected to open its concert Tuesday with a sunny suite of dances  by the celebrated Danish choreographer August Bournonville, staged for the  company by his compatriot, Peter Schaufuss.  </P></p>

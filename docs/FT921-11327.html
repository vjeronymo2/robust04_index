			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / World leaders optimistic on future: UN declaration The following is an edited version of the final declaration approved by 15 world leaders at the first-ever Security Council summit yesterday: The members of the Security Council consider that their meeting is a timely recognition of the fact that there are new, favourable international circumstances under which the Security Council has begun to fulfil more effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Time of change This meeting takes place at a time of momentous change. The ending of the Cold War has raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and more humane world. Last year, under the authority of the United Nations, the international community succeeded in enabling Kuwait to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity, which it had lost as a result of Iraqi aggression. The resolutions adopted by the Security Council remain essential to the restoration of peace and stability in the region and must be fully implemented. At the same time the members of the Council are concerned by the humanitarian situation of the innocent civilian population of Iraq. Members of the Council support the Middle East peace process, facilitated by the Russian Federation and the United States, and hope it will be brought to a successful conclusion on the basis of Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The members of the Council note that United Nations peace-keeping tasks have increased and broadened considerably in recent years. Election monitoring, human rights verification and the repatriation of refugees have in the settlement of some regional conflicts, at the request or with the agreement of the parties concerned, been integral parts of the Security Council's effort to maintain international peace and security. They welcome these developments. The members of the Council also recognise that change, however welcome, has brought new risks for stability and security. The international community therefore faces new challenges in the search for peace. All member states expect the United Nations to play a central role at this crucial stage. The members of the Council stress the importance of strengthening and improving the United Nations to increase its effectiveness. Commitment to collective security The members of the Council pledge their commitment to international law and to the United Nations Charter. All disputes between states should be peacefully resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. The members of the Council reaffirm their commitment to the collective security system of the Charter to deal with threats to peace and to reverse acts of aggression. The members of the Council express their deep concern over acts of international terrorism and emphasise the need for the international community to deal effectively with all such acts. Peace-making and peace-keeping To strengthen the effectiveness of these commitments .. the members of the Council have decided on the following approach. They invite the secretary-general to prepare, for circulation to the members of the United Nations by 1 July 1992, his analysis and recommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient within the framework and provision of the charter the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and for peace-keeping. Secretary-general's analysis and recommendations could cover the role of the United Nations in identifying potential crises and areas of instability as well as the contribution to be made by regional organisations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter in helping the work of the Council. They could also cover the need for adequate resources, both material and financial. The secretary-general might draw on lessons learned in recent United Nations peace-keeping missions to recommend ways of making more effective Secretariat planning and operations. He could also consider how greater use might be made of his good offices, and of his other functions under the United Nations Charter. Disarmament, arms control and weapons of mass destruction The members of the Council underline the need for all member states to fulfil their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament; to prevent the proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction; to avoid excessive and destabilising accumulations and transfers of arms; and to resolve peacefully in accordance with the Charter any problems concerning these matters threatening or disrupting the maintenance of regional and global stability. They emphasise the importance of the early ratification and implementation by States concerned of all international and regional arms control arrangements, especially the START and CFE Treaties. The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The members of the Council commit themselves to working to prevent the spread of technology related to the research for or production of such weapons and to take appropriate action to that end. On nuclear proliferation, they note the importance of the decision of many countries to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and emphasise the integral role in the implementation of that Treaty of fully effective IAEA safeguards, as well as the importance of effective exports controls. The members of the Council will take appropriate measures in the case of any violations notified to them by the IAEA. On chemical weapons, they support the efforts of the Geneva Conference with a view to reaching agreement on the conclusion, by the end of 1992, of a universal convention, including a verification regime, to prohibit chemical weapons. On conventional armaments, they note the General Assembly's vote in favour of a United Nations register of arms transfers as a first step, and in this connection recognise the importance of all states providing all the information called for in the General Assembly's resolution. Conclusion In conclusion, the members of the Security Council affirm their determination to build on the initiative of their meeting in order to secure positive advances in promoting international peace and security. They agree that the United Nations secretary-general has a crucial role to play. They welcome the new secretary-general, His Excellency Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and note with satisfaction his intention to strengthen and improve the functioning of the United Nations. They pledge their full support to him. The members of the Council agree that the world now has the best chance of achieving international peace and security since the foundation of the United Nations.</p>

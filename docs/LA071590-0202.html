			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHE'S PLAGUED BY PAIN -- AND WANTS ANSWERS;  </P> <P> DISABILITY: CECILE GRACY TOOK L-TRYPTOPHAN TO IMPROVE HER HEALTH BEFORE HER  WEDDING. SHE CLAIMS A BAD BATCH OF IT HAS RUINED HER LIFE.  </P> <P> Last July, Cecile Gracy was an excited Burbank bride-to-be who vowed to get in  shape before her September wedding. So she began exercising, dieting and taking  a health supplement called L-tryptophan.  </P> <P> Gracy had taken the over-the-counter product in 1984 after her doctor  recommended it for sleeping difficulties and cramps. The tryptophan proved so  effective that she figured it would help her become a healthy, fit bride.  </P> <P> "What had been good for me before is going to be good for me now," Gracy  recalled saying last year. Though tryptophan is not normally prescribed for  fitness or dieting, she had come to regard the supplement as a harmless  vitamin. "I wanted to clean up my act, and this supplement was kind of like  extra protection and support."  </P> <P> One year later, 31-year-old Cecile Gracy is disabled. She cannot walk without a  cane and has difficulty breathing. She feels pain in her muscles when her new  husband tries to hug her. She cannot remember much of what she reads or hears.  And she fears she will never be able to have children.  </P> <P> What once cured her cramps and was expected to improve her health, her doctors  say, is precisely what disabled her: the supplement L-tryptophan.  </P> <P> On Monday, Cecile and her husband filed a $30-million lawsuit in Burbank  Superior Court against the largest of six Japanese suppliers of tryptophan.  They allege that Showa Denko of Tokyo produced a contaminated batch of the  product that damaged Cecile's body.  </P> <P> "Everything's gone to hell," said Mike Gracy, her 27-year-old husband, in an  interview at the couple's small Burbank apartment. "It's been almost a year and  she's not even close to being able to function normally. They don't even know  if she'll live past her next birthday."  </P> <P> Cecile and hundreds of others nationwide were diagnosed last fall as having  eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a mysterious ailment marked by abnormal levels  of white blood cells called eosinophils and severe muscle pain. These cells are  part of the body's immune system, but in this ailment abnormally large amounts  release a toxin that attacks bodily tissues. Victims and doctors initially were  baffled by the cause, but researchers eventually linked the syndrome to  tryptophan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled the supplement in  mid-November.  </P> <P> Medical, federal and state officials say there is increasing evidence that the  epidemic was caused by a contaminated batch of tryptophan manufactured  specifically by Showa Denko.  </P> <P> Neither the FDA nor the federal Centers for Disease Control has officially  blamed the company, and Showa Denko has acknowledged only a "statistical  association" between the epidemic and its product, said Bob Schwadron, a  company spokesman. He said more research is needed to pinpoint the cause.  </P> <P> But other medical researchers said they believe Showa Denko is responsible.  </P> <P> "We have no evidence that it's anybody's product but Showa Denko's," said Dr.  Michael Osterholm, a Minnesota state epidemiologist who helped author an  upcoming New England Journal of Medicine article that details that theory.  </P> <P> For Cecile and Mike Gracy, that is a partial relief. Finding a cause should  help them seek redress, and more important, might help find a treatment or  cure, they said. But it is the uncertainty of the future -- of whether Cecile  will fully recover, bear children or die -- that worries the newlyweds.  </P> <P> "The worst thing is the unknown," Mike Gracy said. "We're staring into an abyss  and there's nothing coming back. To start a life together like that . . . it's  not fair."  </P> <P> Neither Cecile, a blond-haired woman with a soft, girlish voice and face, nor  Mike, her burly, bearded spouse, was ever athletic or particularly  health-conscious, they said. But they loved the outdoors, often riding mountain  bikes or going four-wheel-driving in the hills.  </P> <P> Cecile Gracy diligently recorded memories of those times on a wall calendar she  treated as a daily diary. The square for each day was filled with notes  describing her workday and the time she shared with her husband.  </P> <P> Then, starting in July, "it just got filled with rotten things," such as notes  about her deteriorating condition, she said. Shortly after she resumed taking  tryptophan, she began getting sore throats, and her face, feet and hands  started to swell. Soon she was having trouble breathing and was losing weight  and hair.  </P> <P> Her co-workers and friends attributed the problems to nervousness about the  upcoming wedding; she and Mike thought it was the stress of her job, as a title  assistant at a large Glendale real estate company.  </P> <P> The Gracys were married Sept. 16, but the honeymoon was cut short because  Cecile felt increasingly ill. In the weeks that followed, she began to feel  pain in her muscles and to lose her memory at work. Eventually, she could  neither urinate nor eat. But until she could no longer get the pills down her  throat, she said, she continued taking tryptophan.  </P> <P> "That's the pathetic part," she said. "Every morning I'd say, 'OK, maybe today  the tryptophan will get rid of this stress and these problems.' "  </P> <P> Cecile was hospitalized in October and was routinely ordered to stop taking any  medicines or vitamins. After three weeks of testing, her doctors knew she had  an abnormal level of white blood cells but could not identify her illness.  </P> <P> Dr. Peng Fan -- a Sherman Oaks rheumatologist who years earlier had recommended  tryptophan for her cramps -- prescribed prednisone, a steroid, for reducing the  white blood cell count, and sent her home. Weeks later, as other cases appeared  nationwide, Fan and other doctors identified her case as being part of the  epidemic of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, caused by tryptophan.  </P> <P> Today, Cecile Gracy visits a doctor and physical therapist six days a week. But  most of her time is spent resting on the couch or sitting in a hot bath, trying  to relax her muscles, she said. Each day, Mike Gracy rises early, helps her get  settled for the day, and returns periodically from his job as a manager at an  electrical supply company to check on her.  </P> <P> Most of his nights and weekends are spent sifting through stacks of medical  documents, he said, and fighting with his insurance company over its share of  the bills -- -- which he said now might be in the six-figure range. They are  worried that if her condition deteriorates, the demands of caring for her could  force him to lose his job, threatening the couple's ability to pay their share  of the medical bills.  </P> <P> "She's still pretty afflicted at this time," Fan said in an interview. "She  still is in a lot of pain from the damage done by the tryptophan. Right now, we  really don't have any effective treatment. All we have are some medicines that  make it more tolerable."  </P> <P> The prednisone steroid, despite some side effects, has helped reduce her white  blood cell count, Fan said. Cecile is able to move around somewhat with a cane  and at times can accomplish household tasks, although she said her memory is  still poor.  </P> <P> Fan said Cecile actually is faring better than some of the other  eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome patients he and other Los Angeles doctors now are  treating. Some people afflicted with the malady have died, while others have  suffered few or no symptoms. But he said that it is impossible to predict her  future.  </P> <P> That is what frustrates and scares Cecile and Mike Gracy the most. And what  makes them angriest at Showa Denko, the company they allege is responsible.  </P> <P> "We wanted to get married, build a house and raise a family. My biggest dream  was to have a set of twins," said Cecile, her voice cracking. "I don't want  vengeance. If they can come up with the chemical to reverse all this, I'd take  that instead of any amount of money.  </P> <P> "There's a fair trade," she said. "Make it go away."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Tryptophan is a natural amino acid contained in proteins found in meat, eggs,  dairy products and other foods. Tryptophan supplements were widely used for a  variety of problems, including sleeping difficulties, anxiety and premenstrual  syndrome. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last November ordered the  supplements recalled after they were linked to an epidemic of a blood and  muscle ailment called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. So far, more than 1,500  cases, including 27 deaths, have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 29 (CTK) -- Industry and Trade Minister  Vladimir Dlouhy today told CTK that Chilean General Augusto  Pinochet was considered in his country a "standard  representative of certain circles" and if he came to the Czech  Republic to negotiate trade deals he would not to take a stand  on his visit. "That is the prerogative of other bodies in this  country," Dlouhy said.    He emphasized that he had neither been briefed on Pinochet's  visit beforehand nor asked to meet or negotiate with him. He  said, however, he did not rule out the possibility of his  ministry, as the license administration, being asked to agree to  arms exports -- but to Chile, not General Pinochet, he stressed.    If Pinochet concluded the deals planned, according to valid  Czech law the ministry would certainly take a position on it,  Dlouhy said, adding that the ministry's position would not be  absolutely dependent on whether it was Pinochet or someone else  who negotiated the deals.    What is important is not that it is Pinochet who is leading  the Chilean delegation but that the delegation will come to buy  Czech weapons, Dlouhy said. If Pinochet comes as an official  representative of the Chilean Armed Forces then some contract  would probably be agreed upon and the possible exports of  armaments would have to be approved by the license  administration, Dlouhy said.    Consideration will be given to whether Chile is among  countries to which the Czech Republic wants to limit arms  exports to or not. "Chile is today a democratic country and I  would therefore expect that the stand would be positive if the  final user of weapons is clear. But I cannot say beforehand,"  he added.</p>

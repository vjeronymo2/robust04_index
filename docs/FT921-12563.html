			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: Stoned in the sun - Anthony Curtis enjoys some serious gossip THE DREAM AT THE END OF THE WORLD by Michelle Green Bloomsbury Pounds 19.99, 381 pages TANGIER: CITY OF THE DREAMby Iain FinlaysonHarper Collins Pounds 16, 371 pages WHEN HE first went to Tangier in 1931 with Aaron Copland, the 21-year-old Paul Bowles seemed to have a great future ahead of him in music. He went, says Michelle Green, in this new study of the Tangier expatriates, as the composer's 'angular blond prodigy'. Sixteen years later Bowles set off alone to Tangier with a novel forming in his head, writing it as he journeyed through the Sahara. The next year his wife Jane joined him in Tangier. Apart from occasional holidays and excursions to other exotic places, the Bowleses stayed put in Tangier for ever after. Jane died in 1973 in a sanatorium in Malaga to which she had gone with the greatest reluctance after the first of several strokes had devastated her fine mind. After her death Bowles stayed on in Tangier. Now, at the age of 82, he is still there, an internationally famous celebrity thanks to Bertolucci's film of his cult-novel, The Sheltering Sky. The Bowles' marriage was a strange one. He was a homosexual Wasp, she was Jewish and lesbian. For a while they were the darlings of radical chic New York. In addition to having a surrealist opera, The Wind Remains, performed, Bowles worked as a music critic and a translator for Broadway of French plays. They gave up the glitzy life without a moment's regret. As soon as she arrived in Tangier in 1947, Jane, whose novel, Two Serious Ladies (1943) had given her a reputation as writer to rival her husband's, fell in love with an illiterate young Moroccan woman she discovered in the grain market. After a long, tortuous, costly courtship, she weaned her away from her natural environment to come and live with her. Two years later Paul's fictional masterpiece about an ill-assorted American husband and wife, whose personalities gradually disintegrate in the glare of the North African desert, appeared. It was followed, at long intervals, by a couple more novels, travel books and volumes of stories. And in 1972 appeared Bowles' autobiography, Without Stopping, which William Burroughs said should have been called Without Telling. As the Bowleses might have expected, the distractions they had left New York to escape re-appeared in a more extreme form in Tangier. Other American escapers had joyfully discovered the permissiveness and inexpensiveness of the place. Some of these were rich and grand. All used drugs regularly and most were gay. At the top of the pile was Barbara Hutton and her latest husband, throwing extravagant all-night parties and galas at Sidni Hosni, her palace in the Casbah. Her English friends David Herbert, son of the Earl of Pembroke, and Cecil Beaton, would monitor the list of guests for her. That ubiquitous scandalmonger, Truman Capote, came out for a while to see what was going on. 'The Bowlses', he said 'have a sterilised tout confort apartment in the new quarter and also a refuge hidden away in the darker Arab neighbourhood: a native house that must be one of the city's tiniest habitations'. The Beats were also curious - Allen Ginsberg and his friend Peter Orlovsky surfaced, and they stayed somewhat longer. So did Jack Kerouac and Gregory Corso. And from England Alan Sillitoe arrived, trying to discover how Tangier behaved during a Saturday night and Sunday morning, and his wife, the poet Ruth Fainlight, who brought with her their newborn baby. She made a friend of Jane Bowles, and was fascinated to watch her with Cherifa (her beloved) in the kitchen preparing a meal. Tennessee Williams, on the rebound from his affair with Frank Merlo and writing The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More, was another temporary escaper who found a welcoming refuge chez Bowles. As must be abundantly clear by now, Michelle Greene has written a book of serious gossip. The Dream at the End of the World contains riveting pen-portraits of all these people written in relentlessly glossy prose; for example, people rarely simply 'go' somewhere they 'zero in'. Greene's theme, if she has one, is the relations of the confirmed tangerinos - the permanent European residents - leading their smashed lives, smoking kif (cannabis mixed with tobacco) or high on majoun (another cannabis confection) with the indigenous tanjawis, the local Arab population. Some amusing but already almost forgotten writers like Alfred Chester and Brion Gysin are resurrected. After a shaky start Gysin, also a wit, a painter and a bar-owner, became a collaborator of William Burroughs. The forbidding, grimly dedicated homosexual author of The Naked Lunch found a haven in Tangier for a long time. It was while he and Gysin were there that Gysin discovered the 'cut-up'. A page of print is divided into four parts and pasted together again in a different sequence. You then read the lines of print as if they were coherent sentences. This juxtaposing of texts to create gibberish was enthusiastically adopted by Burroughs as a significant art form (see The Third Mind) - an inward escape from the constraints of conventional writing. Apart from Bowles' smallish sterling output, that would seem to be the main contribution of expatriate Tangier to literature. Exactly the same ground is covered by Iain Finlayson in his Tangier: City of the Dream (which is published on February 13) but in a less frenetic, more methodical manner. Finlayson has a chapter on Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell's sojourn in Tangier ignored by Green. He also brings the English tangerinos like Herbert and Rupert Croft-Cooke more into the centre of the picture, which remains a murky one. He is particularly interesting on the city's lethal ethnic cocktail, its mixture of races all living under the same sheltering sky.</p>

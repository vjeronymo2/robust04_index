			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Plan to phase in electronic bills of lading Electronic bills of lading could begin to replace the paper documents currently in use from next year if a project funded by the European Union proves successful. The main problems involved in moving to an electronic bill, a document which itemises a cargo and details its destination and route, have been solved, Mr John Reeve, senior partner at Touche Ross Management Consultants, said yesterday. A 15-month Ecu3.7m (Pounds 2.9m) pilot project financed jointly by the European Union and the private sector will spend the next year testing the Bolero project with a group of up to 30 private sector users. If the system proves itself, it could free the log-jam currently blocking the widespread use of electronic transfer in the field of shipping documents. Since bills of lading are negotiable - they confer ownership on the person holding the document - the problems of security have proved particularly taxing. Electronic bills of lading should provide a faster, more secure means of communicating cargo information than a paper document which can be lost, stolen or forged. They could also reduce errors which frequently delay acceptance of shipping documents. But if shippers, shipowners and others involved in seaborne cargoes can be convinced, then electronic data interchange could be used more widely for insurance certificates, customs documents, letters of credit and other banking documents. The main difficulties involved ensuring that a bill of lading in electronic form was genuine and developing the computer technology which could be used easily by shipping clerks. The security issue has been circumvented by Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group and a partner in the project, which will act as 'trusted third party' to guarantee that an electronic bill is genuine. Previous attempts to launch electronic bills foundered because potential participants did not regard the guarantor, in one case a bank, as an independent party. Subscribers to the the Bolero system would require a personal computer terminal, applications software and a card giving providing secure access. The initial investment should amount to a few thousand pounds. which should mean that it is affordable even by small shippers, Mr Reeve said. Members of the development consortium include Cryptomathic, a Danish security consultancy; Denton Hall, a UK law firm; Istev, an Italian information technology institute; and Unisource, a Dutch business telecommunications company. The user group which is testing the system includes BAT, the tobacco and financial services group; Nedlloyd Lines, Maersk Line, Chase Manhattan Bank and United Distillers.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: DWIGHT YOAKAM TOURS SIN CITY'S HONKIEST TONKS  </P> <P> Blasting off with a swamp thang version of Dave Alvin's "Long White Cadillac,"  country maverick Dwight Yoakam and his punchy little guitar-fiddle-bass-drums  outfit took Friday's near-capacity Universal Amphitheatre crowd on a nearly  two-hour tour of Sin City's honkiest tonks.  </P> <P> Along with the ability to get away with wearin' a pair of jeans-sotight he  must've put 'em on with an air wrench, Yoakam packs a classic country voice,  and that's what's got him a six pack a hits ever since he busted out of the El  Lay club scene several years back.  </P> <P> Doin' everything from his own numbers ("Guitars, Cadillacs") to the King's  "Little Sister" and even saving a taste for ole Buck ("Streets of  Bakersfield"), Yoakam fleshed out the evening's entertainment with a loose but  lucid rap about "what women mean when they say 'nothing' ") before closin' 'em  down with several two-fisted rounds of back-to-the-joints Merle/George/Ray  Price/Johnny Horton standards. There wasn't a dry beer in the house. DON WALLER  </P></p>

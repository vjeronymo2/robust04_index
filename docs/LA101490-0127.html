			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> UPHOLDING VALUES  </P> <P> I'm concerned about the showing of NC-17 (adults only) films in malls and  multiplex theaters because it's easily accessible to kids and teen-agers. A  young person might buy a ticket for another movie, but, once inside, they could  probably get into any of the movies.  </P> <P> The new rating essentially replaces the X rating. I think NC-17 has a softer  image than an X.  </P> <P> Pornographic films eat away from people on the inside and we can see the  results on the outside. One study said sexually suggestive films increase  aggressive behavior toward women.  </P> <P> Showing these films in neighborhood theaters sends communities into a downward  spiral in terms of upholding good family values and good morals.  </P> <P> I don't think it's realistic to think the industry will cease making X-rated  films. But if these films were banned from neighborhood theaters, that would be  one step in the right direction.  </P></p>

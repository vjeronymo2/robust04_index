			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Report on EBRD puts final cost of refit at Pounds 66m AN OFFICIAL report into the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's London headquarters rejects the bank's original justification for the cost of fitting out the offices and says the final figure will be Pounds 66.2m compared with the original budget of Pounds 53m. The bank had said the expenditure was in line with comparable City office projects. But according to the report, prepared by accountants Coopers and Lybrand, the bank spent more than Pounds 1,000 per square metre for fitting out the building compared with an average of more than Pounds 900 for a typical 'prestige' specification building and Pounds 700 for a 'high' specification building. The report also says the architects who worked on the building at One Exchange Square were appointed without competitive tender and details a number of new examples of lavish spending. The report will be presented at a news conference today given by Mr Claes de Neergaard, chairman of the EBRD's audit committee. EBRD executives said they expected Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, to leave the bank today, two months earlier than expected, despite his intention to stay on until a permanent successor was in place. Mr Neergaard will also present a 30-page commentary on the report written by the EBRD's audit committee which is expected to be critical of Mr Attali, Mr Anders Ljungh, vice-president of finance, and Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the cabinet director. Coopers also looked at Mr Attali's use of private jets, fees he received for speeches and his slowness in repaying personal expenses initially charged to the bank. Bank executives who have seen the report say it highlights a number of costly items including: Pounds 1.3m, or Pounds 44 per square foot, for specially coloured carpet designed to appear 'shadowless'; Pounds 250,000 for metallic aerofoil-shaped column casings, each of which cost Pounds 4,000; Meeting room chairs at a cost of Pounds 1,000 each; Marble cladding and flooring which cost more than Pounds 1.6m, including Pounds 845,000 spent on replacing existing new marble in the lift areas; Curved doors, which cost Pounds 1,700 each, about Pounds 600 more than a typical high-specification door; Almost Pounds 6m for a high-tech system of suspended ceilings. The executives say it examines the performance of the project architect, Anglo-French partnership Berthet Pochy Siddell Gibson, and the relationship between Mr Jean Louis Berthet of BPSG and Mr Attali. The report says the French side of the partnership, Berthet et Pochy, 'appears to have been appointed' to do some initial work for the bank at its previous headquarters on Mr Attali's recommendation. BPSG was subsequently appointed to work on the Exchange Square project without competitive tender. BPSG's work was supposed to be managed by the main contractor, Bovis. The report, however, cites a UK government memo which quotes Mr Berthet as saying he received design instructions from Mr Attali, 'often, over the weekend, in Paris'. BPSG's fees and expenses from the project have totalled more than Pounds 3m, though the report says these are reasonable. However, Berthet et Pochy is gaining additional royalties because it designed chairs, some desks and work stations for the project. The report criticises Berthet et Pochy for not declaring in advance that it would make royalties from the furniture. It is also critical of the EBRD for not giving overall management responsibility for the project to a single individual.</p>

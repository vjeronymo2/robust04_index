			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY / IN BRIEF: CATALINA ISLAND;  </P> <P> INQUIRY DROPPED IN CRUISE SHIP SINKING  </P> <P> After a four-month criminal investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency  has concluded it cannot prove that a salvage company deliberately scuttled the  former cruise ship Princess Louise miles short of its intended resting place  off Catalina Island. But EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald said the agency is still  considering possible civil fines against Trinav Shipping Ltd. for allowing the  2,300-ton vessel to sink too close to an ocean dump site in San Pedro Channel.  </P> <P> The site is used for disposal of dredge material from local harbors and is  significant to the EPA, Grunwald said, because of ocean floor tests that may  now be hampered by the ship. The Princess Louise, for years a popular floating  restaurant, sank in 900 feet of water on June 30 en route to Catalina. Willem  Boelman, president of Trinav, has maintained that he had no choice but to  scuttle the ship short of its destination because it was taking on water and  posed a risk to his salvage crew.  </P></p>

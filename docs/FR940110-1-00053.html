			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For various tax reasons, sponsors prefer to structure LIHTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects so that the AHP direct subsidy is lent to the project for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific long-term period, with principal and interest payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferred until the end of such term. The lending of a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy by a sponsor raises the question whether the subsidy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being passed on to the ultimate recipient, as required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the subsidy ultimately is being repaid to the Bank. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). The Board believes that the lending of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidy for the long-term period of income eligibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordability required by &sect;960.5 of the proposed rule, with all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term, satisfies section 10(j)(9)(E) and proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the project will have had the use of such funds for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period the project must remain occupied by and affordable for low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or moderate-income households, even though the funds may be repaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the end of such term. As discussed below, &sect;960.5(a)(1) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule defines this long-term period generally as not less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 30 years for rental housing projects. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidy must be lent for a term of 30 years or more, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(b)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant receives a subsidized advance or a direct subsidy from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank, and in turn provides both a loan and a grant to a borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee charged by the applicant for providing the grant may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid with the AHP subsidized advance or direct subsidy. The fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be paid with the AHP subsidized advance because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant has already covered the underwriting costs for the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the grant in its origination fee for the loan. The fee may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be paid with the direct subsidy because otherwise the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the AHP subsidy would not be passed through to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;960.4(b)(1)(i). See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Long-term Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Owner-occupied housing units. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Long-term requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(j)(1) of the Act states that pursuant to regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated by the Board, each Bank shall establish a Program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidize the interest rate on advances to members engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending for long-term, low- and moderate-income, owner-occupied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing at subsidized interest rates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;1430(j)(1). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, section 10(j)(2)(A) of the Act states that the Board's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations shall permit Bank members to use subsidized advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from the Banks to finance homeownership by families with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;1430(j)(2)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act permits more than one possible interpretation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that owner-occupied housing must be ``long-term.'' One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way to interpret this requirement is that owner-occupied housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units assisted under the AHP must be added to and retained as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the stock of affordable housing for a long-term period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, the Act may be interpreted to require that under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP, assistance must be provided to low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households to make owner-occupied housing units affordable to such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households for as long as they own the unit. These two possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretations are incorporated in options A and B described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. The Board specifically requests comments on these two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option A. Under option A, the long-term requirement would be met by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing that owner-occupied housing units be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained as affordable units for 30 years or, at the election of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sponsor, the remaining useful life of the units, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in occupancy. In order to enforce this retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, owner-occupied units assisted with a loan or a grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP would have to be subject to a deed restriction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other legally enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit to a low- or moderate-income household if the unit were sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 30 years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or prior to the end of the remaining useful life of the unit, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case may be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A household purchasing such a unit would have to qualify as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low- or moderate-income household only at the time of purchase or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of closing on the financing for the unit. A household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitating a unit would have to qualify as a low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income household only at the time the household received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a commitment for funding through the AHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

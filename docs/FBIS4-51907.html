			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Some 400 college students  staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration near the American  Center in this southwestern city at 5:30 A.M. Wednesday,  declaring that "We oppose the United States creating a war  atmosphere."    The students, members of Namchongnyon, an activist  organization comprising students from Chonnam National and  Choson Universities as well as other schools in Kwangju and  South Cholla Province, tried to storm into the American Center  but were blocked by riot police firing tear-gas.    A clash between the police and students wielding paint  bottles and rocks ensued, injuring some 10 policemen and  students who were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.    At 6:10, the students moved to the South Cholla police  agency  to demand the release of their arrested fellows, while throwing  over 20 paint bottles at the agency building.</p>

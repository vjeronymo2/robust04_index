			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Lloyd's snubbed Yesterday's rejection by Lloyd's Names of a Pounds 900m offer of compensation from the London insurance market looks a little quixotic. Even an inveterate gambler would hesitate to punt on the verdict of the courts over an issue as contentious as this. While the bill for successful legal action against Lloyd's agents would be met chiefly from errors and omissions insurance and from Lloyd's central fund, money from these two sources could easily fall short of what may ultimately be required. There is a worry that some parent companies will walk away from the liabilities of their agency subsidiaries. This was, then, a case where the bird in hand had something to commend it. Yet the whole dismal Lloyd's saga, which has caused a substantial and painful redistribution of wealth among Britain's landed and professional classes, is fraught with emotion. For too many people the proposed settlement would not have been enough to stave off impending bankruptcy: they had nothing to lose by turning it down. The result is that Lloyd's will suffer the nagging distraction of continuous litigation for the forseeable future. Whether the damage to the market's reputation will be equally durable is another matter. Certainly this snub from the Names is less worrying than it would have been before Lloyd's brought in Pounds 800m of corporate capital last year. Having passed this test, the ability of Lloyd's to write new business is greatly enhanced. Dire forecasts of a meltdown in the insurance market now look less plausible - the more so since the 1993 underwriting year is expected to be profitable. There is a growing perception that the market may be past the worst and that the new broom at Lloyd's was beginning to deliver something tangible. Yet there is still a long haul ahead. Losses for 1991 and 1992 which have yet to be reported are expected to saddle Names with a further bill of Pounds 3bn. And a successful outcome to the attempt to insulate the market from pollution and asbestosis claims by setting up a separate Pounds 4bn reinsurance arm known as NewCo is far from certain. That said, Lloyd's still has a formidable advantage: it has never short-changed its policy holders. Insurance rates are rising. If the market professionals manage to keep their nerve in the face of continuing bad publicity arising from litigation, they might just pull through</p>

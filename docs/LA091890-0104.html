			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WALTERS, BLOOM GET COURT REVERSAL  </P> <P> A federal appeals court in Chicago Monday overturned the racketeering  convictions of two sports agents who had been accused of signing athletes to  contracts before their eligibility expired.  </P> <P> The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of Norby Walters  and Lloyd Bloom on a legal technicality and did not address the mail fraud,  racketeering or conspiracy counts.  </P> <P> This left open the possibility of retrial, but prosecutors who handled the case  were not in their offices after business hours Monday, and it could not be  learned if they would try again for convictions.  </P> <P> In its ruling, the appeals court said U.S. District Judge George Marovich  improperly refused to call certain testimony to the jurors' attention during  his instruction to the panel.  </P> <P> Walters, 58, of New York, had been sentenced to five years in prison; Bloom,  30, of Sherman Oaks was given three years.  </P> <P> "I love everybody! God bless the judges!" Walters shouted into the telephone  from his New York home minutes after he learned of the reversal. "I believe  justice was done."  </P> <P> The government said Walters and Bloom paid college athletes thousands of  dollars to sign secret representation contracts before their eligibility had  expired, a violation of NCAA rules. The pair was also accused of threatening to  break the legs of some athletes to keep them from disregarding the contracts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIMILAR TO DEFEATED MEASURE A;  </P> <P> O.C. SUPERVISORS MAY OK SLOW-GROWTH PLAN TODAY  </P> <P> Scrambling to cope with the impact of explosive growth in south Orange County,  the Board of Supervisors today is expected to divide unincorporated county  areas into five growth-management zones, where new development will be tied to  improvements in roads, libraries, flood control, and police and fire  protection.  </P> <P> Under the plan, which is expected to be adopted without opposition, developers  will have to pay for improvements needed to ensure that public facilities meet  specific service levels, especially traffic flow at intersections.  </P> <P> But the plan, by not requiring developers to correct traffic problems that are  a result of previous commercial and residential growth, sidesteps objections  raised in recent court decisions that invalidated slow-growth initiatives  adopted by voters in San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The growth-management zones attempt to link neighborhoods that have common  problems, life styles and facility needs. The area affected by the county's  plan is expected to grow by an estimated 600,000 people in the next 20 years.  </P> <P> The 11-member citizens' committee that drafted the plan voted to disband last  Friday. And some members expressed disappointment that more progress has not  been made on efforts to protect rural areas from urban encroachment.  </P> <P> The panel was appointed by county supervisors a year ago in the heat of a  petition drive that netted 96,000 signatures on behalf of Measure A, a  countywide, slow-growth ballot initiative. Measure A failed last June by a  margin of 56% to 44%, despite strong support in the less-populated southern  portion of the county.  </P> <P> Approval of the growth-management plan by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday  would be a "milestone," said Michael Ruane, the county's director of advance  planning.  </P> <P> For the first time, Ruane said, growth in unincorporated areas, particularly  the south county, would be phased and managed under a single plan. The plan  would also require, for the most part, that developers pay for facilities and  services before any construction can begin, a major feature of Measure A.  </P> <P> Ruane said the plan is an adequate safeguard against unreasonable and  uncontrolled development, and he called it "as tough a plan as the court would  allow."  </P> <P> "We are very pleased," he said. "It's the foundation for a countywide  growth-management effort and some interregional cooperation."  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who appointed the citizens' panel last year when  she was chairman of the board, said the group has performed as she had hoped.  "We had to demonstrate (to the public) that we were listening, and this plan  shows that we did, before the election."  </P> <P> Former Supervisor Bruce Nestande, who headed the panel, said that county  officials were moving in the direction of such a growth-management plan even  before the slow-growth forces qualified their ballot initiative.  </P> <P> "I can even make a case that Measure A was a handicap to doing it in a more  thoughtful manner," said Nestande, now vice chairman of Costa Mesa-based Arnel  Development Co. "As a result of the initiative process, there was a great deal  of haste on the part of many developers to get under the protection of  developer agreements. And now, there's a great deal of confusion about which  takes precedence -- this plan or a development agreement that the county has  signed with a developer in good faith."  </P> <P> Indeed, a major disappointment to environmentalists is that more than 60,000  new housing units planned for construction during the next 20 years will be  exempt from the county's growth-management plan because they are protected by  those so-called developer agreements, in which developers basically agree to  help fund public facilities, including roads, in exchange for protection from  future changes in county land-use policies.  </P> <P> Norm Grossman, a committee member on the boards of both Laguna Greenbelt Inc.  and Citizens for Sensible Growth and Traffic Control, the sponsor of Measure A,  said he is pleased with the plan. But he said he and some other panelists were  disappointed that more progress has not been made on efforts to protect rural  areas and natural resources, such as oak trees and ridgelines.  </P> <P> While anticipating further work by county staff members on the concept of  buffer zones, Grossman said, the committee has recommended strict enforcement  of policies barring ridgeline development as an interim step.  </P> <P> "Nothing in life is perfect," said Grossman, who contended that no plan would  have been completed without the pressure of Measure A. He said he is convinced  that the plan will be enforced because of county officials' plans to place a  half-cent, countywide sales tax for transportation projects before voters in  November or sometime next year. Polls show that voters want growth-management  policies to accompany any plan for spending revenue from such a sales tax.  </P> <P> Grossman is on the citizens' committee that is working on the proposed  sales-tax measure.  </P> <P> John Erskine, executive director of the Orange County Building Industry Assn.  and a Huntington Beach city councilman who also served on the citizens'  growth-management committee, said he is happy with the county plan and believes  it is "tougher than most jurisdictions would tolerate."  </P> <P> Ruane said county officials have 90 days to "fine tune" the plan before  supervisors will take a final vote on the document. The plan will be reviewed  annually, he added.  </P> <P> Before the citizens' committee disbanded, it issued a controversial  recommendation that the county establish rural transition (buffer) zones as  part of the county's General Plan, a legal document intended to guide county  housing, zoning, land-use and transportation policies.  </P> <P> Environmentalists, in particular, believe that such buffer zones between new  development and wilderness areas are needed to protect ecologically sensitive  regions, such as the foothills and canyon lands of eastern Orange County.  </P> <P> In those zones, there would be limited development, large tracts of open space,  and tight controls on use and access.  </P> <P> Incorporating those zones in the General Plan would give those areas a "higher  stature" or priority, Ruane said, making it more difficult to alter the use of  that land in the future.  </P> <P> The committee also recommended hiring an ombudsman to answer questions and  concerns of the public on controversial development projects, and to give the  county complete control of the environmental review process of development  projects, which now relies heavily on consultants hired by developers. Both  actions would improve the county's image and improve the county's credibility  on development issues, the committee said.  </P></p>

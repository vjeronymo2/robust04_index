			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Headaches over Russian metal sales 'to continue' RUSSIA'S METAL production and exports to the west would fall this year but remain high enough to continue causing western producers severe headaches, analysts suggested yesterday. Metal output might drop as much as 15 per cent from last year's level, according to Burdett, Buckeridge &amp; Young, the Australian stockbroker. Last year production of the main traded metals fell from the 1990 level by between 5.5 (nickel) and 11.5 per cent (tin). Russian metal exports could fall by a third this year, mainly because of problems caused by new taxes and licensing, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggested. He pointed out there was an eight-week backlog for licences in Russia and it seemed exports had more or less ground to a halt. Mr Arnold said metal exports would be low in the first quarter of 1992 because rail transport in Russia had been diverted to moving food and fuel. It should return to normal in the second quarter. Other analysts were less convinced that exports would drop so much. 'While the flow of metal might not quite reach 1991 levels, it will remain very high by historic standards,' said Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research. 'There will be a lot of metal for the relatively sluggish western European economies to absorb.' Mr Buxton pointed out, even if exports slowed, there was a great deal of Russian metal already in Europe - for example 30,000 tonnes of nickel in Rotterdam. Analysts were puzzled by remarks made in London by Mr Anatoly Filatov, chairman of Norilsk, Russia's main nickel producer. He insisted that delays in nickel shipments had not been caused by bureaucratic delays and the new export tariff but because prices were too low. Mr Filatov told Reuter that Norilsk had already closed one smelter in Siberia for six-months maintenance work because of low prices and said it would not ship nickel to the west if the price fell below Dollars 3.50 a lb. Last night nickel closed in London at Dollars 3.63. Analysts suggested that Norilsk could not have escaped the difficulties faced by other Russian metal producers. Burdett, Buckeridge pointed out in a study of the Russian resources industry that these included problems of labour productivity, old-fashioned equipment, shortages of raw materials and capital and failures in power supply.  ------------------------------------------- SOVIET MINERAL OUTPUT ('000 TONNES)  -------------------------------------------                       1990   market share  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium            2,600      14.3% Copper               1,340      13.5% Lead                   730      11% Nickel                 215      26% Zinc                 1,015      13% Gold                   270      13.5% Iron ore  (metal cont.)     132,000      27% Steel              154,000      20% Coal               630,000      13% Crude oil           11,400      17.5% Natural gas  (oil equiv.)          655      37%  ------------------------------------------- Source: Burdett, Buckeridge &amp; Young  -------------------------------------------</p>

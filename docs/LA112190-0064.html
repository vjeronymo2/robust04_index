			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> PROPOSED SCHOOL LAYOFFS PROTESTED  </P> <P> About 150 union members, teachers and parents packed the boardroom of the  Orange Unified School District this week to protest the proposed layoffs of 79  classified employees.  </P> <P> After the district signed a two-year contract with the classified workers  earlier this month, Supt.  </P> <P> Norman Guith gathered school principals and employees at the district office  last week to announce the proposed cuts.  </P> <P> The announcement took union officials by surprise, said Becky Mayers, union  representative for Local 67 of the Classified School Employees Assn.  </P> <P> "This is about the coldest thing I think I've ever seen," Mayers said. "Usually  we are conferred with about layoffs."  </P> <P> Mayers said the union agreed to approve retirement incentives and made other  concessions during negotiations to avert staff cuts.  </P> <P> "We were told during negotiations that there would be some layoffs," Mayers  said. "They never indicated there would be seventy-some people."  </P> <P> The layoffs, which would save the district $1.2 million in one year, would  affect workers with the least seniority, including 39 school clerks, 22  maintenance workers and 10 employees from the district office.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of ideas on how we can offset layoffs, but we have to be given  the chance," Mayers said.  </P> <P> A flurry of protests following last week's announcement prompted the school  board to schedule meetings to discuss the issue later this month.  </P> <P> Board President Jeff Holstien said the district administration may have moved  prematurely in proposing the layoffs before examining all options. Holstien  said the board "would explore every possible source of income" before resorting  to layoffs.  </P> <P> "This board of education cares about the employees of the district and plans to  do everything in its power to treat its employees with care and humanity,"  Holstien said.  </P> <P> School board members plan to discuss the issue at the Dec. 6 board meeting.

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: Blow for passive smokers The US Environmental Protection Agency's recent classification of second-hand cigarette smoke as a first-class carcinogen is prodding many US companies to reassess workplace smoking rules. The judgment makes employers which do not ban smoking more vulnerable to lawsuits. The EPA ruling blamed passive smoke for 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the US. New federal regulations, to be issued as a result of the EPA report, could soon make it mandatory for companies with more than 10 employees to prohibit smoking at the workplace altogether. Such regulations would mean the end of employee smoking rooms. 'Because the smoking room uses the same ventilation system as other offices in the building, it doesn't provide enough protection to non-smokers,' said Fran Dumelle, deputy managing director of the American Lung Association. Many US companies have already banned smoking, and groups of smokers can increasingly be seen huddled outside large office buildings. Concern over smokers traipsing out of doors in inclement weather has prompted some of the more innovative companies to erect external 'smoking shelters'. They look like bus shelters and shield smokers against rain, wind and snow. The ALA also recommends that companies offer 'smoker sensitivity training', which explains to non-smoking employees how difficult it is for smokers to quit. Many employers also adopt a series of motivational programmes to encourage smokers to give up. These often include support groups with worksite meetings, free counseling and discounts on nicotine patches. Cigarette companies say the problem should be addressed in another manner. 'With improved ventilation systems, non-smokers would not be bothered by people smoking,' said Thomas Borelli, director of science affairs for Philip Morris.</p>

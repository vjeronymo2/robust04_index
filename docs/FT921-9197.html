			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia cuts growers' coffee price by 5 per cent THE COLOMBIAN coffee authorities have reduced the price paid to growers by 5 per cent in response to very low international prices, writes Sarita Kendall in Bogota. This is an unusual move for Colombia, which has tried to maintain domestic purchase prices despite the large deficit incurred by the National Coffee Fund. Mr Jorge Cardenas, manager of the coffee growers' federation, said it was a critical moment for coffee on both the internal and foreign fronts: this year's harvest is running at about 16.7m bags (60 kg each), the highest ever, and though Colombia hopes to export some 13m bags, stocks will increase. The federation and the regional coffee organisations are to pare spending to a minimum, while growers will be encouraged to renovate plantations in order to reduce the area harvested during the next two years. The aim is to cut production by 500,000 bags.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sprint warms up for race to link world telecoms - The US group's planned alliance reflects a global trend If it is consummated, the prospective tie-up between Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telecommunications carrier, and the state telecoms operators of France and Germany will be the second of three grand international telecoms alliances due to be formed by the end of the year. It will also set the seal on the contract between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom signed last December, when the two European state-owned companies announced an Ecu1bn (Dollars 666m) alliance to develop much of their international networks business jointly. The first alliance was announced last June, when British Telecommunications undertook to buy 20 per cent of MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier, and form a joint venture with it geared to the international business market. BT laid out Dollars 5.3bn - Dollars 1bn for the joint venture and the rest for the stake. 'That put the pressure on the rest of us with global pretensions to move fast,' says a senior Deutsche Telekom executive. That meant, in particular, the French and German operators, the US giant AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Unisource - a joint venture between the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss state operators with Telefonica of Spain in loose association. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which is headed by Helmut Ricke, were already linked in a joint venture called Eunetcom, geared like Unisource to the market for 'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinational companies. Their decision to deepen the alliance surprised no-one. However, intensive talks between the two and AT&amp;T caused widespread consternation, given that it would involve a union of three of the world's four largest telecoms operators, each of them from the monopoly stable. Disputes over the structure of an alliance, and fears about regulatory approval - the Franco-German link has still to be approved by the European Commission - appear to have scuppered the talks. AT&amp;T has since been in negotiations with Unisource: this has already led to co-operation between the two to win Europe's largest telecoms outsourcing contract. And analysts believe it could proceed further. That tie-up left Sprint and the Franco-German partnership searching for allies. However, it has taken more than the elimination of prospective partners to bring them together - a strong business rationale underlines the union, however difficult it may prove to be in practice. The goal for all the companies engaged in the current matchmaking is simple: as international telecoms are liberalised, to carve out a leading share in the market they expect to develop for outsourcing the telecoms needs of multinational companies. There is room for scepticism about the value, even the existence, of the market they are aiming at. According to Dataquest, the international consultancy, the European market for corporate outsourcing is expected to rise from Dollars 800m in 1993 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1996 - out of total European spending of Dollars 186bn on telecoms services two years from now. 'It's only a tiny fraction of the total market they are going for,' says Ms Kathy Burrows at Dataquest. However, the large telecoms operators have convinced themselves that the market will grow fast thereafter, and that a commanding position in it could open up strategic opportunities. To take advantage of them, each believes it needs to be in an alliance with four factors: money; a presence in the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific; a benign regulatory climate; and access to state-of-the-art network services. The attraction of Sprint to France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom is its reputation for technological innovation, its international data network and its US operations. Its network extends to all three important sectors of the US market: long distance and international, local telephone and cellular wireless services. Given its small share of the US long-distance market (10 per cent against AT&amp;T's 65 per cent), it is also unlikely to alarm regulators on either side of the Atlantic. Sprint already has a sizeable international presence of its own, with sales offices and joint ventures in 34 countries and territories, and a stake in global fibre optic links. It is best-known internationally for SprintNet, one of the world's leading data networks, linking computers in nearly 100 cities and 32 countries. SprintNet is used for sophisticated corporate data information flows, such as bank transfer of funds or order processing and inventory tracking by multinational manufacturing companies. The group's SprintMail service also claims a substantial share of the international E-mail market. Sprint needs capital to expand. And to be a respectable operator in the international outsourcing market, it needs a weighty European partner. An alliance with the French and German operators offers the prospect of both. But even if an alliance is announced, there are plenty of potential obstacles. Not the least of them is the severe difficulties being experienced by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom in their efforts to restructure in order to face up to competition within Europe. The privatisation of the German operator appears to have run into trouble: and so afraid is the French government of the backlash from France Telecom's employees, it will not even start the process.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Suspicion (Channel 9 Sunday at 1 p.m.). The Hitchcock classic, with the  compromised ending, based on Francis Iles' shivery wife-suspects-husband  thriller, "Before the Fact."  </P> <P> With Joan Fontaine and an ambivalent Cary Grant.  </P> <P> Farewell (Bravo Monday at 8:30 p.m.). Reportedly the favorite movie of Mikhail  Gorbachev, this poignant drama -- directed by Efem Klimov from a script  prepared by his late wife Larissa Shepitko -- is highly reminiscent of the Elia  Kazan classic, "Wild River."  </P> <P> Winchester 73 (Showtime Tuesday at 10 a.m.) The first of the great Anthony  Mann-James Stewart westerns, all about the stolen rifle that passes from hand  to hand, with Jimmy and horse Pie in relentless pursuit.  </P> <P> A Day with Marilyn Monroe (AMC Saturday, inclusive). This all-day Marilyn  Marathon includes, in order, The Seven Year Itch (10 a.m. &amp; 8 p.m.),  Niagara (12 noon &amp; 10 p.m.)), Don't Bother to Knock (1:30 p.m. &amp; 11:30  p.m.) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (3 p.m. &amp; 1 a.m.), River of No Return (4:30  p.m. &amp; 2:30 a.m.) and How to Marry a Millionaire (6 p.m.).  </P></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks Sir John Quinton must think it unfair that Barclays' share price has been a singular victim of current property and construction worries. His bank has only 148 per cent of its equity tied up in lending to property and construction companies. Lloyds quietly let slip in its annual report that its exposure is even higher at 165 per cent. Of the four top clearers, only National Westminster has lent less than its total equity. Having taken fright after earlier excess in the 1970s, it restrained itself to a mere 87 per cent. So, it only risks being almost wiped out. The banks would doubtless respond that the ratios overstate the danger. Much of their property lending is perfectly sound and their BIS capital ratios are strong. True, but they also have a large hidden exposure to property through security on other lending. Nor do high real interest rates and excess supply offer any grounds to expect an interruption to the 30 per cent fall in commercial property prices since the peak in 1989. Having just about sorted out developing country debts, the banks now face years of work on property loans. Recovery hopes will be dented by further provisions while interest margins will be squeezed by non-performing loans. Barclays will be badly hit because its property and construction lending has grown particularly fast in relation to its UK loan book since 1988, the year Sir John launched a controversial rights issue to embark on an ill-advised dash for growth. Barclays has also been slower to make provisions. Still, there is no reason for Midland to smirk. Its exposure is 119 per cent of equity. The Hongkong Bank must be scrutinising that ratio as it decides how much to offer.</p>

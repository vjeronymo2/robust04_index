			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Iberian banks in share swap SPAIN'S Banco Central Hispanoamericano has joined the push by Spanish banks into Portugal through a share swap with with Banco Comercial Portugues. Under the agreement announced yesterday, BCH has taken 10 per cent of BCP which, in turn, has taken 2 per cent of BCH and 50 per cent of Banco Banif Gestion Privada, a BCH 'boutique' bank that caters for wealthy clients. The operation is thought to be the biggest share exchange between Spanish and Portuguese institutions. BCH bought 9.14m shares in BCP at Esc2,500 each while BCP acquired 3.4m BCN shares at Monday's closing price in Madrid of Pta3,300. It also marks the boldest advance made by a Portuguese bank into Spanish territory. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP chairman, is likely to be given a seat on the BCH board next month. BCH, Spain's biggest bank in terms of assets, and BCP said they were looking forward to 'long term co-operation' and that they 'share a similar philosophy of performance both in the Portuguese and Spanish markets.' It is not clear whether BCH plans to use its BCP stake merely as a source of dividends or whether it will try to operate in some way in Portugal through the BCP association. BCH has just reported a dramatic 22 per cent fall in net profits last year, to Pta52.6bn.</p>

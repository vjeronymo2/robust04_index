			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / France eases stance on ERM: Balladur and Kohl seek common ground on economic union THE FRENCH government signalled a more relaxed attitude towards the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday by indicating that France was in no hurry to return to the narrow bands which led to last month's currency crisis. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, made his conciliatory remarks on the eve of today's Franco-German summit in Bonn. The meeting between the leaders of France and Germany is aimed at finding common ground on European economic and monetary union and resolving differences on trade and other bilateral issues. Pressure on Mr Balladur and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to reach agreement increased when Mr Karel Van Miert, vice-president of the European Commission, warned that achievements such as the single European market could come apart if the momentum towards economic and monetary union (Emu) was not regained. 'The Community is living dangerously,' the Belgian commissioner said yesterday, 'and we could say that the EC itself is floating' (with its currencies). A successful meeting today between Mr Balladur and Chancellor Kohl is vital if the European Community is to emerge from its current crisis in reasonable shape. Mr Balladur said yesterday that France was determined to proceed with Emu. He added that France should avoid letting the franc reach its new wider limit, agreed as part of the ERM reforms this month. Mr Balladur said France was determined that the second phase of European economic and monetary union should come into effect on schedule next year and that he will discuss how to achieve economic convergence with Mr Kohl. His statement on ERM fluctuation bands was interpreted by economists as a more pragmatic response to the European currency crisis which broke the franc's close link with the D-Mark and widened bands from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. The expectation in Bonn is that the two heads of government will seek to give a clear statement of their determination to co-operate, without very precise ideas on how to resolve their outstanding problems - including the future of the EMS and Gatt. Proposals on how to maintain the momentum towards Emu, in spite of the recent currency upheaval, are still being discussed at the level of senior officials. 'The heads of government would be well advised to leave it there,' one official said. Although there is a desire to promise closer co-operation on economic and budgetary policies, both sides are constrained by their domestic political realities. Mr Kohl is locked into a strict budget savings plan which does not allow for an early relaxation. But Mr Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, called on both sides to co-ordinate their economic policies: 'If we cannot succeed in bringing Germany and France back into monetary harmony, then the European Monetary System will no longer be the preliminary step towards a currency union.'

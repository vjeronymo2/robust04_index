			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Treasury's approach linked to recovery: Public-sector workers will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain their standards of living, say pay analysts THE TREASURY yesterday linked its new limits on public-sector pay with the effort to maintain the pace of recovery and ensure low inflation. The plan for a near-freeze on public-sector wages in 1994-95 also fitted in with the need to 'restore the public finances to better health', the Treasury said. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned that wage-bargaining expectations throughout the economy would have to change so that price pressures remain subdued, thus giving industry a solid platform for expansion later in the 1990s. 'It will not be possible to achieve sustainable growth and steady recovery without continued low inflation,' the Treasury said. 'What previously might have been regarded as restrained levels of pay settlement are now in fact sensible and necessary and will remain so. We must become accustomed to a pattern where significant real terms increases in pay are not expected each year by professions and employees.' The department said the government's goal of keeping underlying inflation - as measured by the year-on-year change in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments - under 4 per cent within the life of the present parliament would be helped by 'continued moderation in pay increases' in both the public and private sectors. The strict limits on public-sector wages also appears designed to appease rightwing Tories. In recent weeks, they have voiced concerns that tax rises, rather than new spending limits, have been the preferred government option in the battle to rein back the deficit. Wages account for nearly half this year's spending of Pounds 244bn, as measured by the Treasury's 'control total' which excludes social security linked to the economic cycle and debt interest. Therefore strict pay limits for next year and onwards should help Mr Clarke cut the gap between spending and revenues from the expected Pounds 50bn this financial year. Even so, the chancellor has refused to rule out tax increases in his November 30 Budget. These would take effect from next April, and come on top of the Pounds 16bn of tax rises already announced for the next two financial years.</p>

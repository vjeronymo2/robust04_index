			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SULTAN SWATTED 2 OFF 'BIG TRAIN' JOHNSON  </P> <P> The 1924 Babe Ruth-vs.-Walter Johnson game at Brea may have been the Bambino's  only local appearance, but it wasn't his "only Orange County home run"  (Newswatch, Oct. 31).  </P> <P> He belted two of them out of the park that day, both off hometown son "Big  Train" Johnson.  </P> <P> The only thing spooky about this Halloween treat was Johnson, who was touched  for eight runs and eight hits (four of them homers), before being pulled in the  fifth. No slouch as a pitcher, Ruth southpawed his smoke ball through the whole  game, giving up just one homer in the ninth to Bob Meusel for the 12-1 victory.  </P> <P> Incidentally, the exhibition was a fund-raiser for the Anaheim Elks' Christmas  charity. So Brea lost twice.  </P> <P> JIM SLEEPER, Tustin  </P></p>

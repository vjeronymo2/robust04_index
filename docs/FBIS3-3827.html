Philip Hui-Ho  Cheng, 64, is expected to return to Hong Kong Friday from  Changsha, where he was detained after his business partner in  the mainland decided to withdraw from an investment project and  wanted his money back. Cheng's passport was returned to him on  Tuesday after a court in Changsha found his business partner had  falsified business documents in order to convince court  officials to arrest him. Cheng was arrested and during a  three-day interrogation in a detention centre headed by his  partner's brother-in-law was told to return the money  immediately or face a jail term.</p>

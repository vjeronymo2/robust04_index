			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Kantor urges rapid approval of Nafta MR Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, yesterday issued a ringing defence of the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement and warned that an opportunity to secure another such pact would not happen for a generation. Both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, have hinted that the pact might win Congressional approval if it were sent back to the White House for renegotiation. If the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada fails to win Congressional approve, 'it will be our children negotiating the next Nafta,' Mr Kantor said in a speech before the American Business Conference. On Tuesday Mr Gephardt announced his opposition to 'this Nafta'. In a press conference on Capitol Hill they claimed that the trade pact could still win approval without the majority leader's support. Congressman David Skaggs, a Colorado Democrat, warned: 'Anyone who thinks we need to defeat this because there is something new and better coming down the road is living in a dream world.' Furthermore the US credibility as a trade negotiating partner is at stake, he and others cautioned. The trade representative claimed to be optimistic about Nafta's chances for passage in the House and characterising the pact as the Administration's top foreign policy initiative. For years the US has coped with Mexican tariffs, quotas and performance and production requirements. 'Why in the world anyone would want to continue this unfair situation is frankly beyond me. What they are saying is maintain the status quo. Keep this unfair rules the same.' Turning to the Uruguay Round, Mr Kantor characterised French dissatisfaction with the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last year at Washington's Blair House, as 'an internal EC matter' in which the US would not get involved. This hands-off stance will not much help Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, when he arrives in Washington next Monday, to request 'clarifications' of the deal. 'I don't know what clarifications means,' said Mr Kantor. 'But my stomach starts hurting when anyone says they want clarifications of an already negotiated and signed agreement.' He said Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva have been 'moving quite well' although 'the French, of course have not helped the situation by raising this Blair House agreement - I think I'm putting it delicately.' Mr Kantor said US trade policy will focus more on Asia where 'we have not been as successful at building trade regimes around our relationship.' Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

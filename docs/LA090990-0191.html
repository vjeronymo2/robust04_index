			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> WAR ON CITIZENS  </P> <P> What in the world can you say to something like that? My first reaction is that  it's hyperbole that comes out of Alice in Wonderland or as (marijuana  researcher) Tod Mikuriya referred to it, "Malice in Blunderland."  </P> <P> Over the years, drug policy has widened its net of who moves into the criminal  category, so that more and more U.S. citizens are pulled into criminal  sanctions.  </P> <P> The question was what severity of criminal sanctions is going to produce the  necessary result.  </P> <P> What this one does for people who are not committed drug-users is to move them  into criminal categories that (Gates) says are equal to treason. What it does  is place the government at war with its citizens -- for the most part citizens  not at war with their government.  </P> <P> Their behavior for the most part is recreational and ought to be outside the  whole scope of what is considered criminal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iran should be governed by a three-member advisory board chaired by the late  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's son, Ahmed, an editorial in a government-run  newspaper said. The governing board should also include President Ali Khamenei  and Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the English-language Tehran Times  said. It said Khomeini should be chairman because he was closest to his father  and thus familiar with his thinking. Khamenei was named as Iran's supreme  leader a day after Khomeini died June 3.  </P></p>

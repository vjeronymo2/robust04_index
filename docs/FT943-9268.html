			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Laing gets NatWest Tower contract John Laing, the UK construction group, has won the main contract to refurbish London's NatWest Tower, which was severely damaged in a terrorist bomb attack in April 1993, Andrew Taylor writes. The contract for work on Britain's second-tallest building is thought to be worth about Pounds 80m. The 42-storey property, previously housed the headquarters of National Westminster's high street banking operations. Mr David Edmonds, NatWest's property and central services general manager, said yesterday that a decision on how the building was to be reoccupied would not be taken until closer to the completion of the refurbishment in December 1996. The bank intends to reclad the exterior of the building in its original style. It will, however, redesign the interior. Schmidlin UK has been awarded the cladding sub-contract. Crown House Engineering has been awarded mechanical and electrical and public health sub-contracts. The architects are GMW Partnership, assisted by Richard Seifert and Partners, the original architects of the tower.</p>

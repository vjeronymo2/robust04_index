			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Braer captain escapes action The master of the Braer oil tanker, which was wrecked in stormy seas off Shetland in January last year, is not to be prosecuted. Law officials in Edinburgh confirmed yesterday that no criminal proceedings are to be launched against anyone over the incident, in which more than 85,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the sea. No reason for the decision was given by the Crown Office in Edinburgh. Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, said he would seek an explanation from Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the Lord Advocate. The master of the Braer, Captain Alexandros Gelis, was criticised in a report last January by the Department of Transport's marine accident investigation branch. It blamed him for failing to deal with steel tubes that broke loose on the deck of the Braer and smashed into fuel tank vents, leading to fuel contamination and engine failure. Mr Wallace said that if yesterday's decision was taken on 'policy' grounds, it would be a matter for concern. However, if it was felt there was insufficient evidence to make a case beyond reasonable doubt, that decision was for the Crown lawyers. The decision not to prosecute does not prevent civil proceedings, but Shetland Islands Council said yesterday that it would not pursue that course.</p>

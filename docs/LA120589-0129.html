			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAZZ TROUPE LEAVES BEATEN PATH; AUDIENCE RELUCTANT TO FOLLOW  </P> <P> Jazz Unlimited may never entirely shed its image as a Vegas-style dance troupe  with more speed and pizazz than kinetic substance. But during last weekend's  concert at San Diego State University's Don Powell Theatre, the company took a  step in that direction with a pair of premieres that took their cues from the  flowing lyricism of modern dance. Both "Summons," and "Silahkan" were obvious  signposts of softer things to come, although the audience showed it preferred  the old favorites.  </P> <P> Melissa Nunn, a choreographer with roots firmly planted in the tenets of  traditional modern dance, created the blunt-edged motional patterns and pretty  stage pictures of "Summons."  </P> <P> Despite unflattering costumes for both the men and the women, the dance ebbed  and flowed nicely along the eerie lines of its Tibetan-flavored score. Brash  lighting designs enhanced the mood.  </P> <P> There were lapses in unison work at times, and the stop-action balances  demanded more control, but "Summons" was a worthy addition to the repertory.  </P> <P> Patricia Rincon, founding director of the 10-year-old troupe, made a detour of  her own with a new ensemble work she dubbed "Silahkan." The sextet owed its  lovely, lyrical quality to the Eastern musical motifs of Zakir Hussain. Its  East Indian stillness and supple moves of Egyptian dance were quite a departure  for Rincon and her dancers.  </P> <P> At its best, the dance should ripple along rhythmically, like leaves sailing on  the crest of a gentle breeze. Unfortunately, the cast had difficulty sustaining  that seamless flow of movement during its first performance Saturday.  </P> <P> The most disappointing work on the program was Rincon's lively "Trilogy," which  seemed totally at odds with its laid-back, country-style accompaniment and the  crude photo montage used as a backdrop.  </P> <P> The old hallmarks of jazz dance still showed up in this concert, but not until  the latter part of the six-piece program. Rincon's second premiere, "Grounded,"  a dramatic dance about stifling relationships and entrapment, began with a  striking tableau of the five dancers in a huddle. They peeled apart for some  rapid high jinks, but never strayed far from the core. It was a fine showcase  for the dancers.  </P> <P> Jazz Unlimited went back to its 1985 signature work, "Company Break," for its  only all-out crowd pleaser. The piece, with a rollicking score by Rob Mullins  to propel it, is the kind of sassy show-biz shenanigans that Jazz Unlimited  fans have come to expect. And it generated a spontaneous outbreak of applause  and whistles when it burst on the scene for the finale.  </P> <P> Jazz Unlimited may have designs on a new image, but, judging from the response  it received Saturday night, it may have to find a new audience to accept it.  </P></p>

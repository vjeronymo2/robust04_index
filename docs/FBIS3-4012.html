Yi Zhenqiu  said that of the number of new stocks the state allowed to  Guangdong last year, some 90 million yuan worth had not been  issued. Recently, the provincial commission for restructuring  economy has drawn up a list of enterprises, which already has  been submitted to the State Commission for Restructuring Economy  for its examination and approval. However, the number of  enterprises and the list itself cannot be published as of today.  Yi Zhengqiu said the selection of enterprises to be listed this  year would continue to comply with the national industrial  policy of focusing efforts on supporting key projects in energy  resources and infrastructure. It is certain that the method of  selling application forms for drawing lots in the marketing of  new stocks will not be repeated. On the issue of Chinese stocks  to be listed outside the border, Director Yi said that the  Guangdong Foshan Earthenware Group has been included in the 22  firms to be listed outside the border, as decided by the central  authorities; also included are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway  and the Southern Aviation Company, which are enterprises under  ministerial jurisdiction. At present, those enterprises  included on the list are conducting asset assessment.</p>

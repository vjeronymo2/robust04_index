			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> WATER CONSUMPTION DOWN 25% IN JUNE  </P> <P> The Casitas Municipal Water District is reporting a 25% reduction in water  usage in June compared with the same month last year.  </P> <P> The water company, which sells 40% of its water to Ventura residents and the  rest to those in the Ojai Valley, asked all its customers in April to  voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 20%.  </P> <P> Casitas customers, who used 2,485 acre-feet of water during June, 1989,  consumed only 1,861 acre-feet this June, said Richard Barnett, Casitas' chief  engineer.  </P> <P> But Barnett said that it is too soon to tell if voluntary conservation efforts  in the Ojai Valley will prevent the need for mandatory water rationing in the  future.  </P> <P> "A large part of that savings is probably Ventura," Barnett said Tuesday after  city officials reported that Ventura residents have cut water use by 25% since  the city started mandatory rationing two months ago.  </P> <P> Casitas officials had warned for several months prior to April that mandatory  rationing would go into effect next year if the voluntary program does not  succeed in cutting water use by at least 20% this year.  </P> <P> Barnett said the real test of voluntary conservation will occur during the next  three months when water usage is usually highest for agricultural and  residential irrigation.

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOTTAY PUPPETS ADDRESS SOME WEIGHTY QUESTIONS  </P> <P> Vi's in hot water. She's not sleeping with her husband anymore. Her kids think  she's a shadow of her former self and the endless news of war on her Sony sends  her into a suburban tizzy.  </P> <P> Vi's a 13-inch rod puppet -- as are most of the forlorn beings in her world.  Pulling the strings: New York visual artist, Janie Geiser, who uses puppets to  engage audiences about choices between involvement in social issues or passive  alienation.  </P> <P> While the former political activists from the '60s sit at home and watch  "thirtysomething," now, at least, there are puppets to rail against wars in  Central America and the Persian Gulf. It's a comment on a willingness to  delegate anything unpleasant and a lesson in creative enterprise.  </P> <P> Geiser's seven-member Jottay Theatre ensemble will present two West Coast  premieres -- "The House," co-written by Geiser and Neill Bogan, and "The Fish,"  based on a short story by Russell Banks -- at MOCA's Ahmanson Auditorium  tonight. Chip Epsten's score for toy piano and electric guitar will be  performed live.  </P> <P> Why use puppets to dramatize the dilemma of choosing between what Geiser calls  "helping only oneself" versus "also helping the world"? Wouldn't  flesh-and-blood human beings, in all their violence and greed, be more  appropriate for the role?  </P> <P> "There's something pretty mysterious and mythic about puppets, like  pre-classical Greek figures, that remind us about our essential humanity in a  way that can sometimes be startling enough to get people thinking," Geiser  replies.  </P> <P> "I suppose the puppets, in transcending class and race differences, get at  something eccentric and vulnerable in all of us," she says, "things that I  think powerful people, people with a lot to lose, don't want to think about."  </P> <P> Geiser believes that Vi's decision to jeopardize her cozy home life by spending  her entire day educating herself about the worldwide wars and genocide she had  once blocked out "may seem surreal but it's also very telling."  </P> <P> Vi discovers she has the magic ability to affect the outcome of global  conflicts by picturing them correctly in her mind.  </P> <P> In many cases, she forestalls plane crashes and ends conflict in the Persian  Gulf. For Geiser's part, the implications are obvious: "In a world so  dangerous, Vi learns that not only does she have a responsibility to be  informed, her actions seem to make a difference."  </P> <P> Does Geiser, 38, see any parallels between Vi and herself, the string-puller?  </P> <P> "It's always dangerous to make connections between puppets and their creators,"  she asserts. "But I do think that artists occupy a privileged role in society,  and we should use our position to try and lead ourselves out from our own dark  ages."  </P> <P> As a painter until age 30, Geiser remembers experiencing a "deep and strange  reaction" when visiting the Center for Puppetry Arts in her native Atlanta  (where most of Jottay Theatre's members live and work) and seeing Bread and  Puppet Theater and puppeteer Bruce D. Schwartz perform.  </P> <P> With no theatrical experience, but a desire to "make work that dealt with  political issues and that was live," she began learning about puppets from  scratch, discovering "a Geppetto love of puppet mechanics with rods and  strings" she never knew she had.  </P> <P> But Geiser wasn't content with Punch-and-Judy gimmicks. She began to  incorporate much of the gestural body work she saw in the New York dance-based  performance art scene and began overlaying live speaking roles (performed by  members in her troupe) with the puppets' silent actions.  </P> <P> These "puppet beings" -- who took on the appearance of Kabuki monsters and Paul  Klee children -- apparently touched a nerve when first seen in New York in  1985, and no less when Geiser dealt head-on with such controversial issues as  plague, serial killings and the abuses of leaders who lack compassion.  </P> <P> Last year she received a Bessie Award, the equivalent of an Academy Award in  the New York dance and performance art world.  </P> <P> But Geiser bristles at suggestions that it's the visual component of her work  that moves people the most.  </P> <P> "The visuals are just a tool to get the meat," she says. "Gosh, I would hate to  do something just because it looked nice or was pleasing to the eye.  </P> <P> "Even when I was painting, I was making these narrative dioramas, always  fascinated by the story of people and the forces that surround them, like in  Vi's case, where she finally encounters what all of us are looking for: a way  to give our lives meaning.  </P> <P> "My partners in Jottay Theatre -- who usually get little credit because they're  behind the scenes, pulling the strings -- and I are attracted to work that  moves closer to a more engaged relationship to the world -- even if it makes  you despair."  </P></p>

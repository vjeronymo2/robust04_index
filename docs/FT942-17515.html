			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Quality outshines fame and fortune JOHN STEINBECK: A BIOGRAPHY by Jay Parini Heinemann, Pounds 20, 614 pages Is it still true, as I suppose, that most people love reading John Steinbeck in their teens, yet only rarely return to him in their maturity? Was his friend John Hersey right when, explaining Steinbeck's astronomical sales, he said, 'Readers loved him. Even people who really did read books read Steinbeck'? Has persistent denigration by academic critics denied him his proper reputation notwithstanding his Nobel Prize? The virtue of this long but readable book is that Jay Parini, by achieving an excellent balance between biography and literary appreciation - always a difficult task - makes a strong case for the quality of Steinbeck's work in the course of a well-told life story. He establishes the structure with confident authority: the family homes in Salinas and Monterey; the unsatisfactory parents who nevertheless supported their son while he mastered his trade; the failure at Stanford; the early experience on the road, as labourer, rancher, sailor, solitary; the three wives, the alcohol and the depressions; the unfailing conviction of his vocation as writer; and then the breakthrough to worldwide success with Tortilla Flat, followed by Of Mice and Men and, in 1939,The Grapes of Wrath. Parini then moves deeper. He understands that the fame of The Grapes of Wrath - one of the great 'angry books', the instant classic which describes so unforgettably the plight of the Okies fleeing from the Dust Bowl - can mislead us about Steinbeck's true gifts. The 1930s may have been the period when the American novel went political but Steinbeck, an instinctive New Deal Democrat rather than a radical sophisticate, always knew that realism was, in his words, 'a dead end for the novel'. His own ambitions lay more in the myth-making function of the artist. He had a life-long obsession with the Arthurian legend (which is clear in Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row) and, arising out of his scientific bent, he held well-developed theories about the relationship between the individual and the larger social unit which he called the 'phalanx'. 'Man is a double thing,' he once wrote, 'a group animal and at the same time an individual. And it occurs to me that he cannot successfully be the second until he has fulfilled the first.' That is rather a good way of understanding The Grapes of Wrath. As Parini points out, this philosophy is not so far from Jung's Collective Unconscious, and it is particularly interesting to find that one of Steinbeck's close friends in pre-war Monterey was Joseph Campbell, later to become America's most influential mythologist. (This California group of 'whores, scientists, bums, winos and local artists' included Steinbeck's best friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, George Albee and John Cage, as well as Campbell, who had an affair with Carol Steinbeck which may have contributed to the eventual divorce.) Out of all this detail, Parini focuses on his argument: 'Like Joyce and Eliot and any number of other writers, Steinbeck used myth to organise his ideas and ground his work in archetypal patterns. The important point is that Steinbeck summoned a reality that was fresh and highly particularised, always trying to examine 'the group' and its effects on the individual.' There is a lovely line from Steinbeck's diary as he was writing Grapes - 'Carol says, stay with the detail'. After earning a mere Dollars 870 in his first seven years, Steinbeck took off. The critics soon decided that he had peaked already, but the public disagreed. There were to be films and plays and travel books and journalism, as well as more novels. Parini takes us smoothly through the fame and the fortune, the years as war correspondent, the move to New York, the bad second marriage and failure as a father, divorce and more drink and crisis, a happy third marriage, East of Eden and the screenplay of Viva Zapata]. Steinbeck wrote a book a year between 1931 and 1950 and was only defeated by his attempt on his beloved Malory, for which he moved to Glastonbury. These later years are told at a fast lick, but it would be churlish to complain. The argument of the book is not simply that Steinbeck is unfairly under-esteemed but that it is wrong of the critics to declare that his work declined after the famous bestsellers. Does Parini make his case? I suspect that he protests too much. But in order to be sure, I'll have to go back to the books - which is a good test of a good biography.</p>

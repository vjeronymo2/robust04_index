			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Lubbers returns to avert crisis The Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, cut short an official visit to Indonesia and returned home last night in an effort to defuse differences between his ruling Christian Democrat (CDA) party and the Labour coalition partners, with a general election only one month away. The coalition today faces a parliamentary debate over its handling of a police corruption scandal. The opposition may table a motion of no confidence in the run-up to the May polls. Yesterday, an independent NOVA/ANP opinion poll suggested that support for the CDA had plunged by a third since the 1989 elections to 19.5 per cent, putting it in last place among the four top parties now led by Labour. The main beneficiaries of voter dissatisfaction have been D66, a centrist party, the right-wing Liberals, and a number of smaller groups including those of the far-right.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: The rights and wrongs of forecasts Sir, Your leading article on the problems of economic forecasts ('Stormy forecasts', July 8) compares their reliability with weather forecasts. This is not just unfair to weather forecasters, but also ignores a fundamental difference between the two. Weather forecasts do not affect the weather, but forecasts of the economy do affect the economy. Forecasts of human behaviour or activity which are believed and acted upon tend to fall into two categories - self-fulfilling or self-defeating. Forecasts of the economy clearly fall into the latter category: if believed, they will prove wrong, if ignored they may prove correct. Economic forecasters thus have a choice. They can become influential and wrong, or ignored, but right. Peter Beck, Frant, East Sussex</p>

At the meeting Chief of the Society Kim Mu-chin said that  the  organisation was named "Sunflower Society" from motives of  holding in high esteem and following only the dear leader Mr.  Kim Chong-il as the sunflower invariably follows the sun any  time and anywhere.    He said:    "The dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il who imbues us with the  spirit of independence, unfolds a great program of reunification  and embraces the 70 million fellow countrymen in his bosom is  the destiny of our nation, its unified motherland and its future.    "Let us all become the loyal sunflower following the dear  leader Mr. Kim Chong-il, the sun of guidance, through  generations."    Member of the Society Sin Chong-su said that the hearts of  the members of the "Sunflower Society" following the dear leader  Mr. Kim Chong-il as sunflower follows the sun at all times  remain firm like a rock unshaken in any whirlwind and are  upright like pine and bamboo.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Development aid to be pooled in Pounds 1.4bn regional package ECONOMIC AID to England's regions is to be restructured in what ministers call one of the biggest upheavals in Whitehall's relations with local government in 14 years of Conservative rule. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said under the reform local people would have more influence over spending. But the restructuring plan prompted scepticism among opposition MPs who think it could be accompanied by heavy development grant cuts in the Budget at the end of this month. Under the reform, six government departments will pool their separate regional aid programmes in areas such as housing development, education support and business development in a single budget. The overall programme will be administered by a new cabinet committee from April next year, to be headed by Mr Gummer. Until now the aid programmes have been administered by the Home Office and the Departments of Trade and Industry, Environment, Education, Employment and Transport. The new committee will administer a budget of about Pounds 1.4bn in 1994-95, some Pounds 300m less than the combined budgets of the 20 aid programmes last year. Mr Gummer also launched an invitation to civic and business leaders in London, Birmingham and Manchester to define what practical steps they may want to take in the area of urban regeneration. Under two programmes, called City Pride and London Pride, Mr Gummer said he planned to explore with civic and business leaders 'how they could build on their strengths and come forward with a vision for their areas expressed in practical terms'.</p>

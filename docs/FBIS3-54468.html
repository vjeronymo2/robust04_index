In his answer, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi announced that "the  Voice and Vision organization is managed under the supervision  of the exalted leader. It has therefore always been the closest  body to the exalted leader and the leadership."[.sup]1[/] Yet  His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i, the exalted leader of the  Islamic revolution, recently said clearly in answer to a letter  from the speaker of the Majles that the Voice and Vision  organization was not to answer the Majles, and said that doing  this was not justifiable.    The Majles is the only power that has the right to inquire,  investigate, and evaluate the performance of all the nation's  organizations. The deputies can even interpellate the ministers  and the government. Can those who have been investigated use the  Voice and Vision organization to defend themselves again?    Mr. Mohammad Hashemi first laid the groundwork for heresy  during the Majles vote of confidence for the minister of  petroleum, and yesterday he continued in this. During the Majles  vote of confidence for the minister of petroleum, an opponent  discussed the bad performance of an organization affiliated with  this ministry. An opportunity to respond was afforded both to  the minister and to supporters, and this matter was concluded.  However, a long time after the vote of confidence for the  ministers, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi broadcast that organization's  answer over the Majles radio. During Engineer Yahyavi's response  to this act, in an insulting response, with disrespect and  sarcasm concerning Engineer Yahyavi's 10 years of imprisonment  in the Iraqi Government's black pits, he defended what he did.    This time Mr. Mohammad Hashemi used the national radio  network. He repeatedly interrupted regular programming to insult  the Majles deputies.    Can Mr. Hashemi, without the approval of the exalted leader,  turn the Voice and Vision into a personal forum, when it should  be broadcasting the views of the vice-regency of the chief  jurisconsult, and use it to revile and abuse people who came to  the Majles by a direct vote of the people?    2. In his answer Mr. Mohammad Hashemi says that before the  inquiry and investigation he went to the Majles commission and  divided the people of society into two groups, those who support  and those who oppose the Voice and Vision organization. He said  that the hypocrites, the leftist groups, the Hojjatieh Society  and those who support America, Israel, and the monarchists are  the main opponents. Then, clearly interfering in the work of the  commission, he protested the fact that Mr. Parvaresh is a member  of this commission. What must be done with someone who was in  America during the heat of the revolution and is now saying that  deputies elected by the people have the intellectual qualities  of the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh Society? Do such heavy  accusations against the deputies of the people conform to  Islamic culture or American culture, especially when he attacks  Mr. Parvaresh, who went to prison, was abused by the accursed  shah, is reviled by the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh, and served  as minister and deputy Majles speaker for several terms after  the revolution?    Before the Inquiry and Investigation Commission began its  work, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi told them that those who oppose him  will be considered supporters of Israel, the hypocrites, and the  Hojjatieh. We have seen that he made those very accusations  against the commission's members after the inquiry and  investigation report was read. Notice: "The intellectual  qualities of some of the insensitive members of the Inquiry and  Investigation Group is clear: Hojjatieh and  hypocrites!"[.sup]2[/]    Things similar to this have been reflected repeatedly in the  answers from the Voice and Vision organization.    3. One of the reasons some officials feel immunity and  easily  step out of their domain is the judiciary's failure to  investigate their crimes promptly. We remember how, during the  election for president of the republic, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi  took it upon himself, in violation of the law, to publish a  statement against one of the candidates for president of the  republic, or to edit his speech, a measure that met with the  exalted leader's opposition. If the judiciary had promptly  investigated the complaints of these candidates, the supervisor  of the Voice and Vision organization would not have dared this  time to deal in this ugly and damaging way with the sacred body  of the Majles.    God forbid, if the judiciary does not deal with such crimes,  it will lead to insecurity and increased insults and accusations  against government bodies and the elected deputies to the Majles.

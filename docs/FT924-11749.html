			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons up on broker sentiment PHARMACEUTICALS group Fisons bucked the dreary performance in the sector as one of the stock's principal bears changed tack. The shares jumped to 238p at one stage and closed 9 higher at 224p on heavy turnover of 6.9m. The stock received a boost at first as a result of heavy buying in the traded options market. Then, investment bank BZW, which has fought shy of Fisons for around five years, came out with a more positive story after a meeting with chief executive Mr Cedric Scroggs. BZW said that it had not officially changed forecasts or recommendations but had been discussing a 'qualitative story' with clients. Others in the market said Mr Scroggs had been enthusiastic about the potential for two products still awaiting US approval and had persuaded BZW to increase its profit forecast from the current Pounds 140m. It is also expected that the house will upgrade its present 'hold' recommendation. Recs retreat The regional electricity companies (Recs) retreated in busy trading as one broker cut its dividend growth forecast and others hinted they may follow. Shares in Southern, the only Rec in the FTSE 100, fell 15 to 376p on heavy turnover of 2.7m. Kleinwort Benson said that lower inflation meant that the Recs' level of dividend increase could not be sustained and that this year's 13 per cent forecast rise was likely to be only 10 per cent. However, other electricity stock watchers added that political considerations would also overhang the rate of dividend increase, with the Recs being put under pressure to rein in the rise until the controversy over pit closures blows over. Ms Rachel Lucas at County NatWest said: 'While the political climate will make the Recs careful at the November interims, I think the full-year dividend rate of increase will show no decline.' There was also additional pressure on the Recs yesterday as some in the market considered them overvalued, with a switch into the water stocks being recommended. Eastern fell 14 to 366p, London 18 to 393p, Midlands 20 to 403p and Yorkshire 20 to 433p. Royals speculation Troubled Royal Insurance was the focus of strong speculation early yesterday. Turnover expanded as a takeover rumours swept the market and one broker prepared a buy recommendation. The shares jumped 12 and the possibility of a bid was enough to drive the shares higher, leaving a number of traders short of stock across the board. Once its effect had been felt, the rumour, which featured German insurer Allianz, died away. However, some analysts also argued that mortgage indemnity problems, which affect Royal particularly badly, were likely to lessen as a result of much lower base rates. Then Credit Lyonnais Laing put out a hefty buy note, arguing that despite the very real problems of mortgage indemnity the shares were undervalued. Royal shares closed a net 7 higher at 216p with 8.5m traded, the heaviest turnover since the group passed its final dividend in February. High street drugs group Boots tumbled after one leading house recommended profit-taking amid a general sentiment in the market that the stock had overrun. The shares closed 14 adrift at 479p in heavy turnover of 2.7m. County NatWest believes that recent optimism surrounding the group may have been overdone. It cites falling drug margins and dull high street sales in Boots' competitors as evidence to impinge on what it expects to be otherwise 'excellent interim results next month'. Exploration and production group Lasmo saw heavy turnover in the underlying shares and traded options as one analyst pointed to a 'lemming-like rush for stock'. Investors were worried about being caught out by the currency-related rise in E&amp;P stocks but preferred Lasmo to Enterprise because of the overhang of stock created by the latter's recent US share issue. Lasmo gained 3 to 191p, making a gain of 26 this week, on turnover of 6.9m shares. Enterprise lifted 7 to 439p. Turnover in Lucas Industries jumped to 14m after Hoare Govett was said to have placed around 1 per cent of the company's shares. In a mid-morning deal, the stockbroker was thought to have bought a block of 7m at 104p, and quickly passed it on at 105p, though the original seller remained unknown. The shares closed a penny lower at 105p, having touched 110 earlier in the session. The automotive and aerospace components group remains the subject of bid speculation with international conglomerate BTR put forward as a potential predator. There was another day's hectic activity in the building and property sectors as institutions continued to shop around in the hope of climbing aboard for the long-awaited recovery. However, analysts continued to caution against any sustained rise on the back of this week's government pronouncements. The building materials sector was enlivened with talk of a bid for Blue Circle, the shares jumping 7 to 153p in good turnover of 4.7m. Dealers said that packaging group Carnaud Metalbox, off 5 at 2045p, was the rumoured predator. Among housebuilders, second-liners were in demand. Berkeley Group rose 11 to 240p, Bryant 6 to 90p and Laing 12 to 190p. Costain Group was steady at 25p with 16m traded, the highest of the day. Property group Land Securities ran into a bout of selling, the shares slipping 11 to 421p. Analysts said Wednesday's rise had been overdone and worries over the group's dividend returned. Instead investors turned their attention to MEPC, up 15 to 323p and again to the second-line stocks. Bank stocks were very firm in active trading as most houses reassessed their value. Lloyds, the quality play, lifted 10 to 434p and troubled Barclays also lifted 10 to 334p with 15m traded. Abbey National, the most highly geared to an upturn in the housing market, lifted 5 to 331p with 11m shares traded. The principal pharmaceutical stocks were weak as US interest died away and a few stories provided an excuse to sell. Some analysts talked of a US press article which pointed out the disparity between drug prices in the US and Canada; there is a feeling that if Mr Bill Clinton is elected president he will clamp down on US pharmaceutical prices. There was also reasonable selling of Glaxo American Depositary Receipts in the UK. This was followed by reports of a negative press story on Glaxo's asthma product Serevent. Glaxo fell 19 to 776p. A maintained dividend by Albert Fisher sent the shares forward in early trading. But a cautious meeting with analysts pulled the shares back and they closed 1 1/2 off at 40 1/2 p. Turnover was a very heavy 12.5m. Profit-taking advice from Hoare Govett and Panmure Gordon was said to have held Unilever back, the shares dropping 17 to 1077p. Shares in international conglomerate BTR fell 7 to 497p early in the day after broker County NatWest advised a switch out of the stock and into Hanson. In a note set to land on investors' desks today, County said: 'For many years Hanson and BTR were given similar multiples. However, Hanson now trades at a substantial discount to BTR. We belive that the differential between the two is no longer justified.' The strong market trend later helped BTR recover some of the lost ground and it closed a penny easier at 503p on trade of 5.5m shares, while Hanson gained 2 to 232p, with some 8.6m shares dealt by the close. The market was cheered by GKN's north American expansion plans and the shares jumped 18 to 414p. Chemicals group BOC fell 10 to 730p as Hoare Govett moved from a buy to a hold.

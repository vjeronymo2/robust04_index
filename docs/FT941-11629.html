			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Honda considers keeping Rover link The first tentative signs emerged yesterday that Honda is not considering quickly severing its ties with Rover in the wake of BMW's planned takeover of the British carmaker. This came as a Honda vice-president, who sits on Rover's board, began talks in the UK on Honda's options. Officials at Honda Motor Europe's headquarters in Reading began to distance Rover from the actions of its parent, British Aerospace, which announced the Pounds 800m sale to BMW on Monday. 'Why should we be angry with Rover; it was a BAe decision to sell to BMW,' said Mr Chris Rogers, HME's spokesman. Mr Yoshihide Munekuni, Honda's director on the Rover board, arrived yesterday for talks with HME's president, Mr Shojiro Miyake. Mr Munekuni was expected also to meet BAe officials. It is believed that he was keen to review the situation with Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman and BAe's deputy chief executive. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has made it clear that he hopes Honda will maintain its alliance with Rover. He plans to go to Tokyo next week to meet Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's chief executive. Publicly, Honda in Tokyo has been cool towards the prospect of such talks. However, HME officials accept that a dialogue with BMW must be opened. 'We will have to talk. There was a great deal of disappointment and genuine shock that our trust in what has been a very long-term partnership should appear misplaced. But now we have to start deciding on our European strategy options,' said Mr Rogers. Honda said yesterday: 'We are still shell-shocked and it is far too early' to discuss the future of most of the projects between Honda and Rover. However, Mr Miyake confirmed that one, at least, would not be affected - the sale of Land Rover's Discovery model through Honda's sales networks in Japan, badged as the Honda Crossroads. The agreement runs for three years. Honda's dismay at the way the deal was done is shared by many inside Rover. While recognising that BMW had much to recommend it, Rover managers privately expressed anger at the treatment administered to Honda. 'We have worked closely with Honda colleagues for 15 years and we have built up both liking and a deep mutual respect,' said one. Some industry analysts have predicted that Honda will at least allow existing and planned collaborations to run their course. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

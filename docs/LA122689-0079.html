			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA: DEATH OF A DICTATOR;  </P> <P> FULLERTON RESIDENT REPORTED KILLED;  </P> <P> FIGHTING: IONEL ANTIMIE WAS DELIVERING AID TO FRIENDS. HIS FAMILY BELIEVES HE  WAS SHOT BY FORCES LOYAL TO CEAUSESCU.  </P> <P> A 21-year-old man who fled his native Romania for Orange County four years ago  but who returned last week with a brother to visit his girlfriend and bring  medical supplies for friends and relatives was reportedly shot to death, his  family said Monday.  </P> <P> On a grim Christmas Day, the family of Ionel (John) Antimie waited anxiously at  their home in Fullerton for further word from friends or family members in  Romania, where continued fighting made communication difficult if not  impossible.  </P> <P> But they already believe the worst.  </P> <P> "He is gone," said one cousin who joined about a dozen other relatives at  Antimie's house Sunday after hearing the report. "All that is left are the  pictures."  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Philip Covington said U.S. officials cannot confirm  the incident but are investigating it.  </P> <P> "We're taking the report very seriously," Covington said. "We're looking into  it."  </P> <P> Ionel Antimie helped run a family construction business in Fullerton with his  father, Ion, and several brothers, among them Constantine, 32, who traveled to  Romania with him. Ionel Antimie was a four-year resident of the city but not  yet a U.S. citizen.  </P> <P> No U.S. citizens have been reported killed in the recent spate of violence that  has accompanied the overthrow of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The U.S.  government does not normally track injuries or deaths to American residents who  are not citizens.  </P> <P> "The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens is our highest priority," Covington  said. The whereabouts of a U.S. resident such as Antimie, he said, "would be a  little bit lower on our priority list."  </P> <P> The brothers' family said they are convinced that Antimie was gunned down by  Ceausescu security forces. Their belief, they said, is based on a phone call  they received Sunday from a friend who had been in touch with Constantine.  </P> <P> The two brothers left Orange County nine days ago, before public reports of the  massacre of protesters by Ceausescu forces and the subsequent outbreak of some  of Europe's worst urban warfare since World War II. Ionel Antimie had been  planning to visit his girlfriend, Angelica Hij, 16, a resident of the city of  Cluj.  </P> <P> But as the chaos erupted in Romania, the brothers changed their plans, family  members said. As they waited in Germany, the two gathered food and medical  supplies -- "thousands of dollars" worth, according to their father, who spoke  with them before they left Germany. Then they entered Romania, apparently from  Yugoslavia, with plans to offer what aid they could to friends and relatives.  </P> <P> The men's father said he was worried about his sons' entering Romania but that  "I accepted it because the people needed food and medicine."  </P> <P> The family said they believe that Ionel and Constantine were driving to Cluj  over the weekend when their rental car was ordered to stop by security forces  still loyal to Ceausescu. They believe, they said, that the uniformed police  shot Ionel Antimie but that Constantine was able to jump from the car and flee.  </P> <P> Constantine reportedly told friends in Portland, who were able to get a call  through to Romania, that he returned to the site of the shooting with friends  and retrieved his brother's body.  </P> <P> Ion Antimie, who also lives in Fullerton, said that this Christmas, already  soured by the reports of widespread bloodshed in his homeland, was "the worst  and the most sorrowful day of my life."  </P></p>

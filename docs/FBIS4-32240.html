			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edward Krzemien: "Facing Government Alone; </F> Olechowski Suspending His Resignation Until July?"]    [Text]To prevent losing access to diplomatic posts  for their party colleagues, the whole government is rejecting a  reform of the Foreign Affairs Ministry [MSZ] proposed by Foreign  Minister Olechowski. In the meantime, the minister is not  giving up.    That is why the conflict between the MSZ and the government,  which has been concealed for some time, erupted anyway.  Yesterday the Council of Ministers rejected the draft of a new  MSZ statute which attempted to divide the ministry into a  political and a civilian part. Debate on the draft by the  Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] has been pending for  almost two months.    Two weeks ago, GAZETA WYBORCZA reported that a delay in the  decision may lead to a resignation by Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski, who denied the reports while hoping for an agreement  with URM.    But the Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party  coalition regarded its control over MSZ as more important.  According to the coalition's chief politicians, the reform  being proposed by Olechowski permanently forecloses access for  the coalition to posts in this prestigious ministry.    It is a decision that I cannot accept -- an angered  Olechowski told reporters. I failed to obtain the support of  any minister during today's session. When asked whether, in  this situation, he still rules out his dismissal, Olechowski  refused to answer: The foreign minister's position is such that  if he is a responsible and diligent man, then he cannot go  around talking about a resignation any time he pleases. And  then he ended the discussion in an even more determined manner:  We are in a period of intensive international measures which in  my view are of historical importance. So I refuse to answer  such questions at all.    As we found out unofficially from a very well-informed  source, if it were not for the upcoming visit by U.S. President  Clinton to Warsaw on 6 and 7 July, Olechowski would not have  hesitated to submit an ostentatious resignation yesterday. But  if he fails to come to an agreement with Pawlak and the  coalition in the near future, the question of resignation will  be just a question of time.    The debate is to be continued and decisions should be made  in  June or July, not later than that -- Olechowski said. I regard  the July deadline as a borderline one, and a further delay of  the reforms would be very hard for me to accept. When asked by  a reporter what he meant by "borderline deadline," Olechowski  replied: It means what you just heard. After July, comes August.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING THE WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> The Times should be lauded for publishing an unpopular alternative drug plan  ("Anyone Care What Works?" by Ethan Nadelmann, Op-Ed Page, Sept. 6). The  trouble with Nadelmann's plan is that it does not go far enough.  </P> <P> Heretofore, it may be true that government has respected free enterprise and  just taxed and regulated "sins." But drugs are such a big "sin" that government  will have to get directly involved.  </P> <P> The best way to kill this "blue chip" $110-billion business is to have the U.S.  government take it over. Set up government drug stores, register users and sell  drugs at a fair market price which will drive illegal dealers out of business.  And if it doesn't, cite them as we now do bootleggers and bookies. Define drug  abuse and addiction as social-mental diseases requiring treatment and  hospitalization. Circulate lists of users to employers, schools, military  services, government agencies, etc. Inform parents of use by minors, and  require that parents try to stop drug abuse in the home.  </P> <P> With the profits that even government would somehow manage to make, for the  first few years at least, we could treat addicts, and build and fund special  hospitals and halfway houses. We would free penitentiary cells, court calendars  could be cleared and the police and military could go back to chasing muggers.  And maybe the gangs would go back to spraying graffiti and just shooting one  another.  </P> <P> For the "less fortunate" who cannot afford drugs, we could give drug stamps and  clean needles. Perhaps then our persons, homes and cars would be safer.  </P> <P> Am I serious? As serious as were Voltaire, Mark Twain and Will Rogers.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE M. FISCHBACH  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

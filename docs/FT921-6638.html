			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (8): Welcome hints for travellers FIRST IMPRESSIONS on arrival in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, are of a modern, efficient airport. While customs and immigration procedures are smooth - one may be required to pay an entry fee of Dollars 10 - it is advisable to make sure that baggage is retrieved early. If it is not claimed soon, it could take another visit to the airport - costly to scheduled meetings - to get hold of it. Foreign currency should be changed as early as possible to cover local costs, such as taxi fares. Prominent signs throughout the city warn that it is a criminal offence to use foreign currency to settle transactions. This does not apply to the fee for entering the country and that airport tax, also of Dollars 10, which is payable on departure. The major hotels in Santo Domingo are located close to the main business districts, and taxis are freely available. As these are not metered, it is advisable to determine the cost of the trip before setting out. Rates stated at the hotels are usually ignored by drivers who set their own. Telecommunications from the Dominican Republic are efficient, although callers to Europe may experience delays because of limited circuits. The hotels are equipped with their own electricity generators so guests do not suffer unduly from the frequent power cuts which are common to the city. Dominicans are usually willing to meet you at short notice, although it would make for a better management of an itinerary if meetings are set up beforehand. Dominican time is equally flexible, and some delay in appointments is not unusual. The Dominican Republic also offers the business visitor a wide range of after-hours activities. The city is blessed with many fine restaurants with an international and local menu. One may even dine elegantly in a cave. The colonial section of Santo Domingo, which is being restored, is worth a visit, particularly this year when Dominicans are marking the quincentenary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean. A stroll through the old city will provide a close view of buildings erected in as early as the first decade of the 16th century, including the Columbus palace and several art galleries and museums dedicated to the colonial period. The cathedral, which Dominicans say is the oldest in the Americas, has what are claimed to be the remains of Christopher Columbus. The country has many fine beaches and resorts. Located in La Romana, to the east of Santo Domingo, is the Casa de Campo resort spread over several square miles. On the north coast, Puerto Plata is a growing resort with several beach front hotels.</p>

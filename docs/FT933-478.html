			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Fresh poll urged on power prices BIG INDUSTRIAL energy users are demanding a fresh poll of members of the electricity pool over proposed reforms which they believe will be ineffective in bringing down electricity prices. The Energy Intensive Users Group yesterday claimed that its members' interests had not been properly represented in the August poll. The pool had agreed changes in bidding procedures which it said could bring prices down by between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent.</p>

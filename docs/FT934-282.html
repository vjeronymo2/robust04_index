			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record run maintained on Christmas Eve - Market report Enthusiasm continued to run high on the London stock market on Christmas Eve, when the Footsie pushed through 3,400 to yet higher peaks as investors anticipated a cut in UK base rates early in January. Confidence in economic recovery was encouraged by reports from Britain's leading retailers that sales had risen nationally by 13pc-17pc over the past fortnight; record sales of mobile phones provided the iceing on the Christmas retail cake. The FT-SE Index closed at a new peak of 3,412.3, a gain of 15.8 on overnight and only a touch below the new intra-day peak chalked up just before trading closed. The final week of pre-Christmas trading saw the Footsie brush off the expected attempted profit-taking to return to the upward trend as futures markets indicated the underlyingly bullish investment view. Share prices have been squeezed higher by a severe shortage of stock as marketmakers have struggled to meet unexpected demand from the institutions. Although the extended Christmas equity account does not close until the end of this month, traders have become wary of leaving dealing positions exposed over a period when most major stocks markets will be closed for several days. Some houses still held short positions on Friday morning and were active buyers of stock. Also at a new closing peak was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, with a gain of 10.4 bringing a final figure of 3,773.2. The Mid 250 stocks have proved volatile but have attracted increasing interest from both professional and private investors. Although equity trading volumes were naturally reduced for the half-day Christmas Eve session, statistics on retail, or customer, business confirmed that investment in the UK stock market remained above average for pre-Christmas weeks. Stock index futures continued to provide a strong lead for share prices. In pre-futures trading, the equity market was little changed from overnight but when the March contract opened with a good premium, shares began to move ahead, and the Footsie showed a gain of about 11 points after half an hour of official trading. Morning meetings at the City's leading securities firms were somewhat lightly attended but most analysts had already put together their lists of recommended share buys. Traders were warned not to relax their grip of a market which could well see further activity in the final sessions of the year. Fund managers are expected to take any opportunity offered to top up their portfolios with stocks in those sectors which have led the market forward since the Budget at the end of November. Substantial gains in the banking sector again provided the market's strongest feature as dividend confidence continued to drive the sector forward. The rest of the financial sector also remained very firm, although the merchant banks, which have benefited strongly from their active association with the securities markets, traded more calmly. Leading store shares, which have shown some caution while awaiting news on Christmas trading, looked firmer although there was no rush to buy the shares. Seaq volume ended at 242.1m shares for the half-session, compared with 885.4m for the full session of the previous day. On Thursday, retail volume was worth Pounds 1.86bn, at the top end of daily averages for the year.</p>

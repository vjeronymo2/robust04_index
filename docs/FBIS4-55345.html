			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry on Thursday [12 May] condemned Muslim attacks on Brcko.  Moscow believes that such attacks lead to further escalation of  conflicts and that they are especially dangerous prior to the  forthcoming ministerial conference in Geneva. The chief  diplomats of the United States, Russia and the European Union  and officials of the United Nations will meet in Geneva on  Friday to try to definitively determine the framework for a  political settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The situation around the Serb town of Brcko in the north of  Bosnia is currently at the focus of attention of political  organs and the media in Moscow. Radio and television stations  broadcast the news that the U.N. Security Council had condemned  the Muslim attack on Brcko in which four civilians were killed  and 13 wounded. It is believed here that the current situation  in Bosnia, especially around Brcko, does not inspire a great  deal of hope for an early settlement of the conflict.    Official sources here say that on both sides -- Serb and  Muslim -- there are forces inclined to military confrontation  who believe that a political settlement is impossible. Moscow  has announced that its position in Geneva will be `very  resolute' but it is not clear whether it will make any new  proposals. Russia insists on an agreement that the warring  sides resume talks as soon as possible. If this is not  achieved, the war could continue indefinitely and the  consequences could be disastrous, official sources in Moscow  maintain.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL FANS MOURN LOSS OF COMMISSIONER WITH GENUINE SORROW  </P> <P> When the shock wears off, Bart Giamatti's memory will turn into an everlasting  legacy.  </P> <P> In his five months as commissioner, he proved to us that nobody could take away  the pride and integrity of major league baseball. But most of all, he  demonstrated to us how we should protect the game. His respect and love for the  game showed us the perfect commissioner. We should take note, because we need  more people in this world like Bart Giamatti.  </P> <P> GARY ROBERT FENTON, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

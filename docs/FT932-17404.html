			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Things will never be the same again: For better or for worse, today, April Fool's Day, sees the launch of a range of measures from care in the community to council tax. FT reporters pick out some of the fresh starts in the private and the public sectors THE APRIL 1 change that will affect most people is the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax. The council tax has won more general acceptance than the poll tax, which prompted rioting on the streets and resignations among Tory councillors and contributed to Mrs Thatcher's downfall. The change returns local taxation to a property base, loosely relating it to ability to pay. The task of putting every home into one of eight valuation bands was completed late last year, but only from today can a householder appeal against the ruling. The government has provided for up to 1m appeals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there will be many appeals to move down to a cheaper band, but some people may appeal to move up a band in the belief that the suggestion of a higher house value is worth a small rise in tax. The bill for a two-person household in a band C (Pounds 52,000-68,000) home varies from Pounds 704 in Newcastle upon Tyne to Pounds 218 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Unemployment: Many unemployed people will be affected by today's launch of the Training for Work scheme, which combines Employment Training, the main training scheme for the adult jobless, with Employment Action, the work experience scheme. At any time there will be 150,000 people on the scheme, with about 320,000 opportunities in any year. It has a budget of Pounds 936m in 1993-94 - Pounds 40m less than spending on ET and EA this year - and cuts training from 26 weeks to 14 weeks. Homelessness: For the homeless in central London today is the first day without their nine winter shelters, closed yesterday. The Pounds 1.5m programme to help people sleeping rough had provided 400 extra bed spaces in the shelters. Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment minister, said those still using them would be found alternative accommodation. Business: West Yorkshire's main business communities of Leeds and Bradford today partially bury their old rivalry by merging most functions of their chambers of commerce and industry. Each will continue to represent business in its area, but services will be run by a joint company, with equal numbers of directors from Leeds and Bradford. Its offices are likely to be in Pudsey, which is officially in Leeds, and has a Leeds postcode, but parts of it have Bradford telephone numbers. Coal: Contracts by which British Coal will sell coal worth Pounds 5.5bn to the electricity generators over five years and provide a future for 19 mines  -12 reprieved, six mothballed and one to be developed - take effect today following months of wrangling over the contracts which were finally signed earlier this week. The protracted wrangling was one reason why last week's coal white paper was not able to guarantee a future for a further 19 mines which have been reprieved or mothballed. Uncertainty over their fate will continue while British Coal negotiates additional contracts with the generators. The generators have contracted to sell the power produced to the regional electricity companies for about Pounds 13bn. Health: A total of 132 National Health Service hospitals, community services and ambulance services become trusts managing their own day-to-day affairs. It is the third wave since the launch of the government's health reforms in 1991. When a fourth wave comes on stream next April almost all hospital and community services will be delivered by locally managed trusts. Army: The army's new baby is the Royal Logistic Corps, formed from the Royal Corps of Transport, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Pioneer Corps, the Army Catering Corps and the postal and courier services of the Royal Engineers. BBC: Not everyone at the corporation is laughing on April Fool's Day, which sees the start of Producer Choice - the system which will give producers full control of their budgets. Many people are expected to lose their jobs in the process. Humour: Appropriately, April 1 sees the launch of The Cartoonist, a fortnightly newspaper devoted to cartoons. The publication, which costs Pounds 1.20, will follow the format of a national newspaper with cartoons on politics and current events in the front half and sports at the back.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW AGENCIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                                   Department              Staff  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Army Base Repair Organisation          Defence                 3,800 Chessington Computer Centre            Cabinet Office            450 Child Support Agency                   Northern Ireland          700 Government Property Lawyers            Treasury Solicitor        130 Paymaster General's Office             Treasury                  855 Pesticide Safety Directorate           Agriculture               170 Prison Service Agency                  Home Office            37,420 Royal Parks                            National Heritage         260 Scottish Office Pensions Agency        Scottish Office           185 Scottish Prison Service                Scottish Office         4,600 Scottish Record Office                 Scottish Office           125 Social Security Child Support Agency   Social Security         3,500 Valuation and Lands Agency             Northern Ireland          360 TOTAL                                                         52,555  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This brings the total to 89 agencies employing more than 350,000 civil servants, 60 per cent of the total  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

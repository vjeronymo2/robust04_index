			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Turning over a new leaf to reveal vital statistics IT IS still not too late for a final New Year resolution. As the festive excesses fade, the first accountancy column of 1992 offers a chance for certain influential readers to turn over a new leaf and respond to growing pressure to expose one of their most vital statistics. There is still time for action during the current year. The larger UK accountancy firms collaborate each spring to reveal several useful and comparable figures on their financial performance for the year to March 31, which are published in early summer. They show fee income, broken down by the increasingly diverse divisions within each firm: audit, management consultancy, insolvency and so on. It is also normally possible to gather figures for the number of partners and salaried staff for the period. But one crucial figure is always missing: the level of profit. Inside each firm, few salaried staff have accurate information on the money taken home by their partners. Outside the profession, an even smaller number can do no more than guess. A handful of the firms with more open attitudes do provide data for internal consumption. Some headhunters - and staff recruiters within the different firms - can make calculated guesses from the declared income of job seekers. Most others, including accountants' clients and the general public, are left in ignorance. The absence of a profit figure makes it impossible to arrive at any realistic estimate of financial performance for the firms, several of which are big businesses by any standard. The highest earning firm, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, declared fee income last year of Pounds 588m. The potential ambiguity from fee income alone is arguably greater than ever this year. Revenues may have continued to rise for most of the top 20 firms during 1991 in spite of the recession. But without a profit figure, there is no way of calculating elements like the cost of buildings and other overheads, the contribution to income from firms that were acquired or merged, and the amount generated by discounting on fees to win new business, all significant factors. Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, sees no justification for disclosure. He asserts that partnerships are privately-owned bodies which are not legally obliged to reveal profits, so there is no reason why they should. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has no official policy on the subject. 'It is a proprietary matter for firms themselves,' says Mr Henry Gold, technical director. 'Some people no doubt find it a little ironic that at the same time as accountants are championing full disclosure in their client companies, they are not revealing their own profits,' he says. 'But the difference is easily explained by the law.' Yet there are moves for reform. Privately, a number of the senior partners in accountancy firms state that they would be willing to release profit information under certain conditions. In the late 1970s, Arthur Andersen did produce worldwide accounts, including figures on average partner earnings, which were even audited by a large competitor. But the practice was discontinued within two years, partly, it appears, because of embarrassment about the large sums earned by the partners. The issue remains potent for Andersen, which had more than 14 staff to each partner in the UK last year (more than any of the other large firms) and hence fewer people with whom to share the profits. 'Practices are very wary of letting staff know what their partners earn,' says Mr Patrick Porter, manager of the public practice division at Robert Half, a recruitment firm. 'Accountancy is quite well paid, but the differential between partners' earnings and staff salaries is quite large.' 'Everybody would find it helpful if they were disclosed,' he adds. 'It would let us know which practices are doing well and are appropriate to do business with.' But he concedes that it might make partnerships more vulnerable to negative publicity and even takeover fears. The accountancy firms say that revealing profits would lead to misinterpretation. Partnership 'profits' are deceptively large, because  - unlike company directors' remuneration - they reflect the reward for owning and holding unlimited liability in the business, and compensate for benefits not offered by the firms such as pension contributions. In consequence, most firms say they will only publish profits figures if their competitors do the same, so that fairer comparisons can be made. Some stretch that to include other forms of partnership, most notably surveyors and law firms. In fact, the American Lawyer magazine began publishing an annual table of US law partnership revenues and profits in 1985. It is now widely accepted and used within the profession. Mr Steven Brill, editor and publisher, says: 'There was initial hostility, but now firms strive to co-operate. Our biggest problem is too much co-operation - some of the figures look fudged.' He argues that the tables offer law firms, clients and job-hunters valuable market information to show how to assess their rivals. He believes the comparisons have been used extensively as a benchmark by some competing firms which scrutinise each others' costs and profits. 'In any free market there is some good to be had from the free flow of information,' he says. 'The firms are such large institutions, employing so many people and consulted so widely that the value of this information is quite high.' In contrast, Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed International and chairman of the technical committee of the 100 Group of finance directors of leading companies, says he is not aware of strong calls for greater disclosure by accountants in the UK. 'Profit per partner would not be sufficient information to judge the performance of a firm,' he says. 'You would need to measure the ability of a partner to come up with extra capital if required. That involves levels of personal disclosure which we could not expect.' Nevertheless, he does welcome the amendment to the Companies Act introduced last year which will force publication of non-audit fees charged to a company by its auditors. He believes reliance on an individual client is the issue most likely to threaten the survival or independence of an accountancy firm. Others argue that the existing levels of fee income declared each year may be suspect, since disclosure is voluntary and the figures are not audited. There are fears that a single additional statistic on profits could be equally unreliable. 'Personally I'm quite relaxed about it,' says Mr Nick Land, London managing partner for Ernst &amp; Young. 'I don't feel defensive about my income - as long as everyone else publishes their profits so we are not giving away competitive advantage, and the figures are comparable.' He acknowledges that pressure is likely to grow with the perception that the large accountancy firms are changing from partnerships into large corporate entities with responsibilities to reveal more information. A final thought: If accountants were to disclose their profits this year, it is likely that at least some would be embarrassed by partners' losses rather than largesse. But at least they would have a low base from which to increase profits over the coming decade.</p>

Bosniaks in Bosnia and Sandzak are one people and have been  living in the same state since the Berlin Congress in 1878. This  congress had passed a decision whereby the Bosnia-Herzegovina  borders were redrawn, Sandzak was separated from Bosnia and  divided between Serbia and Montenegro. From 1878 to 1945 the  people of Sandzak were under various forms of pressure and  emigrated to Bosnia and Turkey. The pressure on Muslims in  Sandzak increased after the disintegration of Yugoslavia and  reached its peak during the war in Bosnia. Organized state  terror against the Bosniak minority has caused a new wave of  emigration of Muslims from Sandzak not dissimilar to ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The focus of world attention on the tragedy in Bosnia has  pushed our people outside Bosnia into the background. These  people are exposed to the terror of the same forces and people  who had planned and carried out the genocide in Bosnia.    Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia are actively involved in the  Geneva talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this way conditions are  created for a global settlement of the national status of Serbs  and Croats, as well as the status of Muslims in former  Yugoslavia. It is obvious that the issue of the Bosniak people  outside Bosnia cannot be resolved by temporarily sending a  working group from Sandzak, which took part in the Conference on  Former Yugoslavia in London, The Hague, and Geneva. Therefore,  I think it necessary to accede to the demand of the Sandzak  Muslim National Council to include representatives of this  council in the talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina as an interested  party, we read in President Izetbegovic's letter to the  cochairmen of the Peace Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

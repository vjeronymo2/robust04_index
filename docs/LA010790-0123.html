			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO LIVE AND DIE IN SHANTYTOWN  </P> <P> "Why do the church bells ring so often?" I asked Nailza de Arruda soon after  I'd moved into a corner of her tiny mud-walled hut near the top of the  shantytown called the Alto do Cruzeiro (Crucifix Hill). I was a Peace Corps  volunteer. It was the dry and blazing hot summer of 1965. Save for the rusty,  clanging bells of N.S. das Dores Church, an eerie quiet had settled over the  market town that I call Bom Jesus da Mata. "It's nothing," replied Nailza,  "just another little angel gone to heaven."  </P> <P> Nailza had sent more than her share of "little angels to heaven." Sometimes at  night, I could hear her muffled but passionate conversations with one of them,  2-year-old Joana. Joana's photograph, taken as she lay, eyes open, propped up  in her cardboard coffin, hung on a wall next to the one of Nailza and Ze  Antonio on the day they eloped.  </P> <P> Nailza could hardly remember the other infants and babies who'd come and gone  in close succession. Most had died unnamed and had been hastily baptized in  their coffins. Only Joana, properly baptized in church at the end of her first  year and placed under the protection of a powerful saint, Joan of Arc, had been  expected to live. And Nailza had dangerously allowed herself to love the little  girl.  </P> <P> In addressing the dead child, Nailza's voice would range from tearful imploring  to angry recrimination: "Why did you leave me. Was your patron saint so greedy  that she could not allow me one child on this earth."  </P> <P> Ze Antonio advised me to ignore Nailza's behavior, which he understood as a  kind of madness that, like the birth and death of children, came and went.  Indeed, the premature birth of a stillborn son some months later "cured" Nailza  of her "inappropriate" grief. The day came when she removed Joana's photo and  carefully packed it away.  </P> <P> More than 15 years elapsed before I returned to the Alto do Cruzeiro. Since  1982, I have returned several times to investigate a phenomenon that first  attracted my attention while I was in the Peace Corps.  </P> <P> The Alto do Cruzeiro is one of three shantytowns surrounding Bom Jesus in the  sugar-plantation zone of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. The region,  approximately twice the size of Texas, encompasses nine states. As the poorest  in the country, they are representative of the Third World within a dynamic and  rapidly industrializing nation.  </P> <P> Life expectancy in the Northeast is only 40 years, largely because of the high  rate of infant and child mortality. Approximately a million Brazilian children  under age 5 die each year. The children of the Northeast, especially those born  in shantytowns on the periphery of urban life, are at a very high risk of  death. They lack the traditional protection of breast-feeding, subsistence  gardens, stable marriages and multiple adult caretakers that survives in the  interior.  </P> <P> In the hillside shantytowns that spring up around cities or, in this case,  interior market towns, marriages are brittle, single parenting is the norm and  women are frequently forced into the shadow economy of domestic work in the  homes of the rich or into unprotected and "scab" wage labor on the surrounding  sugar plantations. The women of the Alto may not bring their babies with them  into the homes of the wealthy because the frequently sick infants are  considered sources of contamination. They cannot carry them to the riverbanks  to wash clothes because the river is heavily infested with schistosomes and  other deadly parasites. Nor can they carry their young children to the  plantations. At wages of a dollar a day, the women of the Alto cannot hire  baby- sitters. Older children who are not in school will sometimes serve as  care-takers. But any child not in school is also expected to find wage work. In  most cases, babies are left at home alone, the door securely fastened.  </P> <P> The phenomenon that first attracted me crystallized during a veritable  "die-off" of Alto babies during a severe drought in 1965. The food and water  shortages, as well as the political and economic chaos that followed a military  coup that year, were reflected in the handwritten entries of births and deaths  in the ledgers kept at the public registry office in Bom Jesus. More than 350  babies died in the Alto alone. Yet, there were ample reasons for the deaths in  the miserable conditions of shantytown life. What puzzled me was the seeming  indifference of the Alto mothers and their willingness to attribute to their  dying babies an aversion to life that made their deaths seem wholly natural.  </P> <P> I learned that the mothers' strong expectation of death and their ability to  face child death with stoicism and equanimity produced distinctive patterns of  nurturing. Infants thought of as thrivers and survivors were nurtured. When  infants were stigmatized, that is, thought to be born already "waiting to die,"  mothers stepped back and allowed nature to take its course. These devout women  do not consider this sinful. Rather, it is understood as cooperating with God's  plan.  </P> <P> Frequent child death remains a powerful shaper of maternal thinking and  practice. In the absence of a firm expectation that a child will survive,  mother love is attenuated and delayed. In an environment already precarious for  young life, the emotional detachment of mothers toward some of their babies  contributes even further to the spiral of high mortality-high fertility in a  kind of macabre lock-step dance of death.  </P> <P> The average woman of the Alto experiences 9.5 pregnancies, 3.5 child deaths,  and 1.5 stillbirths. Seventy percent of all child deaths occur in the first six  months of life, 82% by the end of the first year. Of all deaths in the  community each year, about 45% are of children under age 5.  </P> <P> With life in the Alto do Cruzeiro resembling that in an emergency room in an  overcrowded inner-city public hospital, morality is guided by a kind of  "lifeboat ethics," the morality of triage. The seemingly studied indifference  toward the suffering of some of their infants, conveyed in such sayings as  "little critters have no feelings," is understandable in light of these women's  obligation to carry on with their reproductive and nurturing lives.  </P> <P> Also, in a society where triplicates of every form are required for the most  banal events, the registration of infant and child death is informal,  incomplete and rapid. It requires no documentation, takes fewer than five  minutes and demands no witnesses other than office clerks. Cause of death is  left blank, unquestioned and unexamined. From the registry office, the parent  walks over to town hall, where the mayor will give him or her a voucher for a  free baby coffin.  </P> <P> The church, too, contributes to this routinization of child death. Under  Liberation Theology, the bells of N.S. das Dores Church no longer peal for the  death of Alto babies. No priest accompanies the procession to the cemetery. No  prayers are recited. No sign of the cross is made as the coffin is lowered into  the grave. In a few months, the remains of the former occupant are tossed into  the deep well called the "bone depository."  </P> <P> Still, the women of Bom Jesus are survivors. One, Biu, told me her life  history, returning again and again to the themes of child death, her first  husband's suicide, abandonment by her father and later by her second husband,  and all the other losses and disappointments she had suffered in her long 45  years.  </P> <P> "No, Dona Nanci, I won't cry, and I won't waste my life thinking about it from  morning to night . . . Can I argue with God for the state that I'm in? No! And  so I'll dance and I'll jump and I'll play Carnaval! And yes, I'll laugh and  people will wonder at a pobre like me who can have such a good time."  </P></p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie records strongest daily gain this year - Market Report The London stock market took the opportunity of yesterday's holiday closure in Frankfurt to mount a determined rally after its prolonged run of weak trading sessions. The FT-SE 100 Index recorded its best daily gain for the year as a strong recovery in UK government bonds, together with a better performance from stock index futures, signalled growing suspicion among fund managers that the near 5 per cent fall in share prices over the past two weeks may have been overdone. Buyers appeared as soon as the market opened and the pace quickened in the second half of the session when gains in UK gilts were extended to nearly 2 1/2 points as US Federal bonds opened higher and the German bund, trading on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), reversed early losses to forge ahead. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100-share Index at 2,980.8, the gain of 48.9 representing a recovery of all, and more, of the loss on the previous day; it was the highest daily advance since December 29 last year when the Footsie jumped by 49.7 points. As so often in current market conditions, much of the lead came from stock index futures, where the June contract narrowed its discount to the cash market and recorded heavy trading volume. With the focus on the futures-related blue chip stocks, the broader market had a less dramatic session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was finally a net 18.6 up at 3,556.3. Bargain hunters appeared as soon as the market opened, following morning meetings at most market firms at which buying recommendations had predominated. Share gains were extended when the June stock index future opened at a smaller discount to the underlying Footsie index than had been seen for some days. This, in turn, pushed market firms to buy the underlying stocks. However, the advance was fairly restrained at first and it was only when the UK gilts market turned sharply ahead that the gain on the Footsie moved above the 20-point mark. There was little response to a modest fall in Britain's longer leading economic indicator, nor to details of UK gold and currency reserves, neither of which contained any surprises for the market. It was left to the bond sector to give the final boost to a stock market which turned strongly ahead in the final hour of trading to close at the best level of the day. Seaq volume of 613.9m shares compared with 530.7m on Wednesday but was unexceptional; retail business was worth Pounds 1.12bn on the previous day, also a modest total in spite of the sharp fall in the stock market. Traders admitted to being caught out by the strength behind what was generally categorised as a technical rally. The near term outlook still depends on trends in the German bond market when it reopens this morning and in the US markets' response to the payroll and unemployment data, due today. One factor behind the recent weakness in the Footsie has been the absence of support levels on the equity charts. For similar reasons, any recovery in the market could run as far as Footsie 3,050 before being seriously challenged. Wall Street was showing a gain of only 1.23 on the Dow Average as London closed for the day and some UK traders expressed concern over weakness in some Far Eastern markets.</p>

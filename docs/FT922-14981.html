			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hudson modernisation will boost output HUDSON BAY, whose Flin Flon metallurgical operations in Manitoba were threatened with closure because they could not meet new environmental regulations, is on course for a substantial expansion and cut in production costs. A CDollars 183m (Pounds 89m) modernisation scheme, primarily designed to cope with environmental problems, would also boost annual zinc output from about 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes and copper production from 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes, said Mr Tim Wadeson, technical director of Minorco, yesterday. Minorco, part of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, took over Hudson Bay for USDollars 85 in August. Canada's federal government has provided a CDollars 25m loan and the provincial government one of CDollars 55m towards the modernisation project. Mr Wadeson said at a presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in London that the scheme was likely to be finished ahead of schedule and under budget in 1994. Then Hudson's zinc production costs (including credits for by-product metals) would be down from 50 cents a lb to 30 cents, making it one of the world's most competitive producers. Hudson Bay was spending CDollars 12m a year on exploration near its nine mines in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and recently more ore had been found at depth at the Trout Lake mine. Mr Wadeson said recent exploration work by Minorco's Independence Mining subsidiary might, 'if we're lucky', result in a new gold mine and associated plant in Nevada. Independence had lifted annual exploration spending from USDollars 11.7m to Dollars 15.2m. Since Minorco acquired Independence for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan in 1990, total reserves and resources had increased by 40 per cent: to 2.9m ounces of gold in reserves and 2.7m ounces in resources. Independence expected to produce 317,218 ounces of gold at a cash cost of Dollars 229 an ounce in the 1991-92 year to generate revenue of Dollars 357 an ounce. This compared with 304,682 ounces at a cost of Dollars 220 and revenue per ounce of Dollars 374 in the previous 12 months.</p>

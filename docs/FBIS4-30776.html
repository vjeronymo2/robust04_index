			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "U. Hewer: Two Largest Slovak Banks and Two </F> Smaller Banks Are Having Problems"]    [Text] Bratislava -- The two largest Slovak banks and two  smaller institutions are having problems as a result of  irrecoverable loans and lack of experience. Ulrich Hewer,  representative of the World Bank in Slovakia, told the REUTER  agency that the problems affect Slovenska Statna Sporitelna  [Slovak State Savings Bank] (SSSP), Vseobecna Uverova Banka  [General Credit Bank] (VUB), Investicna a Rozvojova Banka  [Investment and Development Bank] (IRB), and Konsolidacna Banka  [Consolidation Bank] (KB). The SSSP with a capital of 2.1  billion Slovak korunas [Sk] tops the ranking of 16 Slovak banks,  the VUB with a capital of Sk2 billion is in second place and the  largest creditor. The IRB is in fourth place and the KB in 11th  place in terms of the size of their capital.    "We think that the SSSP is having problems. Over the last  two years it extended a large number of unreasonable loans. We  have discussed the issue with the Slovak National Bank (NBS) and  agreed that a solution will have to be found." The World Bank  expects the SSSP and the other banks to be placed under control  before it helps the Slovak Republic restructure the banking  system. "We are waiting for the results of an audit, which  should be available by the end of this month. A mission of  inquiry will come to Slovakia in mid-June 1994 and these talks  will hopefully lead to a solution."    NBS representatives were not able to specify the size of the  four banks' irrecoverable loans. They noted that in Slovakia no  rules exist for rating risks. "We are in the initial stage of  collecting information and the relevant documents." The  "Memorandum" that the Slovak Government had prepared for the  World Bank last fall noted that the SSSP did not have experience  in lending money, even though it holds 90 percent of Slovak  private deposits. "We are afraid lest its efforts to become a  universal bank jeopardize its deposits."    "I fundamentally disagree with Ulrich Hewer's view," says KB  Director General Jan Pichonsky. He assumes that Ulrich Hewer  may have arrived at his conclusion on the basis of an audit for  1993 that was carried out in the KB by the Deloitte &amp; Touche  company. Last week it submitted to the KB the final report, in  which it recommends to the management that the bank increase the  reserves prescribed by law to almost 10 times their present  level. Jan Pichonsky considers the recommendation incorrect  because "it does not correspond to the state of the Slovak legal  system and to the reality."    "The IRB denies Ulrich Hewer's assertion," says Vladimir  Kovacik, IRB director general and member of the IRB Board of  Directors. The IRB's positive situation is also documented by  the 1993 auditors' report from the renowned British firm Ernst  &amp;  Young.    "We received the REUTER report at the time of the annual  meeting of VUB shareholders, which approved the economic results  for last year and a proposal for the division of profits. This  proposal provides for the payment of dividends to shareholders  at the amount of 10 percent of the shares' nominal value, that  is, Sk100 per share. We were surprised by the formulations used  by Ulrich Hewer from the World Bank and Peter Bajcik, the author  of the REUTER report. We do not know the two gentlemen, who  have neither visited the VUB nor have received any documentation  from us," states a statement issued by VUB President Jozef  Mudrik. "Our bank, as one of the successors to the Czechoslovak  State Bank, has taken over some credits that had been extended  under the command system of national economic management and the  returnability of which is endangered. Over the past four years  the VUB has increased the credit volume by only approximately 4  percent, which demonstrates that it has been extending new loans  on a very limited scale. Therefore, it could not be extending  any new bad loans," Jozef Mudrik states. "Because of our  awareness of the problem of the quality of banks' credit  portfolio, we were one of the first banks in the then CSFR to  have its economic results and the quality of its credit  portfolio verified by the international firm of auditors Coopers  &amp; Lybrant as early as 1991. We publish the results of these  audits annually and send them to all our partner banks abroad.  On the basis of these audits, the bank has been accepted by  many foreign insurance companies and, on this basis, also by  foreign partner banks, with which it is engaged in mutually  beneficial partner relations," the VUB president's statement  says in conclusion.    [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 27 May on pages 1  and  2 carries a 700-word TA SR report on the REUTER report, and the  Slovak banks' reactions to it, which includes the following  additional passage on the NBS's reaction: "The NBS draws the  attention of the population to the fact that deposits in the  largest Slovak banks are guaranteed by the Slovak Republic and  various conjectures about their safety are groundless.    ["Bad loans occur in every economy and are no exceptional  phenomenon. Only the extent of these loans can be exceptional.  The situation in Slovak commercial banks is no worse than in  other transforming economies, in which loans had been allocated  in the past on the basis of administrative decisions. The NBS,  in cooperation with state bodies, is aware of this problem and  is ready to deal with it, after the appropriate analyses are  carried out. On no account will the solution affect depositors.    ["The NBS does not identify with the contents of the  interview with a World Bank representative published by REUTER  on 25 May and considers its overall tenor distorted. The NBS  secures, in accordance with the law, the stability of the  banking system, as is normal in all countries, and, in this  process, it also holds talks with the World Bank and the IMF.  The two institutions have not officially confirmed such an  extent of the problem of bad assets as indicated by the REUTER  interview. The NBS will consult on its contents with World Bank  representatives in Washington."]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to a report by the Press Agency of the  Slovak Republic, Deputy Premier Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister  Jozef Moravcik left the Cabinet meeting five minutes after it  started. As the agency went on to say, according to unconfirmed  reports, they do not intend to attend the Cabinet meetings  before their position is clarified. Minister Jozef Moravcik is  said to have taken his leave. Our colleages Dagmar Bazlikova  and Michal Tvarozek interviewed the two Cabinet members late  this morning.    [begin recording] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, what is on the  agenda of the Cabinet meeting that prevents you and the foreign  minister from attending the meeting?    [Kovac] The prime minister's opening address included a  number of accusations against us, and the prime minister asked  us to leave the Cabinet meeting. Immediately after our  departure, the debate of the regular 17-point agenda concerning  privatization started. It was said that, if we did not leave  the Cabinet meeting, the Cabinet would end its meeting and there  would be a consultative meeting of some ministers--that is, a  consultative meeting of the ministers excluding us. We complied  with the prime minister's wish and left the Cabinet meeting in  order not to complicate the course of their debate. [passage  omitted]    [Tvarozek] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, do you not perceive  this as some sort of a psychological war--the prime minister  declared that he expected that you would leave the Cabinet  voluntarily.    [Kovac] I think that if we leave voluntarily it would be a  certain admission of mistakes committed by us in our posts. I  do not think that either Minister Moravcik or I committed  mistakes that would lead us to the conclusion that we do not do  our work properly.    There is yet another fact here: Because we, together with  deputies' initiative [Alternative of Political Realism],  proposed a certain solution to the current political situation,  there is a question of whether the prime minister will make a  decision about our future membership in the Cabinet or whether  he will not make such a decision. He really has the right to  choose colleagues whom he fully trusts. [passage omitted]    [Moravcik] I would like to add one thing. In his opening  speech, the prime minister said that he would ask the  Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether our course of action  was in accordance with the law and whether regulations of the  penal code might be used to deal with it. I would like to say  that such a way of thinking is absurd because there is our  parliament here to tackle political crises. That means that,  when a way out of the current internal political problems is  being sought, the solution must be sought through the  parliament. This is the fundamental principle of parliamentary  democracy. When we took our course of action, we acted fully in  accordance with the Constitution. [passage omitted]    [Tvarozek] Shouldn't the current situation be characterized  as a parliamentary crisis followed by a government crisis?    [Kovac] It is possible to say that the Cabinet will continue  its activities only with great difficulty because all of the  measures they will present to the parliament will pose  considerable problems there. I think that a number of officials  of the parliamentary parties have made statements on this issue.    [Tvarozek] Mr. Minister, according to a report by the press  agency, you are said to be taking your leave now.    [Moravcik] To be honest, I would really welcome to have  leave, from my personal point of view. However, these days it  is not appropriate to take leave.</p>

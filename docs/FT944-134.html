			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Catholic Church is about faith, not politics Sir, Your article on Pope John Paul II was markedly below par. The form of the article was too close to that of a hasty, pre-festive rewrite of tired quotes and cliches to appeal to the readers of the cultural section of your newspaper. As to the content, there seemed to be two main points. Contrary to what is suggested, the Church is not '. . . all about politics . . .' because the mission of the Church is exclusively supernatural, namely, the holiness of its members. Second, the Church has not and never has had a 'problem with birth control'. It has never approved of artificial birth control and, probably, never will. Further, as its reasons for rejecting birth control are not religious ones, they can be maintained by those of any religion or none (as is often the case). By any measure the present Pope is a giant with a prodigious intellectual output. It is highly probable that he could have become a major figure in whatever profession he had chosen. Robert Graham and Paul Betts have done truth and themselves a disservice by lending their names to this article. F Killoran, Calle Pena Santa, 6 28034 Madrid, Spain</p>

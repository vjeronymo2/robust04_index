			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment authority role still unclear Sir, The interim report of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee identifies, but does not provide an answer to, a fundamental problem in retail investment regulation. The committee obviously believes that, in its present form and structure, the Personal Investment Authority will not be effective; major and fundamental changes are needed. But, before then, and as a matter of urgency, government should indicate if it is prepared to legislate to withdraw the ability for any retail investment business to seek authorisation from the Securities and Investments Board directly. If such legislation is promised, the PIA can be developed, as the committee obviously believes is necessary, as a single retail regulator under the self-regulatory organisation regime. If government is not prepared to legislate, regulatory arbitrage will frustrate the accepted need for a single retail regulator; there will always be the choice between SIB or PIA. Consequently, if no legislation is likely to be forthcoming, the only answer is for the PIA to become a designated agency, equal to and alongside the SIB. In these circumstances, there would be no opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Arguments about composition of governance would cease, and consumers would know exactly how their adviser was regulated. Without a clear indication from government of legislation to remove SIB's authorisation powers, the PIA as a self-regulatory organisation has no real future as the single, effective retail regulator.

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens as Hong Kong gains 2.6 per cent THE NIKKEI average traded in a narrow range yesterday before slipping slightly towards the close, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The index closed down 45.14 at 16,589.55, its fifth consecutive fall, having seen a low of 16,532.06 and a high of 16,698.30. Declines outnumbered advances by 577 to 277, with 226 unchanged. Participation weakened, and volume dropped to an estimated 120m shares after 221m on Friday. The Topix index of all first section shares lost 5.59 to 1,283.93 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.13 to 1,042.42. Weekend reports that the ministry of finance had requested banks not to sell stocks, hoping to enhance balance sheets in time for the end of the financial year in March, were not enough to improve sentiment. Arbitrageurs, public pension funds and investment trusts continued to be the main players, with few individual buyers attracted to the market. Ms Kathy Matsui, a strategist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, predicted that the Nikkei would continue to drift above the 16,000 mark in the first quarter. 'We really do need some measures on behalf of the government to stimulate confidence. There is nothing further that can be done from the corporate sector or the financial sector to boost the economy,' she said. Profit-taking continued to weaken many shares which had made gains on news of the crown prince's engagement late last week, particularly in the paper and printing sectors. Oji Paper lost Y4 to Y862, Mitsubishi Paper Mills fell Y12 to Y545, and Kanzaki Paper dropped Y18 to Y606. However, department stores and television companies continued to do well out of the imperial wedding. Mitsukoshi gained Y1 to Y731, Takashimaya advanced Y6 to Y902 and Marui put on Y20 to Y1,120. Nippon Television Network rose Y1,100 to Y14,800. The banking sector was generally weaker. Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y20 to Y2,350, Bank of Tokyo fell Y30 to Y1,250, Mitsubishi Bank lost Y40 to Y2,210, and Daiwa Bank closed down Y34 at Y916. Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sakura, Fuji and Sumitomo banks experienced similar declines. Kawasaki Steel and Nippon Steel both closed unchanged after heavy trading. Victor Co of Japan (JVC) eased after recent gains, closing at Y840, down Y20. In Osaka the OSE index dropped 89.25 to 18,309.73 in volume of 49.7m shares. Roundup WEAKNESS on Wall Street gave some of the region's markets a poor start to the week, but a number made gains. Bombay was closed due to violence in the city. HONG KONG ended 2.6 per cent higher on overseas buying which some local analysts viewed as over-optimistic. The Hang Seng index closed 143.54 higher at 5,673.10, its day's high. Turnover was more than HKDollars 2.3bn, well above the depressed levels of last week. UK institutions led the buying on apparently conciliatory comments by Chinese leaders on Friday on the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's plans for political reform. Among the most active stocks, HSBC was HKDollars 3.00 higher at HKDollars 59.00. AUSTRALIA bounced back after three days of heavy losses. After sinking below 1,500 in the morning on heavy futures selling, the All Ordinaries index closed 11.8 higher at 1,514.1, off a low of 1,487.6. Thin trading contributed to the market's volatility. BHP and CRA led the recovery, both rising to ADollars 13, up 18 cents and 30 cents respectively. TAIWAN, which had extended its recovery on Saturday with a 2.6 per cent gain on hopes that parliament would vote to cut the stock transaction tax as early as this week, focused on Finance Ministry opposition to the move and fell 2.6 per cent, the weighted index closing 82.81 lower at 3,171.24. Brokers said that investor confidence remained very weak ahead of a cabinet reshuffle expected by early February. NEW ZEALAND blamed the Dow and a thin summer market as the NZSE-40 index closed down 26.90 at 1,499.96. Volume was a very thin NZDollars 10.2m. SINGAPORE looked for a first-quarter rally, but failed to get it as sentiment was dampened by a weaker Malaysian market; the Straits Times Industrial index fell 12.20 to 1,543.96. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index fell 8.05 to 621.46, weakened by talk that Malayan Banking is planning a one-for-four rights issue. BANGKOK's banks slowed down after last week's gains but the SET index was still 5.91 higher at 926.70 in turnover of Bt8.80bn. Thai Farmers Bank gained Bt8 to Bt772, Bank of Ayudhya Bt2.50 to Bt28.75 and Krung Thai Bank Bt10 to Bt348, while Bangkok Bank was unchanged at Bt101.</p>

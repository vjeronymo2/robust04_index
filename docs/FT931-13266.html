			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Commons delay on trademark bill AN ATTEMPT by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to win parliamentary time for legislation to modernise the regulation and protection of trademarks has been rebuffed by the government's business managers. A bill to implement the EC trademark directive as well as updating trademark law more generally has been drafted for some time, but Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and the government whips have made it clear it cannot be introduced in the current session because of the amount of other business. Supporters of the bill point out that beyond the straightforward merits of legislating, doing so would strengthen the UK's case for having the EC trademarks office in London rather than in one of the other three cities that have applied for it.</p>

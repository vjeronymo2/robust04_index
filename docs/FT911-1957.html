			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (25): In search of new gas supplies - The energy mix is being closely examined ENERGY experts and environmentalists alike are taking a hard look at Poland's hitherto under-explored gas reserves to change the country's energy mix and reduce reliance on coal and Soviet gas imports. The shift to hard-currency trading with the Soviet Union in January brought steep increases in the domestic prices of petrol and gas - and of electricity, which is linked to the gas price. Around 65 per cent of Poland's gas consumption, or 8m cubic metres, is imported from the USSR, via the Kobryn-Warsaw pipeline. Moscow wants to sell more, but Poland wants to supplement Soviet supplies from its own natural gas reserves, estimated at some 160bn cu m. The World Bank has earmarked Dollars 250m for development of the gas industry with another Dollars 61.5m promised by the European Investment Bank. Two bills regulating foreign exploitation of Poland's reserves are expected to become law by the summer. More than 50 companies have expressed interest, says Mr Andrzej Brach, director of the Polish Oil and Gas Company. Poland produces around 4.5bn cu m of gas, accounting for 8 per cent of energy consumption. As use of coal declines, the percentage of gas will increase. At a minimum, it is planned gas will increase to 15 per cent of energy consumption, based on expansion of domestic use alone. Under the maximum-growth scenario, gas will rise to 25 per cent, and be used for household heating, for district heating systems, and possibly for power-generation for the first time. Poland will, however, never be self-sufficient in gas; and, as imports from the Soviet Union can no longer be guaranteed, the search is on for alternative suppliers. Oil exploitation will also be expanded, although, in the words of Mr Brach, home production will never be more than 'a drop in the ocean'. There are reserves estimated at some 2.2m tonnes in the Carpathian mountains to the south-west, and in the central lowlands. The Poles believe that, with new techniques and foreign investment, it would be possible to double the output of 150,000 tonnes a year. Once again, the Soviet Union has in the past provided 80 per cent of Poland's needs - more than 12m tonnes a year. Poland is looking for other sources of oil, particularly to Norway, to Saudi Arabia, and also to Britain. A new terminal is being constructed at Gdansk, which will increase the amount of oil that can be delivered by sea from 8m tonnes a year to nearly 17m tonnes by 1994. The rise in oil prices, following the switch to hard-currency trading with the USSR, hit the profits of both Poland's largest oil refineries. Gdansk, the smaller plant, with a capacity of 2.6m tonnes a year, used to receive 80 per cent of its oil from the Soviet Union. It has now stopped processing Soviet crude altogether. The refinery is preparing for privatisation, and has been negotiating with potential western partners for more than a year. According to the director, Mr Marek Sokolowski, it is close to signing an agreement. Petrol distribution is the preserve of CPN, the state distribution agency. But the Gdansk refinery has begun constructing four of its own filling stations within a 100km radius of Gdansk. Plock, Poland's biggest refinery, with a capacity of 11.5m tonnes a year, is also preparing for privatisation and possible partnership with the west. Although a recent feasibility study by Credit Suisse First Boston rated Plock third, behind two west German refineries, in a comparative survey of more than 10 European refineries, Plock is not finding it easy to attract foreign backers. 'More than 70 representatives from western companies have visited so far,' says Mr Aleksander Puchowicz, the development director, rather disappointedly, 'but none of them has been prepared to invest.' Plock is a huge complex - four times the size of Gdansk - and has serious pollution problems, as the fourth biggest producer of sulphur dioxide in Poland. Reducing emissions to the target of 50 per cent of 1989 levels by 1995 will require massive investment.</p>

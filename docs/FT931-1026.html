			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Future for coal - Heseltine holds his ground The story of the changes in the various coal proposals over the last five months is primarily the story of how the government was persuaded it was politically imperative to reprieve at least some of the 31 pits earmarked for closure last October. This is the effect of the subsidy proposals unveiled yesterday. The prospect of 12 high-producing pits being saved looks to have staved off the worst of the threatened backbench rebellion which nearly swamped the government in the autumn. But there is no guarantee of how long the reprieve will last and Mr Heseltine has reserved the right to close 12 pits, to mothball a further six and to retain one under development with production halted. In short, the extent of the government's achievement in the white paper could yet be confined to ensuring the closures announced in October are phased in over a much longer period. Yesterday's package bore a strong resemblance to last month's draft white paper, with the important exception of the changes forced upon the government as a result of its failure to win a commitment from the main electricity generators to take more than the 160m tonnes of coal over five years they had agreed. This scuppered hopes that an additional short-term market for deep-mined coal could be created by encouraging the generators to run higher stocks than they had planned. The government has also seen no need to impose a limit on open-cast coal output, which it hinted at in the draft white paper, since such production is expected to fall anyway. Measures related to orimulsion were restricted to making its subject to hydrocarbon duty, rather than forcing power stations burning the bitumen-based fuel to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment - a step hinted at in the draft and recommended by the trade and industry select committee. The government decided to pass over the committee's most radical proposals - postponing electricity market liberalisation, cutting the pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy and cutting purchases of electricity from France - because of its strong preference for avoiding legislation, except that needed to privatise the industry. It has stuck to its faith in the market as the ultimate arbiter of Britain's energy mix, with little change from its position in October.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE PROPOSALS CHANGED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Closure announcement    Select committee report                         October 13, 1992        January 29, 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pit closures            31 to close             Review urged before any                                                 closures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Potential job losses    30,000                  10-15,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- State assistance        Pounds 1bn redundancy;

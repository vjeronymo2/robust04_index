			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpts of the work report of the Jiangsu Provincial </F> People's Procuratorate delivered by Acting Chief Procurator  Zhang Pinhua to the Second Session of the Eighth Jiangsu  Provincial People's Congress on 27 February 1994]    [Text] Fellow deputies: On behalf of the Jiangsu  Provincial People's Procuratorate, I now submit to this session  for your examination and approval a report on the major work of  provincial procuratorial organs in 1993.    Since the First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's  Congress, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu, while upholding the  party's basic line, have seriously implemented the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee; have conscientiously adapted  themselves to the new situation of accelerated reform and  opening up as well as to the socialist market economic  structure; have fully performed and constantly improved their  procuratorial functions; have strictly enforced the law and  handled criminal cases; and have resolutely punished according  to law serious criminals, including those who committed economic  crimes. In this way they have actively served reform, opening  up, and economic construction, and have made new achievements  and progress in procuratorial work.  <H5>  1. Concentrate on Investigating and Handling Embezzlement, </H5> Bribery, and Other Major Economic Cases; Promote the Deepening  of the Anti-Corruption Struggle    In 1993, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu placed the stress  of  their work on combating embezzlement and bribery. Particularly  after the Party Central Committee made new and important  arrangements for the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorial  organs at all levels promptly joined the struggle; concentrated  on investigating and handling major cases; punished embezzlers  as well as those who offered or accepted bribes; promoted the  deepening of the anti-corruption struggle; and provided legal  protection and service to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and  economic construction. Within the year, the province placed on  file and investigated 2,841 cases of economic crimes, including  embezzlement and bribery, 7.1 percent more cases than handled in  1992. Of the 1993 cases, 1,314 or 46.3 percent were major  cases; the high percentage was unprecedented. Twenty-six cadres  of county or provincial department level involved in 23 criminal  cases were investigated and dealt with. The procuratorial  organs instituted proceedings against 1,668 people in people's  courts, and recovered 94.65 million yuan from the direct  economic losses of the state and collectives.    We placed the stress of our work on investigating and  handling cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes,  particularly major cases involving personnel of party and  government organizations, judicial departments, administrative  law-enforcement departments, and economic management departments.    (1) A number of criminal cases involving functionaries  of party and government organizations were investigated and  handled. In 1993, the procuratorial organs in Jiangsu  investigated 191 functionaries of party and government  organizations involved in cases of embezzlement, bribery, and  other economic crimes, including some cadres at the county or  provincial department level. Although criminal cases involving  party and government cadres were small in number, they have done  considerably serious harm and hurt the blood- and-flesh ties  between the party and government and the people. Moreover, they  could promote unhealthy tendencies and induce more crimes.    (2) Some criminal cases involving judicial personnel  and administrative law-enforcement personnel were sternly dealt  with. In 1993, we investigated 29 judicial personnel  involved in economic crimes. We also handled a number of  embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes involving such  administrative law-enforcement departments as the Administration  of Industry and Commerce, taxation departments, and customs  offices. For instance, Cheng Renmin, deputy director of the  Zhangjiagang Customs Office, colluded with two office  accountants to embezzle more than 400,000 yuan of public funds.  Cheng also diverted 500,000 yuan of public funds to be used in  his personal profit-making undertakings.    (3) A number of criminal cases involving banking and  economic management departments were detected. In 1993,  procuratorial organs at various levels in Jiangsu resolutely  implemented the central authorities' policy decision on  strengthening macro-economic regulation and control, and helped  rectify the banking order and improve the management of the  securities and real estate markets. They promptly investigated  and handled cases of embezzlement and bribery, as well as cases  of using public funds in speculation on stocks, real estate, and  futures. They detected 108 criminal cases involving 122 persons  of the Banking Department. Wang Guangyi, secretary of the  leading party group of the Bank of Agriculture and president of  the Keyin Real Estate Development Company in the Runzhou  District of Zhenjiang, and four others took bribes of 240,000  yuan renminbi and HK$20,000 from real estate speculators. After  they were prosecuted by procuratorial organs, they were  sentenced to imprisonment ranging from five to 13 years. The  procuratorial organs in various localities also detected a  number of cases in the supply and marketing, materials, grain,  and other economic management departments.    (4) Resolute efforts were made to combat such crimes  as trademark falsification, tax evasion, and fraudulent export  tax refund. Trademark falsification, tax evasion, and  fraud greatly jeopardize the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure. In 1993, the province investigated  252 cases of trademark falsification, 167 percent more than in  1992. Of those cases, 57 involved illegal business volume of  more than 100,000 yuan each, and three involved illegal business  volume of more than 1 million yuan each. Fraudulent export tax  refunds are a new form of crime. In 1993, this province  discovered 14 cases in this regard and placed them on file for  investigation.    As far as economic criminal cases which are under  investigation by Jiangsu procuratorial organs are concerned,  currently such crimes as corruption and bribery are rampant.  The major characteristics of such cases are: First, the amount  involved in such crimes is increasing. In 1993, the average  amount involved in each case totalled 35,000 yuan, up 40 percent  over 1992. Thirty-nine corruption and bribery cases were filed  for investigation, each involving more than 100,000 yuan, plus  six embezzlement cases, each involving more than one million  yuan. Second, the number of cases involving more than one person  has increased, and many cases are characterized by collusion  between insiders and outsiders. Among filed cases, there were  720 people jointly committing crimes. Third, many crimes are  committed by youth, and many of these are major cases. Among  filed cases, there are 232 criminals under 25. Some embezzled  large sums of money when they took their posts; others spent  freely and indulged in wanton pleasure after receiving huge  amounts in bribes. Fourth, more and more criminal elements  abscond with funds. In 1993, 93 criminals absconding with funds  were apprehended; some carried funds worth hundreds of thousand  yuan.  2. Crack Down on Major Criminal Activities and Maintain  Political and Social Stability    In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu continued to  carry out the policy of giving heavier punishments over a short  time according to the law and of cracking down on major criminal  activities in order to maintain social stability and ensure that  Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic construction  proceeded smoothly. Particularly during the "summertime  crackdown" launched across Jiangsu in June-September,  procuratorial organs at various levels earnestly carried out  their duties, closely coordinated with public security organs  and courts, and cracked down on a number of criminal elements of  major cases. In 1993, procuratorial organs at various levels  accepted applications for approval by public security organs to  arrest 31,157 criminals; authorized the arrest of 28,708  criminals, an increase of 17.3 percent over 1992; and prosecuted  28,063 of the 31,157 criminals transferred from public security  organs.    During crackdowns, we concentrated on curtailing crimes that  seriously endanger social order and public security as well as  people's lives, properties, and security; we mercilessly  punished such major criminal elements as murderers, robbers,  rapists, major thieves, hooligan groups, "train and road  bandits," and "river bandits." In 1993, 8,903 criminals of  major cases were prosecuted across Jiangsu. To quickly punish  criminals from major cases, procuratorial organs at various  levels were involved early in the investigations and preparatory  examinations by public security organs; examined and verified  facts and evidence; proposed ways to obtain evidence; adhered to  the principles of having irrefutable facts and conclusive  evidence as well as avoiding quibbling over side issues; and  ensured they not miss any opportunities in procuratorial work.  Procuratorial organs across Jiangsu were involved in 1,211  criminal cases which were still under investigation by public  security organs; participated in the inspection of the crime  scene 1,294 times; participated in preparatory examination and  case discussions 2,354 times; and presented 2,082 proposals for  obtaining evidence.    In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu earnestly  participated in comprehensive management of the social order and  strived to strengthen the social effect of the "crackdown"  campaign. First, they coordinated with the courts to organize  meetings on a certain scale for public trials and verdicts,  publicized knowledge of the legal system, and educated the  masses by exposing crimes. Second, focusing on areas and  sections where public security problems were conspicuous, they  coordinated with the concerned departments and made great  efforts to launch special crackdown and management projects.  Third, they established public security networks, rectified  public order, and implemented preventive measures. Fourth, they  doubled their efforts to educate, redeem, and help juvenile  delinquents. Fifth, they doubled their efforts to investigate  the execution of a criminal's sentence outside prison and to  help and teach those exempted from prosecution. Sixth, they  earnestly launched a procuratorial advise campaign in light of  handling cases, urging units in such localities where public  security is worse to implement reform measures so as to prevent  and reduce crimes.    3. Strengthen Supervision Over Law Enforcement To  Ensure the Unified and Correct Implementation of the Laws of the  State    As state organs in charge of supervision over laws,  procuratorial organs shoulder heavy responsibility for  supervising law enforcement and for maintaining the dignity of  the laws and regulations of the state. Last year, procuratorial  organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province conscientiously  fulfilled their duty of supervision over law enforcement,  strengthened supervision over investigations by public security  organs and over criminal trials by people's courts, earnestly  conducted procuratorial work at detention centers as well as  procuratorial work on civil cases and cases involving  administration, and scored new achievements.    (1) Strengthen Supervision Over the Investigations and  Trials of Criminal Cases. Last year, while insisting on  using facts as the basis and laws as the criteria, procuratorial  organs throughout the province strictly checked up on cases  submitted to higher authorities for approving the arrest and  prosecution of suspects; conscientiously made a distinction  between those who were guilty and those who were not, as well as  between different kinds of guilt; prevented mistakes and  omissions; and corrected violations of the law. While punishing  criminals in accordance with the law, they protected innocent  people from criminal investigation. They decided not to grant  approval for the arrest of 3,005 criminals among those submitted  by public security organs, and decided to arrest and prosecute  90 more criminals in addition to those submitted by public  security organs. While supervising the trial of criminal cases,  we focused attention on improving the work of protesting a  verdict. At the beginning of the year, the Jiangsu Provincial  People's Procuratorate conducted a special survey on the work of  protesting a verdict, proposed measures for improvement,  improved guidance for and examination of protest cases, and  resolutely supported the correct opinions on protesting a  verdict put forward by people's procuratorates at the lower  level. Last year, procuratorial organs across the province  lodged a total of 53 cases with people's courts in protest of  their verdicts in accordance with the law; they corrected some  cases which had been given improper court verdicts. Yin  Fengxiang, chief of the accounting section of Taizhou's Chengbei  Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, embezzled  240,000 yuan. After being prosecuted by procuratorial organs,  he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with five years'  probation after both first and second court hearings. The  punishment meted out to him was unusually lenient. The Taizhou  People's Procuratorate persisted in its correct opinion to  protest the verdict. With resolute support from the Jiangsu  Provincial People's Procuratorate and intervention by the  Taizhou People's Congress and the Yangzhou People's Congress,  the sentence for criminal Yin Fengxiang was finally changed to  eight years' imprisonment plus the deprivation of his political  rights for two years.    (2) Improve Procuratorial Work at Detention Centers;  Supervise the Implementation of Court Verdicts and Rulings on  Criminal Cases, and Court Decisions on Reeducation Through Labor  and Remold Through Education Under Custody in Accordance With  the Laws. Last year, procuratorial organs throughout the  province focused attention on examining and correcting the  implementation of court rulings and decisions not in accordance  with the provisions of the law; the use of money to avoid jail  terms; and the collection of unwarranted fees from reducing a  penalty, granting parole, and accepting bail on medical reasons.  They proposed a total of 11,413 opinions on correcting such  violations of the law. The detention center at Dafeng County  arbitrarily accepted money for bail and pledges, and released 14  criminals serving jail terms. After procuratorial organs timely  proposed their opinion on correction, all the released criminals  were again taken into custody to serve their jail terms, and all  the money taken for bail and pledges was returned. Wu Yilin,  former deputy chief of the Dongtai Public Security Bureau, was  sentenced to two years' imprisonment for fraudulent practice out  of personal considerations. Less than two months after he began  serving his jail term, his penalty was reduced to 11 months.  After procuratorial organs proposed a correction in accordance  with the law, the court ruling on the reduction of his penalty  was annulled. In addition, procuratorial organs in all areas  placed on file, investigated, and handled criminal cases  committed by 17 working personnel of custody and remold centers  involving corruption, taking of bribes, releasing inmates  without authorization, and subjecting inmates to corporal  punishment and maltreatment.    (3) Improve Procuratorial Work on Civil Cases and  Cases Involving Administration, and Fulfill the Duty of Legal  Supervision Over Court Trials on Civil and Administration  Cases. Throughout the entire year, procuratorial organs  throughout the province handled a total of 702 appeal cases  lodged by citizens and legal persons against verdicts and  rulings given by people's courts on civil cases, economic cases,  and cases involving administration; placed 163 cases on file for  investigation; and lodged 16 cases in protest of court verdicts.  The number of protest cases lodged by the Jiangsu Provincial  People's Procuratorate alone totaled seven. They made  suggestions to judicial organs on conducting a trial again, or  served circulars on correcting law violations; the number of  such cases totaled 45. While handling protests against verdicts  given on civil cases and cases involving administration, we also  paid attention to discovering and investigating favoritism,  malpractice, the taking of bribes, and the bending of the laws  committed by judicial personnel in making a court judgment.  While handling a case on contract disputes, Xu Zhongchen,  judicial officer of the economic court of the Changzhou  Intermediate People's Court, abused his power, accepted bribes  offered by the litigants, and bent the law in making court  judgments. After having conscientiously conducted a thorough  investigation of the facts, procuratorial organs lodged a  protest against the erroneous verdict in accordance with the  law, meanwhile resolutely investigating Xu Zhongchen's taking of  bribes and bending the law.    4. Procuratorial Organs Safeguarded the Legitimate  Rights and Interests of Citizens As Well As the Normal Functions  of State Organs by Earnestly Investigating Cases About "Rights  Infringements" and Negligence of Duties, As Well As Complaints  and Petitions    Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files  for investigating 618 cases concerning negligence of duty and  infringement of citizens' democratic rights. That was an  increase of 5.5 percent over a year previous. By so doing, we  retrieved economic losses exceeding 95 million yuan. While  carrying out our assignments, we focused our attention on  investigating cases of corruption, extortion by torture for  confession, unlawful detention, malfeasance, and major accidents  caused by negligence of duty; because of our efforts, the  prosecution of lawless behavior continued to deepen. It is  noteworthy that the problem of lawless detention--such as the  holding of hostages [ren zhi xing fei fa ju jin 0086 6347 0992  7236 3127 2153 4391]--was still quite conspicuous. Owing to  disputes over debts, creditors often unlawfully abducted and  detained the debtors' relatives as hostages. Last year,  procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files for  investigating 53 of 100 cases of this nature, and freed 87  people held as hostages. Last year, procuratorial organs in  Jiangsu also established files for investigating 350 major  accidents caused by negligence of duty. That was 5.9 percent  over the preceding year; cases of this nature caused 240 million  yuan of direct economic losses and the death of 335 people.    Regarding the investigation of people's complaints as an  important aspect of safeguarding citizens' legitimate rights and  interests, Jiangsu's procuratorial organs last year played a  fairly effective role in this regard by cracking down on crime,  protecting the innocent, upholding justice, and keeping promises  they had made to the people. Compared with 1992, the number of  people's complaints presented either through letters or personal  visits increased 35.3 percent, totaling 36,940. People were  particularly eager to report all sorts of crimes. Procuratorial  organs investigated 17,709 of the 20,890 first-time reports they  accepted. That was 63.9 percent greater than accepted in 1992.  Many major cases, serial cases, and unresolved cases were  cracked because of clues provided by the masses. While  investigating complaints, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu also  followed the principle of seeking truth from facts and  correcting all mistakes, established files for investigating 564  cases of various complaints, and reinvestigated complaints  presented by people who disagreed with procuratorial organs'  decisions not to arrest people they reported and not prosecute  them. Certain mishandled cases were corrected. Last year,  procuratorial organs in Jiangsu handled 74 collective petitions  and 81 letters calling for emergency handling, and calmed  petitioners and solved the problems in different ways according  to the circumstances.  <H5>  5. Stronger Contingents of Procuratorial Personnel Were </H5> Built, and Police Officers' Political and Professional Qualities  Were Improved    Last year, procuratorates at all levels in Jiangsu,  upholding  the principle of building stronger contingents of procuratorial  personnel while handling day-to-day operations, made new headway  in building stronger procuratorates and strictly managing  procuratorial personnel. First of all, we organized police  officers to study the guidelines of the 14th national party  congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," thus arming the minds of procuratorial personnel with  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  This has heightened their awareness of implementing the party's  basic lines, and their sense of responsibility and mission in  discharging their duties and following the correct political  course under the new situation. Second, we actively carried out  ideological and political work relevant to the characteristics  of procuratorial organs, and by so doing we educated  procuratorial personnel on professional ethics,  responsibilities, and discipline as well as the need to serve  the people wholeheartedly. We also carried out competitions for  excellence, commended advanced units and individuals, and guided  police officers to wage arduous struggle and be brave to make  contributions. At one time or another, the provincial  procuratorate commended units and individuals having  distinguished themselves in cracking down on crime and  corruption, and issued a circular urging procuratorial personnel  to learn from Comrade Ji Zhong, director of the Haimen County  Procuratorate Office, who selflessly and diligently dedicated  himself to his work even when he was stricken by cancer. Wuxi's  procuratorial authorities also launched a series of educational  activities on comparing contributions and striving to become the  best.    Procuratorial organizations are important forces in the  fight against corruption, and those organizations themselves are  considered as key departments which need to be investigated in  the anticorruption campaign. Last year we seriously made  efforts to check ourselves in the anticorruption campaign.  First, we arranged to have leading cadres of procuratorial  organizations at various levels, especially cadres at and above  department level, take part in democratic life meetings to check  if they met with the five requirements set by the party Central  Committee on self discipline, the three supplementary provisions  set by this province, and the "10 forbidden things" set by the  Central Commission on Politics and Law. We checked and corrected  our behavior against those requirements one by one. We  conducted positive education for the broad masses of  procuratorial cadres and policemen. We attached importance to  the "three rectifications and being strict in three things,"  namely rectifying our ideology and being strict in conducting  education, rectifying our workstyle and being strict in  administration, and rectifying discipline and being strict in  setting demands. On this basis, various procuratorial  organizations all established and improved rules and regulations  to ensure honesty in performing official duties. Second, we  seriously straightened up and corrected the situation of wanton  collection of fees by using procuratorial power. We  investigated and rectified all companies and economic entities  established by procuratorial organizations in the province, and  adopted measures to close or transfer those companies and  economic entities. Third, we seriously investigated cases of  violation of law and discipline by procuratorial workers, and  made decisions on punishing 17 procuratorial cadres and  policemen who violated the law and discipline. At the end of  last year, we also made an all-round investigation on the  enforcement of law and discipline by procuratoratial  organizations throughout the province. We corrected and improved  all problems discovered in the investigation.    Fellow deputies: The procuratorates in this province made  certain achievements in 1993. We gained understanding in the  following five areas:    (1) Serving economic construction is the guiding  ideology which must be firmly adhered to in carrying out  procuratorial work.    (2) Enforcing law in a strict manner and investigating  and handling cases in a relentless manner are correct guiding  policies for promoting the constant improvement of procuratorial  work.    (3) Firmly adhering to the party's leadership is an  important principle of procuratorial work.    (4) Consciously accepting supervision by the people's  congresses and various circles is a guarantee for enforcement of  law in a just manner.    (5) Persisting in integrating the work of  procuratorial organizations with the mass line is an effective  way to improve procuratorial work.    Reviewing the work over the past year, we have found that  there are still shortcomings and problems, although we have made  some achievements. For example: The ideological understanding  and methods of work of some procuratorial personnel still cannot  fully meet the new requirements in the establishment of a  socialist market economy; a small number of leaders are not  resolute enough when they meet with difficulties and resistance  in the enforcement of the law; procuratorial work has been  carried out unevenly in various places, some locales lack  effective measures, and their results are not prominent in  investigating and handling major and serious cases; some places  cannot promptly investigate and handle clues due to a lack of  manpower; organizations for handling civil cases are not sound,  and the progress of their work is slow; and investigative work  is relatively weak due to backward equipment and facilities,  lack of funds in handling cases, and other reasons.    Fellow deputies, 1994 is crucial to China's reform and  opening up. It is essential that we have a comprehensive legal  system to regulate and safeguard the establishment of a sound  socialist market economic structure. As state organs in charge  of supervising law enforcement, procuratorates shoulder a major  responsibility in safeguarding uniform and correct law  enforcement and in bringing China's law enforcement in line with  its socialist market economy. Its tasks are heavier and more  difficult. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee  and the provincial party committee, and guided by their plans,  our current struggle against corruption has achieved interim  success. However, corruption as a social phenomenon in history  will exist for a long time. Accordingly, the struggle against  corruption will be a protracted, complicated process. Presently  the lack of strict law enforcement to crack down on crimes  exists in varying degrees throughput the province. In some  economic crimes, investigation has encountered fairly large  resistance. The masses still have doubts about the struggle  against corruption. Thus, the drive to crack down on corruption  and bribery still has a long way to go. Although the situation  is generally stable as far as public order is concerned,  destabilizing factors still exist in force. The lack of a good  social order is still a matter of general concern among the  masses. Cracking down sternly and swiftly on grave criminal  offenses remains an important task for procuratorial organs.    In 1994, procuratorial organs at all levels in the province  will earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th  National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, as well as those of the national  conference of chief procurators and the seventh plenary  (enlarged) session of the eighth provincial party committee; use  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as our guide; uphold the policy of  "grasping two links simultaneously, attaching equal importance  to both"; strengthen their role in legal supervision; strictly  enforce the law; vigorously investigate cases; concentrate  efforts on cracking major and important cases; deal blows to all  kinds of criminal activities; protect the citizens' legitimate  rights and interests; safeguard political and social stability;  and ensure the establishment and development of a socialist  market economy. To provide them with an ideological guide  for this year's work, the provincial procuratorate asks all  procuratorial organs in the province not to waver in their  thinking that: 1) procuratorial work shall serve the cause of  establishing and developing a socialist market economy; 2)  strict law enforcement and vigorous investigation constitutes  the heart of procuratorial work; 3) it is necessary to  strengthen their role in legal supervision and firmly safeguard  uniform and correct law enforcement; 4) it is necessary to crack  down on corruption in accordance with the law, and to  consolidate and develop the fruits of the anticorruption drive;  and 5) it is necessary to enforce strict discipline within  procuratorial organs and improve the ranks of procuratorial  personnel. In day-to- day work, they are asked to take further  steps in the struggle against corruption in three areas: 1) to  continue concentrating their efforts on investigating major and  important cases, particularly important criminal cases involving  leading cadres; 2) to strengthen law enforcement supervision and  strictly investigate law-breaking and criminal cases, such as  failures to strictly enforce the law; and 3) to investigate  criminal cases involving legal entities.</p>

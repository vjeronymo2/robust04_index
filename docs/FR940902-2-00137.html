NPF&hyph;68 and NPF&hyph;81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment will relocate the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.7.10, Area Temperature Monitoring, to section 16.3 of the VEGP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). With this relocation to the FSAR, GPC plans to clarify the basis for areas to be monitored and modify these surveillance requirements. This change is being proposed in accordance with NUREG&hyph;1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of area temperature monitoring is to provide reasonable assurance that the normal operating temperatures in the selected rooms will remain consistent with the temperatures assumed for the environmental qualification of safety related equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The normal operating temperature is significant for its effect on the qualified life of the components as well as the predicted environmental transients (i.e., pressure, temperature, and radiation) that occur under accident conditions. The following justifications are provided for the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed change to perform temperature surveillance only when the normal ventilation system is out of service is justified based on the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The HVAC systems at VEGP have been designed to maintain the room temperatures at less than the maximum normal temperature specified for environmental qualification purposes. The HVAC calculations have conservatively considered the worst case heat load conditions with a nominal safety factor when sizing the cooling systems that serve the subject rooms. As a result, the plant is generally maintained at temperatures well below the level assumed for normal operation and used for environmental qualification of equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Temperature monitoring activities per Technical Specification 3/4.7.10 have been in place for 6 years on Unit 1 and 4 years on Unit 2. The data collected during this time demonstrate that the temperatures have remained well within environmental qualification limits with the exception of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) area which has exceeded its reportability limits on several occasions. The MSIV area has since been provided with a new ventilation system and temperature monitoring instrumentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the normal ventilation system for one of the specified rooms is not functioning, temperature monitoring activities will resume at the previously specified rate of once every 12 hours. The proposed change to monitor these rooms only when the normal ventilation system is out of service will provide a level of assurance that is similar to that provided by the current Technical Specification. Therefore, continued monitoring is not warranted as long as the normal ventilation systems are functioning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change in room selection criteria to eliminate rooms that are classified as mild environment is justified based on the current methods of environmental qualification. The qualified life of safety related equipment in mild environment is no longer based on environmental qualification, but is based on a combination of design life, trending, and periodic maintenance and surveillance as discussed in FSAR section 3.11.B. Therefore, the monitoring of mild rooms is not required to verify that the normal design temperature is being maintained. However, the existing Technical Specifications not only require monitoring of the normal room temperature, but also require actions to evaluate equipment operability if an abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address this abnormal temperature condition, the rooms that are not monitored based on mild environment will not exceed 150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F following a complete loss of normal HVAC for a 7-day period. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The abnormal temperature limits currently shown in the Technical Specifications are the calculated room temperatures with a loss of normal HVAC for a 24-hour period. The new criterion is based on an equipment qualification analysis that demonstrates that short duration temperature excursions of up to 24 hours at 150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F have an insignificant effect on the qualified life of electrical and mechanical equipment. The limitation is further supported by Appendix F of NUMARC Report 87&hyph;00 that concludes that electrical and mechanical equipment will operate in station blackout conditions with no loss of function with temperatures of up to 150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F for short durations (i.e., 4 hours). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Per project calculations, the loss of normal HVAC for 7 days has been shown to be sufficient time to achieve steady state temperature conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the revision of the TS reporting requirements are justified as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. As discussed in enclosure 1 [of the licensee's February 3, 1994 submittal], the existing TS requirements for the area temperature monitoring program do not meet any of the criteria of the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and can safely be relocated to the FSAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The area temperature monitoring program added to the FSAR will continue to ensure that room temperatures are maintained within the limits assumed for environmental qualification. The monitoring requirements of once every 12 hours when the normal ventilation system is not in service will ensure that a room would not experience a short duration temperature excursion for more than 24 hours without an evaluation of equipment operability. Although reporting requirements have been excluded from the FSAR description, an evaluation of equipment operability will continue to be performed in the event that the temperature limits are exceeded. The reporting of operability concerns to the NRC will be based on the reporting requirements for the specific equipment in an affected area after a determination of operability has been made. The current TS requires that a report be prepared and submitted to the NRC that demonstrates the continued operability of the affected equipment if the maximum normal temperature in an area is exceeded for more than 8 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new FSAR description will continue to require an evaluation of equipment operability if either the normal temperature limit or abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded. However, no report to the NRC will be required unless the equipment operability evaluation indicates a reportable condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above considerations, GPC has concluded the following concerning 10 CFR 50.92. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The environmental qualification and operability of the safety related equipment will not be adversely affected by the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program. The relocation of TS to the FSAR and the changes to monitoring frequency will not increase the probability that the room temperature design limits will be exceeded or result in a loss of qualified life of safety related equipment. In addition, the consequences of exceeding the temperature limits will not significantly differ from the existing program since an evaluation of qualified life and operability will continue to be performed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the changes in monitoring procedures do not change the design of individual equipment, systems, nor the plant operating procedures and therefore will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those already evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because the revised monitoring requirements will continue to ensure that the environmental qualification temperature limits of safety related equipment scoped in the area temperature monitoring program will not be exceeded without an evaluation of equipment operability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

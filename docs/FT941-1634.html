			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Halifax ready to cut mortgage rate if base rates fall Halifax building society, the UK's largest, said yesterday that if there were a further 0.25 percentage point cut in base lending rates then it would reduce its variable mortgage rates. Announcing a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 866m for 1993-94, the chairman Mr Jon Foulds made it clear, however, that a cut in rates to borrowers would also mean reductions for savers. Halifax attracted Pounds 1.1bn in retail savings last year, taking retail funds and deposits to Pounds 51.6bn, and raised a further Pounds 2.1bn on the wholesale markets, where funding was cheaper. Mr Foulds said the society had performed well in the 'fragile market', although he acknowledged the fierce competition for retail savings. He highlighted short-term factors such as payment of home fuel bills in advance of the imposition of Value Added Tax in April, and more permanent features such as the popularity of unit trusts and Peps. The society's wholesale funding ratio, at 18.3 per cent of total shares, deposits and loans, remained well within the statutory limit of 40 per cent. In the longer term, however, he said the proportion of the balance sheet from the wholesale markets would have to grow, and so societies would need wider access to wholesale markets. This is one of the priorities for the government's review of building society legislation. Mr Foulds added that he thought there was a 'sea-change' in the pattern of personal savings. This was one reason for the launch of Halifax Life next January. A sharp fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts - mostly for residential property - to Pounds 271m, from Pounds 374m in the year to the end of January 1993, was one factor in the rise, but the level of provisioning remained higher than in previous years. Mr Foulds believed there would be significant levels of provisions for a few years to come, though he was encouraged by the drop in arrears. Gross lending rose to Pounds 8.6bn, from Pounds 8.3bn, while net lending fell back slightly to Pounds 3.2bn from Pounds 3.3bn. This represented a slightly larger share - 19 per cent - of a smaller mortgage market. The number of advances rose to 1.86m from 1.82m. The society's total assets rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 67bn. Its cost/income ratio remained stable at just under 40 per cent. Losses at Halifax's estate agency fell to Pounds 4m from Pounds 18m, and it is expected to break even in the current year. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, said the agency provided 10 per cent of Halifax's mortgage business, and would remain part of the society's strategy. Mr Blackburn said Halifax had reservations about the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect private investors, and had not yet decided whether to join. It would prefer full statutory regulation and doubted the PIA would deliver an increase in investor protection.</p>

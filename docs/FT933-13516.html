			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (10): Scrip option plan has a short shelf-life - An attempt to beat the taxman over ACT THE ability of Britain's corporate financiers to twist new financing techniques to the disadvantage of the taxman is legendary. But the problem of surplus Advance Corporation Tax for those with too low a corporate tax bill to offset has had them stumped for years. Thus, there was a certain frisson in the City when BAT Industries, long dogged by unrecoverable ACT, announced its advisers had come up with a plan to tackle it. The plan, advanced by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, seemed simple. BAT would offer to pay its shareholders their usual dividend in cash, incurring ACT on all those payments. But those who elected to take their dividends in shares, which do not attract ACT, could earn a dividend worth up to 50 per cent more. From the deal, BAT would save Pounds 97m in ACT charges and another Pounds 334.7m assuming that all shareholders took scrip instead of cash. Even better, BZW told shareholders that they could achieve the best of both worlds, getting cash worth almost 50 per cent more than the dividend. BZW would operate a kind of resale facility, offering to buy - at no dealing cost - the extra shares at a discount to the market of only 5 per cent. Shareholders who exercised the scrip option but then sold the extra share allotment would still be better off than those who chose the initial ACT-attracting cash dividend. So attractive was the technique that seven other big UK companies quickly announced plans for similar techniques. But then, things began to go sour. Just why they did so is a complicated story but ultimately, BZW acknowledges, enhanced scrip dividends are a virtuous product with a regrettably short shelf-life. Mr Amir Eilon, managing director, corporate finance, at BZW and one of the architects of the structure, says the group began to think of ways to help companies around the problem of surplus ACT in 1991. Initially, BZW toyed with the idea of issuing A and B class shares, one of which would attract ACT and the other not. But previous experiments with that structure, along with the general distaste among investors for different classes of shares, led it to abandon that route. The enhanced scrip dividend structure, he says, is blindingly simple by comparison. The problem with scrip dividends is that shareholders do not like them. In Britain, tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds find them unattractive because they are able to reclaim 20 per cent of the ACT paid by the company, so that the return on a cash dividend is even higher than it appears. Thus, scrip dividends have a traditionally low take-up of under 5 per cent. The sheer volume of the BAT offer made it attractive to the institutions and overcame their initial distaste for new share certificates. But after the initial euphoria, doubts began to creep in. The Association of British Insurers, one of the UK's most influential shareholder groups, said it was concerned about them. 'These are like ice-cream,' says a member of the ABI's investment committee. 'They glisten at first but after they've sat in the sun for a while they don't look so good.' The ABI view is that, as a one-off arrangement to avoid unrecoverable ACT, the use of enhanced scrip dividends is to be welcomed. But by next year, its use should become obsolete because the Treasury has already promised to introduce foreign income dividends. These will help companies with foreign profits to pay dividends out of those profits without incurring an ACT charge. However, the ABI is worried that companies will issue them repeatedly, in effect turning them into a rolling rights issue. A significant expansion in the number of outstanding shares raises questions about a company's ability to finance them. After all, extra shares over time may force companies either to restrain their dividend increases or, worse, to cut pay-outs on each share. But BZW says that companies need only earn a 15 per cent return on capital to ensure that the dividend stream is maintained. Shareholders are also concerned that the use of scrip could evolve into a kind of 'fudge' for companies which are short of the cash necessary to pay the dividend, but are unwilling to say so publicly. Among the companies which issued enhanced scrip dividends was Forte, which also announced a cut in its dividend. 'If I want a company's shares I'll go out and buy them,' says Ms Caroline Burton, director of investment management at Guardian Royal Exchange. 'In the meantime, I'd like my dividend in cash, thank you very much.' However, the greatest controversy over enhanced scrip dividends is not over their efficacy but about the profits to be derived from advising companies on their use. Swiss Bank Corporation caused a commotion when it saidit would repurchase extra shares issued as dividends by BAT at a discount of only 2 per cent to market price, undercutting BZW's 5 per cent discount. SBC said it could offer a smaller discount after applying an options model analysis to the offering and realising that the risk to the buyer justified a much lower fee. In defence of the wider discount it had sought initially, BZW said that, at the time, it had no idea what the take-up of the enhanced scrip would be and therefore, it judged the risks to be greater. SBC, it said, made its price offer with the benefit of hindsight.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco puts off smelter decision COMINCO HAS again put off a decision on the future of its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia, to give the German engineering group Lurgi more time to correct flaws in the plant. At the same time, the Vancouver-based base metals producer disclosed that should it abandon Lurgi's QSL technology, the most likely alternative is the Kivcet process used by smelters in Italy and Kazakhstan. Earlier this year, Cominco retained Snamprogetti of Italy to prepare engineering and cost estimates for converting the facility to the Kivcet process. Cominco said it is now considering commercial-scale tests at the Kazakhstan smelter. It expects to decide either late this year or in early 1993 whether to persevere with the QSL system or convert the Trail smelter to the Kivcet process. The CDollars 135m (Pounds 60m) Trail plant, designed to produce 160,000 lb of lead a year, was shut down less than three months after being commissioned in December 1990. The main problem has been in the reduction chamber of the 40-metre long reactor, where natural gas has replaced pulverised coal as the reducing agent. Lead operations have continued using the old, high-cost smelter that the QSL facility was designed to replace. Production totalled just over 87,000 tonnes last year. Lurgi remains confident that the QSL process, with some modifications, is suitable for Trail. Cominco says however, that it remains concerned about 'the rate at which the plant would have to be driven to achieve the production required by Trail'. The Canadian company has set up a committee of independent directors to consider the legal ramifications if the QSL smelter cannot be started satisfactorily.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> MAN GIVEN 10 YEARS FOR BOMB THREATS  </P> <P> A loner who called in more than 300 false bomb threats to airlines was  sentenced to 10 years in prison by a San Diego federal judge who said there is  no room for leniency when it comes to disruptive threats to the nation's air  transit system. William A. Risley, who had been jobless, collecting welfare and  living in a $15-a-night downtown San Diego hotel when arrested last year, had  asked U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving for a two-year term, saying he  made the threats to distract himself from his feelings of hopelessness.  </P> <P> Irving flatly rejected Risley's plea for mercy. The judge said he viewed the  threats -- called in over a nine-year period from public phones in San Diego,  San Francisco, Detroit and Washington -- as "extremely serious antisocial  conduct" that "caused havoc in nationwide air travel." Officials believe Risley  cost the airline industry more than $1 million as frantic pilots returned to  airports and inspections were conducted on runways.  </P></p>

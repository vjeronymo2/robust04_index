			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Thorn stalls on demerger: Music and rentals group sees 18% fall in first-quarter profits Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn EMI's chairman, yesterday firmly ruled out an early demerger of the music and rentals group and said the proposal was now 'on the back-burner'. Sir Colin, speaking as Thorn unveiled an 18 per cent fall in first-quarter pre-tax profits reflecting exceptional charges, said: 'I don't think we will look at demerger again for three years.' There was 'no indication of any terrific upside value' in a demerger of the group's core music and retail divisions and he noted that the costs would be huge. Thorn's shares, which have rallied recently on revived speculation of a demerger, closed down 9p at 1054p. The group's results for the three months to June 30 - the first time Thorn has reported the first quarter - showed a strong performance by its main businesses, EMI Music, Thorn Group and HMV, together with an improvement in its other businesses. However, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.1m from Pounds 40.4m after a net exceptional charge of Pounds 13.1m, mainly on the disposal of Thorn Security, which was partly offset by a decline in finance charges to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 12.5m). Turnover from continuing operations increased to Pounds 928.8m (Pounds 870.8m) with discontinued operations contributing a further Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 147.9m). The group sold Thorn Lighting and its stake in Thames Television. Profits from continuing operations rose 24.7 per cent to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 42.1m). Sales at EMI Music rose 16.6 per cent to Pounds 404.9m and profits grew by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 33m helped by the success of Canto Gregoriano and Pink Floyd's latest album. Thorn Group, the renamed rental business, posted a 9.8 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 25.8m on revenues which rose 6.2 per cent to Pounds 374.1m, underpinned by improvement in both UK and continental European businesses. Sales at HMV increased 12.4 per cent to Pounds 87.8m with its seasonal loss falling 24.4 per cent to Pounds 3.4m. Store sales continued to grow on a like-for-like basis and the group opened a further six shops to bring its total to 188 stores worldwide. Net borrowings at the end of June stood at Pounds 471.5m representing gearing of 38.3 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 3.1p (6.4p) on a fully diluted basis. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUERRILLA GOT 15 MINUTES' TRAINING  </P> <P> A teen-age Arab guerrilla caught by Israel after infiltrating from Egypt told  television viewers Friday that he was sent to kill 100 Israeli soldiers with 15  minutes of training and a promise of $20,000.  </P> <P> He was one of two Palestinian gunmen Israel captured after they attacked an  army base near the Egyptian border Wednesday, just hours before Israel handed  back the Red Sea beach resort of Taba to Egypt.  </P> <P> The guerrilla, identified as Iman Mohammed Hassan Younis, 18, described his  mission to reporters on Israel Television, saying he was recruited by two men  about two months ago.  </P> <P> "They told us that we have to attack an army base full of 100 Jews," Younis  said. "They lured us to do this by promising us $20,000 and by showing us the  Koran." The Koran is Islam's holiest book.  </P> <P> Younis claimed he received only 15 minutes of training.  </P> <P> Younis said he did it for money.  </P></p>

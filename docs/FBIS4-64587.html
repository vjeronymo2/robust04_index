			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks denote recorded passages; speakers </F> identified by caption]    [Text] If the Freedom Alliance is having problems coming to  an agreement on forming the new cabinet, then the Party of the  Democratic Left [PDS] is also going through a tough time in the  run-up to its autumn congress. Rocco Tolfa reports:    [Tolfa] Smiles, handshakes and peace signals -- all this in  public. In reality there is a battle going on between Achille  Occhetto and Massimo D'Alema. The battle is taking place in the  secret rooms of the party's headquarters in Rome, however,  rumors of this duel are emerging and Occhetto has let it be  known that he could even give up the secretaryship of the PDS on  condition that D'Alema is not his successor. The battle is  wounding the party.    [Emanuel Macaluso] "I have never understood what the  political basis for their divisions were. There has never been  any sort of explanation in any party publication nor in public."    [Tolfa] A personal dispute? The men from the party say no.    [Fabio Mussi] "None of us -- from Occhetto downward -- can  remain in his place for ever and ever. What counts is the  political perspective, and it remains to be seen who will be in  charge."    [Tolfa] Moves and countermoves in the light of the  forthcoming autumn congress. Occhetto has tried to calm the  waters by offering D'Alema the deputy leadership of the party.  The editor of the party newspaper, L'UNITA has for the moment  said no. He said that at present he does not want to enter the  fray, but it is clear that he is now part of the fight. It is  from this settling of scores that the man to challenge  Berlusconi will emerge.</p>

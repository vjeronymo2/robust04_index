			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATE KICK LIFTS NAVY TO AN UPSET OF ARMY;  </P> <P> RIVALRY: MIDSHIPMEN END CADETS' THREE-GAME WINNING STREAK IN SERIES, 19-17, AND  SALVAGE FORGETTABLE SEASON.  </P> <P> Frank Schenk, who missed a chip-shot field goal earlier in the season that cost  Navy a victory against Delaware, made a 32-yarder with 11 seconds to play,  giving the Midshipmen a 19-17 upset victory over Army Saturday.  </P> <P> The victory ended Navy's three-game losing streak in the series and gave the  Midshipmen a 42-41-7 lead since it began in 1890.  </P> <P> Navy Coach Elliot Uzelac said he told Schenk after the missed field goal  against Delaware: "Son, you're going to kick the winning field goal against  Army." But Uzelac added: "I didn't think it was going to be this week."  </P> <P> Schenk, a junior, said: "I knew (the outcome) was going to be close. As soon as  the Army kicker made it 17-16, I knew it was going to come down to me. That  fourth quarter was the longest time of my life."  </P> <P> Uzelac said the victory made up for a 3-8 record that included three losses to  Division I-AA teams.  </P> <P> "I know we've had a lousy season and nobody's madder about it than I am," he  said. "But we beat Army and that takes care of a lousy season."  </P> <P> Mike Mayweather, a junior halfback, broke Army's rushing record. His 84 yards  gave him 2,960, three more than Glenn Davis compiled from 1943-46. Mayweather  also finished the season with 1,176 yards, breaking Doug Black's Army season  record set in 1984.  </P> <P> "If it's any consolation to my teammates, I hope they can relish in this record  as long as I do," Mayweather said.  </P> <P> Army Coach Jim Young said: "I am happy we had a winning season (6-5). It is  certainly better than having a losing year, but losing today was a big  disappointment."  </P> <P> Young praised Navy quarterback Alton Grizzard, who converted three fourth-down  running attempts, including one during the final drive.  </P> <P> Uzelac said he knew going into the game that Navy would have to take some  chances.  </P> <P> "We decided that whatever it was going to take we were going to do," he said.  "I knew I was going to gamble on some fourth downs."  </P> <P> The final gamble kept the winning drive alive. Grizzard, on a keeper, lunged  for a first down on fourth-and-two at the Army 35.  </P> <P> Grizzard followed the first down with a 10-yard carry up the middle to the Army  23. Rodney Purifoy got another eight yards, and Schenk came onto the field with  11 seconds left.  </P> <P> Army called time out. Then Schenk erased bad memories of the 10-9 loss to  Delaware.  </P> <P> "After the Delaware game, everyone knew what I was going through," Schenk said.  "When I went back on the field, I just tried to forget the crowd, to forget it  was the Army-Navy game. Just to think positive, to kick it like any other  kick."  </P></p>

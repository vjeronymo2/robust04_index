			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACING Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Question: Which is considered the more difficult feat: winning the Triple Crown  in the United States, when the three races are contested over a period of five  weeks, or winning it in England, with the three races spread out over more than  three months?  </P> <P> Answer: There is a divergence of opinion among professionals. Some feel the  concentration of pressure involved in the American Triple Crown places a  fearsome burden on a horse. Others feel it is more difficult to keep a horse in  top condition for the longer period of time involved in the English Triple  Crown. Suffice to say, both series are difficult to sweep. There have been 11  winners of the U.S. Triple Crown since Sir Barton was the first in 1919.  Affirmed, in 1978, was the last. West Australian was the first to sweep the  English Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and St. Leger) in 1853, and  15 horses have done it. The last was Nijinsky II in 1970, and he was the first  since Bahram in 1935. The English Triple Crown does not seem to hold the same  appeal for horsemen in that country these days as the American Triple Crown  among horsemen in this country.  </P> <P> Q: I am fascinated by the distinction made between races at a mile and a 16th  and races at a mile and 70 yards. The two distances are so close together, for  a mile and a 16th is a mile and 110 yards. Why do tracks offer both distances  when they are almost the same thing?  </P> <P> A: It is often a matter of psychology. The racing secretary is trying to  attract the best possible racing material for his programs. Some trainers may  feel that their horse doesn't have the stamina to stay a mile and a 16th but  might be able to win at a mile and 70 yards. Department stores practice the  same psychology by pricing items at $99, rather than $100.  </P> <P> Q: When I handicap the races, I compare the best previous times of the horses  in that race at the distance in question. Some of my friends discount the best  time as having little significance. What do you think?  </P> <P> A: "The quality of the race can make a difference," said Leroy Jolley, the Hall  of Fame trainer who saddled Kentucky Derby winners Foolish Pleasure and Genuine  Risk. "Cheap horses are not consistent and can turn in a good time one day and  a slow time the next. In some instances they are favored by certain track  conditions, or perhaps they can get an easy lead in some races and nurse it all  the way. Good horses, on the other hand, hold their form longer, and if they  run in fast time, they are more likely to run back in comparable time than  cheap horses. Not all the time, but more often. Thus, in better races, the best  times are probably more significant."  </P> <P> Q: Like many others, I have read many stories and am concerned about the number  of fractures occurring among our racehorses. Isn't it possible to alleviate  this situation to some degree by feeding a heavier calcium diet to horses, thus  building stronger bone?  </P> <P> A: "In the absence of a marked deficiency of calcium in the body makeup, it has  been proven to the satisfaction of most professionals that a high calcium diet  is not effective in the prevention of fractures in racehorses," said the noted  Midwestern veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copeian. "Levels of calcium above the norm  are rejected by the body."  </P></p>

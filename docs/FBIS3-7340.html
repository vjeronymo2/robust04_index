Each time, however, they suffered a  stern punishment.    They, failing to draw a lesson from the sinking of their  pirate ship "General Sherman" in the river Taedong in 1866,  started a surprise attack on the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea on June 25, 1950 after watching for a chance.    In an attempt to gratify their sinister ambition for  aggression at any cost, they hurled into the Korean war one  third of their Army armed with latest-type equipment, one fifth  of their Air Force, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet, soldiers of  their 15 satellite states and the South Korean puppet army, more  than two million strong, huge combat technical equipment and 73  million tons of war supplies. The aggressors, however, met  head-on hammer blows of the Korean people.    In the Korean war they lost 1,567,000 effectives including  405,000 GIs, 12,200 planes, 3,250 tanks and armoured vehicles,  560 warships and many other combat technical equipment.    On July 27, 1953, the U.S. imperialist aggressors signed the  armistice agreement before the flag of the DPRK, surrendering to  the Korean people. This was their first ignominious defeat in  their 100-year-long history of wars of aggression.    The case of the spy ship "Pueblo" in January, 1968, was  another provocation committed by the U.S. imperialists,  forgetting the lesson of their defeat.    When the armed spy ship was apprehended by the DPRK after  intruding into its territorial waters to infringe upon its  sovereignty, they drove the situation to the brink of war,  threatening that they would "bombard" and "blockade" ports of  the DPRK as "retaliatory steps." At that moment, all the Korean  people and People's Army manifested their unswerving will to  answer a "retaliation" with a retaliation, a "total war" with a  total war.    To meet the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the People's Army  soldiers took their positions and the entire working people  wrought miracles in production and construction with a rifle in  one hand and a sickle or a hammer in the other, demonstrating  the mettle of the Korean people.    The U.S. imperialists who were threatening an immediate war  succumbed to the Korean people, who rose up like a mountain. On  December 23, they came out with a white flag to the conference  room in Panmunjom where they had signed the armistice agreement,  admitted their criminal act concerning the ship "Pueblo" case  and apologized to the Korean people for it and signed the  surrender document promising not to commit such provocation  again. They, however, infiltrated an EC-121 large  reconnaissance plane into the air space of the DPRK on April 15,  1969 only to suffer a serious defeat under the eyes of the world.    The Korean people are an indomitable people who have never  pardoned the provokers.    The provokers must draw a lesson from their defeat.</p>

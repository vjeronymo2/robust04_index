			<p>BFN     [Text] In Copenhagen today, Danish Prime Minister Poul  Rasmussen received the president of the republic of Kosova, Dr.  Ibrahim Rugova, who is touring several European countries.    At today's meeting with Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen,  President Rugova gave a briefing on the situation in Kosova. He  stressed that over the last five years a campaign of Serbian  violence has been continuing in Kosova, and this represents a  danger to the region.    The president of the republic of Kosova went on to brief the  Danish prime minister on the Albanians' political aim of an  independent and neutral Kosova, as being the best solution to  the Kosova problem. He stressed that the people of Kosova have  expressed their own will through a referendum and through other  institutional acts and that they are waiting for international  support in implementing this will.    President Rugova said that they had expressed their  readiness  for a dialogue with Belgrade in the presence of a third party.  Denmark, which plays an important role in the European Union,  can make a contribution to resolving this issue, president  Rugova said, thanking the Danish prime minister for the interest  that his country has so far shown in the Kosova question and  regional problems.    In his speech, Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen stressed that  it was an honor to meet with Dr. Rugova and that he knew the  Kosova problem well. He said that the European Union was  worried about the situation in Kosova and that, within this  framework, Denmark would continue with its commitment. He said  that Denmark would exert pressure for the return of the CSCE  observers to Kosova and a resolution of this matter. He  expressed his support for the peaceful policy of president  Rugova and the Kosovar people on the road to realizing their  aspirations. Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen promised that  Denmark would be active in this direction.    After the reception and the friendly talks held with the  Danish prime minister, the president of the republic of Kosova,  Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, addressed the members of the Foreign Policy  Committee of the Danish Parliament.    Tomorrow, president Rugova is expected to meet Danish  Foreign  Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and other Danish officials. It  is reported that today Dr. Rugova gave several interviews to the  Danish press.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Finnish chemicals group swings back into black KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group which is on the government's privatisation list, swung to a FM168m (Dollars 29.6m) profit after financial items in the first eight months, from a FM173m loss in the same 1992 period. It still expects its full-year result to be negative, because of the seasonal nature of its fertiliser activities, although the loss will be much lower than last year's FM345m deficit. The group's seven main divisions all increased turnover, contributing to a 15 per cent growth in overall net sales to FM8.18bn. Operating income before depreciation rose 44 per cent to FM1.29bn, or 15.8 per cent of net sales. Full year sales are forecast at FM12bn, and operating income at around FM1.68bn.</p>

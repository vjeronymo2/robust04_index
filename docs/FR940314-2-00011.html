			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The unrounded cost of the TFP was $355.55 in June 1992 and $364.895 in June 1993. The change from June 1992 to June 1993 is 102.6284%, which when multiplied by $10.96, the unrounded minimum benefit in Fiscal Year 1993, results in a new unrounded minimum benefit of $11.25. Rounded to the nearest $5, the minimum benefit for Fiscal Year 1994 is $10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Deductions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Food stamp benefits are calculated on the basis of an individual household's net income. Deductions serve to lower household net income and thus to increase household benefits. When a household's net income decreases, its food stamp benefits increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard deduction is available to all households. The excess shelter expense deduction is available to households with extremely high shelter costs. There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter deduction for households with no elderly or disabled members but no maximum for households with elderly or disabled members. The standard deduction and the maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction for households with no elderly or disabled members are being adjusted by this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice is also adjusting the homeless household shelter expense. The homeless household shelter expense is a standard estimate of the shelter expenses of homeless households and is available to households in which all members are homeless and are not receiving free shelter throughout the month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Adjustment of the Standard Deduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, provides that, in computing household income, households shall be allowed a standard deduction. (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)). Section 5(e) also requires that the standard deduction be adjusted periodically. The deduction for the 48 States and DC was last adjusted effective October 1, 1992. Section 5(e)(4) requires that the adjustment in the level of the standard deduction shall take into account changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for items other than food (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e)(4)). The adjustments are rounded to the nearest lower dollar pursuant to the requirements of Section 5(e). There are separate standard deductions for the 48 States and DC, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table shows the deductions resulting from the last adjustment, the unrounded results of this adjustment, and the new deduction amounts that go into effect on October 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s100,15,15,15 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Standard Deductions for All Households <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Previous standard deductions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (eff. 10&hyph;1&hyph;92)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1New unrounded numbers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (10-1-93) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Standard deductions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (eff. 10&hyph;1&hyph;93) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 48 States and DC  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $127  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $131.19  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $131 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaska  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 216  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 223.77  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 223 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawaii  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 179  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 185.21  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 185 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guam  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 254  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 262.35  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 262 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virgin Islands  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 112  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 115.75  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 115 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Adjustment of the Shelter Deduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act also provides that, in computing household income, households shall be allowed a deduction for certain excess shelter expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(e). There is a maximum amount for the excess shelter expense deduction, unless the household has an elderly or disabled member, in which case there is no maximum.

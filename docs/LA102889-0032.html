			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE AFTERMATH AND FREEWAY SAFETY  </P> <P> Howard Jarvis often stated opponents of Proposition 13 would blame the eruption  of Mt. Saint Helens on the initiative just because they hated the measure. Paul  Conrad displayed such a knee-jerk reaction with his cartoon of the Nimitz  Freeway (Oct. 24).  </P> <P> State government revenues have tripled since Proposition 13 passed.  Prioritizing that money for transportation could easily have been accomplished  but the Legislature had other favorite programs to fund. Our organization  attempted to reorganize priorities towards transportation by sponsoring  Proposition 72 to use state sales tax on gasoline for transportation purposes  instead of funneling it to the general fund. Sacramento politicians opposed the  idea.  </P> <P> Conrad's attack is the more irresponsible considering experts tell us we do not  have the technology to brace the Nimitz Freeway against powerful earthquakes.  </P> <P> On the same Op-Ed Page, Lenny Goldberg makes the ridiculous statement that  whereas a freeway collapse in New York would result from a contracting scandal,  a collapse in California would be the result of an ideological scandal over  taxes. Goldberg is trying to explain away the fact that disasters happen in  high tax states without a Proposition 13. Such disasters are the Achilles' heel  of his argument that high taxes would prevent the calamities. The collapse of  the relatively newer overpasses in the Sylmar earthquake of 1971 occurred seven  years before we had Proposition 13 during a high tax period in California.  </P> <P> Howard Jarvis' prediction was correct: Proposition 13 will continue to be the  scapegoat for any trouble caused by man or by nature.  </P> <P> JOEL FOX  </P> <P> President, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response, the Department notes that many of the demand curves used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model were derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those that were empirically estimated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1976. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The Department recognizes that a project to update the demand curves could be useful, considering the age of the data currently being used. The Department does not believe that such data exist. However, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests that if such data does exist that it be submitted as comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Lin, Hirst, and Colon, Fuel Choices in the Household Sector, ORNL Report Con-3 Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1976. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Product mix.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model should, but does not, take into account the effect that standards have on the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices among product classes, which in turn will change the product mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demanded by the market. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 67).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department did take cross-elasticity effects into account in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of water heaters (between electric and gas fuels) where they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly important, and will continue to look for instances where such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects may arise in order to take those effects into account as warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See Technical Support Document, Volume F, Appendix B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Market power.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical of the way the Department models marketplace monopsony power, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the market power of purchasers. In its critique, the Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers stated that the ability of manufacturers to pass on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased costs to the consumer is limited because their customers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily a group of large and sophisticated retailers who have significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and increasing power in the marketplace, and who exert downward pressure on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the retail prices of appliances. It further stated that the Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model attempts to model the situation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeling a larger number of manufacturers than actually exist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> theoretical underpinnings were given for this assertion and that there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason why the predictions of this ``false model'' should have any resemblance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to what actually transpires in the real world. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 67&hyph;68).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that oligopsony power itself could probably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeled analogously to oligopoly power. There is, however, no accepted theory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the modeling of an industry characterized by both oligopoly and oligopsony.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, DOE detailed the assumptions and relevant mathematical derivations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approach in the aforementioned Technical Support Document for the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. The approach is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the number of firms input into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model until the markups that are actually observed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace are achieved; this is also an obvious implication of The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments that manufacturers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to pass on costs is limited. In fact, the most prominent comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a review panel on the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model indicated a concern that the modeling assumptions had gone too far in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the direction of reduced markups. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Manufacturers Impact Model (MIM) External Review Panel Meeting, January 11, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Individual firm.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were also three comments critical of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's modeling of an individual firm. It was argued that the use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``typical firm'' does not address the differential impacts of standards on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies, e.g., sizes, costs, niche markets. The Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers insisted that the Department could address the lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data in performing this type of analysis by researching the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature or by developing an economic theory of how different classes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers would be affected by standards. Whirlpool Corporation suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing the data problem by putting a range on the cost and margin data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 3; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 68&hyph;69).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The problem is essentially a lack of data. The Department's review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the economic literature offered no solution to this problem. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does analyze the cost and margin data (in addition to other parameters) by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing a sensitivity analysis where the Department changes those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters (and others) in the model, and tests the sensitivity of the model's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During interviews conducted with manufacturers, the Department asked a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series of questions covering the effects of firm size and specialization. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date, DOE has not been given information by the industry to draw conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about probable effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

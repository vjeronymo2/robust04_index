			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raisuke Miyawaki, Dentsu adviser, former cabinet </F> Public Relations Office director: "The Structure of the Gang  Recession About Which No One Writes: The Heisei Recession Is `a  Gangster Recession'"]    [Text] The bubble has been cruelly burst and a  two-stage bottoming out is expected for the economy, but  gangsters have deeply penetrated corporations and stocked up a  huge mountain of material for threats in that process.  Full-scale extrication from the recession will be impossible  without a countermeasure for this.    Over a year has past since the new gang law came into  effect.  It is believed that the new law is steadily taking root in  Japanese society, but it cannot be said that corporate society,  which has been on the verge of crisis, has been resuscitated  because of it. Just by reviewing newspaper reports for the past  several months, one can see an incident where five masked gang  members fired five shots into the home of a bank president in  Nagoya in September, and the vice president of a bank in  Wakayama Prefecture was shot with a gun and died in August. From  February to May, a series of fire bombs were thrown at the homes  of branch offices of life insurance, bank, and real estate heads  affiliated with a former zaibatsu. My true feeling is that "the  crisis of corporate society" is still not over.    The current gang force is 90,600 people in 3,490 gangs.  Among  these are 56,600 full-fledged members, and the remaining 34,000  are quasi-members. The big three, the Yamaguchi-gumi,  Inagawa-kai, and Sumiyoshi-kai respectively have 37,200 people  (41.4 percent), 9,800 people (10.8 percent), and 11,400 people  (12.6 percent), and the aggregate total of the three gangs  accounts for about 65 percent.    The National Police Agency [NPA] estimates the income for  all  these gangs at 1.3 trillion yen in 1989 figures. However, this  is a very low estimate; it is probably several times that,  certainly about 5 trillion yen, since it is a figure from before  the bubble economy. Incidentally, the Mafia of the United States  has a core of 5,000 people in 26 families, and their income is  about 10 trillion yen. The Mafia of Italy is said to have an  income between 2 trillion to 4 trillion yen.    The breakdown of the income of Japanese gangs, also in NPA  estimates, is 34.4 percent or 450 billion yen in income from  stimulant drugs; about three tons a year are smuggled in. Since  about 33 shots can be made with one gram, it is an amount that  reaches 100 million shots. Gambling, bucket shop operations,  bodyguard fees, violent intervention in civic affairs, and  violence against corporations are also big income sources.    In an investigation by the NPA, besides the aforementioned  illegal income, 20 percent of the whole is considered to be  income other than illegal such as corporate activities. However,  this part of the income, which is not illegal, is much greater  and has been estimated to be about equal to the illegal income.  It is believed that the weight of this was especially high  during the bubble period.  <H5>  Transformation of Gangs </H5>   There have been four characteristic changes in gangs in  recent years. The first is oligopolization. The number of big  three gang members was 24.6 percent of the whole in 1983. Since  it currently is 65 percent, it calculates to a share increase of  about 40 percent in the 10-year period. What the gangsters call  "the force of the substitute family crest" and what the police  call "the force of organization intimidation" is the motive  force for oligopolization.    The Mafia in the United States and Italy have "an invisible  existence." However, Japanese gangs, far from being invisible,  are "visible gangs," and threaten by showing themselves openly.  In order to threaten by showing themselves, it is more  convenient to have great organizational backing. Profits are  quite different when one can present a business card to show  great organizational backing. Therefore, weak gangs all get  under the umbrella of big gangs. A brake finally has begun to be  put to that trend recently, but that is because the substitute  family crest charge, or in other words, the payment to those in  charge has become high and payment has become difficult.    The second change is infiltration into civic life and  economic activities for fund resource activities. Before the new  gang law was put into force in March 1992, there was "the  principle of nonintervention in civic affairs" among the police  and, speaking in extremes, gangs intervening in civic affairs  were left alone in a situation close to noninterference. In the  meantime, violent intervention in civic matters ballooned into a  large income source for gangs.    Furthermore, there is violence targeted at corporations. Not  only have gangs that have become political associations,  including sokaiya [gangsters who promise not to  disrupt shareholders' general meetings in return for payoffs or  who work for companies in shouting down dissenting shareholders  at such meetings], rapidly increased, but gangs of racketeers  specializing in banks called "bank racketeers" have also  appeared. Banks are overly concerned about appearances and  easily become targets.    Furthermore, they have become active in dummy corporations.  There are companies that supply oshibori [steamed  towels to freshen hands] to bars and clubs, or lease paintings.  Many have also advanced into civil engineering and construction  or the financial business. A gang source calls these "legitimate  businesses," but they are backed by the force of organization  intimidation and the police do not view them as legitimate  businesses so long as the groups are not disbanded.    The third change is armament. For about the past 10 years  except for 1990, over 1,000 guns a year have been confiscated.  Last year, it numbered 1,450, the highest in history. It is said  that one gun has already been distributed to each gang member.    The fourth change is the advance of Japanese gangs overseas  and the advance of foreign gangs into Japan, that is, the  problem of the internationalization of gangs. The United States  has two concerns about this. One is that it will be disastrous  if those with good brains such as the Japanese come and form  violent organizations. The Mafia in the United States originally  was created by local people who were apt to be viewed lowly in  American society, but in reality that group has seized the neck  of the United States. Who is to say what would happen if  Japanese who are said to have good brains came in.    The other is rooted in the so-called "Japanese uniqueness  theory" advocated by revisionists. In other words, the viewpoint  is rapidly spreading that Japan is a unique country that cannot  get along without the association of gangsters.    In any case, their flashy actions overseas have been  conspicuous such as purchasing golf courses in order to launder  money earned during the bubble era. Contacts seeking a smuggling  route for drugs are also becoming active and caution is  necessary.    On the other hand, inroads into Japan by foreign gang  organizations have become active along with the rapid increase  in foreign workers. There are also activities organized by  illegal residents and persons smuggled into the country.  Organized crime groups from Taiwan and Hong Kong have already  landed and situations where they are conspiring with Japanese or  feuding with each other have become a reality.  <H5>  Infiltration Into Corporate Society </H5>   With the bubble economy sandwiched in between, the  infiltration of gangs into corporations has become serious.    The first crisis when Japanese corporate society was  infiltrated by gangs was about the time of revision of the  Commercial Code in 1982. It is common knowledge that the  sokaiya of the ruling party had the role of  suppressing the sokaiya of the opposition parties in  addition to being thoroughly familiar with the intimate details  of corporations. The employment of gangs by those  sokaiya to demonstrate power at general stockholder  meetings was an opportunity for sokaiya inroads by  gangs. At first, gangs came in cautiously, but they found that  there was no other such profitable business. While in gangs,  they had been treated as if they had no human rights by  detectives of the Metropolitan Police Department, for instance,  but as soon as they became sokaiya, they came to be  called "sensei" [title of respect for teachers, doctors, etc.].  Prior to the 1982 revision of the Commercial Code, it is  estimated that from 100 billion yen to 200 billion yen flowed to  sokaiya. By gangs taking the place of  sokaiya, the intimate details of corporations were  grasped by the gangs.    Therefore, the Commercial Code was hastily revised. It  prohibited provision of profits to sokaiya. In  addition, the authority of the chairman at general stockholder  meetings was strengthened, and the unit stock system was also  introduced. By this, laws were prepared to eliminate  sokaiya, and the existence of sokaiya was  no longer necessary if there were resolute managers. Problems no  longer occurred so long as they kept an attentive eye on  management.    Nevertheless, they were not able to eliminate  sokaiya entirely. When general meetings of the  stockholders neared, some managers even become cross with the  general affairs staff, demanding to know why they had to study  such a thing, and sokaiya came to shake up such  companies. Such a thing was solely a problem of manager  attitude.    Although there was some decrease in sokaiya, they  did not disappear completely because there were some companies  giving profits to sokaiya. Then, the bubble economy  occurred and the situation completely changed.  <H5>  Greatest Shackle to Economic Recovery </H5>   I say that the current Heisei recession is "a gangster  recession," and many managers would agree and say, "That is  right." The economists, however, do not seem to see the  connection between gangs and the current recession. I believe  that extrication from the recession will be impossible without  this viewpoint.    There are three reasons for that.    First, some corporations transferred the excess money in the  bubble era to stock, and moreover, some corporations rode the  wave of urban redevelopment and invested in office buildings and  planned for the construction of golf courses and leisure  facilities. Land speculators were necessary for that, and many  gangs were involved with land speculators. Initially, there was  a middleman, but it soon became troublesome. Moreover, gangs  always sought acquaintance with corporate officers. Cases of  gang members and corporate employees drinking with each other  increased, and the things they said, snide remarks about  superiors, and other corporate gossip that was unintentionally  revealed, looking at it now, are all becoming the material for  their threats.    Moreover, although they depended on land speculators, there  were many projects that collapsed midway. If that happened, the  gangs learned how much loss was incurred by whose responsibility  within the corporation. They also knew how much embellishment  was made in the March 1992 settlement of accounts when the  bubble burst, and how much coverup was made in the stockholders  general meeting.    Even worse, gossip about the plans of corporation heads,  starting with the creation of condos for when they retire and  shifting company money to compensate for those losses, was also  snared in the net of considerable information of the gangs.    The gangs believe that it will be to their advantage not to  make threats immediately, but to intimidate them after corporate  performance improves a little more. When the economy has begun  to recover, there will be an increase in the corporations that  cannot refuse if they propose to do new work jointly. By this,  even if there is somewhat of an upturn in the economy, there  will be no frame of mind for facilities investment.    Second, there is the problem of bad debts. As economists  have  also pointed out, a considerable portion of the bad debts, which  some say amount to 40 trillion yen in financial institutions  alone, are said to be related to gangs. There are some managers  who seek help from gangs in disposing of bad debts, although  they are not related to gangs. The relationship between bad  debts and gangs is proceeding in a rather bad direction and  there will be no resolution of the bad debt problem by ignoring  gang countermeasures.    Third, the amassing of public works projects is being  conducted as a recession countermeasure. However, from 1 percent  to 3 percent of the public works expenditures have flowed to  gangs under the pretext of periphery countermeasure expenses or  cooperation money. Some say that if they don't pay money to  gangs, they will not be allowed to go through the streets. That  is because some gangs are involved in ready mixed concrete,  gravel, and waste disposal businesses. In some areas gangs  control dump trucks and the structure is such that projects are  impossible without paying cooperation money.    Thus, gangs are incorporated into the basic structure of the  Japanese economy. Even if the official rate is lowered, and even  if public works projects are amassed, there is one more big  factor why a clear response does not appear, and that is  because we close our eyes to gangs. The media also has a  serious responsibility for the gang problem. Even if illegal  activities of bank branch managers occur, gang involvement is  not reported until an announcement by the police. Before that,  hardly anything is written about the bad parts of corporations,  perhaps the result of corporate public relations  countermeasures. It is said that "beat reporters" have made  politics worse, but what about economic journalists? I believe  that grave reflection is called for on the way journalists  report about coporations.    Of course, it goes without saying that a strengthening of  controls on underground money with the systematic cooperation of  the police, National Tax Administration, and public prosecutors  offices is necessary for extrication from the recession, but  more than anything, self-awareness by managers is most  important. They must have self-awareness that having  relationships with gangs as a corporation and as an individual  is itself a crime and keep in mind that gangs are organized  criminal groups that will do anything for money. Extrication  from the "gangster recession" will be impossible without a  resolute attitude.</p>

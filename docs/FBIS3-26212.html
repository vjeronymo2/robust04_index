Present at the  party were Peng Chong, vice chairman of the Seventh National  People's Congress Standing Committee; Yuan Qitong, Su Changpei,  Liu Yongye, Zhang Mingjun, and Song Jun, vice chairmen of the  Eighth Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee; leading  comrades of the fifth, sixth, and seventh provincial people's  congress standing committees; and retired cadres at and above  the departmental level from subordinate organs of the provincial  people's congress. They happily gathered together to usher in  the Spring Festival.    You Dexin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference provincial committee, attended the tea  party. Yuan Qitong presided over the party and, on behalf of  the provincial people's congress standing committee, extended  New Year's greetings to old comrades present at the party.    Amid warm applause, Comrade Peng Chong aired his view on the  issue of the development of democracy and the legal system. He  said: Developing a high degree of socialist democracy and a  sound socialist legal system is our long-termn strategic task.  To be sure, democracy is important, but it must be regulated by  law and be put on a systematic basis. Without a legal system  there will be no democracy. In particular, without a legal  system, we will not be able to achieve our goal of establishing  a socialist market economy.    Peng Chong said: The Fujian Provincial People's Congress  Standing Committee has done a great deal of work in local  legislation, playing an important role in promoting and  defending reform, opening up, and economic construction, as well  as social stability. It is necessary to heighten the sense of  the legal system, adhere to the principle of acting according to  the law, strictly enforce laws, intensify supervision over  implementation of laws, and take effective measures to eliminate  corruption and other ugly phenomena in the community.    Old comrades, including Cheng Xu, Zan Fumin, Wen Xiushan,  Wang Zhe, and Zhang Yumin, also addressed the tea party.</p>

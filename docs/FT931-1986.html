			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Kynoch improves to Pounds 958,000 Kynoch Group, the specialist healthcare equipment company which underwent a capital reconstruction earlier this year, reported profits of Pounds 958,000 before tax for the 1992 year. The outcome - achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 14m to Pounds 15.2m of which exports accounted for 22 per cent - compared with profits of Pounds 703,000 last time. Earnings per share, adjusted for a full tax charge, emerged at 3.4p (3.2p). Directors intend to resume the payment of dividends on the ordinary capital 'as soon as it is practicable'.</p>

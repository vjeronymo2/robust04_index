			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: European mergers The European Commission's decision to re-open its investigation of the British Airways-Dan-Air merger will do little to allay the fears of those who worry that its competition policy is politically driven. The request was made by the Belgian government, as indeed is its right under the hitherto neglected article 22 of the EC merger regulation. However it is not hard to detect the hidden hand of the Belgian flag carrier Sabena and its shareholder, Air France. They may have difficulty arguing that the merger will impede competition in the Belgian market. Before it acquired Dan-Air, BA had seven daily flights between London Heathrow and Brussels - the same as Sabena. Now it has acquired four flights from Gatwick, yet the merged British carrier still accounts for less than one third of the traffic between the two capitals. Last month the EC found no reason to block the deal at a European level. Now it seems slightly embarrassed at having to revisit the issue. The outcome is unlikely to be anything tougher than a requirement on BA to give up some of its London-Brussels slots, if that. The City was right to shrug off the implications yesterday, but Sabena may have found a temporary spoiling tactic and Belgium's action shows the battle to confine European merger control to competition issues is still not won.</p>

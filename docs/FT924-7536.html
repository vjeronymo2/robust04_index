			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Investors optimistic about US growth THREE quarters of Britain's leading institutional investors are more optimistic about the prospects for US growth in the next 12 months following Mr Bill Clinton's victory in the presidential election, according to a Gallup survey for stockbrokers Smith New Court. For the first time in a year the investors have declared an intention to increase rather than decrease their holdings of US equities. The fund managers continue to be more interested in increasing holdings of UK equities than UK gilts. In three months time they anticipate the FTSE-100 index will stand at 2745 - it closed at 2697.5 on Friday - and in a year they anticipate 2973. The survey suggests there is less investor concern about inflation in the UK. The investors' forecast of the 12-month inflation rate by the end of 1993 has fallen to 3.7 per cent from 4 per cent last month. Base rates are forecast to fall to 6 per cent in a year's time. The survey of 103 institutions handling Pounds 611bn of funds was carried out before the chancellor's mini-budget on Thursday. The investors believed average earnings will increase by 4 per cent over the next 12 months, the lowest forecast for over a year. For the first time since Smith New Court started the survey two years ago, the investors have decided to reduce their holdings of Japanese equities.</p>

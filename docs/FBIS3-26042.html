			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary on current economic affairs by Liu Yusong (0491 </F> 3552 2646), Qian Wenying (6929 2429 3841), and Du Xiangsheng  (6757 4382 3932): "Take Problems in Market Construction  Seriously"]    [Text] As of the end of last year, Shanghai had 10  national-level commodity exchange markets, making 1993 a year of  steady progress in the municipality's market construction.  Building a framework of major commodity markets in Shanghai in  accordance with the needs of a socialist market economy is a new  agenda. The 10 commodity markets all have the characteristics  of a modern market:    -- The markets are comprehensive and large in scale.  Shanghai did not have a head start in major commodity market  construction; however, it has advanced quickly and has surpassed  the early starters. It not only leads the rest of the country  in the number of national-level commodity exchange markets but  also ranks among the top in transaction volume. The total  amount of transactions reached 450 billion yuan last year. In  addition, the municipality has comprehensive commodity markets,  consisting of eight capital goods and two consumer goods  markets. The eight capital goods markets cover all the  categories of capital goods.    -- The markets have instituted mechanisms for conducting  futures transactions and are advancing toward becoming standard  futures markets. All 10 major exchanges have instituted  mechanisms for operating futures transactions, including a  membership system, a cash deposit system, open bidding, and  uniform settlement. In addition, they are all working hard to  promote futures transactions. Shanghai's metals exchange  conducted 108,737 million yuan of futures transactions using  standard contracts last year, representing 28 percent of the  total volume of the exchange's transactions. Shanghai's building  materials exchange conducted four transactions using standard  contracts as soon as it began operation at the end of last year.    -- Their members are numerous and scattered throughout the  country, and their structures are rational. Each of the  exchanges has several dozen members, and one has 209. About  half of their members come from other parts of the country while  the other half are local enterprises. Among them are producers,  end-users, businesses in the circulation area, and specialized  brokerage companies.    -- The rate of contract fulfillment has been fairly high.  All the exchanges have formulated self-regulatory rules  governing administration, transactions, and membership, thereby  ensuring a good and sound market order.    -- Development is uneven. Trading is more active in  exchanges dealing with commodities that are more  market-oriented. Shanghai's metals exchange, for example, had a  record daily transaction of 5.7 billion yuan, and its total  volume of transactions last year reached 400 billion yuan,  making it the third largest metals exchange in the world.  Trading is rather slow in exchanges dealing with commodities  that are more planning-oriented. Shanghai's automobile exchange  market, farming goods exchange, and coal exchange had an average  of 612,000 yuan, 739,000 yuan, and 964,000 yuan, respectively,  in daily transactions.    Shanghai's 10 major markets have already made positive  contributions. They have, for example, made initial  contributions to reducing price fluctuations in spot markets by  helping set prices and guide production. They have helped  enterprises reduce their inventories and save capital through  rational allocation of resources. They have removed from the  economic system the elements of "informal transactions" and  other factors affecting fair competition. They have helped  train a number of specialized personnel for many emerging  industries and trades.    Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets have  also encountered problems during their development. The main  problems, as reported by the exchanges, are the lack of a  municipality-wide unified authoritative administrative agency;  the lack of municipality uniform transaction rules and  regulations; the lack of an independent settlement company  serving the needs of the exchanges; and the lack of special  warehouses for transactions in kind. In addition, futures  personnel training and management are in chaos, and there are  too many departments demanding transaction data. Further, the  exchanges' self-regulatory rules and regulations are still in an  early stage of development. There are many loopholes in hedging  risks on the part of the exchanges and in monitoring members'  trading practices.    Shanghai's national-level commodity exchange markets should  pay close attention to the following tasks to ensure steady,  regularized, and sound development:    1. The municipality should set up a separate market  supervision and management commission to undertake comprehensive  planning and rational distribution and to strictly screen the  categories and varieties of commodities placed for trading. The  commission should remove commodities not suitable for futures  exchange and should help coordinate matters related to trading.    2. The municipality should transform two or three selected  exchanges into standard futures commodity exchanges ahead of  others and link them to the international market by cultivating  and developing them on a priority basis. It should prescribe  medicine for exchanges with slack business according to their  symptoms: replacing commodities that will be planning-oriented  for the next few years; based on the requirements of spot  exchange, regulate markets that are not suitable for futures  transactions; and merge various specialized futures exchange  markets when conditions are ripe so that transactions can be  conducted in a single market to improve efficiency.    3. The municipality should step up training of trading  specialists, conduct in-depth study on trading issues, help  organize influential multi-purpose brokerage companies, and  attract more producers, end-users, and intermediary businesses  to engage in futures trading.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that Turkey  and the Ukraine share a historical heritage as well as a common  geographical area and added that relations will develop quickly  as a result of these favorable conditions. TRT correspondent  Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Kiev:    [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Demirel, who is currently  visiting the Ukraine, delivered a speech at the Ukrainian  Supreme Council this morning.    In his speech, Demirel pointed out that the Ukraine  demonstrated its political will when it converted to pluralistic  democracy. Stressing that those that have faith in democracy are  not deterred by hardships, Demirel added: The advise I would  like to give you as the president of Turkey, Ataturk's Turkey  and a nation which inherited a great and rich historical  heritage, is that the fate of a country is shaped by its faith  in democracy. In addition to having all kinds of solutions in a  pluralistic democracy, it is the only regime where a suitable  and favorable solution can be found in an constructive manner.  Demirel indicated that another condition for achieving a  pluralistic democracy is success in a free market economy.  Stating that Turkey, which has been implementing a free market  economy for a long time now, is perpetually in search of new  pursuits, Demirel noted that the Ukraine should not be  discouraged by obstacles on the road to a free market economy.    Demirel also met Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Ukranian  Supreme Council, and conferred with him for some time. Demirel  later received a group of Turkish university students, listened  to their concerns, and pointed out to the importance of  verifying whether the courses they are taking correspond to  those in Turkey. Demirel asked Professor Mehmet Saglam,  president of Council on Higher Education, that more information  should be given to the student on this issue.    Receiving representatives of Turkish companies in Ukraine,  Demirel pointed out to a great potential existing in this  country for Turkish businessmen. Demirel indicated that special  efforts will be exerted to evaluate this potential. Turkish  businessmen presented him with a plaque in memory of his visit.    Demirel later visited a 1,700-building complex built by  Turks  for Ukrainian officers. Demirel will receive the Ukrainian  deputy prime minister after visiting the Cathedral of St.  Sophia. The presidents of both countries will hold a joint news  conference in the afternoon where they will assess Demirel's  visit.    Meanwhile, the joint communique signed yesterday by Ukraine  and Turkey will be announced today. [end recording]</p>

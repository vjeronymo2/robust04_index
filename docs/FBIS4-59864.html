			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ranya Khallaf: "Lawyers Furor in Central Cairo"] </F>   [Text] The death in police custody of 32-year-old lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani triggered an angry protest by hundreds of  lawyers at the Cairo headquarters of the Lawyers Syndicate last  Tuesday. The police said death had been due to natural causes,  but members of the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled syndicate  insisted he had died as a result of torture. Madani was  arrested on 26 April and transferred to the prisoners' wing of  Qasr al-'Ayni hospital a few days later, where he subsequently  died. His family was informed of his death on 6 May and asked  to collect his body.    Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi vehemently denied  allegations  that Madani's death had been other than a natural one, asserting  that "the man died of an asthma attack, and it has nothing to do  with torture."    Reported to have been a prominent member of the clandestine  al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, Madani was heavily involved in  defending its members before the courts and had on several  occasions faced charges himself connected to militant Islamist  activities.    But according to Kamal Khalid, an independent member of  parliament and lawyer, Madani had recently been trying to  negotiate truce between the al-Jama'ah and the state. Khalid,  in an interview with AL-AHRAM WEEKLY, claimed that shortly  before his arrest Madani had approached him and asked him to  relate to the security bodies a proposal to end the violence on  both sides. Khalid added that Madani had told him the  al-Jama'ah had realised that "certain foreign powers were using  the confrontation to harm the country, and was therefore willing  to end its attacks if the security forces did the same." The  security officials Khalid approached with the proposal refused  to discuss it however, he went on to allege.    Islamist members of the Lawyers Syndicate hailed Madani as a  martyr and vowed to avenge him. "Martyr have no fear, your  death shall be avenged," the protesting lawyers chanted at the  syndicate's headquarters on Tuesday. On the balconies of the  syndicate's second floor stood veiled women dressed in black  equally chanting slogans while some wept.    Heavily surrounded by contingents of the anti-riot Central  Security Forces, the syndicate headquarters in central Cairo was  enveloped in banners, posters and signs denouncing the alleged  murder of Madani. The lawyers threatened to take their protest  to the streets, demanding a full investigation into the  incident. Meanwhile the massive police siege to prevent the  outbreak of demonstrations created havoc with the already  congested traffic throughout central Cairo. However, and  despite the fierceness of the slogans, the police stood and  watched as the lawyers carried on with their protest within the  syndicate's gates.    Tuesday's angry protest was not confined to the Islamists  however, but included leftists, Nasirists and a number of  Wafdists. The head of the Cairo branch of the Lawyers Syndicate,  leading Wafdist Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz addressed the protest  rally saying that Madani's death "strengthens our resolve and  determination to defend freedom and liberties." He went on to  warn, "It will not be the last unless we take strong and united  action against such violations."    Tuesday's show of unity did not heal the deep fracture in  the  ranks of the Islamists themselves however. Muntasir al-Zayyat,  a prominent lawyer for members of the Jihad and the al-Jama'ah  told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY after the protest that the Muslim  Brotherhood members of the Lawyers Syndicate's Executive Council  were equally to blame for Madani's death. "They should have  taken more decisive action on this and similar cases," he said,  adding that some 30 lawyers were still subject to administrative  detention. Earlier, the Association of Islamist Lawyers, of  which al-Zayyat is a leading member, issued a statement accusing  the council of "complicity and cowardice". Commenting on the  day's events, al-Zayyat criticised the council for failing to  organise a street demonstration to protest Madani's death. He  described the recommendations adopted by the council during the  rally as inadequate.    For its part, the council issued a number of resolutions  demanding that an independent autopsy be conducted on Madani's  body and that the culprits in his alleged torture be named and  duly punished. It also demanded the release of all lawyers  subject to administrative detention. It warned that unless  these demands are complied with, it will call for a general  lawyers strike next Sunday and for a peaceful street  demonstration.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Indian minister to stay Mr PV Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister, yesterday rejected the resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, ending a week of uncertainty about India's economic reform programme. Mr Singh offered his resignation on December 24, after a parliamentary committee report had implicated the finance ministry in the Bombay financial scandal. An official said the prime minister had decided not to accept the resignation after a parliamentary debate on Wednesday and Thursday. The opposition had vociferously demanded that Mr Singh's resignation be accepted but the prime minister decided the minister would defend himself and the role of the government in the scandal. The spokesman said the prime minister had written to the finance minister saying that the government had set itself an enormous agenda which needed to be completed. Mr Singh, considered a main architect of India's economic liberalisation, rebutted several charges by the parliamentary committee which investigated the Bombay scandal.</p>

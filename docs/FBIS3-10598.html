The  award will be granted during the national expanded UPEC [Union  of Cuban Journalists] plenum, which will also be held on 14  March. The plenum is to examine important matters related to the  development of the press in Cuba, following the sixth UPEC  Congress.    UPEC president Tubal Paez announced that the commemoration,  instituted as an historical tribute to the founding of the  newspaper PATRIA by Jose Marti, is being observed nationwide,  with homage being paid in discussion and exchange forums. These  have already begun in Cienfuegos.    The UPEC presidency reported that UPEC is working on  restructuring the provincial emulation competitions in order to  choose a site for the Press Day events and the PATRIA newspaper  award.    In this capital, Cuba's journalists paid homage to Enrique  de  la Osa, Santiago Alvarez, and Adigio Benitez [all names as  heard] -- living legends in print journalism, cinematography,  and graphic arts. Certificates were awarded to commemorate the  moment. The moment, however, was far more memorable to those who  attended the meeting that followed the initial ceremony, which  opened to the collection of stories and the broad vision of  professionals who, through their different ways of doing things,  have set press standards.    At the meeting to pay homage to De la Osa, Alvarez, and  Benitez, one of the fascinating subjects turned out to be the  revival of ("Nao") and "Hanoi: Tuesday the Thirteenth" ["Hanoi,  Martes Trece"], two of the best-remembered plays by the man who  founded the (ITAI-Latinoamericano) newscast. UPEC's homage to  three great members of the national press constituted  reaffirmation of the value of Cuban journalism, its  perspectives, and its spirit.</p>

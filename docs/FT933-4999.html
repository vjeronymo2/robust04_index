			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: BNP's private hopes Since BNP will be the first in the looming wave of French privatisations, it stands to reason that investors will be offered an attractive deal. Frantic preparation is now under way on the offering, which looks likely to be targeted heavily towards French retail investors. Keeping international buyers short would be one way of whipping up appeal. As with Spain's Argentaria sale earlier this year, their enthusiasm could spill over into the domestic market, creating a virtuous circle of demand. Blow away the froth, though, and a more complex question arises. Having virtually doubled over the past year, BNP's investment certificates are discounting a substantial earnings recovery. The market assumed that, by announcing a 42 per cent increase in first-half bad debt provisions, Mr Michel Pebereau, BNP's new chairman, was clearing the decks for such a recovery. Provisions could again be high in the second half, though, given BNP's heavy exposure to the small business sector which is taking the brunt of the current downturn. With the authorities still reluctant to cut interest rates, it could be 1995 before BNP delivers a solid earnings recovery. Admittedly, it may be striking when it comes, simply because peak provisions will have been so high. Even if Mr Pebereau only manages a modest clampdown on costs, there could also be significant growth in operating income. The danger is that the shine could be taken off by the plan for BNP to raise additional capital to purchase a further 10 per cent of the UAP insurance company. Such a move fits with official policy of giving privatised companies an interlocking network of stable shareholders, but it makes little commercial sense when BNP already has its own life insurance operation. Above all, it risks being dilutive: UAP's longer term recovery prospects are considerably less exciting than those of BNP itself.</p>

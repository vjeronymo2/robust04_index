			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITISH VOTE EXPECTED TO DRUB THATCHER  </P> <P> Britons voting in nationwide elections today were expected to hand Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher the worst electoral drubbing of her 11 years in  power and register strong opposition to her economic policies, including a poll  tax that has set off rioting.  </P> <P> Officials reported a brisk turnout during the daylong balloting in brilliant  sunshine across most of the country.  </P> <P> In Britain, votes are counted by hand and most results were to be declared in  the early hours Friday, several hours after the polls close.  </P> <P> The ballot for 201 local councils was the Conservative Party prime minister's  biggest electoral test since her popularity began dropping a year ago to a now  record low due in part to higher interest rates and inflation.  </P> <P> The opposition socialist Labor Party held a huge lead of more than 20 points,  recent opinion polls indicated.  </P> <P> Today's polling is the first time the Conservatives have faced voters since the  imposition April 1 of the so-called poll tax, an unpopular per-capita  assessment by local governments that replaced a property-based levy.  </P> <P> At stake are about 5,000 seats on local councils ranging from big regional  cities to English country districts.  </P> <P> A rout would increase speculation that the party may try to dump Thatcher this  autumn, the last realistic chance before the next general election in 1991 or  1992.  </P> <P> "In midterm, the government aims to hold what it has. This we shall do,"  Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth Baker said Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But computer forecasts based on opinion polls showed the Conservatives on  course to lose up to 350 seats -- about one-fourth of the seats they are  defending. As the bad news piled up, Thatcher aides hinted this week that the  poll tax may be amended.  </P> <P> Critics call the tax inherently unfair because the country's richest man pays  the same as his gardener.  </P> <P> Under the old local tax system, only the country's 17 million homeowners paid a  property tax. The new tax is levied against every adult.  </P></p>

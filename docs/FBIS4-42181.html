			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Allies Table Bill To </F> Lift Fascist Ban"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- A group of Reformist  (ex-Radical party) MPs, external allies of the Berlusconi  government, today tabled a bill calling for the scrapping of two  Constitutional articles banning the recreation of the prewar  Fascist Party and the return to Italy of members of the former  royal family, the House of Savoy, exiled since soon after the  war.    A statement stressed that the move was libertarian in  inspiration. A similar proposal was presented to parliament by  the Reformists' predecessors, the civil libertarian Radicals, in  1982.    In their statement, the six signatories to the bill said  that  "it is just at this difficult time that one must affirm with  intransigence and rigour the values of that same liberal  tolerance, that safeguarding of all freedoms starting with  freedom of speech, that were and are the inspiration and the  founding criterion of antitotalitarian antifascism."    "It is at a time that the postfascists have obtained full  legitimacy, while legitimate concerns have been raised, that  rigorous tolerance must be affirmed in all its force," the  Reformists said, apparently in reference to a threatened  encroachment on free speech in the wake of a national rally of  neo-Nazi skinheads 10 days ago. Two officials at the northern  town of Vicenza, the scene of the march, were sacked by Interior  Minister Roberto Maroni, who said there would be no repetition,  and yesterday declared war on extremists of all stripes.    The bill is identical to one represented on May 16 by  Foreign  Undersecretary Vincenzo Trantino, of the hard right National  Alliance, immediately disowned and withdrawn by party leader  Gianfranco Fini, who has stepped up his drive to distance what  he calls the "postfascist" Alliance from the neofascist roots of  its major component, the Italian Social Movement.    The libertarian MPs' stance contrasted somewhat with that of  Fini, who has repeatedly condemned neo-Nazis as "racist idiots"  and said that those who took part in the Vicenza march should be  "sent to the salt mines." Around 30 young members of the  Italian Social Movement who took part in the march were  immediately ejected from the party.    But the move by one of the conservative government's smaller  and lesser-known allies -- who have not actually entered  government, but profess "external support" -- will do little to  snuff flickering international concern over the presence in the  Berlusconi cabinet of three ministers and numerous  undersecretaries from the Italian Social Movement.    Italy's partners have been assured by Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino, in Brussels last week and in  Washington yesterday, that Berlusconi's is essentially a  centrist government and that the National Alliance's moves away  from the Italian Social Movement are strong and sincere.

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMY CARTER  </P> <P> There has been considerable negative clamor about the prospects of Richard  Nixon returning to political activism.  </P> <P> Jimmy Carter has recently been involved in the Nicaraguan electoral process  (taking advantage of the news coverage to criticize the policies of the Reagan  and Bush Administrations).  </P> <P> Currently, he is adventuring into the "Mideast peace process" situation.  </P> <P> Lest we forget, this is the same Jimmy Carter whose ineptness brought the  United States to its knees with regard to our international posture and  domestic economy.  </P> <P> In particular, his policies (or lack of them) led to the fall of the shah of  Iran (one of our best allies), the hostage situation, the hostage rescue  fiasco, the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan, the communization of Nicaragua,  the negotiated loss of the Panama Canal, the highest domestic inflation rate  (that we have ever suffered), the gutting of our defenses and intelligence  agencies -- all occurred on Jimmy Carter's watch!  </P> <P> It is naive to perceive Carter's activities as altruistic (including his  poverty area home-building projects). He is obviously maneuvering for political  gain.  </P> <P> OBIE R. SILVERWOOD JR.  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

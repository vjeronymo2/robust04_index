			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyoto, June 7 KYODO -- Kyoto city officials  apologized Tuesday [7 June] for the oversight that led to a  police raid Monday on the Kyoto chapter of a pro-Pyongyang group  of Korean residents and its school, Kyoto Chosen Gakuen.    Haruyuki Nishi, head of financial affairs for the Kyoto  municipal government, apologized for the city's oversight in  thinking that the school had failed to submit a report required  under the National Land Utilization Law.    Kyoto police raided 27 locations associated with the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), including  the school, believing the school had failed to submit a report  on the intended uses of the land.    The 43,000 square meters of land was purchased from Kyoto  farmers between March 1990 and October 1991 for the relocation  of the school building.    The land is located in an urbanization control area and the  law requires that necessary information must be filed with the  municipal government upon transaction of such land.    On Tuesday, Nishi said police had inquired in late March  about the land transaction and an official in the city's land  uses inspection section overlooked the proper entry in the  city's ledger.    Nishi also explained that since 1987 the city has been  computerizing its operations under the law, but the school's  transaction had not yet been put in the computer.    As the computerization operations continue, city officials  will double-check the data to avoid a recurrence of the  incident, he added.    Earlier Tuesday, Chongnyon members in Kyoto protested the  raid and demanded an apology and the return of confiscated  articles.    Meanwhile in Tokyo, the head of Chongnyon's international  division, Kim Tae-hui, demanded an apology and tighter control  over "unjust raids and violations of human rights by police  authorities."    Police raided Chongnyon's Osaka offices in April on  suspicion  that the association's members disrupted a rally by another  group of Korean residents demanding North Korea release  political prisoners.    Monday's mistaken raid also comes amid a growing number of  attacks on students of Chongnyon-affiliated schools, believed to  have been sparked by allegations that Chongnyon members send  billions of yen annually to relatives in North Korea.    The U.S. Government believes that at least some of the money  is funneled to the financially strapped North Korean Government  and may be used to fund a suspected nuclear arms development  program.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / People: A different type of finance director Building products and packaging group Norcros has filled the slot of finance director vacated when Robert Alcock was promoted to group managing director earlier this year by headhunting Gavin Morris, former chief executive of United Precision Industries. 'We were looking for a different type of finance director, not one from the narrow discipline of accountancy,' says chairman Michael Doherty; he and Alcock are both from the profession 'which is more than enough'. Morris does indeed have an atypical background for a finance director. Having gained a first in psychology from Edinburgh, with spells at universities in the US and Germany during that course, he worked for three years at Citicorp before taking an MBA at the University of Chicago. He then went to Bain for five years, before joining United Precision Industries as commercial director of the management buy-in of RHP Bearings. The company was restructured and sold to Nippon Seiko in 1990; he took over as chief executive from Alan Bowkett who went to Berisford. Since then he has been involved in merging NSK's European businesses - helped by his fluency in German and Spanish as well as his workable French. At the same time Norcros, which has been going through a long restructuring phase, announced that EMAP group managing director David Arculus will join the board as a non-executive director. 'Coming from the magazine and newspapers business he has a very different outlook on life,' Doherty explains. 'Producing a product that is waste paper tomorrow if you fail to deliver it to your customers gives you a far greater sense of immediacy.' Arculus meanwhile has hitherto not taken on other non-executive positions; Norcros will give him his first taste of the world of manufacturing.</p>

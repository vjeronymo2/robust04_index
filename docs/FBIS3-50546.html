The Holy See advised that the  Catholic Church cannot and should not be involved in acts of  bloodshed, which the Gospel rejects, nor can it support  violence. Therefore, if some lay person or clergyman is  involved in these events, it is on a personal basis, as the  church -- as an institution - distances itself from all of this.    This was stated by (Girolamo Priggiani), the Pope's  representative in Mexico, after saying that the developments in  Chiapas State are painful, regrettable, and dramatic. He said  the Church shrinks from acts of violence and is not nor can it  be involved in this delicate matter in which lives have been  lost.</p>

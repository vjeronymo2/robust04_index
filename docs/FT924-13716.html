			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens may quit 'long' steel HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel group, may stop making long steel products according to Mr Aad van der Velden, a member of the board, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. Hoogovens has forecast losses of several hundred million guilders in 1992, but expects to return to profit in 1993. Mr Van der Velden said Hoogovens would increasingly concentrate on high grades of flat steel, such as that used for car bodies.</p>

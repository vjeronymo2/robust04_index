			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kone lifts profits despite sales fall Profits at Kone, the Finnish elevators group, rose 15.6 per cent in the first four months as lower financing costs offset a sharp drop in sales and sluggish markets. The results, showing profits after financial items rising to FM74m (Dollars 13.4m) from FM64m, reflect the impact of the group's refocusing programme and weak demand in Europe, which accounts for 80 per cent of turnover. New elevator deliveries were lower than a year ago and maintenance business was static. The group said there was no sign of a revival in European elevator demand. It looked for growth from non-European markets and a steady development of maintenance and modernisation business. Disposals and the difficult elevator market explain the 30 per cent drop in sales to FM2.5bn from FM3.6bn. The company has sold MacGregor-Navire, a supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, and Kone Cranes, as part of a focus on its main lift operations. Operating profits sank to FM85m from FM123m. The disposals helped cut interest-bearing net debt to FM500m at the end of April from FM1bn at the end of 1993, reducing financing costs to FM20m from FM70m. The company wants to sell its remaining non-core activities. Kone's majority owner, the Herlin family, last month rejected an offer from Germany's Thyssen group for its entire shareholding. The family controls about 40 per cent of Kone's capital and 70 per cent of the votes.</p>

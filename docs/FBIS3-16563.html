			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 16 March carries the 10-minute "Details"  program, presented by Sergey Dorenko. The program carries brief  recorded interviews with some opposition figures at unspecified  locations.    The presenter begins by noting that there will be opposition  rallies in Moscow's Theater Square on 17 March. He says that the  exact number of militia and internal troops who will be assigned  for crowd control is a military secret, "but there will be  enough." Dorenko adds, however, that the militia are demoralized  by the recent amnesty decision: "They risked their lives during  such operations; the criminals then walked free."    There follow telephone interviews with former Vice President  Aleksandr Rutskoy and Communist Party chairman Gennadiy  Zyuganov, who criticize the rallies as pointless and state that  they have no involvement with them. Zyuganov says that the  situation could get out of control and play into the hands of  provocateurs.    Dorenko notes that opposition leaders fear the rally more  than the government; he says they are already applying enough  pressure on Yeltsin and do not need street fights to put them in  power.    He goes on: "From contact with all the opposition leaders we  gained the impression today that they are all terribly afraid of  something."    Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian Popular Alliance, then  appears. He says: "I am, of course, put on my guard both by the  fact that the defense minister postponed his trip to St.  Petersburg and by the fact that the president hastily went off  to Sochi. This all indicates that there may be surprises in  store, but not from those who are conducting the rally."    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia (LDPR), is shown. He says: "Troop movements are  thought to be taking place nevertheless and a scenario, as it  were, is being worked out: under the pretext of eliminating the  consequences of inspired and provoked mass disorder -- for  example, a group of armed bandits attacks a group of traders,  over 200 fatalities, blood -- under the pretext of putting an  end to massive disorder, a state of emergency is declared in the  city and, accordingly, there may be restrictions on political  freedoms."    Mikhail Astafyev, leader of the Cadet Party, says that only  the country's present leadership need a crisis on the streets.  Members of the opposition want power to come to them by the due  process of politics, but the authorities are whipping up tension  by practising military manoeuvres.    Dorenko resumes: "Today deputies of all the colours in the  rainbow, from Russia's Choice to the LDPR, came up to us and  talked about a failed attempt yesterday at a coup in Russia with  the ousting of the president and his dismissal from power.  Deputies link this with the immediate hospitalization of  counterintelligence chief Stepashin right after his conversation  with the president. Among the heroes of the defense of the  president, they name Yakovlev, head of the Ostankino TV company,  and General Korzhakov. Whether or not these rumors are true or  not, they characterize the atmosphere in some power structures."    Dorenko goes on to say: "A considerable section of the  opposition feels very strong. It is sure that power is just  about to fall into its hands. Yet they fear that power will be  seized from them by the power structures and by the economic  elite, which will take over the country together with Yeltsin or  without him. The opposition is aware that it is weaker than its  competitors and is even doing its utmost to defend the  president."    Zhirinovskiy next says: "It's a purely Russian scenario. The  president is supposed to be ill or on vacation. It's Foros-2. A  good scenario: he's on vacation, he doesn't know anything. If  disorders occur, democracy is curtailed. If everything is okay,  he is protected and gets fuller powers. If things are bad, he  is protected and punishes those who were unable to do anything.  That's it -- maybe that's all it takes. We've had October 91  and October 93. Why not March 94?"    Dorenko concluded the program by saying: "All schemes and  schedules for the future carving of power are based on the  assumption that the president is seriously ill. Incidentally,  we know from our sources that, on 6 March this year, President  Yeltsin had a thorough medical check-up, including an  investigation of his kidneys and cerebral blood circulation.  Our sources say that the president feels, at least, no worse  than two years ago. We trust our sources. But you, of course,  are not obliged to trust them at all until you are given the  details by the president's physician."</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Private cash plan for Scots M-way The government's intended method of financing road construction with private funds is set to make its Scottish debut. Ministers hope to use the method to complete the M74 motorway in southern Scotland, and could eventually transfer 100km (62 miles) of new motorway to a private operator. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the Scottish Office was exploring the possibility of using the private-finance route for two remaining sections of the M74 project, on which work has not yet begun. He said the Scottish Office was talking to the Department of Transport about applying the same solution to an English stretch of the A74 between Carlisle and the border at Gretna. Under the design, build, finance and operate method, the contractor finances the construction of the road and maintains it for 15 to 25 years, recouping money from the exchequer through 'shadow tolls' based on the amount of traffic using the road. Last month Mr John Watts, roads minister for England and Wales, asked contractors to bid for the first four such road schemes in England. The Scottish Office envisages that a contractor which undertook to complete the M74 in Scotland and England would then take over the full 100km from Abington to Carlisle and operate it. To complete the three stretches would cost about Pounds 160m. Mr Lang was opening an 18.6km stretch of the M74 between Dinwoodie Green and Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway. The four sections have been completed for Pounds 100m by Miller Civil Engineering and Balfour Beatty. Two further sections under construction will be finished towards the end of this year, meaning that more than two-thirds of the project will have been completed at a total cost of nearly Pounds 350m.

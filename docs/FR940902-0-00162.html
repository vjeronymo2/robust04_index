As such, committees must be perceived to be representative and fair in order to be most effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;631.31  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Monitoring and oversight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Governor is responsible for monitoring and oversight of all State and substate grantee activities under this part.

The Governor shall allocate such funds, subject to the SJTCC or HRIC review and comment, during the first three quarters of the program year among substate grantees on the basis of need. Such funds shall be allocated to substate grantees and shall not be used for statewide activities. Such funds shall be included in each substate grantee's allocation for purposes of cost limitations, as described in &sect;631.14 of this part (sections 302(c)(2) and 317(1)(B)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;631.33  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> State procedures for identifying funds subject to mandatory Federal reallotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Governor shall establish procedures to assure the equitable identification of funds required to be reallotted pursuant to section 303(b) of the Act.

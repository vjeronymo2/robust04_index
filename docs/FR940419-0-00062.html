			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with FAR 9.5, EPA will require all contractors who have at least three years of records to search back through the immediately preceding three years of records. For contractors who do not have three years of records to search, a transition period for searches will be implemented requiring the contractor to search any records that it has until, over time, three years of records are accumulated. Contractors, however, are always required to report any conflicts of which they are aware. We emphasize that a contractor is not required to collect, maintain or search records on personal conflicts of interest. The requirement on the contractor is to inform its employees, performing work under or related to EPA contracts, of their obligation to report conflicts of interest. It is the employees' responsibility to review their current and past activities and to report potential conflicts of interest to their employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Elimination of Conflicts by Full Disclosure of Contractor Roles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that EPA should focus on full disclosure of roles, since where full and open disclosure of a contractor's role exists no conflict of interest can occur. We disagree. Although we certainly believe in openness regarding the role of contractors in EPA's procurement program, we fail to see how full disclosure of the role of contractors eliminates the existence of conflicts. Rather, it is contractor disclosure of potential conflicts to EPA that provides the opportunity to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Centralized Decision Making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many comments were received recommending the establishment of a centralized decision making function with an administrative contracting officer at EPA headquarters having the responsibility for decisions on all conflict of interest requests. It was pointed out that this would achieve consistency in conflict of interest determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have seriously considered this as an option and have rejected it. A central administrative contracting officer would not have the necessary background or knowledge of the individual contracts to make well informed conflict of interest determinations. We believe that a decentralized approach to conflict of interest decision making, where determinations are made by the EPA Contracting Officer for the contract on a case-by-case basis, is the more effective approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 16. Objective Standards for Determining Conflicts of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that meaningful objective standards be adopted to evaluate significant personal and organizational conflicts of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAR subpart 9.5 provides definitions and general rules pertaining to conflict of interest, but do not include objective standards. Conflict of interest is a subject for which objective standards are difficult to formulate. However, this does not mean that conflicts cannot be described through definitions and general rules. In addition to the examples included in the FAR, EPA Contracting Officers receive training and assistance on conflict of interest issues from the conflict of interest staff within EPA's Office of Acquisition Management. Therefore, Contracting Officers will have available examples and precedents to assist them in their conflict of interest determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Limited EPA Resources To Administer Conflict of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed concern that EPA would not have the resources to efficiently administer the rule, and other commenters recommended that EPA provide examples of conflicts of interest to help Contracting Officers respond consistently and wisely and prevent delays associated with these new regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe the Agency has sufficient staff to administer these regulations. In the past, response times were sometimes delayed not because of a lack of resources but because of insufficient training and experience. EPA is committed to a comprehensive conflict of interest training program for its Contracting Officers and project personnel. The training will include a collection of case studies and examples upon which to base conflict of interest decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Applicability of the Rule to Superfund Work Outside EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter, expressing support for the rule, suggested that the EPA should consider and clarify how the provisions in the rule can be enforced equally with respect to all Superfund contracts, whether they are let by EPA or other Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

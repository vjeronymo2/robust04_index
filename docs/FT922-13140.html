			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Russia gripped by power struggle: Cabinet members storm out of Congress after taunts by Speaker THE FATE of Russia's reformist government hung in the balance last night as its power struggle with the parliament reached its final stages. Cabinet members stormed out of yesterday's session of the Congress of People's Deputies after Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the ambitious parliamentary Speaker, described the government as 'kids who lost their nerve'. Mr Khasbulatov was taunting the government for its decision to quit unless deputies gave it a vote of confidence and withdrew demands for increased social spending, tax cuts and a continuation of subsidies for the energy sector. As ministers accused the Speaker of reneging on a compromise worked out with parliamentary leaders on Sunday, talks resumed behind the scenes to try to find a new agreement. The stakes are high should they fail. If the government carries out its threat - the resignation letter is lying on President Boris Yeltsin's desk - the country faces yet another political upheaval and a new set of economic promises. It would also face the possible withdrawal of a Dollars 24bn western aid package announced only two weeks ago. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said the bank would halt all financial assistance to Russia if the reforms were postponed and sent a message to Moscow urging the government to press on. A suspension of western aid would further alienate a public exhausted by political squabbling and the hardships of economic reforms already under way. Having damaged Mr Yeltsin's standing, the conservative parliament, elected two years ago under an antiquated electoral system, could also find itself in a political vacuum. In the absence of a developed parliamentary system with strong parties, it is dependent on leaders such as Mr Yeltsin, who may choose to dissolve parliament or go to the country with a referendum. A furious Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, who has masterminded the economic reforms which the west is pledging to help, said: 'We expected more responsibility from the deputies for the fate of the country.' In a four-page statement, Mr Gaidar said their demands were mutually contradictory, hyper-inflationary and would cause the west to withdraw assistance. Although his presence has proved decisive in swaying rebellious deputies in the past, Mr Yeltsin stayed away from parliament yesterday, letting it be known he would speak only at the end of the congress. This suggested that Mr Yeltsin is still anxious to avoid confrontation. Moscow aims for foreign investment, Page 2 World stock markets, Page 37</p>

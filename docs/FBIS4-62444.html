			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] In an interview with a  UNIAN correspondent today, District Electoral Commission  Chairman Heorhiy Romanovskyy said preliminary data shows that of  all the contenders for a Ukrainian presidential candidacy in  Nikolayev oblast, former premier Leonid Kuchma has collected  most signatures. There were 8,380 votes in his favor. He is  followed by Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz, with 5,746  signatures, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk, with 4,963,  President Leonid Kravchuk, with 4,011, former economy minister  Volodymyr Lanovyy, with 2,690, and parliamentary speaker Ivan  Plyushch, with 2,576.    Independent experts point out that the only surprise is the  third result, that by Ukrainian Education Minister Petro  Talanchuk. However, they explain it by the somewhat command-like  manner of signature collection at Nikolayev's teachers' training  institute, which the minister visited in April.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC DEFENDER NOW A VICTIM  </P> <P> He has been my husband for 22 years and he has been a public defender for 24  years. His name is Howard Waco and he has never been a victim.  </P> <P> After we had been married for a few years, I began to tell him about my  family's background. My parents had been victims, survivors of concentration  camps in Germany, where I was born and raised. My father's entire family was  murdered. My mother lost her parents, a sister, a brother, a niece and many  other family members. The most important loss of all was the loss of human  dignity, the loss of trust, the loss of security, the loss of self-worth.  </P> <P> My husband could not understand. My husband was unable to comprehend how people  allowed to let themselves be led to slaughter. "Didn't they resist?" he asked.  "Didn't they fight back?"  </P> <P> "But . . . but . . . but . . . " He could not understand.  </P> <P> Until yesterday morning (Nov. 6) in Van Nuys Superior Court. Yesterday, he  understood what it means to be a victim. Yesterday, when he was grabbed and  with brute force removed by two police officers, acting on orders of a judge,  from one courtroom, dragged down a hallway to the other end of the building,  thrown against a door and tossed inside another courthouse like a piece of  trash, still clutching his court file, yesterday, he knew. He knew how it feels  to be helpless, how it feels to be a victim. He knew. And now he understands.  </P> <P> LAURA WACO  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

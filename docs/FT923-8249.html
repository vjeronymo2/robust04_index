			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Mubarak seeks Lockerbie accord President Hosni Mubarak arrived in Libya yesterday and met Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi in an effort to resolve Tripoli's crisis with the west over the Lockerbie case, AP reports from Cairo. The meeting comes shortly before the UN Security Council is scheduled to review air, arms and diplomatic sanctions against Libya. The sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to hand over to the US or Britain two suspects in the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The bombing killed 270 people. Since the sanctions took effect on April 15, Egypt has been mediating between Libya and the west for a diplomatic solution that would forestall harsher penalties. Egypt and Libya are members of the Arab League and more than 1m Egyptians work or live in Libya.</p>

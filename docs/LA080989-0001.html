			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A physician said that an 87-year-old woman who was presumed dead and taken from  a Springfield, Ohio, nursing home to a funeral parlor for embalming had  apparently suffered a heart attack, then revived. Carrie Stringfellow was  reported in fair condition after coming within minutes of being embalmed by  mortician Dennis Porter over the weekend. "Our conjecture is that she probably  suffered a heart seizure and her heart probably stopped at the nursing home,"  said Dr. Ernest Henson, of Mercy Medical Center in Springfield.  </P></p>

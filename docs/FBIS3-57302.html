			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev by </F> Radik Batyrshin in Kazan under the "Tatarstan" rubric: "We Will  Come to a Democratic Federation, President Mintimer Shaymiyev  Believes"; date not given]    [Text] On 21 January a meeting of the presidents of Russia  and Tatarstan took place. Upon returning to Kazan, Mintimer  Shaymiyev gave an exclusive interview to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.    [Batyrshin] What can be considered the meeting's main  result?    [Shaymiyev] We agreed to speed up the negotiating process as  much as possible, because on 13 March new elections to the  Federal Assembly will take place in Tatarstan. We believe that  Tatarstan should be represented in the Federal Assembly. But in  order for the population to turn out actively for the elections,  we need to sign a bilateral treaty. Without determining a  formula of our relationship, however, expecting the voters to be  active would be simply naive.    [Batyrshin] Does the Russian president object in principle  regarding the bilateral treaty's text?    [Shaymiyev] The work on the treaty is still going on, which  is why we did not consider separate articles of the document,  and we agreed that the final version of the text would be  considered no later than by the first third of February.    [Batyrshin] What problems exist today in the negotiating  process between Moscow and Kazan?    [Shaymiyev] There are no big problems in the work on the  treaty text. The main, albeit entirely surmountable,  difficulties have emerged in the process of preparing five  intergovernmental agreements -- on banking activity, the budget,  the coordination of the law-enforcement agencies' efforts, on  defense matters, and on foreign economic activity. The treaty  will not be concluded without these agreements. I think that  within 10 days we will be able to complete the work on these  agreements and get around to concluding the treaty.    [Batyrshin] Does this mean that Moscow currently recognizes  Tatarstan's status as "a sovereign state, a subject of  international law, associated with the Russian Federation on the  basis of the Treaty between the State Authorities of the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan on the Mutual  Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference" (a phrasing from  the Tatarstan Constitution)?    [Shaymiyev] We are trying to arrive at a formula of a  relationship within the framework of the two constitutions that  would be a fruit of a compromise.    [Batyrshin] Could you, please, expand on that?    [Shaymiyev] No, because presently the working groups under  Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev and Russian  Federation Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov are working on it  every day, from early morning till midnight. The definitive  consideration within the dates I have mentioned will bring about  complete clarity.    [Batyrshin] Do the agreements call for the law-enforcement  agencies to be brought under Tatarstan jurisdiction or the other  way around?    [Shaymiyev] There will be subjects of joint jurisdiction and  subjects under Tatarstan jurisdiction. As the consultations  have shown, we can easily reach agreement. As with regard to  other problems, the republic's independence does not rule out  coordination in our work. Presently, a major part of the  republic's law- enforcement agencies is under Tatarstan's  jurisdiction, but this does not hamper collaboration with the  federal authorities. Or why should we have the Internal Affairs  Ministry's army units performing federal missions in our  subordination?    [Batyrshin] Is Moscow going to accept a one-channel taxation  system that has long been favored by Kazan?    [Shaymiyev] Tax relations involve politics, too. For  Tatarstan citizens have Russian Federation citizenship and must  feel through taxes that they belong to Russia. Earlier, we did  not take this matter into account; it is impeccable in legal  terms. It is another matter that there are many questions  related to the financing of our specific programs, the more so  because our republic does not belong to those that receive  subsidies.    [Batyrshin] The latest full-scale negotiations between  Russia and Tatarstan took place last May. At the time, you were  certain that the treaty would be signed by August at the latest.  Aren't you afraid that presently the period of accelerated work  on the treaty will be followed by nine months of stagnation?    [Shaymiyev] No, because I do not think that Russia is in for  last year's upheavals. The sociopolitical situation inside the  country is currently favorable for concluding the treaty. In  addition, the president and the Russian Government are  decisively intent on launching a new regional policy.  Decentralization is inevitable. It has been two years since  they have refused to give Tatarstan powers, but we took them on  our own. Is Tatarstan worse off because of that or not? No one  can deny that the situation inside the republic has improved.  So, what do we have to be afraid of? I am convinced that  Tatarstan's stance paves a way toward the Russian Federation's  democratization. We will come to a democratic federation, even  now, when many politicians think that Russia is a unitary state.</p>

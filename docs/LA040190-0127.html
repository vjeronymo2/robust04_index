			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS FIGURES HELP GROUP CLOUT, HARDLY COUNT THE MINORITY OF ONE  </P> <P> I associate the word census with Christmas midnight Mass, with the priest  reading St. Luke's Gospel: "At that time there went forth a decree from Caesar  Augustus that a census of the whole world should be taken . . . ."  </P> <P> You do not have to be a child, though I suppose it helps, to be awed by the  epic event -- the ancient world discovering itself. One thousand, nine hundred  and ninety years later, the government envelope arrives in my mailbox:  Sincerely yours, the Department of Commerce.  </P> <P> For weeks there have been news stories about this census. For weeks political  leaders have been urging Americans who live in closets or shadows to be  counted, to use the census as a way of voting. The Chinese-American activist  tells his fellow Chinese-Americans -- legally here or not -- that they should  fill out the census form for their community's good. The gay activist tells gay  men and women that being counted is a political assertion. Last week was the  spectacle of census-takers prowling through the urban dark, trying to count the  homeless.  </P> <P> The census is important, not as a national tally but for its splintered  results. Journalists and senators, social activists and advertising executives  will look at the numbers within numbers -- the subgroups. Not the "World Book"  total -- how many of us are here -- but how different we are from each other.  </P> <P> Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and  Education Fund, is quoted in a Hispanic newspaper with the cadence of a  political activist: "Our size must be fully documented to ensure that,  economically and politically, we receive our portion of the pie." The pie. The  American pie. In the 1960s, the hymn of the black civil-rights movement  described an America united. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke with Pauline  eloquence of a nation uniting Christian and Jew, old and young, rich and poor,  black and white. Within a decade, by the 1970s, the heroic struggle for black  equality was replaced by competition for pieces of a pie. The quest for a  portion of power became an end in itself. The metaphor for the American city  was the committee room: One black, one woman, one person under 30. The new  American way.  </P> <P> So why do I hesitate when it comes to Question No. 4 -- the one in the census  referring to race? And then hesitate again with No. 7? Isn't this a  straightforward question?  </P> <P> Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin?  </P> <P> I remember, not long ago, talking with several Spanish-language TV executives.  None of them, incidentally, was Hispanic. But they were interested in Hispanic  numbers. They were expecting that the new census numbers would make their jobs  easier and more lucrative. They were pleased especially that Question No. 7  allows respondents to specify their ethnic Hispanic group. Puerto Rican.  Nicaraguan. The answers would help ad agencies "target the diverse Hispanic  market."  </P> <P> Social activists tell me that numbers are everything in Sacramento or  Washington. Hispanics matter because they are a large number, getting larger.  To a certain extent it seems logical and right that politicians attend to needs  and problems as they grow larger. But what about the needs of those who do not  belong to a group that is large and getting larger? Doesn't the single life  deserve attention in Sacramento or Washington? Or have I missed the point of  democracy?  </P> <P> "I count," someone says. Meaning: I matter. Is there anything sadder than  hearing the opposite: "I don't count."  </P> <P> And yet there are people, many millions of them, who do not count or who do not  think that they do. They are people of every race, of every color. Most are  poor. Most are poorly educated. What they have in common is that they do not  think of themselves as in common, as belonging to majority society, our  society, or in league with each other. They are people of a margin, at the  edge. People who lack the will or desire or ability or energy to speak publicly  of themselves as a "we."  </P> <P> We know such people exist and yet we trivialize their plight. We speak, for  example, of "minority groups." We use the word minority in a simple collective  sense, usually to mean that certain populations are underrepresented in public  life. We ignore the deeper, more urgent cultural sense of the term minority. We  speak of minority groups without irony or a sense of paradox. We forget that  the true minority is the person -- male or female, white or black -- who for  any one of a thousand private reasons is without the consolation of belonging  to a group.  </P> <P> Now we speak of "the homeless." Last week census takers searched them out -- a  government looking for its lost children. The homeless. Perhaps we must cluster  them together with such an expression. But the term should not let us forget  that the ones -- ones -- who live in the streets are people alone, lives adrift  in a crowd.  </P> <P> For the last two decades we have tried various bureaucratic solutions that do  not make fine distinctions. We group Americans by race and do not bother to  notice their differences. No distinction is drawn between the black teen-ager  who is also middle-class and the teen-ager who lives in the inner city -- the  true minority child of violence, of shuttered possibility, of despair.  </P> <P> There is a burden to being an "I" in America when "one" is the ultimate  minority -- an outsider -- in America. For the rest of us, the lure, the reason  so many people would come here is the "I." This nation gives you access -- to  the freeway, to ambition, to drive, to becoming more than your parents.  </P> <P> The middle-class price for such opportunity, especially now in this vast  society, is sometime loneliness. Middle-class Americans have grown decadent  with self-pity. Ethnic students at American universities, for example, leave  home and family for ambition and then construct ethnic tribalism at school to  convince themselves that nothing has changed in their lives.  </P> <P> Americans look for relief from the loneliness ambition has brought them. The  census form for 1990 suggests a middle-class country that is no longer  interested in the epic tally, a nation of people afraid of a national "we."  </P> <P> Question No. 7 is as impersonal as only a government survey can manage to be.  Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin?  </P> <P> I am.  </P> <P> But I put down my pencil. I refuse to be grouped for advertising executives. I  refuse to be grouped for the activist who will then proclaim me in some tally  of a minority group, because I know there are true minorities in this country  very different from me.  </P> <P> I refuse to darken the circle because I am otherwise grateful to America for  what it has given me -- the chance to see my number in the final figure, one  among the national tally.  </P></p>

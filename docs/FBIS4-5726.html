			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The Labor Ministry hopes  to persuade management and labor to agree on wage hikes of 5.0  percent to 8.7 percent this year, which was approved by the  Korea Employers Association and the Federation of Korean Trade  Unions on March 30.    The Ministry sent a guideline on this year's pay hikes to 45  local labor offices, which are to work for increases below 5  percent in prosperous industries such as electronics,  shipbuilding and automobiles, because large rises in these areas  might affect other sectors.    It also decided that wage negotiations should be settled  before late May.    The Ministry hopes that wage hikes will be meted out not  under the seniority system, but according to merit that fully  reflects the achievements of workers.    The Ministry will help management and labor in settling wage  negotiations and a trade agreement at the same time.</p>

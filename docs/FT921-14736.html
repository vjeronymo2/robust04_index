			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: A more primitive Citicorp after shake-up at the top IT HAS BEEN a rough couple of years for Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman who yesterday unveiled a senior-level management shake-up at the nation's largest bank. At the close of 1990, with real estate loan losses rising and Citicorp's core capital-to-asset ratio slipping beneath the 4 per cent regulatory minimum, Mr Reed began slashing the bank's dividend and workforce. In October 1991, with Citicorp embarked upon a Dollars 1bn cost-cutting plan, Mr Reed was again embarrassed - and Wall Street was severely disappointed - when he revealed Dollars 1.6bn of loan write-offs, Dollars 885m of third-quarter losses, a radical revision of the cost-cutting plan requiring an additional Dollars 700m of cuts in operating expenses and the first halting of Citicorp's dividend in its 179-year history. Now Mr Reed is to shuffle the bank's top management, moving to what he calls 'a much more primitive structure' to achieve better credit controls. He is also acting to bring down costs as needed, to return to profits in the first half of 1992 and to boost the bank's 3.6 per cent core capital ratio above 4 per cent by mid-1992. Yesterday's management changes include the setting up of a series of corporate task-forces that will deal with problem areas and seek to identify asset disposals that will help strengthen capital. Mr Reed says Citicorp's operating expenses are running at Dollars 10bn a year, down from Dollars 10.7bn a year ago. His goal is annual costs of Dollars 9bn by the end of 1992, to be achieved through further operational cuts of Dollars 600m and sales proceeds of Dollars 400m. The most visible changes, however, revolve around the ousting of Mr Michael Callen, the head of Citicorp's US, European and Japanese corporate businesses and the man who had responsibility for US real estate until Mr Reed took personal charge of that portfolio last year. Mr Callen, whose departure is termed a resignation, was a Reed loyalist. His corporate division responsibilities will be taken up by Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who on January 21 will be named as a Citicorp vice-chairman and board member. Yesterday, Mr Reed was not shy about criticising the past management of the corporate division, which suffered a Dollars 298m loss in the third quarter. 'One of the things I have been correctly criticised for is that the management (of the corporate division) has produced some pretty horrendous results. We are guilty of having run the business a bit cavalierly,' Mr Reed said in an interview. 'When you run a corporate business that has the ability to destroy consumer profits you are obviously running it with the wrong risk-reward ratio,' he said, adding: 'I don't want a business to jeopardise the whole company.' He noted that strengthening the corporate division's management was important because this was 'not an area I myself have worked in'. Turning to US commercial real estate, where Dollars 4.4bn, or 31 per cent, of Citicorp loans are classified as non-performing, Mr Reed said he believed that 'unusually high commercial real estate write-offs' would continue for the next seven years. He said he expected real estate write-offs, bad debt provisions and carrying costs on foreclosed property to total Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn during the next seven years, 'which for all practical purposes is forever'. As for his own future, the subject of Wall Street speculation, Mr Reed was brief: 'I will be in my position until I get the job done. I'm working my tail off.'</p>

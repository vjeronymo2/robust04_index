			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT THE TOP MOVIES  </P> <P> While including on their Top 10 lists for the 1980s voyeuristic sleaze ("Blue  Velvet"), hip amateurism ("Do the Right Thing"), childish trivia ("Raiders of  the Lost Ark") and pretentious pseudo art ("Raging Bull"), the Times' movie  reviewers revealed the prerequisites for their job: short memories and bad  taste.  </P> <P> Conspicuous by their absence were such clearly superior works as "Breaker  Morant," "The Flight of the Eagle," "The Official Story," "When Father Was Away  on Business," "A Cry in the Dark," "Melvin and Howard" and "Diner."  </P> <P> Even Peter Rainer included on his list "E.T." -- which may have been fun, but  let's not raise calculating box-office movie candy to the level of films with  genuine substance, originality and lasting merit.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS CARASSO  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

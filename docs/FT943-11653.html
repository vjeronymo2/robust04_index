			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Probe on coal mine deaths reports The Bilsthorpe colliery tragedy of August 1993 occurred because British Coal misunderstood or underestimated the effects of previous workings on the rock strata at the mine, a public inquiry has found. Three miners died at the Nottinghamshire coal mine when they were engulfed by a fall of sandstone half a mile underground. The accident prompted an investigation into safety at the mine by the Health and Safety Executive, which then set up a public inquiry conducted by Sir Bernard Crossland of Queen's University, Belfast. The inquiry concentrated on whether the use of rock-bolting to hold up the roof was safe. Under this system a bolt is driven into the rock and held fast with resin. The bolts hold steel straps which make a caged roof for the mine roadway. At the inquiry Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, argued that rock-bolting made an accident like the one at Bilsthorpe almost inevitable. Sir Bernard called the general use of rock-bolting 'well-established and proven'. But in his inquiry report, he questioned the sole use of rock bolts at Bilsthorpe because the roadway where the accident took place ran alongside an old tunnel - so-called 'skin-to-skin working'. There had been limited experience with rock-bolting under those conditions. Sir Bernard drew attention to the fact that the roof was solidly supported on one side only, and that rock fractures caused by the old Bilsthorpe workings were underestimated. There was 'a roof deformation mechanism which was beyond the control of the rock bolts,' his report said. The report also said that the use of more traditional roof support methods would not have reduced the speed of sandstone fall.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY PITCHES IN TO AID QUAKE AREA;  </P> <P> DISASTER: SEABEES AND RED CROSS WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO BOLSTER THE  EFFORTS TO RESTORE UTILITIES AND HELP VICTIMS.  </P> <P> Ventura County residents were quick Wednesday to join in the relief effort for  victims of Tuesday's killer earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> Two-hundred Seabees assigned to the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port  Hueneme were airlifted to the stricken area to help restore water and sewer  service to military families in the region.  </P> <P> Sixty people were mobilized at the Channel Islands Air National Guard station  at Point Mugu by leaders of the California Air National Guard, who sent four  relief planes carrying medical supplies and police to the earthquake area.  </P> <P> And a trio of Red Cross volunteers from Ventura were dispatched by truck to  deliver cots, blankets and other supplies for use by Bay Area residents left  homeless by the temblor.  </P> <P> Ventura County Red Cross officials issued an appeal for donations of cash and  blood and for extra volunteers willing to work in the quake-ravaged region in  the coming weeks.  </P> <P> "The Red Cross' national disaster fund was already depleted by Hurricane Hugo,"  said Lenore Gabel, a spokeswoman for the relief agency's Ventura chapter. "The  best thing people can do now is continue to make contributions of cash."  </P> <P> Volunteers Betty Jimenez of Oxnard and Larry Dawes and Robert Lefever of  Ventura were dispatched with a vanload of supplies to Burlingame late Wednesday  morning, Gabel said.  </P> <P> Dawes and Lefever were advised that they would be asked to spend the remainder  of the week shuttling emergency supplies around the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Jimenez -- who is a leader of the Red Cross disaster team in Oxnard -- was told  to stay in the earthquake area for at least three weeks.  </P> <P> Gabel said that 300 other trained volunteers are available in Ventura County  and that training sessions have been scheduled for next week to beef up that  force.  </P> <P> Methods of dealing with general emergency relief, damage assessment and  emergency assistance for families will be taught Tuesday night and the weekend  of Oct. 28-29 at locations to be determined later, she said.  </P> <P> County residents willing to donate blood should contact United Blood Services  at (805) 654-1600, she said. Blood types O positive, O negative and A negative  are especially needed, although all blood types will be accepted, Gabel said.  </P> <P> People willing to donate cash can do so at any Bank of A. Levy branch or by  sending a check to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund at P.O. Box AR, Ventura  93002, she said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's Bay Area temblor came as county Red Cross officials continued to  solicit donations to help finance continuing relief work for victims of  Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the Caribbean and South Carolina last  month.  </P> <P> As of Wednesday, county residents had contributed $28,000. Local Red Cross  administrators had set a goal of $62,100 in donations.  </P> <P> Two area volunteers -- Dale Carnathan of Ojai and Carol Holmes of Agoura --  have worked in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, since Hugo's 100-m.p.h. winds raked  the area.  </P> <P> The Port Hueneme Seabees were accompanied by forklifts, trenchers and other  heavy equipment when they were ferried to the Bay Area on Wednesday by C-130  Hercules cargo planes, said Connie Taylor, spokeswoman for the Naval  Construction Battalion Center.  </P> <P> Taylor said about 2,000 families living on Navy bases in the San Francisco  region were left without water or sewer service. She said construction experts  from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 3 were also being assigned to  emergency runway repair duties at the Alameda Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> She said it was unknown whether the Seabees will also be asked to help with  civilian rescue efforts that were under way Wednesday in San Francisco, where  some apartment buildings were reported to have collapsed, or in Oakland, where  a section of double-decked freeway fell atop hundreds of motorists.  </P> <P> Some Port Hueneme-based Seabees who were completing a routine training session  at Fort Hunter Liggett east of Monterey were rushed directly to the Bay Area,  Taylor said.  </P> <P> Some of the same Seabees were also involved in relief efforts after Hurricane  Hugo, she said. Eighty-five of them were sent to Charleston, S. C., and 200  others were dispatched to Puerto Rico to help with cleanup work, she said.  </P> <P> Officials of the California Air National Guard said three planeloads of medical  supplies were rushed to Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco. A fourth  plane carrying police officers for duty in the Santa Cruz area was sent at noon  Wednesday to Watsonville, said Lt. Col. David Woolsey.  </P> <P> About 60 guardsmen were mobilized to serve as flight and ground crews for the  emergency airlift. Woolsey said the unit was waiting for instructions for  additional flights from Guard officials in Sacramento.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Political and public  circles of the world denounced the United States' unjustifiable  pressure on Korea and expressed solidarity for the Korean  people's cause of justice.    Juan Ramos, general secretary of the Communist Party of the  Peoples of Spain, expressed firm solidarity for the just  struggle of the Korean people, saying they should never yield to  the unreasonable demand of the United States, when he received  the permanent representative of the DPRK to the World Tourism  Organization on March 28.    Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism) in a  statement March 27 said it was ridiculous of the United States  to raise a clamor for "sanctions" and war racket against the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He demanded that all  outside forces immediately give up pressure and threats against  Korea.    The Communist Party of Chile in a statement March 28  expressed full support to the measure taken by the DPRK  Government to defend the sovereignty of the country and the  dignity of the nation.    Ali Hassan, general secretary of the Supreme Council of the  Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in Lebanon, at a meeting  held on March 24, and David Baz, former chairman of the party,  in a statement March 22, called upon all the political parties  and organizations and the peaceloving people of the world to  launch a solidarity movement in support of the just struggle of  the Workers' Party and people of Korea.    The political department of the Palestine Liberation  Organization in a statement March 23 demanded that the U.S.  Administration immediately give up its nuclear threats against  the DPRK and seek a peaceful, fair solution to the nuclear  issue through direct dialogue with the DPRK.    Juan Mariategui, director of the Peruvian Institute for Non-  Alignment and African Studies, in a press statement published  that day, stressed that the United States must try to find a  solution through negotiation, not by means of pressure, and Om  Prakash Mantri, secretary general of the Asian regional  committee to support Korea's reunification, in a statement on  the same day, urged the United States to renounce the  anachronistic idea that it could solve problems by means of  military strongarm and strength.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In April, the retail consumer goods market in our  province maintained its momentum of vigorous development, with  its total retail sales volume exceeding 2.2 billion yuan, a 28.7  percent increase over the same period last year. Market  operations in the whole province had the following features:    1. The gaps between the development of urban and rural  markets were narrowed further, and the margin of increase in the  rural market was 4.8 percent higher than that of the urban  market.    2. The margin of increase of the retail volume in the  catering trade was much higher than that of other trades. In  April, the increase of the retail volume in the catering trade  was 48.2 percent, mainly because food and drink prices have  risen and people have upgraded their eating and drinking  standards.    3. The retail volume of the agricultural means of production  reached 620 million yuan, an increase of 120 percent over the  same period last year. This showed that inputs in agriculture  have been considerably increased, and that supply and marketing  cooperatives have done a solid job in serving the peasants.</p>

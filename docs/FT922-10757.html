			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Tide of relief greets Major IT HAD been a very close-run thing, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, told the 2,500 people attending the institute's 43rd annual convention, Michael Cassell writes. They hardly needed reminding that their victory rally, following the Tories' fourth consecutive election victory, could just as easily have been a wake. The prospect of Mr John Smith with his hands deep in the pockets of the well-paid and of his sidekick Mr Gordon Brown barging into boardrooms all over the country had been very real when delegates were booking their Pounds 120-a-head places. The IoD was well-prepared for the worst. If Labour had won, the smoked salmon timbale in the famous luncheon hampers was unlikely to have been replaced with a prawn cocktail. But Mr Neil Kinnock would certainly have been asked to make yesterday's keynote speech. His performance would have been unlikely to provoke the enraptured response he won at his triumphalist Sheffield gathering a month ago. 'He would have been lucky to get back to his seat before the applause stopped,' said Mr Jerry Hughes, a Black Country finance director. In the event, Mr John Major emerged, almost sheepishly, from behind a black curtain to reassure his audience that everything was really going to be all right. Mr Major, it seems, was invited to speak to the IoD when he became foreign secretary but was moved on before he could keep the date. He was invited again as chancellor but was once more moved. This time, he was still in the job as prime minister and seemed to find the situation quite satisfactory. So did his audience. Behind evident surprise and relief there was a warm welcome for Mr Major's pledge to complete Mrs Thatcher's trade union reforms and to keep a wary eye on Brussels. There was, above all, widespread enthusiasm for the prospect of a period of political stability and of an end to the recession. Recovery, the prime minister said, had been waiting in the wings and a return of confidence would now speed up the revival. Few in the audience, however, were yet prepared to say the recession was over. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, said most businessmen would be encouraged by Mr Major's bullish appraisal of prospects for economic recovery. 'We cannot expect it all to happen within weeks of an election victory,' he said. 'But we have averted a national disaster.' Few of the captains of industry would have disagreed.</p>

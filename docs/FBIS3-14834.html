			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington February 25 TASS -- The U.S. President  met leaders of the Congress in the White House on Friday. The  meeting was attended by lawmakers from the Democratic and  Republican Parties.    The White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that the  meeting of the U.S. President with congressmen focused on  providing U.S. aid to Russia. Recently, a number of U.S.  lawmakers called to freeze U.S. aid or reduce it, following a  scandal which flared up around the CIA officer Aldrich Ames and  his wife charged with spying both for Russia and the United  States.    "Undoubtedly, the president intends to oppose any efforts  aimed at reducing U.S. aid to Russia," Dee Dee Myers said,  adding that the president is convinced that the politics of the  U.S. Administration, including its support to Moscow, meets U.S.  national interests.    Dee Dee Myers said that at present, the U.S. and Russia are  making efforts to settle the problem around the "Ames" case at  different levels and using different channels. The press  secretary pointed out that the Russians had not responded to  U.S. demands so far, adding that they expected a reply in the  near future. No one of the U.S. administration has mentioned  yet what demands Washington made on Moscow, motivating their  silence by the interests of national security.    Presumably, one of the channels expected to be used by the  two sides to resolve their problem is a visit to Washington by  first Russian Deputy Foreign Minister G. Mamedov. The  high-ranking Russian diplomat, who arrived in Washington on  Thursday night, intends to meet U.S. First Deputy Secretary of  State [title as received] Strobe Talbott and other foreign  ministry officials on Friday.    Mamedov's visit to Washington had been scheduled long ago to  discuss different problems of international politics.  Nevertheless, talking to journalists on Friday Mamedov made it  clear that the "Ames case" would be discussed. "We are concerned  about anything which might be detrimental to Russo-American  partnership," Mamedov said. "However, we believe that we have  accumulated enough confidence and gave sufficient impetus to  these relations so that we could overcome any problem," he said.</p>

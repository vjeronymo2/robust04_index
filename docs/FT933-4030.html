			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Too big for the UK, too small for the world, Cadbury Schweppes has long wondered how to acquire critical mass in overseas markets without jeopardising its earnings record. Merging a series of small beverages businesses appears a neat solution for the US. The ultimate prize would be the creation of a cash generative franchise business controlling almost half the non-cola market. Its realisation, however, is fraught with pitfalls. Cadbury has first to secure A&amp;W Brands; it then has to persuade Dr Pepper to sign up to the plan. A full bid for Dr Pepper has become a lot harder since the latter swallowed its poison pill. The final fear would be that even if Cadbury did make a splash in US beverages it would only provoke a scrap with the two cola giants in their own backyard. Cadbury must prove that the risks of creating a third force in the mature and competitive US market are not so great as to detract from its other virtues. The 9 per cent increase in its underlying earnings highlights its considerable trading momentum. Its investments in China and Poland signpost fruitful avenues of expansion available elsewhere in the world.</p>

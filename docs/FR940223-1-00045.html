			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The proposed rule is of a cost relieving nature and would therefore afford cost savings to individual part 121 operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under FAA Order 2100.14A, the criterion for a ``substantial impact'' is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one third of the small entities subject to the rule. For operators of aircraft for hire, a small operator is one that owns, but does necessarily operate, nine or fewer aircraft. This proposal would mainly affect part 121 scheduled operators, although some unscheduled operators could be affected as well. The FAA's criterion for a ``significant impact'' is $116,300 or more per year for a scheduled operator whose entire fleet has a seating capacity of 60 seats or more, $65,000 for a scheduled operator with a fleet including smaller aircraft, and $4,600 or more for an unscheduled operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extent of the annualized cost savings per aircraft resulting from the opportunity cost of capital that would be saved (i.e., what could be earned on alternative investments) would be $2,100 per aircraft, based on the assumptions used in calculating the potential total cost savings resulting from this factor in the previous section (.07&times;$30,000). A scheduled carrier with a fleet of smaller aircraft would therefore need to convert well over nine aircraft to exceed its threshold value of $65,000, in which case it would not be regarded as a small entity. A scheduled carrier with a fleet of larger aircraft would have to convert even more aircraft to exceed its threshold of $116,300. The threshold value for an unscheduled operator is only $4,600, however, as noted above. A carrier would therefore, only have to convert three airplanes to exceed this threshold, using the estimate of cost savings derived above. To make a determination of a ``significant economic impact,'' the FAA needs information pertaining to the number of Stage 2 aircraft that small unscheduled operators are planning to retrofit with noise suppression equipment. The FAA therefore requests that affected part 121 operators provide information pertaining to the number of aircraft involved and the potential reduction in compliance costs per aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OMB directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The proposed rule will affect only U.S. air carriers because foreign carriers are not subject to part 121. The economic analysis of the final rule mandating that aircraft receiving an original type certificate before September 30, 1969, install DFDR's capable of recording the required number of parameters by May 1994 concluded that there would not be any trade impact. Therefore, the provision of relief from the original rule in the form of a deadline extension is not expected to have any impact on international trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply with the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA is not aware of any differences that this proposal would present if adopted. Any differences that may be presented in comments to this proposal, however, will be taken into consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is considered not significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang, Huang Kwang-chun, and Luo Kwang-jen] </F>   [Text] San Salvador, May 31 (CNA) -- In a bid to further  help Taiwan investors in El Salvador, the government is  considering designating a trade representative in its embassy  here, Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang said Tuesday [31  May].    Chiang, who is accompanying Premier Lien Chan on his May  29-June 7 Central American tour, said investors from the  Republic of China [ROC], especially textile, footware and  umbrella makers, should consider El Salvador when choosing  overseas production sites, given that labor and production costs  in many Southeast Asian countries are rising.    Although many investors who have set up businesses here have  lauded the favorable investment climate, the ROC Government  believes assigning a trade representative will be necessary to  help increase the number of Taiwan investors interested in  expanding into El Salvador, Chiang said.    Chiang said the government will decide on whether to assign  a  trade representative to El Salvador after he holds talks with  Ambassador Andrew J. P. Shen and Taiwan investors in the country.    Currently, ROC diplomatic missions in Panama, Guatemala,  Costa Rica, and Honduras include a trade representative.    Meanwhile, newly designated Salvadoran Foreign Affairs  Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria and Economic Affairs Minister  Luis Enrique Cordova, said the newly installed government of  President Armando Calderon Sol will take measures to simplify  visa procedures for ROC citizens as a way of attracting more  Taiwan investment, which he said creates jobs and helps upgrade  living standards here.    As ROC agricultural missions stationed here have contributed  a great deal to the social and economic development in El  Salvador, bilateral ties between the two countries should be  further boosted, Cordova said.    The new Salvadoran Government will also send ranking  officials to Taiwan to hold investment seminars as a way of  attracting additional investors, he added.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "The Communist Party </F> Reemerging in Fall"]    [Text] The Finnish Communist Party (Unity) (SKP-Y) is  holding a congress in November where the purpose will be to  resume the activity of the [former] Communist Party of Finland  [SKP]. When in April the SKP-Y and the Left Alliance (VL) agreed  to cooperate, it was asserted that the SKP's activity was being  resumed. At the same time, agreement was reached that the VL  would also place communists on its election lists in the next  parliamentary election, states SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen.  According to Hakanen, communists will run in all election  districts. Among the communist candidates, some will be members  of the VL, some of the SKP-Y, and some unbound.    The convention will be held in Helsinki on 26 and 27  November. Summoned to the convention are "all party units and  district organizations within the SKP," in a statement released  by the SKP-Y.    Some of the former minority [hard-line or Stalinist]  communists are active within the SKP-Y. The SKP itself has been  dissolved as an organization.</p>

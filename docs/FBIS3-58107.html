			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "Head of State Denounces the </F> Government's Policy"]    [Text] It is an impressionistic opposition. By a  succession of little touches, Francois Mitterrand is undermining  the polite cohabitation which has hitherto reigned between the  Elysee and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office].    The head of state, who yesterday afternoon received the  "nation's vital forces" at the Elysee (employers, trade unions,  charity organizations, community movements, and so forth), spoke  at length about his proposal for a "new social contract."    In his New Year's wishes, the president of the republic  described 1993 as a "black year of unemployment" and urged  Edouard Balladur, without naming him, to "help" the employers  and trade unions to combat this scourge.    Speaking on Tuesday evening [4 January], the prime minister  had reaffirmed his desire to include the struggle against the  increase in unemployment on the top of his agenda for 1994.  "With regard to the social pact," he reaffirmed that "for the  first time in many years, the government which I head twice  brought together the two sides of industry, the employers' and  workers' organizations, in April."  <H5>  "This Is A High Price To Pay" </H5>   The whole question here is whether or not this is  cooperation  or organized consultation. "The question is whether we can sit  down at a table and reach an agreement," the prime minister  replied with extreme caution, "I am in favor of this in  principle but that is not enough. The employers' and trade  union organizations must be ready for it too." To verify this,  Edouard Balladur has decided to establish "a number of contacts  with some of them."    Francois Mitterrand probably judged the reply to be  inadequate. The term "social pact" mentioned by Balladur was  judged to be "irritating and disagreeable with regard to the  past." The head of state thinks it is appropriate to "help  revive a contractual policy which has been in abeyance for all  too long." "I think that the contractual policy should help to  form the social foundation for any social action in France."    But the head of state did not stop at this "encouragement."  In front of a prime minister very busy counting the lights on  the chandelier in the hall, he listed four courses. The first  relates to the use of credits in the sphere of job creation:  "We must consider that 300 billion francs [Fr] are devoted to  it... That corresponds to 3 million jobs paid at the minimum  wage!" "It is conceivable that such sums could be used to push  back the evil rather than maintaining it," he stressed.    The second is a criticism of the government's policy which  seeks, through the enterprises, "pools of jobs." "Oh, what a  wonderful expression!" he said sarcastically: "I have noted that  this year Fr80 billion have been transferred to the enterprises  without any effect on employment. Heads of enterprise, this is  a high price to pay!" Balladur looked down at his feet.    These are only possible courses: "I am not an inventor."  But the president of the republic expressed the hope that the  governmnent will "set to work" without delay. "This contractual  policy, the foundation of any social policy, only requires a  little imagination and time." Turning to the prime minister, he  added: "I am not asking for an increase in state intervention  (Balladur smiled -- LE FIGARO editor's note) but simply a  transfer of funds to make them useful."    This is certainly not the end of cohabitation, but after his  criticism of the repeal of the Falloux Law, it is clear that the  head of state thinks that it is time to return to his role as a  "spur." Through this "new social contract," Francois Mitterrand  wants to force the government to expose itself more on the  employment front. The Elysee is aware that, although Edouard  Balladur's popularity is reaching great heights, a majority of  French people disapprove of his policy.    By placing the emphasis on the employment issue, the  president of the republic stresses this apparent paradox and  thus gives the measure by which the public will gauge the  success -- or failure -- of Balladur's policy. It is true that,  in this sphere, he is helped by the promises made -- and not  kept -- by the government.    These "digs" are being made at a time when the prime  minister  is observing some signs of economic recovery. What is more,  Mitterrand is not content with a stabilization in the number of  people seeking work: "We must achieve a reduction in  unemployment, a reabsorption of long-term unemployment," he said  yesterday.    If the Socialist Party were still in any doubt, the head of  state's capacity for initiative remains intact.</p>

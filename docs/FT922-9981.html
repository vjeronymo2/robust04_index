			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Calvet view dated and protectionist (1) Sir, Jacques Calvet's Personal View, 'The New Utopias that threaten Europe' (April 29), looks very much like special pleading obfuscated by broad and unsubstantiated generalisations. Remove the attacks on federalism, competition-policy and the criteria agreed for economic convergence curiously defined as a monetarist utopia - and what is left seems to be a desire to see old-fashioned national subsidies replaced by European ones. At a time when agricultural subsidies are stalling the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and threatening world trade, this would be a confirmation of all the worst fears of those who always suspected the creation of a Fortress Europe. Particularly odd is the attack on federalism. Apart from raising again the old canard about the failure of some self- styled quasi-federal governments such as in the old Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and elsewhere, while conveniently ignoring the fact that they were the result of totalitarian or external imposition and not democratic choice, Mr Calvet offers no coherent alternative. It may also surprise British readers that Mr Calvet links federalism with liberalism as Mrs Thatcher has repeatedly attacked it for being associated with socialism. It is, of course, not necessarily associated with either. In the European context 'federal' is essentially shorthand for 'democratic'. There is simply no alternative to a federal Europe if the Community's institutions are to be open, accountable and subject to democratic control. Open debates in the European Parliament must replace decision-making behind closed doors between ministers and civil servants. Or does Mr Calvet prefer a more closed system with the ear of government accessible only to the special pleading of Europe's corporate giants?

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television Sergei Krikalev was the Soviet cosmonaut who watched the revolutionary events in his country from space as he revolved around the earth. After almost a year circling the planet he returned to a new country, called Russia. He is interviewed in Arena (BBC2 at 9pm) which examines the history of the Soviet space programme. What the Papers Say is one of TV's longest running programmes, and since 1956 its annual awards to top press people have been among the most respected. Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, announces the 1992 winners at 11.15pm on BBC 2. John Cole, the former political editor of the BBC, begins a new career as a roving reporter as he travels the country talking to the unemployed in Public Eye, on BBC 2 at 7.40pm. As well as analysis on the changing face of unemployment he tries to offer some remedies. On good nights The Word (Channel 4 at 11.5pm) is the most anarchic programme on TV. It makes an art form of bad taste, but shows a welcome lack of respect for big names.</p>

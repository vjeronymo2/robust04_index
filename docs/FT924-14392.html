			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Now hear this] Now hear this] Evelyn Waugh was famed for rather ostentatiously putting his ear trumpet down when he did not want to listen. Now Siemens has introduced a tiny in-the-ear hearing device that allows users to tune in to what they want to hear and not what they do not. The Insita Plus overcomes a problem for the hard of hearing. Hearing loss is entirely individual and technology has not been able to compensate for the many different external conditions. The solution is the first three-channel, four-programme hearing product that can be instantly adjusted to differing requirements, such as a conversation in a busy street or separating the chatter from the clatter at a restaurant.

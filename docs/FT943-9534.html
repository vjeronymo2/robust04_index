			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady ahead of inflation data Wall Street US share prices were mostly flat in listless trading yesterday as dealers and investors remained on the sidelines awaiting a lead from the bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just 1.95 firmer at 3,755.76, never having strayed far from its opening mark throughout the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.04 to 457.93, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.62 higher at 442.22 and the Nasdaq composite 2.14 ahead at 722.61. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to 259m shares. As on Monday, equities took their cue from bonds. The Treasury market was subdued in early trading because participants were reluctant to commit funds ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn in new three-year notes. In the event, the auction was deemed a modest disappointment, which led to slight selling of bonds, but the general lack of action in the Treasury market, where the yield on the 30-year bond edged ahead to 7.57 per cent, ensured that stocks remained becalmed. Equity investors were also wary of the market yesterday because of the approaching release of July inflation figures. The producer and consumer price indices are due to be published today and tomorrow, and analysts warn that if the inflation numbers are worryingly high the Federal Reserve, already troubled by recent strong growth in the labour market, could decide to raise interest rates once more to cool down the economy. Bank stocks were marginally weaker, unsettled by talk of higher interest rates. Bankers Trust declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67, Chase Manhattan Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 and Chemical Bank Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 . Other financials were also lower, with the securities houses Salomon down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 , Merrill Lynch off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 35 7/8 , Bear Stearns Dollars  3/8 lighter at Dollars 16 3/8 and Morgan Stanley Dollars  3/8 cheaper at Dollars 62 1/2 . Leading technology issues were lifted by reports that a top mutual fund was positive on the sector. Texas Instruments rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 80 1/4 , IBM added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64 1/2 and the Nasdaq-quoted Intel appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 1/4 . Shares in the Equitable insurance group fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 as second-quarter earnings came in below market expectations, partly because of a sharp drop in profits at the Equitable's securities unit, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Storage Technology receded Dollars 2 to Dollars 37 and Network Systems, quoted on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the two companies announced plans to merge later this year in a stock-for-stock transaction. Colgate-Palmolive moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 after an analyst at securities house Morgan Stanley raised her investment rating for the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'.</p>

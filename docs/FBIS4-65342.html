			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Excerpts] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds today  repeated hopes that Britain would respond "sooner rather than  later" to Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the Downing  Street peace declaration.    Mr Reynolds, who last week relayed to London a list of  questions from the IRA's political arm, briefed United States  President Bill Clinton on developments before returning from his  short trip to America today. After arriving at Dublin airport  he said all sides in the Northern Ireland conflict should now  take the opportunity to end the obstruction towards peace caused  by the long-running clarification dispute. He repeated his  opposition to any renegotiation of the five-month-old peace  document he and John Major signed but said if there were genuine  issues of clarification it was for the British Government to  deal with the matter. There was now an opportunity for everyone  to put the issue of clarification behind them and he said he  believed the requests were "answerable" by Britain.    Downing Street said later the Government would consult with  Dublin on the terms of its response to Sinn Fein's document of  questions but a spokesman insisted the Government's views on not  clarifying the declaration had not changed -- and there would be  no negotiations on it.    "What the people of Northern Ireland want from Sinn Fein and  the IRA is an immediate and permanent end to violence, not  months of procrastination while violence continues," the  spokesman said.    But Mr Reynolds, who had two meetings with President Clinton  in Indianapolis on Saturday, said it was important to get back  on the road to talks and bring an end to violence.    Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today demanded "honest,  unambiguous and forthright" answers to the questions and said  Sinn Fein had taken a number of initiatives to remove the  clarification obstacle.    He said the British Government "needs to adopt an equally  positive attitude", adding: "Mr Major must move to close the gap  of distrust between us. Therefore London should respond  positively and in an unambiguous way to the questions we have  transmitted to them through the Dublin Government. "Our specific  questions should be answered in a direct and comprehensive  manner. It is vital that London's response is honest and  forthright."    But Ulster Unionists today warned the Government not to  negotiate in public with the IRA. The party's security  spokesman Ken Maginnis said that would be a "dangerous road to  go down" and that the IRA was not ready to give up violence.    "The IRA...is clearly not prepared to cease violence at this  particular time, so any exercise is both futile and an  indication to the IRA that the Government is weakening," he  added. [passage omitted]    Mr Reynolds later told BBC's One O'Clock News: "There will  be  no negotiation of the Downing Street declaration. We have said  that time and time again.    "But if there are genuine areas of clarification that are  required then let the British Government deal with that matter."</p>

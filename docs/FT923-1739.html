			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / People: Taunt rejoins Smiths Industries No amiable bon mots for some weeks from Robin Taunt, newly appointed business development director at Smiths Industries. He is already hard at work in the US learning his new employer's business. Or rather, learning how it has changed since the late 1970s, when he last worked for the fast-growing, acquisitive high technology company. Then he spent seven years with Smiths in various senior appointments before leaving to become group planning and development manager and eventually security division chief for MK Electric. His principal role is to look after Smiths' ambitious acquisition programme (and, to a lesser extent, disposals). The group has Pounds 95m in cash to snap up bargains in the company's core areas of aerospace electronics, medical systems and specialised industrial products. Taking on debt will prove no barrier if Taunt comes up with a suitably enticing prospect. Now 43, he is a metallurgist by training and came to grips with acquisitions and divestments through a spell as head of corporate finance for British Telecom. His appointment will give economic adviser Gerry Mortimer new freedom to concentrate on strategic planning and investor relations. ***** Following the departure of Martin Saunders to sort out the Tory party's finances at central office, David Morris, a senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick is joining P&amp;O as its new group finance director. Bruce MacPhail, who has a double first in maths and is a chartered accountant, is a highly financially literate managing director, so the City saw much less of Saunders, a quiet man who busied himself with the nuts and bolts of the figures. Saunders' predecessor as finance director, Andrew Robb, who moved across to Pilkington in 1989, had been more active as far as the City was concerned. Morris, too, may wish to adopt a higher profile. With Peat Marwick since 1959, he has spent most of his time on the accountancy side, but worked in the management consultancy arm between 1980 and 1989. In 1989 he was president of the Management Consultancy Association. While KPMG are P&amp;O's auditors, Morris was not responsible for that area. He does, however, know chairman Lord Sterling and Bruce MacPhail well. P&amp;O is wrestling with a mountain of debt - gearing standing at around 70 per cent - acquired partly as the result of its involvement with Laing Properties since early 1990; one analyst characterises Morris' new assignment as 'no soft option'. ***** Mike Russell (above), formerly finance director of Asda Stores, has been appointed finance director of JCB. He succeeds Alan Mellor who has been appointed md of JCB's Japanese joint venture, JCB-SCM. ***** Malcolm Lofts has been promoted to finance director of Bluecrest Foods, part of BOOKER. ***** Tony Clarke, formerly md international of Official Airlines Guide, has been appointed md of INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMMES GROUP. ***** James Perrella has been appointed to the board and president of INGERSOLL-RAND Company. ***** Charles Stern, who joined United Newspapers as finance director in July, is also joining the board of its subsidiary, Extel. Stern replaced Graham Wilson as finance director at United Newspapers when Wilson became managing director and has now taken his place on Extel's board. ***** Wilfried Behle, until recently md of Hewi, a nylon hardware product manufacturer, has been appointed marketing and sales director of the newly created NEWMAN TONKS Europe, in Renchen, Germany. ***** Colin Stacey (below) has been appointed ceo of The Keg, WHITBREAD's North American restaurant operation; he moves to Vancouver from Australia where he has been ceo of Keg Restaurants Australia for the past three years.</p>

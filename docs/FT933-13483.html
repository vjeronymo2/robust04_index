			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association Sir, The principal role of a trade organisation is to do those things which member companies believe is most beneficial to their industry. It is not necessarily to lobby government on legislation and likely changes of policy. And size does not necessarily equate with effectiveness. The Galvanizers Association meets the DTI's criteria for a 'lead association' and the DTI acknowledges this to be so. But four years ago the association separated from an existing confederation and established a clear and separate identity. We took the opportunity to establish focused programmes operated by a professional, well-qualified and properly paid staff. Industry participants, including suppliers, have committed substantial financial resources to a range of programmes in which marketing and technical support to the market-place predominate. When we deal with the UK government we seek constructive dialogue; when we deal with the European Commission we act with our EC counterpart organisations through established channels in Brussels. An aspect of Mr Heseltine's speech which was less well reported was his announcement of a benchmarking challenge, in which industry associations will operate 'benchmarking clubs' to help businesses improve competitiveness. If the same principles were applied to industry associations we would see the emergence of powerful, well-resourced and fully-effective organisations with improved quality of lobbying in Whitehall and Brussels. This is just what Mr Heseltine wants. Such groups would also command stronger industry support because they would provide better value to the subscription dollar.

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, BICHETTE VOWS TO OUTLAST SPRING  </P> <P> The towels spread out on the hill behind the left-field fence might have had  bull's-eyes printed on them, so accurately did Dante Bichette hit the terry  cloth targets.  </P> <P> Blast after blast came off his bat and traveled 350 feet or more, scattering  the fans who had gathered to soak up the sun and watch the Angels take batting  practice Sunday. All they saw was the results of the winter weightlifting  program that added nine pounds to the 26-year-old outfielder's already muscular  frame. They didn't know that his display had as much to do with muscular  strength as with mental strength, the assurance he has been gaining as spring  training goes on.  </P> <P> Bichette was the sensation of spring training a year ago, when he batted .388  with a club-leading four home runs and 17 runs batted in. He was in the  starting lineup in right field on opening day, and for the first month he  maintained his spring pace. He was hitting .324 (11 for 34) with five RBIs on  April 27, but in his next 50 at-bats he had only seven hits. By June 19, he was  demoted to triple-A Edmonton, where he remained until Sept. 1.  </P> <P> "I wasn't playing every day. I never had to come off the bench and pinch-hit  before," said the 6-foot-3, 212-pound Floridian. "Of course, you don't make it  in the minors doing that, so I had no experience, and I found it difficult to  do. I was disappointed when I went down, but I got it together and came back in  September."  </P> <P> He came back to training camp this year determined to prove that his  performance last spring is the true indication of his talent, and he has almost  certainly earned a spot on the 24-player roster as the fourth outfielder. After  going one for two Sunday with an RBI-single in the Angels' 12-4 victory over  the Milwaukee Brewers, Bichette is tied for the team lead with two home runs  and is among the leaders with seven RBIs.  </P> <P> He hit both home runs and drove in five runs Saturday against Cleveland.  </P> <P> "I've had the flu ever since I've been here and that was the first day my  energy was back to normal," Bichette said.  </P> <P> His .267 batting average isn't as gaudy as the numbers he posted last spring,  but he is better able to cope with the pressure he is sure to face once the  season starts.  </P> <P> "Last year, I didn't know what the big leagues were about and how I compared  with big-league players, but this year I know I can play in the big leagues,"  he said.  </P> <P> "Last year, I came to camp in great shape, swinging the bat good, but this year  I came in with the right mental attitude, and that's a big difference. Just  getting a feeling for what the major leagues was has helped me. You think, 'The  major leagues, wow,' if you don't know better, but they're just another bunch  of humans, just at a different level."  </P> <P> Having Manager Doug Rader show confidence in him also helped.  </P> <P> "When I went down to Edmonton last year, I went to him and said, 'Thanks for  the chance,' and he said, 'Don't thank me. You earned it,' " Bichette said. "He  said he knew I'd be back. He's a motivator. He really inspires you."  </P> <P> Rader believes Bichette can inspire the Angels' offense, which finished 12th in  the American League in runs scored and 11th in team batting average last  season.  </P> <P> "It's important to us that he does well and stays on the ballclub," Rader said.  "Last year, he never really had an understanding of the nature of his swing.  He's got all the natural ability in the world regarding his swing. But until  this year, he had to have somebody with him to remind him. Not a whole lot for  him was automatic.  </P> <P> "Part of the difficulty of being a big league player is learning how to use  your ability. He's heading in the right direction. He's made a lot of  progress."  </P> <P> Enough to stay with the Angels all season?  </P> <P> "I hope they plan on me doing something to help the offense here, because I  plan on doing something," Bichette said. "I can't really set goals yet because  I don't know how much playing time I'm going to get, but I know I can help."  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven gave up four hits and no runs in four innings and the Brewers'  infield committed four of Milwaukee's five errors at Compadre Stadium in the  Angels' Arizona exhibition finale. The Angels are 6-3 as they head to Palm  Springs for a four-game series with the San Diego Padres, starting today.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to getting the season started," said Blyleven, who made 67  pitches Sunday and threw an extra inning in the bullpen after coming out. "With  everything that's happened, the lockout, getting down here and all the  traveling we've already done, it'll be nice to be home."  </P> <P> Mark McLemore left the game as a precautionary measure after experiencing  tightness in both hamstrings while rounding second base in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Milwaukee General Manager Harry Dalton, after watching his team commit two  errors in the first inning: "We've got the Venus de Milo infield. They all have  only one arm."  </P> <P> Chuck Finley (on three days' rest), Rich Monteleone and Mike Smithson will  pitch against the Padres today. Mark Langston and Mike Witt are scheduled to  pitch Tuesday, Kirk McCaskill and Jim Abbott on Wednesday and Blyleven on  Thursday.  </P> <P> The Angels are batting .324 in exhibitions, but Rader refuses to get excited.  The Angels batted .277 last spring but only .256 during the season.  </P> <P> "I don't remember anything about our hitting from last spring. I can tell you  about last summer," he said. "I can't tell you who won the Cactus League. I'm  not saying I'm not pleased, but you need to treat it just as what it is. The  thing I'm most pleased with is the approach and the rhythm that's been involved  with the swings."  </P> <P> Rader also said he was pleased with Abbott's four innings Saturday against the  Indians after being concerned about the young left-hander's arm strength. "He  threw breaking balls over the plate and change-ups over the plate. The guy has  a very amazing aptitude. He wasn't able to get the ball inside to right-handed  hitters, but he could very easily have gone a full stint."  </P> <P> Monteleone has an 87.75 earned-run average after giving up 13 earned runs in 1  1/3 innings. Scott Bailes, Mark Eichhorn, Finley and Bob McClure have yet to  give up an earned run.  </P> <P> Leading the hitters is Rick Schu, who was one for four Sunday and is six for 10  (.600). John Orton, who was two for three, is eight for 14 overall (.571).  </P></p>

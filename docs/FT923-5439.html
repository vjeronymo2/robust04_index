			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Japanese action THE POWER struggle within Japan's government has been resolved, at least for the moment. And for once the strongest has not emerged victorious. The unexpectedly large fiscal package of direct public spending increases and tax reliefs confirms that the misgivings of the ministry of finance have been overridden. The malign inaction that has undermined market confidence over the past few months has gone. The financial markets are still celebrating. Only time will tell whether these celebrations are premature. But the realistic, as well as the pessimistic, investor will not yet have been convinced that Tokyo's bear market is over, in spite of a 25 per cent rise in share prices over the past fortnight. It is not enough that the government is, and is seen to be, taking its responsibilities seriously at last. What counts is what the government can do to speed recovery by persuading banks to lend and companies to borrow in order to invest for the future. In fact, it can do very little. The fiscal package, in so far as it involves direct increases in spending, will boost domestic demand while accelerating much needed public investment projects. Yet much of the stimulus from this fiscal boost will not arrive until next year. In the meantime, companies will continue to cut back on capital spending projects in the face of depressed profits and sluggish consumer demand. There remains much bad news for the markets to digest. The sagacity of the various, and often vague, schemes to boost share prices and ease the plight of Japan's indebted banking industry are harder to judge. But the suspicion remains that many, particularly the new private corporation which will buy land from troubled banks, provide means of concealing rather than solving the problems. Only if the government subsidises the purchase of this land will the scheme be any more than an accounting device to conceal the banks' losses from investors. But cutting interest rates is a much better way to support the banking industry than artificially holding up land prices. Yet neither fiscal nor monetary policy can prevent a long and painful work-out from the debt-overhang facing Japan, and the US and UK too. But easing policy can make this process quicker and less painful. Regrettably, neither the US nor the UK can afford anything more than a modest increase in government spending without storing up debt problems of a different sort. The UK has to live with very high interest rates too. Japan's advantage is that it has both policy options at its disposal. The government prevaricated too long before acting to ease fiscal policy, undermining market confidence in the process. But the Bank of Japan can learn from this mistake. It still has room to cut short-term interest rates. It should do so now rather than wait.</p>

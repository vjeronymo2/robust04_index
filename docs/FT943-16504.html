			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: Managing a bull market - Commodities Representatives of coffee producing countries will gather in Brasilia, the Brazilian capital, on Thursday to undertake the relatively pleasant task of deciding how to manage a bull market. Delegates from the host country, Colombia, central America and Africa will be joined at the three-day meeting by US officials in talks prompted by the record-breaking surge in coffee prices that followed news a week ago that beans for the 1995-96 crop in Brazil, the world's biggest producer by far, had been damaged by frost. Producer stocks available to dampen down the ensuing market surge - London futures prices rose by more than 40 per cent - are mostly held in Brazil, estimated at 17m bags (60kg each) and Colombia, 5m bags. The chief task of the meeting will be to decide how much of this should be released to the market and on what time scale. Related questions are expected to concern the degree to which future consumption may be damaged by the rise of prices to 7 1/2 -year highs and how to head off an excessive build-up in production that could quickly send the market from boom to 'bust'. Before that meeting the world's coffee traders will be looking out for an official assessment of the extent of the damage to Brazilian bushes. Analysts' 'guesstimates' last week ranged between 5m and 9m bags out of a crop previously projected at about 24m bags. The higher figure would represent about 10 per cent of world coffee production. With Brazil's coffee frost 'season' having five weeks to run, weather forecasts for Brazilian growing areas will also be of more than usual interest. The most damaging frost ever to hit the Brazilian coffee industry was in 1975, on July 19. That reduced the following year's crop by nearly three quarters, but since then the bulk of the country's coffee planting has moved further north, and is therefore less likely to be affected.</p>

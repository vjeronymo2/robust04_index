			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield up 19% - Doubled profits from plantations help set recovery in train A DOUBLING of profits from plantations and the first contribution from an animal feed acquisition started a recovery last year at Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the conglomerate. Pre-tax profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 85m (Pounds 71.2m) on sales of Pounds 1.93bn (Pounds 1.82bn). But earnings per share of 7.6p, after an increased tax rate, again failed to cover the maintained dividend of 9p, including a 5.4p final. The food and agriculture division increased operating profit by nearly Pounds 10m to Pounds 38.6m, making it the biggest component in group operating profit of Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 92.4m). The BOCM-Silcock animal feed business, acquired from Unilever for Pounds 67m in June, contributed Pounds 7.4m. Mr George Paul, chief executive, said the cost of inte-grating it with the existing Pauls business, including the closure of 10 mills, had been covered by balance sheet provisions. Plantations nearly doubled profit to Pounds 20.1m as palm oil prices rose and yields were improved by new planting. The chemical and industrial division was hit by reorganisation costs of Pounds 3.5m, reducing profit to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 29.5m). In the US, six sites producing iron oxide had been reduced to two. Timber and building materials, including the Harcros chain, fell further to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 22.8m). Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said the builders' merchant market had declined by 30 per cent since late 1989. Net debt rose to Pounds 260m (Pounds 185m), gearing of 51 per cent (38 per cent), pushed up by the acquisition. Profits were helped by a Pounds 3.3m gain (Pounds 1.4m loss) on property and business disposals after deduc-ting a Pounds 6.4m write-off in the value of the head office, which is due to be sold. COMMENT The success of the BOCM acquisition and recovery potential in chemicals and at Harcros give some grounds for optimism after a fall in pre-tax profit from Pounds 131m to Pounds 71m between 1989 and 1991. Although gearing looks a bit high, disposals should bring in the best part of Pounds 30m this year to provide working capital when demand picks up. But signs of life have been slow to emerge, other than in chrome chemicals in the US. In the UK, it is too early to identify a sustained improvement in building materials - a greater flow of house moves is needed. A note of caution was also sounded about continental Europe, although less than 20 per cent of group sales go there. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m this year would give a prospective p/e of 19 times on yesterday's close of 167p, up 5p. This fully reflects recovery hopes. Dogged holding of the dividend for three years running - with the same again predicted - provides 6.7 per cent yield support. But when will it grow? Profits need to more than double to cover the payment twice.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Trade rivalries calmed by Pacific message Last week's meeting of Asian and western foreign ministers in Singapore gave an unexpected boost to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, the four-year-old trade group revitalised by President Bill Clinton as part of his vision of a 'new Pacific community'. By backing Apec, the ministers, whose talks were overshadowed by concerns about regional security, at least revived hopes that the world will be spared a round of inter-continental trade wars. Most Asian members endorsed Mr Clinton's plan for an informal Apec summit in Seattle in November, while south-east Asian countries reached an uneasy compromise on the future of Apec's main rival, the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC). The EAEC, an idea advocated by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, would exclude the so-called 'white' countries - the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - and has been dismissed privately by its opponents as racist. Dr Mahathir, on the other hand, believes that the US will seek to dominate Apec for its own selfish ends and that Asians must therefore stick together. He is the only Asian leader to have flatly turned down Mr Clinton's invitation. Under the compromise, the EAEC will become a caucus within Apec, but will also be able to act independently, a catch-all solution which left Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, and many other delegates saying they were 'puzzled'. The apparent rise of Apec, meanwhile, has been greeted with something approaching enthusiasm. Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Singapore prime minister, said he hoped it would be a 'roaring success'. The significance of Apec - as distinct from other trade blocs - is that it spans two continents, Asia and America, which might otherwise regard themselves as trade rivals rather than partners. Its 15 members are the US, Japan, the 'three Chinas' (China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), the six countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations or Asean (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Korea. At the Singapore meetings, an annual event hosted by Asean and attended by its main trading partners, the usual waggonloads of statistics were wheeled out to convince any remaining disbelievers that Asia, Apec and Asean were important. Some of the figures were hardly surprising: Apec may account for about half the world's gross national product, but then it does cover more than half the globe and includes the US, Japan and China. The statistics emphasised the well-known growth of Asia-Pacific economies. Mr Christopher, for example, noted that last year's US trans-Pacific trade of Dollars 325bn was three times the country's trade with Latin America and 50 per cent more than with western Europe. A corollary of this is that Asia is getting richer. It is already evident, as Dr Mahathir realises, that many future disputes within Apec will concern the western view that increased wealth means increased responsibility: on the environment and human rights as well as tariffs and trade. When, for instance, is a country like Thailand, which has based its export-led economic boom on cheap labour, judged rich enough to spend money on industrial safety? This issue is periodically raised by American labour unions and was taken up by the Thai press in May when about 200 workers, mostly women, were killed in a fire at a toy factory near Bangkok. Mr Christopher declared that Asian countries had reached a level of technological development which enabled them to produce chemicals, sophisticated electronics and other items useful for chemical and biological weapons, and should therefore be prepared to sign agreements controlling the trade in such products. An angry Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister and European Community president, wanted to know why Asian countries, which were so critical of Europe's performance in the former Yugoslavia, had not joined the Europeans in giving humanitarian aid. Other EC officials resented having to pay for aid to Cambodia, while the wealthy - and much nearer - Singaporeans held back. 'They are not poor people,' said one delegate. Another issue facing Apec is how it should relate to the other, often overlapping, trade groups whose acronyms proliferate by the year - Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement), Afta (the Asean Free Trade Area which is supposed to come into being over 15 years) and the SEM (the single European market) to name but three. Australia wants Apec to be an 'integrated regional market' and the US favours the establishment of some sort of trade and investment 'framework', but Asian countries are generally more cautious. As EC Commissioner Mr Manuel Marin of Spain pointed out, politicians pay lip service to global free trade but have a tendency to huddle together with their neighbours. 'Everybody criticises the blocs,' he said, 'but everyone is trying to make friends in their natural regional group.' Apec's task, made easier by the EAEC setback, is to overcome that tendency and strengthen the trade bridge between America and Asia. The question often raised about such trade groups is whether they undermine the latest round of negotiations on the greatest trade acronym of all - the Gatt, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - which are coming to a head at the end of this year. Asians and westerners alike argued that the Gatt should have priority and that regional groups could make useful steps towards free trade as long as they were 'Gatt-consistent'. Nobody contested Mr Christopher's declared aim of 'open regionalism'. 'What we all have to watch against . . . is that we do not abuse the strength that we develop by our numbers for protectionist reasons,' said Mr Hans van den Broek, another EC Commissioner. 'We would be impinging fundamentally on the letter and spirit of Gatt.' Nobody, not even Dr Mahathir, disagreed with that.</p>

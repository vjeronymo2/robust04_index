			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DESIGN;  </P> <P> THE STOVE THAT NEVER SLEEPS  </P> <P> EVER WONDER WHO,besides Princess Di and Paul McCartney, can afford a $9,500  stove? Well, if you think you might, you may as well get your money's worth and  go for one that bakes, boils, broils, steams, fries, stews, roasts, simmers,  grills and toasts -- simultaneously: the legendary British AGA (Amalgamated Gas  Accumulator) Cooker, a cast-iron, hand-enameled work of art that never sleeps.  The stove's four large ovens and two hot plates are stoked to their optimum  temperatures; once there, the stove stays on constantly.  </P> <P> If you've read this far, it may be time to see one up close and take the risk  of being smitten. You'll find a blue one just like Di's (it also comes in red,  green, black, white, brown and ivory) in situ, at Smallbone Showroom; or you  can all AGA's U.S. agent and ask for its full-color brochure and accompanying  20-minute how-to videotape. CHLOE ROSS The AGA Cooker is available through  Smallbone English Kitchens, 315 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles; (213)  550-7299. Or telephone AGA Cookers, (800) 633-9200.  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gephardt endorses Gatt deal House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, has endorsed ratification of the Gatt world trade agreement, saying it will raise America's living standards, AP reports from Washington. Mr Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, was joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by six other House Democrats who had voted against Nafta when it was approved last year. Mr Gephardt said he hoped the US Congress would ratify the Gatt accord this year, but it would make little difference if it was delayed until 1995. 'We ought to do it when we're ready to do it,' he said. US trade representative Mickey Kantor, meanwhile, said Mr Gephardt's endorsement was a sign that Congress would pass the Uruguay Round agreement. Mr Kantor said he was optimistic that Congress would ratify Gatt by August. The main issue still to be resolved was whether to make up lost tax revenue from tariff cuts or get a budget waiver from Congress.</p>

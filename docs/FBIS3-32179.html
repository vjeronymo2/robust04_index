In a news conference with reporters, the foreign minister  said the officer could not be arrested or forced to make  statements because he has total immunity from criminal  jurisdiction in Salvadoran territory, in accordance with the  Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.    Lopez has been accredited with the Salvadoran Government as  a  U.S. Embassy military attache since 4 July 1992, registration  number 267/92.    However, continued the foreign minister, the Vienna  Convention states that the Maj. Lopez's immunity has in El  Salvador does not exempt him from his own country's jurisdiction.    In this sense, said Salaverria, the Foreign Ministry has  from  the outset received assurances from the U.S. Embassy in El  Salvador that Maj. Lopez would be subject to a court martial in  his own country.    "Ever since this regrettable incident occurred, this Foreign  Ministry was informed by the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador about  the case and at the same time was promised that Maj. Lopez would  be subject to U.S. laws," explained the minister.    At the same time, he said the Foreign Ministry has asked the  U.S. Embassy for "a report on emigration procedures surrounding  Maj. Lopez's departure from the country, as well as for the date  when the legal process will begin, information on the court that  will hear the case, and details of penalties established by U.S.  laws for crimes like this, in the event that he is found  guilty." [passage omitted]    For his part, Dr. Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, president of  the  Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ], said that an investigation will  be undertaken into whether the Foreign Ministry committed a  crime in this case.    Upon his return from Brazil, where he participated in a  meeting of the OAS legal committee, Gutierrez Castro explained  that the Foreign Ministry's actions must be investigated by the  judge charged with investigating the crime.    "If what is stated in a U.S. Embassy communique, which  explains that the Foreign Ministry gave permission, is true, we  could be dealing with a crime committed by a state branch,"  stressed the Supreme Court justice.    He explained that the officer has diplomatic immunity, in  accordance with which the Embassy should notify the Foreign  Ministry of the fact, and the Foreign Ministry, for its part,  should then notify the judge in charge of the case so that the  CSJ could invoke treaties regarding diplomatic immunity.    "This accomplished, Mr. Lopez could have left the country  through the corresponding legal borders, thus observing the laws  of the Republic," asserted the president of the CSJ.    Furthermore, Dr. Gutierrez said that over the last few years  the country has been "excessively" generous in granting  immunity, even to people who are connected with embassies or  international organizations but who should really not enjoy that  privilege.    Gutierrez Castro said that it is the duty of the executive  branch to submit a protest to the U.S. Government and urged  candidates in the upcoming elections to defend national  sovereignty.

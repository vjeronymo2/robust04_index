			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENT ORANGE STUDY FUNDING CRITICIZED  </P> <P> The federal Centers for Disease Control misspent $6.6 million while conducting  a disputed study of the effects of Agent Orange, a congressional study released  Saturday said.  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office said the money was spent on work by outside  contractors that was not needed or couldn't be done because the CDC did not  have a methodology ready to begin the work.  </P> <P> Agent Orange was a herbicide sprayed by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War to  remove jungle cover. Many veterans contend it is responsible for cancers, birth  defects and other ailments.  </P> <P> The report fueled renewed criticism of the CDC's handling of the Agent Orange  study.  </P> <P> Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House human resources and  intergovernmental relations subcommittee, called the report "direct evidence  that the political manipulation of the Agent Orange study resulted in the waste  of millions of taxpayer dollars."  </P></p>

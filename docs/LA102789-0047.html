			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Lauri Sing and Michael Brangoccio are two young painters who venture into  different kinds of mixed-media formats, with vastly different results. Sing's  work reads as dreamily introverted; Brangoccio's, as the product of an  extrovert playing coy.  </P> <P> In Sing's multipart constructions, dry, painted images of antique Greek statues  on fabric-covered wood are juxtaposed with pieces of found wood and hinged  sheets of rusting steel. Long, curving arcs cut into the wood resonate oddly  with the veiled, intangible quality of the figures. The arcs suggest an  astronomical reference. The antique figures are embodiments of harmony and  proportion. Together, the abstract markings and the figures evoke a world of  timeless order and mathematical perfection, compared with the "chaos" of the  accidental drips and scuff marks.  </P> <P> Brangoccio has a knack for design. The problem is that he doesn't differentiate  between the superficially pretty, easy gesture and the kind of rewarding visual  surprise that is more hard-won. His spare paintings incorporate collaged  printed papers -- wallpaper, cigarette packets -- and calligraphic swoops of  black paint on textured white surfaces. He'll isolate a single rose from a  swatch of wallpaper ("Scandalize") or stipple a patch of rose paint with lots  of wiggly little black strokes ("Rote Figur"). But these gestures are too  self-consciously cute for their own good, as if he is listening for applause.  (Ruth Bachofner Gallery, 926 Colorado Ave., to Nov. 25.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

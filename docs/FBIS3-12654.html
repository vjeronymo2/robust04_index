You have conveyed a message from Yasir 'Arafat to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. What does the message contain?    ['Urayqat] In fact, the message was conveyed to the Israeli  negotiators by telephone last Friday. The message urges the  Israeli Government to make four moves. First, to disarm the  settlers; second, to dismantle the settlements in Gaza and  Hebron; third, to provide international protection; and fourth,  to place the settlements issue at the top of the agenda. The  Israel Government replied by adopting certain decisions, which  do not rise to the required level and which lack seriousness.  The PLO Executive Committee studied the issue and found that  the decisions and replies did not contribute to peace efforts.    In light of the incidents that followed the massacre in the  occupied Palestinian territories, including the settlers'  continued terrorist and provocative activity and the Israeli  Army's continued killings of Palestinian citizens, the Israeli  Government is once again required to take practical and  realistic measures, rather than mere formalities, like the ones  it has taken in the past. This is exactly what happened and  this is what was conveyed to the Israeli delegations in  Washington.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Where do we stand now regarding the  future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations?    ['Urayqat] I believe that negotiations are not a goal in and  of themselves. They are a means to achieve a goal. We believe  that as a result of the terrorist operation in the city of  Hebron, the current negotiations face a sharp turning point.  Any negotiations that do not deal with settlements will be  fruitless. Therefore, Israeli measures should deal with content  rather than form.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Have you ruled out the resumption of  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations before the PLO's conditions are  met?    ['Urayqat] We are not talking about conditions. We state  clearly that life will not go on as it used to do before the  massacre that took place against our people in Hebron. The U.S.  Administration took procedures to move the negotiations from one  place to another. This is a procedural matter and cannot  influence the situation. What is required now is serious  Israeli and U.S. moves.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much.    ['Urayqat] You are welcome.</p>

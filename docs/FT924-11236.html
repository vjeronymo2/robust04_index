			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Business Law: Avoiding the arbitration trap As the third-world debt crisis begins to show signs of ending, needed capital - much of it in the form of direct foreign investment - is returning to Asia, Latin America and Africa. In the rush to attract foreign business, developing countries risk repeating the errors of the past. One such error has been to underestimate the importance of the method selected for resolving international business disputes. Many transnational corporations remain unwilling to make direct investments in smaller and poorer countries if those investments would require the company to take its disputes to the local courts. Rightly or wrongly, there is a strongly held belief that trust in the impartiality of courts in developing nations is too great a risk. The parties often agree to shift disputes to a neutral forum, which frequently means international arbitration under the auspices of private organisations based in developed countries, such as the International Chamber of Commerce and American Arbitration Association. Arbitration is designed to offer a neutral, expeditious and relatively simple method of resolving business disputes. In many domestic contexts, and some international settings, arbitration accomplishes these goals and provides a means of dispute resolution that is superior in important respects to judicial processes. From the perspective of developing nations and their companies, however, the fairness and benefits of international arbitration are often questionable. The principal areas in which third-world parties can be disadvantaged are selection of arbitrators, forum, cost, and access to and supervision of legal representatives. Lurking in the background are fundamental issues of national and international policy, under which arbitral awards are increasingly exempted from meaningful judicial review, even when awards violate fundamental norms of domestic public policy. Ordinarily both sides appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators, or an arbitral institution, appoint the chairman. There is an understandable tendency on the part of parties to appoint a national as their arbitrator. Unfortunately for parties from the third world, unless their nominee is someone of international stature, their interests tend to be poorly served by a national who is unfamiliar with the workings of international arbitration. If their nominee is seen to lack the stature of the other members of the panel, or seen to be partial, he will be ignored by the chairman. As a result, ordinarily the third-world client's interests will be best served by appointing a European. The odds are that if the contract specifies the law of a developed country, the chairman will be someone from that legal system or from a very similar legal culture. By contrast, if the contract specifies the law of the developing country, it is unlikely that someone from that country will be selected. The result is that the panel is likely to be dominated by persons unfamiliar with the law of the developing country. Unless the contract has a forum-selection clause specifying otherwise, which is rarely the case, ICC and AAA arbitrations are conducted in developed states, often London, Paris or Switzerland. The choice of a developed forum has a large number of consequences, none of them favourable to litigants from less developed countries. Even assuming the parties have selected the substantive law of the contract, the procedure will be determined by the arbitrators, who will routinely turn to the law of the forum. In the case of a lengthy arbitration, the selection of a developed forum can impose large costs on the parties in terms of paying for the hearing room, housing of lawyers, parties and arbitrators, over and above the already high costs of lawyers who charge at the market rates in European capitals or the United States. These costs have to be paid as the matter progresses, which may put a strain on a party that lacks easy access to large quantities of foreign exchange. To these must be added the arbitrator's fees. The fact that the panel will be dominated by Europeans means that the case will have to be presented in a European fashion, by counsel experienced in the procedures of the forum. The tribunal is likely to expect extensive research on the law and tidy presentation of the facts. While the developing country litigant can hire equally experienced outside counsel, at a price, their work must still be monitored by inside lawyers and executives who are unlikely to have the same amount of relevant experience as their transnational counterparts. There are no authoritative statistics on international arbitration results, owing to the confidential nature of arbitration. Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence indicates that international arbitrators have tended to decide in favour of transnational corporations. More fundamentally, international arbitration is premised on a distrust of developing countries and their courts. It is characterised by a more informal approach to so-called legal technicalities. As a result, even a solid claim or defence based on a formal reading of a contract will not necessarily prevail, introducing costly uncertainty as to the likely result. International arbitration converts disputes with significant legal, regulatory and policy dimensions into purely private contractual disagreements. Courts, whose duty it is to administer justice pursuant to law and policy, are replaced with private arbitration panels that often see their mission as merely to settle disagreements in accordance with 'general' legal principles and prevailing business practices that favour transnational corporations. This type of private justice inevitably ignores the legitimate regulatory interests of concerned states. The confidential nature of most arbi-trations further impedes the enforcement of regulatory protections in both developed and developing states. The New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards could mitigate the potential bias inherent in international arbitration. In particular, the convention reintroduces broader concerns of justice by empowering local courts to deny enforcement of international arbitral awards that are rendered contrary to 'public policy'. Unfortunately, courts in many developed countries have employed an exceedingly narrow reading of 'public policy' - indeed more narrow than the interpretation of the same language in the relevant domestic context. And, courts in developing countries, when confronted with international arbitral awards, have often followed the lead of the developed countries by enforcing arbitral awards. This has deprived the public policy safeguard to the private arbitral process of any real meaning, and threatens the legitimate regulatory policies of both developed and developing countries. What should be a meaningful review of arbitral awards has come to resemble a rubber stamp. Courts charged with enforcing arbitral awards could restore the balance between private dispute resolution and public adjudication envisaged by the New York Convention. Meaningful review of arbitration awards by enforcing courts would facilitate international commercial transactions and capitalise on the advantages of arbitration while avoiding the arbitration trap. Meanwhile, however, there has been a growing tendency in certain of the more well-off developing countries to insist on local arbitration, with even the express right to appeal to local courts. This attempt to redress a real or an alleged imbalance by merely tilting the table in one's own direction is clearly a backward step. The only real solution to the problem will be found in the true internationalisation of arbitration.

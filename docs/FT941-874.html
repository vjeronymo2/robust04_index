			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Receivers attacked over sale of FMT A row has broken out over the sale this month of FMT, the machine tool builder which called in receivers in February, to the UK subsidiary of Giddings &amp; Lewis, a US-owned competitor. Mr Keith Bailey, chairman and chief executive of BSA Tools, a rival bidder for FMT, claims a chance has been missed to save the last remaining UK-owned producer of horizontal machining centres and manufacturing systems, and is unhappy with the way his bid was treated by Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers. Meanwhile, Mr Joe Wickham, FMT's former manufacturing director and a shareholder in the company, said the receivers have let the workforce down by failing to ensure that the business was sold as a going concern, as originally intended. But Mr Alan Bloom, the receiver, has strongly defended the sale to G&amp;L, and said Mr Bailey's bid was treated fairly. G&amp;L is understood to have paid about Pounds 650,000 for the FMT name and that of Kearns-Richards, along with the intellectual rights, and the profitable service, spare parts and machine rebuild business. Mr Bailey says he would have retained a nucleus of key FMT employees and transferred final assembly of FMT machines to BSA Tools' plant, which has spare capacity. Mr Bailey was attracted by FMT's business opportunities in China - it was close to clinching an important joint venture there. 'It's a great loss, and I don't believe the best decision was reached,' he said. He is upset that G&amp;L's bid was accepted only hours before he was due to deliver a banker's draft to clinch the purchase.</p>

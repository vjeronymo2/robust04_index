			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 7 June "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, June 7 (BTA) -- The 41st Congress of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists), which  ended here yesterday [6 June], is highlighted in all dailies.  It opened on Friday [3 June] and went on for one night and one  day beyond the scheduled time. Zhan Videnov was reelected  leader and a new statute was adopted. The congress decided that  the BSP programme will be adopted after an all-party  consultation in the autumn and passed a resolution urging for  early parliamentary elections this autumn. A banner headline in  DUMA, the BSP daily, says that it had predicted that Videnov  would lead the party to elections in the autumn. Yesterday,  even before the start of the voting procedure, a front-page  headline in DUMA announced that Videnov remained socialist  leader. The story specified that this was a prediction by the  press. "Other dailies ran similar 'scandalous' headlines  yesterday," DUMA says. Under the headline "If You Fight Battles  of the Past, You Live in the Past" the daily runs an interview  with Zhan Videnov, who says the main steps of the BSP will be to  complete "what we have prepared, paid for dearly and actually  finalized in law-making and in our relationships with the  government" and to guarantee "free, fair and democratic  elections in an atmosphere of stability, needed for a mandate  for stable and successful left-of-centre government". The  leftist daily ZEMYA, the trade union TRUD daily and the private  NOVINAR also run interviews with Videnov. DUMA publishes  declarations adopted at the congress and lists the names of the  members of the newly-elected 106-member Supreme Council,  including 31 delegates from the constituencies, as well as of  the All-Party Controlling Committee. The socialist daily  stresses that in a resolution adopted at the congress the BSP  expressed readiness for parliamentary elections in the autumn.  Asked to be more specific about the timing of elections, BSP  floor leader Nora Ananieva said, "The astronomical end of the  autumn is December 22" according to DUMA.    DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the opposition Union of  Democratic  Forces (SDS), covers the BSP congress under the headline  "Videnov Appointed BSP Chief". Associate Editor Mikhaela  Vuzharova comments: "The Socialists voted to make autumn 'a  base' for a future date for the early elections; for the time  being the Socialists make out that the autumn ends on  Christmas". According to the author, Videnov, now BSP chairman,  wants to become BSP leader. "The renamed Communists no longer  shout `BSP', `Victory' or `Unity' and are not convulsed in  hysteria at the mention of the SDS," the author says.    ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential  extraparliamentary Agrarian Party, headed by Anastasiya  Dimitrova- Mozer, runs a brief report on the congress headlined  "They Are Still the Same".    "One after the other Socialist leaders speak about elections  in autumn, but which autumn do they have in mind?" says a signed  commentary in TRUD.    The private KONTINENT daily carries two signed commentaries  on the BSP congress. One of them stresses that Videnov was the  only candidate for the leadership and won "against himself".  "BSP Makes Painful Step to Power" runs the headline of the  second commentary.    The Social Democracy Alliance, a wing of the BSP, lost  ground  in the supreme body, says a front-page story in OTECHESTVEN  VESTNIK. "It, however, won a leader in the person of Videnov,"  the daily says. The private EXPRESS daily, which resumed  publishing under a new editor-in-chief, says the non-conformists  were thrown out of the BSP Supreme Council. These are  Aleksandur Marinov, leader of the Sofia party organization,  considered an alternative candidate for the position of leader,  and ex-premier Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Velislava Dureva  and Elena Poptodorova, all four of them members of the Social  Democracy Alliance.

Kim U-sok, who is accompanying  President Kim Yong-sam on a three-day visit to Tokyo from  Thursday, made the request in a meeting with Kozo Igarashi,  Japan's construction minister.    Igarashi said that Seoul has to join in a government  procurements agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT) and open its market before being allowed to  make bids for Japanese public works. "If South Korea joins the  GATT treaty and liberalizes its market, it will be treated like  others," Igarashi said.    At the GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  talks, completed in December last year, South Korea expressed  its willingness to sign the government procurements pact, to  come into force in January 1996. To do so, however, requires  the country to liberalize its market first. The country has so  far banned foreign contractors from making bids for its projects  on their own.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Stockbroker seen as main beneficiary of Dublin deals A PROMINENT Dublin stockbroker was the main beneficiary of a series of deals which culminated in the controversial Pounds 9.4m purchase of a headquarters site by Telecom Eireann in 1990, according to the Irish government-appointed inspector investigating the affair. In his recently published final report Mr John Glackin, the inspector, identifies Mr Dermot Desmond as being the key figure in deals which led to the purchase of a disused bakery site in Dublin by the Irish state-run telecommunications company for its new headquarters. Subsequently it emerged that the site had changed hands twice in the 18 months before being acquired by Telecom and that its price had more than doubled in the process. Mr Glackin, a solicitor, was appointed in October 1991 to investigate who controlled and who stood to gain financially from the transactions involving two offshore companies called Chestvale Properties and Hoddle Investments. The report deals with the position of Dr Michael Smurfit, the former chairman of Telecom, who had acknowledged, as he had then recently discovered, that he had indirectly held a small stake in UPH. UPH had at one stage owned the bakery site. Dr Smurfit resigned as Telecom chairman in reaction to a suggestion by Mr Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister, in 1991 that he should 'step aside' pending the outcome of a departmental inquiry into the circumstances. Mr Glackin concludes that 'none of the Telecom Eireann executives or directors other than its chairman, Mr Smurfit, were financially interested in the success or failure (real or apparent) of the companies or able to control or materially influence the policy of the companies.' In the case of Mr Smurfit himself, the inspector says: 'I am satisfied that, save insofar as Mr Smurfit was the beneficial owner of shares, through an Isle of Man company Bacchantes Limited, in UPH, which I have found was financially interested in the success or failure of Chestvale between 9th December and 19th April 1990, he was not financially interested in the success or failure (real or apparent) of the companies nor did he control or materially influence the policy of the companies.' He adds that he did not find any evidence that Mr Smurfit was 'involved in, or aware of the management or affairs of UPH' and accepts the former Telecom chairman's evidence that he had no knowledge that his name was being used by Mr Desmond to help raise finance for the purchase of the site by Chestvale.</p>

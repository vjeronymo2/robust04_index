			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No question of class here Sir, I very much appreciate Quentin Peel's and Judy Dempsey's articles about Germany such as the one on the German election campaign, 'Firmly footed for the final hurdle' (September 10). Unlike many German journalists, they give a clear and unbiased view. What I dislike, however, is the translation of Bundestag into lower house (and, likewise, Bundesrat into upper house). Since there are neither commoners nor lords in this country, no reference should be made to class. I think the British reader does not need such translation.

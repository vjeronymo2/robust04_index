			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Teresa Ronderos, political editor of EL </F> TIEMPO]    [Text] Before venturing into the fascinating results of  this poll, in which a representative sample of Colombians not  only say for whom they are going to vote, but also describe the  candidates and say what they want changed in the next  government, our readers need a word of warning.    This poll was done BEFORE Andres Pastrana entered the  campaign and announced his platform. We wanted to take the pulse  of public opinion just before his campaign began, and then  measure it again in a few weeks so we can evaluate the impact of  the official start of his campaign.    Also, while the poll was being conducted (which took a week  because it used personal interviews) and the results analyzed,  Colombian politics was suddenly jolted. Alvaro Gomez announced  that he was putting aside his antipathy toward the Pastrana  family and joining the Pastranist bandwagon; Carlos Lleras de la  Fuente, a former member of the Constituent Congress, entered the  campaign as a candidate for the Liberal Party primary; and  another hopeful, Gloria Gaitan, made use of the door Lleras had  opened to join in the liberal contest.    In order to reflect part of these sudden changes, EL TIEMPO  asked the CNC [National Survey Center] to conduct a telephone  poll in Colombia's five largest cities to investigate the  liberal primary results with the two new candidates included. If  the liberal primary to select a single presidential candidate  were held today, the results would be: Ernesto Samper, 54  percent; Humberto de la Calle, 14 percent; Carlos Lleras de la  Fuente, 12 percent; Carlos Lemos Simmonds, 8 percent; David  Turbay, 3 percent; and Rodolfo Gonzalez and Gloria Gaitan, each  with 1 percent.    Lleras de la Fuente's impact is considerable, especially in  Bogota, where he would get his highest percentage: 18 percent.  In Barranquilla, though, he would only get 4 percent. Judging by  former polls, Lleras would take some votes from Lemos, something  from Samper, and a little from De la Calle. But he also attracts  new votes from people who said they would vote for none of the  candidates or did not know for whom they would vote.  <H5>  The First Round </H5>   Like the poll results broadcast in recent days by the major  radio stations, this poll shows that the presidential race is no  longer tied between Samper and Pastrana. Samper gets 39 percent  of the votes, and Pastrana, 32 percent. This seven-point  difference is significant, as the margin of error is 3.1 percent.    In third place is Antonio Navarro, the Democratic/Alliance  M-19 candidate with 11 percent, followed by Miguel Maza Marquez  with 4 percent. Regina Betancourt is next with 3 percent; then  Enrique Parejo, 2 percent; Gabriel Melo, 1 percent; and Rodrigo  Marin and Juan Diego Jaramillo, less than 1 percent each.    Samper is strongest in midsized cities, where he gets 46  percent. Pastrana's support, though, is spread proportionally  among small, midsized, and large cities. Navarro gets most of  his support in small cities, where he wins 15 percent. Maza is  stronger in large and midsized cities; Parejo, in large cities.  The fact that the poll included Barranquilla and Santa Marta  among large and midsized cities explains why the latter two  candidates, both from the coast, did well there.    As in former polls, this shows that Samper has a  considerable  edge among men and people over 40. If only women and young  people voted, Pastrana would catch up to Samper. Navarro also  does better with the 18 to 24 age group.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |First Presidential Round                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Candidate                             |Percentage                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Samper                                |39                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pastrana                              |32                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Navarro                               |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maza                                  |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Regina                                |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parejo                                |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Melo                                  |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Marin                                 |under 1                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jaramillo                             |under 1                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |None of the above                     |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do not know; did not answer           |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Second Presidential Round                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Candidate                             |Percentage                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Samper                                |49                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pastrana                              |40                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other                                 |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The most striking fact is the great difference among social  classes. Pastrana leads Samper by 25 percent in the upper  classes; Samper leads by 9 points among the middle classes, and  the two candidates are virtually tied among voters from the  lowest classes.    Looking at the results by party, both Pastrana and Samper  pick up votes from members of the opposing parties. Nine percent  of the conservatives say they will vote for Samper, and 12  percent of the liberals say they will vote for Pastrana. Still,  Pastrana does better than all his rivals with people who say  they have no party affilation; 35 percent say they will vote for  Pastrana.  <H5>  Why Did Samper Go Up? </H5>   "Please think about what you know, have heard, and have seen  that Andres Pastrana has done in the last three months, and tell  me if at this time you feel more inclined, less inclined, or  equally inclined to vote for him than you were three months  ago," the people surveyed were asked. The same question was  asked about Ernesto Samper. The answers show the shift.    Twenty-seven percent said they were more inclined to vote  for  Andres and 30 percent less inclined, giving him a 3 percent  negative balance. Perhaps that is the cost of starting his  campaign late. Samper, though, has 35 percent more inclined and  21 percent less inclined, a positive balance of 14 points.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |During the last three months, have you changed your mind about voting for: |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Candidate         |More inclined (pe-|Less inclined (pe-|No change (percen-|  |                  |rcent)            |rcent)            |t)                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Samper            |35                |21                |29                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pastrana          |27                |30                |27                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Some political analysts say Samper's considerable gain is  due  to the intense work done by the Liberal Party machinery since  the beginning of the year, aiming at the parliamentary  elections. There are 134 candidates for the Senate and 302  candidates for the Chamber: 436 liberal candidates mobilizing  thousands of people in support of their party. That has to help  the candidate with the best chance of winning the Liberal Party  primary.    The Samper campaign takes the view that Samper's central  message, the fight against unemployment, has now taken hold of  people, and more people now think this candidate is the one who  would best deal with unemployment.    In this poll, the problem most citizens cited as the leading  problem is unemployment (56 percent), followed by lack of safety  for the population, with 14 percent (most frequently mentioned  in large cities and by people from the lowest social classes),  and guerrilla violence (11 percent).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |What do you think is the nation's top problem?                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Unemployment                          |56                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Citizens' safety                      |14                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guerrillas                            |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Education                             |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug traffic                          |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Housing                               |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Health care                           |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do not know; did not answer           |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      According to Pastrana's campaign managers, things will  change  after the congressional elections, as the liberal machinery's  activity will decline. There is also a broad group of undecided  voters, among whom, according to their research, Pastrana has  more support. They say that after a few weeks of campaigning,  many of these undecided voters will decide to support the New  Democratic Force candidate.    Perhaps also for the reasons stated above, Samper appears to  have a 9 percent edge over Pastrana in a possible second round.  <H5>  What Do They Want Changed? </H5>   In general, when asked if they prefer change or continuity  in  government policies, people generally say they want change. And,  according to this poll, a considerable majority would like a  change in direction in some specific policies: social policy,  dealings with the guerrillas, and privatization of state  enterprises. In the first case, 60 percent of the Colombian  people would like the next president to change social policy,  while 28 percent would like the same policy to continue.  Sixty-three percent want a change in the method of dealing with  the guerrillas, and 29 percent would like the present course to  continue. A similar pattern is seen with the privatization of  state enterprises (see table).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |On which of the following issues would you like the next president to cont-|  |inue Gaviria's policy, and which you like to be changed?                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Issue             |Continue ()      |Change ()        |Do not know; did  |  |                  |                  |                  |not answer ()    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Handling of the e-|35                |59                |7                 |  |conomy            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |International rel-|44                |44                |12                |  |ations            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Handling of the g-|29                |63                |8                 |  |uerrillas         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Handling of the d-|43                |50                |8                 |  |rug traffic       |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Social policy     |28                |60                |12                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Privatization of  |27                |63                |11                |  |state enterprises |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Change in handling the guerrillas is desired most in large  cities. Where the most people would like a change in social  policy is in large and small cities.    On the economy, the majority, 59 percent, would like new  strategies, but 35 percent want continuity. International  relations and the handling of the drug traffic is where most  people would like the next government to maintain the current  president's policy.  <H5>  Characteristics </H5>   Even though the trend shows Samper ahead of Pastrana, when  people describe the candidates' characteristics, they see in  each of them particular strengths and weaknesses (see table).    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Of the two leading candidates, in whom do you think the following charact-|  |eristics most predominate?                                                |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Characteristic|Pastrana ()  |Samper ()    |Both ()      |Neither ()   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Experience    |29            |46            |12            |6             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Leadership    |35            |41            |11            |4             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Honesty       |26            |33            |17            |14            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Understanding |30            |34            |15            |9             |  |of people's p-|              |              |              |              |  |roblems       |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Intelligence  |25            |34            |27            |4             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Credibility   |31            |37            |13            |10            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ability to so-|29            |36            |19            |9             |  |lve the count-|              |              |              |              |  |ry's problems |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Samper's best recognized characteristic, compared with  Pastrana, is experience. On this point the liberal has a  17-point advantage over his rival.    The quality most people attribute to Pastrana is leadership.  Where he is closest to his rival is his understanding of  ordinary people's problems; on this point, they are practically  tied, taking the margin of error into account.    When people are asked what they want of their president, the  first thing they mention is honesty (32 percent); then an  ability to solve people's problems (25 percent); experience (19  percent); and intelligence (12 percent). Strangely, leadership  is not one of the top-priority qualities.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |What do you think is the principal characteristic Colombia's next president  |  |needs to have?                                                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Quality                               |Percentage                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Honesty                               |32                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Problem-solving ability               |25                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Experience                            |19                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Intelligence                          |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Leadership                            |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Credibility                           |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Understanding                         |3                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Technical Polling Date </H5>   This poll was conducted for EL TIEMPO by the CNC among 1,100  people who said they are going to vote in the upcoming  presidential elections.    A random sample of households was chosen in four large  cities: Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla; six midsized  cities: Santa Marta, Ibague, Pereira, Cucuta, Pasto, and  Villavicencio; and 12 small cities: Yarumal, Sogamoso,  Zipaquira, Lorica, Fundacion, La Dorada, Buenaventura, San Jose  de Isnos, Santander de Quilichao, Floridablanca, Cordoba  (Bolivar), and Calarca.    The interviews were conducted in person between 6 and 10  February. An EL TIEMPO reporter accompanied a CNC interviewer  for one day in Bogota and interviewed some of the persons polled  in greater depth.    This poll's maximum margin of error is 3.1 percent. This  means that if a candidate gets 30 percent in the poll, in  reality his vote may be between 27 and 33 percent.    Because of the last-minute changes in Liberal Party primary  candidates, EL TIEMPO asked the CNC to do a new poll to measure  voting intentions with the new range of candidates.    This poll was done on 16 and 17 February by telephone. Six  hundred people chosen at random were called in Bogota, Medellin,  Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. In this survey, the margin  of error is 4.1 percent.</p>

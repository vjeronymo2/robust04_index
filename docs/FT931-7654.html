			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Strong sales give Chugai 38% advance CHUGAI Pharmaceuticals, the leading Japanese pharmaceuticals manufacturer specialising in anti-cancer drugs, yesterday reported a 38.5 per cent increase in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y14.65bn (Dollars 122m) in the year to the end of December. The sharp rise in profits was produced by a mixture of cost-cutting and strong sales of prescription drugs. Chugai's sales rose by 7.5 per cent to Y143.21bn, buoyed by strong sales of prescription drugs. Net profits rose by 27 per cent to Y5.25bn despite extraordinary losses from investment in an overseas subsidiary. The company has dissolved a joint venture with Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group. The dividend is being maintained at Y7.5.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sharp advance at Bergesen Bergesen, Norway's biggest shipowner and one of the world's largest tanker operators, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in 1993 pretax profits to NKr132m (Dollars 17.4m) from NKr20m a year earlier, helped by gains on securities and disposals. But the group warned of another weak year for shipping operations in 1994. Operating revenue rose by NKr285m to NKr2.93bn while operating profit advanced by only NKr67m to NKr270m, reflecting a weak spot market for tankers and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) vessels. An unchanged dividend of NKr1 a share is proposed. Bergesen charged 1993 accounts with NKr200m in net financial items, up from NKr184m in 1992, after unrealised currency losses of NKr221m. But it booked realised gains on securities of NKr94m, against NKr8m, and said unrealised gains on the group's share portfolio had increased to NKr1.43bn from NKr225m. Bergesen also booked realised gains of NKr61m on the disposal of two dry cargo vessels. The tanker division cut 1993 operating losses to NKr121m from NKr218m and said that overall, the value of its fleet in dollar terms was little changed from 1992 but that a stronger dollar had led to a 10 per cent increase in the krone value of its vessels. Vessel operations last year were satisfactory but the group forecast another weak year in 1994. It added that it saw a weaker year in 1994 for LPG vessels operating in the spot market and a soft market for dry cargo vessels.</p>

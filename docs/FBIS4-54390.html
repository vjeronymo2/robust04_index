On Friday afternoon, the Indonesian businessmen who came  here  as part of the Indonesian delegation met and held talks with the  Myanmar [Burma] minister for trade, Lt. Gen.

Minister Tun Kyi and Myanmar trade officials and Indonesian  businessmen discussed ways and means of increasing trade between  Myanmar and Indonesian during the talks.    On Thursday morning, after the briefing given to the  Indonesian delegation by Minister for National Planning and  Economic Development Brig. Gen.

During these discussions, Minister Hartarto urged the  Indonesian businessmen to play an effective role in the  development of Myanmar's economy.    Hartarto reiterated what Minister of Tourism, Post, and  Telecommunications Joop Ave had earlier stated about Indonesia's  willingness to provide training and technical assistance to  Myanmar for its development of tourist industry.    Hartarto also stressed the need for implementing easy and  quick telecommunications services for bringing about economic  cooperation between Myanmar and Indonesia.    "We will see to it that the telecommunications services  between the two countries will soon be extended," Hartarto said  at the discussions.    According to Brig. Gen.

The Indonesian delegation will leave for home at 3 pm on  Friday.    Myanmar government officials here look upon the visit of  Indonesian delegation led by Hartarto as "a great success" that  will usher in a new era of economic cooperation between the two  countries for mutual benefit.</p>

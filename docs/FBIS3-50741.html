			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Berlioz for the "This Very Day" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has recognized  that the expropriation of property owned by North Americans may  deteriorate trade relations between Honduras and the United  States.    According to an article in THE NEW HERALD, an increasingly  long list of North Americans, perhaps 30, have lost their  property in Honduras due to expropriation, embezzlement, or  illegal maneuvers to the point that the incidents are irritating  Washington and its relations with Honduras.    The article includes quotes from statements made by a U.S.  Embassy official in our country according to whom investing or  buying real estate in Honduras is extremely risky. He adds that  North American investors and owners want to do everything  correctly, in strict abidance by Honduran laws, but piranhas are  eating them alive.    Undoubtedly, the article seriously affects Honduras' chances  of attracting highly sought foreign investments.    [Begin Callejas recording] In my opinion, it is obvious  that much of this happens because it is presumed that the law  will always favor them because they are North Americans. That  is not necessarily the case. [end recording]    According to the president, the situation could undermine  relations between the two countries, particularly trade  relations.    [Begin Callejas recording] Remember that the United States  makes the introduction of our products under preferential terms  contingent upon its foreign policy, so complex situations may  arise. [end recording]    The president mentioned the case of the United Nations Park,  which was erroneously registered in a person's name during  General Tiburcio Carias Andino's administration even though the  families that owned the land at the time were compensated.    [Begin Callejas recording] A North American purchased the  land even though he knew about this error, or perhaps he acted  in good faith. However, an error in the implementation of the  law does not imply that the state is guilty of an illegitimate  action. Therefore, the state believes it has the right to  purchase the land at El Picacho. That is one of the cases  involved. Consequently, we must be fair here and act within the  framework of Honduran society. We must accept the fact that the  North Americans are not necessarily right all the time. [end  recording]</p>

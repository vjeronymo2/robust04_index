			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Congressmen seek block on 'harmful' investment LEGISLATION introduced in the US House of Representatives yesterday would require an executive block on foreign investment if it threatens to harm the US economy. US law partly requires the administration to block investment only if it imperils the US national security interest. Forces in Congress are insisting on expanding the definition of national security to include economic, not just military, interests. The bill sponsored by Mr Mel Levine, a California Democrat, and Mr Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican, reflects concern about US high-technology companies being sold to foreign interests. It would force the administration to include new factors before approving sales. These involve the concentration of foreign direct investment in the industry in question, the effect on critical technologies, and whether the firm to be acquired has received US government funds. The Congressmen released a report criticising the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee which vets foreign investments. The study, by the Economic Strategy Institute, says CFIUS reviewed only 12 of 400 critical foreign acquisitions in the past two-and-a-half years, including 95 computer companies, 35 semiconductor groups, 30 semiconductor equipment-makers, and 15 aerospace companies. The legislation's backers hope to use experiences in the Gulf war to attract support. One of the Congressmen said: 'In the Gulf conflict, without Japanese parts for their radars, our F-16 pilots couldn't find their targets. Imports of Japanese machine-tools have become so crucial that the M1 Abrams Tank could not be built without them'. The proposed legislation would transfer control of CFIUS from the US Treasury to the commerce department. The Congressmen claimed a conflict of interests in the Treasury's dual mission of encouraging foreign purchases of Treasury bills and filtering out acquisitions that could harm US national security.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Free trade deal near between Turkey, Israel Ms Tansu Ciller, the prime minister of Turkey, said in Jerusalem at the weekend that a free trade agreement between Israel and Turkey, held up by opposition from the Israeli textile industry, would be signed before the end of the year. She said it would complement other bilateral agreements to prevent double taxation, guarantee and protect investments and to open up the capital markets of the two countries. During her two-day visit to Israel Mc Ciller discussed a range of multi-million projects in telecommunications, energy, water and military co-operation in construction of the F-16 Phantom fighter jet. In Gaza Ms Ciller promised to help finance Palestinian projects including the construction of housing, a port and international airport. Turkey has promised the Palestinian self-rule authority a Dollars 50m (Pounds 30.4m) package of project credits and a Dollars 2m grant. Ms Ciller's visit was marred, however, by political controversy after she visited Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem. The Israeli cabinet yesterday criticised the visit and the barring by Palestinian security men of Israeli bodyguards accompanying Ms Ciller. Palestinians claimed the visit had bolstered their claims to Jerusalem as the future capital of a Palestinian state. Ms Ciller's visit, the first to Israel by a prime minister of predominantly Moslem Turkey, is expected to strengthen growing economic ties between the two states and boost moves towards regional integration. Israeli tourism to Turkey has more than doubled this year. In the first nine months about 250,000 Israelis visited Turkey compared with 110,000 for the whole of 1993. Turkey, Israel and Egypt have joined together to promote tourism in the Eastern Mediterranean Tourist Association. The volume of trade has also increased from Dollars 93m in 1992 to Dollars 226m last year. Officials said Israel-Turkey trade had considerably expanded in the first nine months of 1994 although no figures were available. Ms Ciller signed agreements pledging Israel and Turkey to integration in a regional communications system based on fibre optics and to linking electricity grids. Ms Ciller also discussed a deal between the Turkish and Israeli defence industries worth several hundred million dollars for Israel to supply avionics for Turkey's F-16 production line. The two countries discussed a long-term project for Turkey to export its surplus water to the region which drains into the Mediterranean. Ms Ciller also said her government was firmly committed to the 'new Middle East' and a future Middle East common market, and pledged to participate in and finance the Middle East development bank agreed in Casablanca last week. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said Turkey could serve as a bridge between Israel and the Arab and Moslem world. In Cairo yesterday, where Ms Ciller continued her tour, Egyptian prime minister Atef Sedki said Egypt hoped to strengthen existing co-operation with Turkey and extend trade worth about Dollars 350m annually. He said oil and gas were the two main areas for increased co-operation.</p>

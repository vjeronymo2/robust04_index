			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York While last week ended as it had begun - with data pointing to stronger economic expansion than bond investors had expected (or wanted) - a degree of composure had crept back into the US government bond market. This week, with little new data, should give the market pause to regain its bearings after the frantic slide of the past fortnight. Friday's employment numbers (a greater-than-expected 217,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in February and a decline in the unemployment rate to 6.5 per cent (from 6.7 per cent the month before) seemed to provide ample opportunity for a sell-off. But the figures contained downward revisions in the January numbers and a modest 0.2 per cent increase in earnings. The bond market shrugged off persistent speculation that the Fed was on the verge of hiking rates again, this time possibly by 50 basis points, to recover its losses by the end of the day. After the pessimism of recent days, Friday's mood swing could set the tone for the first part of this week. The only events of note will be the publication of the Fed's Beige Book on Wednesday and February retail sales figures on Friday. If interest rate speculation abates, and the bond market can get to the end of the week without losing further ground, chalk it up as a minor victory.</p>

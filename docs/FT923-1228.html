			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Geest shares fall following warning on produce prices GEEST, the fresh produce and prepared foods group, reported pre-tax profits slightly ahead at Pounds 15.4m, compared with Pounds 15.1m, for the first half of 1992. However, a recent collapse in fresh produce prices led to a warning that full year profits may be less than the Pounds 26.2m achieved in 1991. The shares fell 36p to 302p. A bumper crop of fresh fruit, excluding bananas, from the northern hemisphere contributed to a dramatic fall in prices in July and August. Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said: 'It is very tough now but it is going to get worse.' Imports and consumer demand for bananas rose during the period ensuring that trading profits from the fresh fruit division edged up to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 11.3m). Prepared foods increased trading profits to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 3.22m). Mr Sugden said the group had identified 'growing niches' to withstand the recession. Earnings per share advanced to 15.3p (15.1p). The interim dividend is increased to 3.7p (3.6p). COMMENT The 9 per cent fall in Geest's share price had more to do with uncertainty surrounding the total European Community banana volumes than to the price deflation affecting fresh produce. However, the unprecedented 6 per cent decline in the volume of fresh produce underlines the seriousness of the problems over the next six months. Yet this should be put in prospective. If the short-term is not looking so good the long-term looks considerably better. Geest's penetration of the EC and dollar banana markets should enable it to increase its banana sales by 60 per cent next year when the quota of EC banana volumes is expected to fall by about 16 per cent to 3.3m tonnes. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m, giving earnings per share of 24.8p, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 12.1. In the long-term they offer good value.</p>

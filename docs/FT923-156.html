The recent rise in the dollar - the currency in which oil is traded - has produced an 'almost complete about-turn' in the fortunes of the North Sea oil industry, the bank's economists said. In August, output rose by 2.6 per cent to just under 1.9m barrels a day, but that was more than offset by a 3 per cent fall in oil prices to just under Dollars 20 a barrel and a 1.2 per cent weakening of the dollar-sterling exchange rate. However, August's production at today's prices would have been worth Pounds 2.5m a day more - at Pounds 21.7m - leading the bank to have a very positive view of likely output value in September and October. The possible strengthening of international oil prices this winter might increase output value even more. Many analysts are forecasting a tight oil market, with an increase in demand. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed earlier this month to freeze its output at its August level in the fourth quarter. Also, some forecasters are predicting an unusually cold winter, which would also push up oil prices.

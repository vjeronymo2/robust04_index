			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described more fully later in this preamble, under the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, wholesale or limited purpose banks would be subject to evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the new community development test rather than under the investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Service Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The December proposal would have evaluated an institution's CRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service performance primarily on the basis of the percentage of its branches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of branches that an institution would have been expected to have in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or readily accessible to low-and moderate-income geographies in each service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area would have depended, in part, on the number of such geographies in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service area. Under the December proposal, institutions would not have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to expand the size of their branching network or to operate branches at a loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies would have been able to adjust an institution's service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record upward or downward to reflect more accurately its branch service to lowor moderate-income geographies or individuals, but downward adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have been made only in exceptional cases. In determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness and degree of any adjustment, the agencies would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered: (1) the institution's record of opening and closing branches;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) whether branches_wherever located_were actually serving low- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income individuals; (3) any significant differences in the quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity or types of services offered to low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; and (4) similar factors. The agencies also could have adjusted an institution's rating upward to reflect a strong record of providing or supporting other services that promote credit availability for low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies. Particular weight would have been given to credit and home-ownership counseling, small and minority-owned business counseling, low-cost check-cashing, and low-cost deposit services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The service test contained in the revised proposal would change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service test contained in the December proposal in response to comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the agencies. In crafting the December proposal, the agencies were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guided by a belief that ready access to branches is a critical factor in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of credit and deposit services in a community. However, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banking industry representatives commented that the service test placed too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much emphasis on ``brick and mortar'' branches (i.e., permanent staffed banking facilities). The commenters noted that although branches are still valuable, present technology has made the need for branches less imperative to the provision of banking services. On the other hand, many consumer groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stressed that, despite changes in technology, brick and mortar branches continue to have symbolic and practical relevance to credit availability. A number of commenters emphasized, however, that evaluations based on the mere presence of brick and mortar facilities is not sufficient. Rather, the agencies must consider the actual services that are provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these comments, the agencies have decided to modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service test so that ``brick and mortar'' branches no longer would serve as the overwhelming factor in assessing an institution's service performance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although they still would receive prominent consideration. Under the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, equal weight would be given to the actual services provided to low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and moderate-income geographies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the revised proposal, the agencies would evaluate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's systems for delivering retail banking services (where the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``systems'' includes, among other things, branches, automated teller machines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ATMs), loan production offices, banking by telephone or computer, mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> branches, and bank-at-work or by-mail programs) by: (1) assessing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of the institution's branches and ATMs among low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (2) reviewing the institution's record of opening and closing branches and ATMs; (3) assessing the range of services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) evaluating the availability of alternative systems for delivering retail banking services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Our correspondent Mirjana  Rakic is on the phone from Vienna. Good evening, colleague  Rakic. We waited for 10 days. What has actually happened now?    [Rakic] Statements, that is, an agreement has been reached.  Nothing has been signed in Vienna. The signatures will be put  down only in Washington, as Charles Redman said, at the end of  this week, that is, around Friday the 18th--the date that was  mentioned yesterday.    The agreement on the draft constitution of the federation  has  been reached. This is an agreement in principle on the issues  which were not disputed in the beginning--a confederal union.  What remains to be solved now are details of measures in the  interim period, that is, from now until the establishment of the  future federation, which implies the parallel functioning of the  existing authorities and interim bodies until the constitutional  assembly and new elections are held. [passage omitted]    We have not been able to obtain the draft constitution which  has 52 pages. Charles Redman said that the draft will be ready  tomorrow because it simply needs to be printed. His statement  leads one to believe that a great compromise has been reached  because, according to him, both the president and the government  have great authority. We can see what is whose specific  competence only when we obtain the document. [passage omitted]</p>

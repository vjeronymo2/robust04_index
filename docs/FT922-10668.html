			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Arts: Monteverdi Vespers The Vespers of 1610 remain one of the most elating experiences music can offer. In Westminster Abbey on Tuesday I spent 100 minutes of rapturous absorption sucked into their unfolding as though I had never heard them before. Scholars advise that they are not to be thought of as a 'whole work', that the order of their component sequences is by no means fixed, and that the exact combination of performing forces must remain a matter of dispute and debate. Yet when one encounters a performance so filled with animation, exaltation and bounding vitality as that by the Collegium Musicum 90 and Westminster Singers under Richard Hickox, it becomes impossible not to succumb to the succession of movements as a totality. For the occasion Hickox had mapped out a path of wise moderation between the executive extremes that have marked recent fashions in putting on the Vespers - the sumptuous large-choral, large-instrumental feast on the one hand and the ascetic, single-instrument and choir-of-soloists meditation on the other. By employing a chamber choir, a band of period instruments and a team of eight soloists, the conductor ensured that both the private and public faces of Monteverdi's invention - the devotional pleadings and the splendid celebrations through corporate virtuosity - received their due. He took many of the movements at a speed which taxed the choir's agility while building up an exhilarating sense of forward movement. The Abbey is, of course, a wonderful place for the Vespers. When solo singers are planted at far ends of the building, or in the pulpit, or high above the choir stalls, a balance of space, intimacy and reverberance is achieved that allows the music to be at once awesome and intimate - 'personal' in the way that stamps, say, the 'Duo Seraphim' as one of the key expressions of Italian humanism in music. Among his group of soloists Hickox had found himself two tenors - Mark Tucker and Lynton Atkinson, young Englishmen both - whose vocal attack, colouring of tone and response to words proved blessedly free of the dreaded Anglo-Saxon good manners that in some circles pass for 'authenticity', and that continue to dog British revivals of Monteverdi. In the 'Duo Seraphim' the two duetted in a spirit of athletic competitiveness as well as of artistic comradeship. Mr Atkinson's outstandingly eloquent contribution to 'Audi coelum' was in the best way worthy of an Italian tenor's: openly engaged with the rhetoric of the musical expression, alive to emotional nuances. If only more modern Monteverdi singing showed a similar engagement with the italianita of the vocal writing] The Vespers, given under the auspices of Opera London Concerts in aid of Save the Children and other charities, will be repeated at Salisbury Cathedral on Saturday.</p>

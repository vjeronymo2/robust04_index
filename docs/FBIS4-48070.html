			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament today adopted a resolution at its resumed  sitting in Accra to extend the state of emergency in seven  districts of the Northern Region for one month. Moving for the  adoption of the resolution, the minister of the interior,  Colonel Osei-Wusu, said although the task force has largely  succeeded in disarming the warring factions, removing  roadblocks, and initiating resettlement [word indistinct] there  are still a few isolated attacks and counterattacks in the  conflict areas. He said the task force is determined that such  hostilities are reduced to the barest minimum within the coming  weeks. Col. Osei-Wusu said it is the government's intention  that the exploratory talks will resume in the next few days to  find the formula that will enable the state of emergency to be  revoked within the shortest possible time. He said it is the  expectation of government that the police will be in a position  to take over from the military.    Adopting the resolution, some MP's impressed upon the  minister to speed up a peaceful solution to the conflict so that  there will be no need for the extension of the state of  emergency at the end of the one-month period. It will be  recalled that the president declared the state of emergency in  seven districts of the Northern Region on 19 Febraury to enable  the government to contain the volatile situation in the conflict  areas.</p>

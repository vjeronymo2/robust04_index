			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Press watchdog chief confirmed Lord Wakeham, the former Conservative cabinet minister, has agreed to become the second chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the industry body that regulates standards in newspapers and magazines. The appointment of the former leader of the House of Lords, who was Baroness Thatcher's chief whip for five years, will be announced formally next week after talks with Lord McGregor, the present chairman, on the timing of his retirement. Lord McGregor, aged 73, is expected to go at the end of this year, although his contract does not run out until the end of 1995. He has had considerable success in protecting the concept of self-regulation in the face of demands for statutory intervention. The appointment of a former senior Conservative politician may appear surprising, in the light of the tension between press and government over recent sleaze allegations, but Lord Wakeham has been seen as a potentially moderating influence on those who favour statutory regulation. A promised bill on the press and privacy is now more than a year overdue amid considerable disagreements on what it should contain. There is a strong feeling in the newspaper industry that the committee has never been given full credit for what it has achieved.</p>

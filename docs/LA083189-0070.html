			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> NORTH VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P> <P> COACH: Myron Gibford, 10th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 1-8; 4th in league, 1-6  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The fact that junior Brandon Ruedy (6-0, 190), a  linebacker-tight end last season, is the team's quarterback should give some  indication that Gibford is trying to shake up things. "We had to find somebody  who could do the job," he said. "We were terrible last year." Senior Kyle Beck  (5-10, 150), who rushed for 136 yards as a reserve last year, is the best of a  good corps of running backs that also includes seniors Michael Hamilton (6-0,  160), a converted receiver; Kenya Smith (5-10, 165), a transfer from Kansas;  and juniors Mukasa Crowe (5-10, 160) and Rayna Stewart (5-9, 165), who will  come off the bench. "We're going to alternate," Gibford said. Junior tight end  Keyawn Murphy (5-10, 165) was the best receiver on last year's B team. Senior  Bobby Hayes (6-0, 240), who returns as center and team captain, is the only  experienced lineman. Senior linebacker Greg Garrison (6-1, 240) begins his  third varsity season. Senior defensive back Pat Minooei (5-8, 155), a transfer  from El Camino Real, is small, "but he is a hitter," Gibford said. Junior  Delvon Hardaway (5-11, 160) will play defensive back and wide receiver.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Chatsworth ranked 16th last season both offensively and defensively  among Valley-area City Section teams. Consequently, Gibford is stressing a  wide-open attack. "But it's going to be hard," he said. "(A record of) 6-3 is  going to be a great year for us. Granada Hills and San Fernando are loaded."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P> <P> COACH: Darryl Stroh, 5th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-3; tied for 1st in league, 6-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Stroh is up to his whistle in talented skill-position  players. "We're going to throw the ball a lot better than we did last year," he  said. Senior Chris Gadomski (175 attempts, 85 completions, 1,158 yards, 4  touchdowns) didn't fare too badly last season. If Gadomski doesn't measure up,  junior Brian Martin (6-2, 175), a transfer from Illinois, is ready. "It is  conceivable that he will start," Stroh said. "We're looking to start the best  player." Granada Hills has plenty of experience. Among the returning starters  are senior tailback-defensive back Leon Glasgow (5-9, 175, 372 yards rushing),  senior wide receivers William Moringlane (6-3, 210, 26 catches, 466 yards) and  Jermaine Love (6-0, 165, 8 catches, 106 yards, 1 touchdown) and senior guard  Terence Bito (6-1, 224). Junior running back Brett Washington (6-0, 215, 616  yards rushing), also a returning starter, probably is the team's fastest  player. Senior tight end Charles Carpenter (6-1, 185) moves from backup to a  starting role. Defensively, juniors Derrick Stewart (5-10, 185) and Robert  Haywood (6-1, 185, 4 interceptions) return in the secondary. Junior nose guard  Robert Kalinowski (6-0, 215) is the best prospect of a still-to-be-determined  line. The same goes for the offensive front. "That's really going to be our  area in question," Stroh said. Senior tackle Bart Barbuscia (6-1, 240) played  backup last year.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Highlanders are flooded with talent and experience on both sides  of the line. Stroh likens this year's crew of skill-position players to the  crop that fashioned a City Section 4-A Division championship two years ago.  "That's where the talent that we know of is," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kennedy  </P> <P> COACH: Bob Francola, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 7-5; 3rd in league, 4-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: All-conference tailback Ontiwaun Carter (5-11, 175), who  rushed for 1,190 yards and nine touchdowns and caught 13 passes for 184 yards  as a sophomore, is one of the best players in the Valley this fall. "He  electrified people as a 10th-grader," Francola said. "And he's bigger and  stronger." Senior wide receiver Jason Rosen (5-11, 165) caught nine touchdown  passes in the L. A. Games this summer. Senior Tony Vasquez (5-11, 170, 36  attempts, 12 completions, 216 yards, 2 touchdowns), who started at quarterback  the final three games of last year, will lead a run-and-shoot offense. Sizable  offensive linemen David Boghossian (6-2, 270) and John Jones (6-2, 275), both  are seniors and both bench press more than 350 pounds. Junior wing back-safety  Keith West (6-0, 175), an all-league soccer player, also will be the punter.  West had five interceptions last year. Senior Ryan McGrath (6-6, 220) will  start at wide receiver and middle linebacker. Junior defensive back Damon Tice  (6-0, 190) was the B team's hardest hitter last season. Sophomores Anthony  Jones (5-10, 160) and Alex Swasky (6-0, 205) are vying for starting positions  in the secondary.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Kennedy probably would be the best team in the West Valley League, the  North Valley's sister league. But competing in the same league with Granada  Hills and San Fernando is a tough lot. Still, with Carter, Kennedy is capable  of scoring against anyone from anywhere on the field. "If we can combine a  running and passing game, we'll be difficult to stop."  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Fernando  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Hernandez, 8th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-4; tied for 1st in league, 6-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Talent abounds offensively. Is there a better all-around high  school quarterback in the state than senior Michael Wynn (6-3, 205), the  leading passer among Valley City Section teams last year? Hernandez doesn't  think so. "He's definitely one of the best quarterbacks in the country," he  said. Wynn's statistics as a junior: 209 attempts, 108 completions (51.6%),  1,614 yards, 24 touchdowns. Wynn also rushed for 190 yards in 92 carries.  Senior tailback-defensive back Maurice McFarland (6-0, 205) rushed for 670  yards and five touchdowns last year. Senior fullback-linebacker Vincent Hall  (5-11, 190) also returns as a two-way starter. Seniors Johnny Carter (5-10, 160  pounds, 14 carries, 79 yards) and Will Taylor (5-11, 170), who rushed for more  than 1,600 yards with the B team last year, will not be sitting by idly.  "Basically," Hernandez said, "all these guys will be all over the place."  Offensive linemen John Ybarra (6-3, 250), a senior, and Rene Acosta (6-2, 245),  a junior, both played backup last year. Several players graduate to starting  roles in what Hernandez insists is an "improved" defense. Senior linebacker  Gilbert Quiroz (5-11, 210) was a second-team all-league selection last year.  Senior Lance Whitaker (6-8, 260) is new at defensive end. Senior Duane West  (5-11, 150) and junior Keith Woods (5-11, 160) move to full-time roles in the  secondary. Senior defensive tackles Victor Hernandez (6-1, 240) and Cornelius  Chisolm (6-0, 230) both return as starters. Senior linebacker Juan Ochoa (5-11,  210) transferred from Alemany during last season. Junior Jose Servin (5-10,  160) was an all-league kicker for the B team last year.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Depth and talent is a tough combination to beat. "We've got them in  every position," Hernandez said. "We just have a couple of questions where kids  have to come through." Certainly not where ballhandling is a prerequisite.  Wynn, a dangerous ballcarrier from the pocket, should emerge as the dominating  player in the conference.  </P></p>

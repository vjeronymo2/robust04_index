			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "Christian Democratic Center </F> Exultant: `There Are Plenty of Us'"]    [Text] Rome -- "People treated us like children, but we  gained percentages similar to those gained by the Italian  Popular Party [PPI]," Clemente Mastella said, with a smile.  "They told us that there were no more than four of us, but in  fact there are 44 of us," Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli said,  referring to the number of seats won by the Christian Democratic  Center [CCD]. Together with Pierferdinando Casini and Francesco  D'Onofrio, they made their appearance at the Jolly Hotel, the  headquarters of Forza Italia's allies; they thanked [Forza  Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who, with an act of "great  generosity," took them under his wing, and they celebrated their  success and at the same time [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli's  sad and lonely defeat.    They have won, but they remain obsessed with the PPI and  their former party comrades. Casini urged them to consider the  results, which "show that D'Onofrio was right to describe the  birth of the CCD and the PPI as the birth of twins. At the time  we were described as naive. I think that whoever said that must  now eat their words; perhaps they alone were naive."    The CCD savored the subtle pleasure of being able to say:  "Look, we were politically right; the election results have  confirmed our option." Casini said: "The DC's [Christian  Democratic Party] traditional centrality is over; in a bipolar  arrangement, people opted for the pole of freedoms." This  assertion was used to justify another blow to the PPI. "When  people at PPI headquarters still talk about votes for the  National Alliance as votes for the neo-fascists, it means that  the leadership has still not realized that those are former DC  votes. I hope that the PPI is now reappraising a line that was  strongly tilted to the Left, and that was therefore mistaken."    This, because, the CCD says, they are the real center -- the  liberal Catholics who opted to stand with Berlusconi in order to  prevent the likely victory of the Left. An unhealed wound  remains from the split over alliances, a rift that has not  closed at all, in view of the fact that Casini said: "Tomorrow  we will hold a meeting of our leadership to request membership  of the Christian Democratic International." The deputy for  Bologna gave to understand that he derives the right to do so  from the election result -- a right which Helmut Kohl and the  other European Christian democratic leaders cannot pretend not  to recognize.    Someone drew attention to a statement by Formigoni [PPI],  who  spoke about a reflection, a prompt decision by the PPI on what  political position to occupy, and a possible turn toward the  moderate Right. Mastella immediately opened the door to a  dialogue with the PPI: "I hope that they will be calm and free  of any preconceptions. Be that as it may, they must know that  it is not impossible to engage in discussions with us, and they  must keep it in mind after their initial period of mourning."    At the start Clemente Mastella said that he would speak out  only now after a lengthy silence. However, his silence did not  prevent him from being elected. Now he can say: "We took a  gamble, a gamble on a risky venture. We were treated like  children that might suffer erosion or the risk of lack of public  understanding; but the results confirm that we were something  more than a handful of children spread around Italy, and that we  enjoy a representativeness that is in some respects equal to  that of the Popular Party."    Mastella wanted to talk about the future too: "I realize  that this country needs to be governed," he said, identifying  Berlusconi as the next prime minister: "He has scored a clear  victory, and achieved a political miracle. To ignore this," he  said, "would be unjust, partly because he, more than anyone  else, believed in the building of this pole." However, he leads  us to understand that now it is necessary to move on from  electoral alliances to political and government alliances. He  stressed that there is no longer any "discrimination" against  the Right. Hence the need for "much more clearly defined  political convergences." This sounded like an appeal to  [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi: "If factors of  division were to prevail," Mastella said, "the election victory  could turn into a political defeat. We have taken on an  obligation to the voters, and we must find the way to honor it.  I say to the League that it must overcome its anxieties about  its allies in the south. Everyone now is agreed that the south  no longer needs a welfare policy."</p>

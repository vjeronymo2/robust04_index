			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Hundreds die in fight with Kurds MORE than 210 people were killed in a battle between Kurdish separatists and Turkish troops near the Iraqi-Turkish border, Reuter reports from Ankara. It was the bloodiest engagement since Kurds launched a guerrilla campaign for independence in 1984. Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel said 29 soldiers and 174 fighters of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) died in the 12-hour battle on Tuesday around Semdinli. Five civilians and three village guards also died. About 500 guerrillas took part in the fighting. Mr Demirel said the government did not know what to do about the Kurdish-based People's Labour Party (HEP), which has 18 seats in parliament, but which is accused of backing separatism. Turkey's state security court prosecutor has asked parliament to lift the immunity of HEP deputies against whom he wants to bring charges which can carry the death penalty. About 5,000 people have been killed in Turkey since the PKK began its war for independence in 1984.</p>

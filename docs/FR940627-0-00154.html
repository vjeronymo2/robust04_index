			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the Tier 2 testing program requires the exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of live laboratory animals to whole F/FA emissions. Rodent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species are required and rats are specifically recommended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animal facilities must be operated in compliance with the ``Guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (U.S. DHHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication (NIH) 86&hyph;23, 1985). To ensure the quality and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of test results, the performance of all studies will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to conform with good laboratory practice (GLP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. GLP standards specific to this rule are included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;79.60. As proposed in the NPRM, the GLP standards are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those published in 40 CFR part 792 (revised as of July 1, 1992)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for conducting tests under TSCA, with modifications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the specific goals of this rule. The GLP standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address facility, equipment, organization, quality assurance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel requirements, as well as specifications for proper care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of laboratory animals, handling of test substances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrumentation issues, conduct of studies, record keeping, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting of results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Exposure Route and Concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the exception of the Salmonella assay, the Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing program is based on the inhalation exposure of laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals to diluted whole emissions. Such studies require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure system designed to ensure the controlled generation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution, and delivery of F/FA emissions to the laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals for prolonged periods. Section VI describes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology for the generation of F/FA combustion and evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and the procedures to deliver the emissions to the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals. Requirements for hardware, maintenance, and the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission generation and inhalation systems are included in &sect;79.57  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and &sect;79.61 of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before testing the emissions of a particular fuel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive/base fuel mixture, a manufacturer must determine an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate range of exposure concentrations to be used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization of potential health effects. The objective is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to select exposure concentrations to determine a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration-response curve that may predict the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health risks associated with a particular exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concentrations should be spaced to produce test groups with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of toxic effects. In order to accomplish this, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that at least three concentration levels be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construct the concentration-response curve. These levels should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correspond to, at a minimum: (1) an overtly or highly toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration, (2) a concentration having an intermediate level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity, and (3) a minimally toxic or non-toxic level. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest concentration should result in toxic effects but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a level of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of the resulting data. The lowest concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should produce minimal or no observable toxic effects. If more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than one intermediate concentration level is used, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects. Due to the inherent toxicity of most vehicle emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it might be impossible to precisely select an exposure level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which results in no observable evidence of toxicity, or a no-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). Thus, EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring manufacturers to specifically achieve a NOAEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, EPA recommends that manufacturers use available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific approaches (e.g., range-finding test and extrapolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of data results) to design the study with reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration spacing so as to improve the probability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving a NOAEL. In recognition of the possibility that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest achievable exposure concentration (considering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting CO concentration) may also be non-toxic, provisions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made for ``limit tests,'' where appropriate. If a test at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest achievable concentration produces no observable toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect(s), then a full study using three concentration levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might not be necessary (see regulatory text for specific endpoint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Subchronic Inhalation Study and Endpoint Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described earlier, the Tier 2 health effects testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program includes a 90-day subchronic inhalation study and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ancillary assays/tests for the examination of specific health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects endpoints. Specific assays or analyses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity, and neurotoxicity may be conducted at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90-day study, coordinated with the 90-day exposure, or conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, EPA proposed a separate acute pulmonary test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., lung lavage assay) for the evaluation of pulmonary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity. However, the Tier 2 testing framework of this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule does not require a separate test for the assessment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulmonary effects because the 90-day subchronic study includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gross pathology and histopathology of the lungs and respiratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tract. Pulmonary effects in this final rule will be examined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the standard 90-day inhalation study. Positive results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the end of the exposure period for pulmonary toxicity will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated by abnormal gross or histopathological findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to appropriate control animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Subchronic Inhalation Study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subchronic inhalation study is designed to determine a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration-response relationship for potential toxic effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in rodents, resulting from exposure to vehicle/engine emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a period of 90 days. This test will provide valuable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on general systemic and target organ toxicity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including pulmonary effects. This information is considered an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential component for the assessment of potential health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards resulting from the exposure to F/FA emissions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure period of the subchronic study (i.e., 90 days) covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately one tenth of the life span for the recommended test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal species (i.e., rats). Although life-shortening or tumors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not likely to be observed within the 90 days of exposure, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subchronic study should be able to identify a wide variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific guidelines for the subchronic inhalation study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included in &sect;79.62 of this final rule. The subchronic study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that animals be observed and weighed during the exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. Ophthalmological examination, blood chemistry analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organ examination, and histopathology are basic requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 90-day protocol. Hematology and clinical biochemistry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations are required to be carried out after 30 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure and just prior to termination. Hematology analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clotting potential (e.g., clotting time, prothrombin time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thromboplastin time, or platelet count). Clinical biochemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing includes assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metabolism, and liver and kidney function. Other specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biochemical tests are described in the regulatory text of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN BECOMES FREE TICKET, NOT ANOTHER RYAN NO-HITTER  </P> <P> Although it was "Guaranteed No-Hitter Night" at Seattle, Nolan Ryan of the  Texas Rangers didn't come close to his seventh no-hitter.  </P> <P> Harold Reynolds beat out an infield hit to open the third inning Saturday night  and make sure all the fans who want them can turn in their ticket stubs for a  $4.50 general admission ticket to a Mariner game against the Angels in the  Kingdome.  </P> <P> The promotion lured 37,248, third largest of the season.  </P> <P> Ryan gave them a thrill by striking out five in the first two innings. But he  lost some of his zip in the third and the Texas Rangers were beaten, 5-0.  </P> <P> Before Ryan pitched his sixth no-hitter last Monday at Oakland, the Mariners  had already planned the special night. Ticket sales boomed, after the  43-year-old right-hander pitched his gem against the world champions.  </P> <P> Ryan, who needs six more victories to reach the 300-victory mark, gave up three  runs and four hits in five innings. He had nine strikeouts but five walks and  left trailing, 3-0.  </P> <P> Matt Young, who lost his no-hit bid in the second inning, pitched his best game  of the season. He held the Rangers to three hits and improved his record to  2-7. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECHY ON ROONEY  </P> <P> Novelist John Rechy discovered that Andy Rooney, after making his apologies on  CBS' "60 Minutes" for some loony remarks about gays and blacks, had sustained  more popularity than President Bush (Op-Ed Page, March 9). So, the USC lecturer  then set out to prove that Rooney was really a bigot after all, albeit a nice  one.  </P> <P> The current trend with such matters is that unless you hold solely to a  politically correct view on race, homosexuality, women's rights, etc., you  become open to yet another powerful victims lobby and in Rooney's case,  considerable persecution and nearly the loss of his job. It's thought control  and repression of the 1950s revisited, only this time perpetrated by many  college professors and universities. Rooney found out that the only way  subjects of race or homosexuality can be discussed is through bland inane  pieties that do little to advance knowledge or understanding.  </P> <P> Rechy makes some missteps of his own. For his purposes, he prefers that the  option, if you will, of deciding whether you are "straight" or homosexual is  much like deciding whether you're going to be a Republican or a Democrat. Then  he corrupts Rooney's positive affirmation of his culture and his life's  preferences that flow from that as a statement of bigotry with moral  equivalents about Nazis and white supremacists. How thoughtful! Rooney like  Rechy added little to the dialogue, but in this instance Rechy made victims of  us all.  </P> <P> BURTON FREEMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

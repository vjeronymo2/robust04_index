			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Technology: On the road to electronic pricing - Kieran Cooke looks at Singapore's ambitious efforts to curb its growing numbers of motorists Driving in many Asian cities is a nightmare. Car and motorbike sales in Bangkok are rising by 13 per cent a year compared with a 1 per cent annual increase in available road space. At times in the rainy season it can take office workers in the Thai capital six hours to get home. Schoolchildren regularly have to rise at 5am to be at school for an 8am start. The situation in many other capital cities in the region is not much better. The government in Singapore is the only administration in the region with a comprehensive traffic control and mass transit system. But even highly regulated Singapore has problems. Despite a tax and quota system which has made cars in Singapore among the world's most expensive - a car that would cost Dollars 11,000 (Pounds 6,700) in Britain costs nearly six times as much in the island republic - increasing affluence has encouraged more Singaporeans to be mobile. Now Singapore is in the process of implementing an ambitious electronic road pricing system (Erp). The aim is to make more efficient use of the island's limited road network (Singapore is only 42km long and 23km wide) and streamline existing labour-intensive systems. The charges levied under the Erp will also hopefully deter motorists from excessive use of their cars. Under the Erp system all vehicles using Singapore's roads will have an in-vehicle unit (IU) permanently fitted to the windscreen or handlebars. Each time the motorist uses the vehicle, a smartcard is inserted into the IU. The smartcard, also referred to as an electronic purse, is issued by local banks and can be used for other purposes, such as retail purchases. A display on the IU tells the motorist how much there is on the card. On various roads in Singapore motorists will pass through two overhead gantries, set 15m apart. Antenna on the first gantry will use microwave transmission to read the IU. As the vehicle passes, the IU will deduct the amount from the smartcard, then inform antenna on the second gantry that a deduction has been made. At the same time a photograph will be taken of the rear licence plate of the vehicle. If nothing is wrong, the photograph will be immediately overwritten. If the motorist has no IU, no smart card or insufficient funding on the card, the photograph and other details will be transmitted to a central control centre. Enforcement measures will then be taken. Norway already has a form of Erp in Oslo. The system is also being tried out in the US. 'What will make our system different is that the Erp will be used on multi-lane roads,' says Lew Yii Der of Singapore's national development authority, the organisation which has been responsible for satisfying the Erp's highly complex technical requirements. 'Existing systems funnel vehicles into a single track,' says Lew. 'Inevitably congestion results. But in our system vehicles will carry on as normal on a three-lane highway and will not have to slow down. The aim is to replace our manual system with an electronic one - and not create any further congestion.' At the moment Singapore operates a restricted zone round its central business district, marked by gantries at 33 entrance points. Motorists who enter the area have to buy tickets costing SDollars 3 (Pounds 1.30) per day for a private car. Police stationed at each entry point check that vehicles have their tickets displayed. Those who abuse the system face minimum fines of SDollars 70. The Erp will not only save on police labour. 'An important feature of the Erp is that it is flexible,' says Lew. 'Charge rates can be varied according to the prevaling congestion levels. Entry and exit information can also be stored so as to more accurately gauge charges for things like car parking or expressway toll ways.' Initially the Erp will duplicate the existing manual system. However, it is likely the system will later be extended to cover a greater part of Singapore's road network. Singapore's planners scoured the world for companies with technology to implement the many complex features of the Erp system. Three consortia, which include local companies and Japanese, Italian, British and Dutch groups, have been shortlisted. Singapore gave each consortia SDollars 1m to test their respective systems. A final decision on who will build the Erp will be made by the middle of next year. The full system is due to be operational by early 1998. The Singapore authorities admit that the Erp depends to a large extent on a law-abiding motoring public. If there was widespread abuse of the system, checking vehicles and fining thousands of errant motorists could turn into a full-time job for the police. The Erp might be workable in a highly regulated, confined island state such as Singapore. Hong Kong is also examining the system. But in countries with a more widespread road network implementation of the system could be problematical. Some worries have also been expressed that the system will encourage the 'Big Brother' syndrome, with the authorities able to track the movements of vehicles. Lew says that the perceived disadvantages of the system are outweighed by its positive points. 'Implementing the system is a considerable challenge. But we are committed. We are the guinea pigs. The rest of the world will be watching to see if we can make it work.'</p>

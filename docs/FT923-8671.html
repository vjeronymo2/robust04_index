			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / 'I know the people who burned my house and took me prisoner. They were my friends and neighbours' FOUR Moslem women arriving in Sarajevo yesterday spoke of gang rapes, beatings, looting and arson by Serbs, many of whom were their friends and neighbours before war engulfed Bosnia-Hercegovina, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Three of the women, aged 15-20, said they were among more than 100 women repeatedly gang-raped over seven days in late July and early August after being rounded up at a school in their home town, Rogatica. They said they were victims of a Serb 'ethnic cleansing' campaign to drive non-Serbs out of the town, where 12,000 Moslems once lived. 'I know the people who burned my house and stole my things and took me prisoner. They were my friends and neighbours,' Saida Ajanovic, 42, said. She said the Serbs sent her and her 20-year-old daughter Samira by bus to Sarajevo four days ago with about 300 other people held for a week at the school in Rogatica. Samira said she was taken from the school by armed men on the night of August 1, driven around with a knife at her throat for three hours and then taken to the flat of a Serbian neighbour she named. 'First he raped me and then the others came - two men I didn't know - and they raped me too,' she said. 'He is married, he has two children, but he did this terrible thing to me.' Samira said she was raped four nights out of the seven she was held at the school, always at gunpoint around midnight. Two of Samira's friends who arrived with her in Sarajevo also said they were gang-raped. Edina Zimic, aged 15, said she was taken by armed men from the school on July 30 and hauled to the headquarters of a local Serbian military commander. 'He asked me questions about where Bosnian units were around the town and wanted to know if I would take a Serbian name,' she said. 'Then he took me to a flat and raped me.' She said she was raped on two other nights during the week at the school, once by three Serbian men she knew. Edina's 17-year-old sister Elvira said she was gang-raped on three occasions, twice on the floor of the school and once in a flat where five Serbian men assaulted her. She said she was also made drunk on wine and then forced to sit on a mine. 'Now that we think about it we know there was no danger because the Chetniks (Serbian extremists) stayed in the room too. But at the time I was terrified,' she said. Saida Ajanovic, a widow whose husband died in the fighting, said all the young women held at the school, over 100 in all, were raped, including mothers with children. 'My cousin, Dzananovic Safa, died at the school,' she said. 'She was a diabetic but the Serbs would not let her take her medicine.' The four women said the Moslem section of Rogatica had been devastated, much of it by fire. They said they were robbed of gold and jewellery at gunpoint and their possessions looted. The only Moslems now left in the town were about 30 young men doing forced labour for the Serbs.</p>

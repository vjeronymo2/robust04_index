			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scapa at Pounds 23m amid pressure - Signs that overcapacity in paper industry is receding Scapa Group, the industrial materials company which mainly supplies paper makers, said yesterday that overcapacity in the paper industry was receding, but cautioned against over-optimism on prices. Pre-tax profits rose by 3.6 per cent to Pounds 23m (Pounds 22.2m) in the six months to September 30, on sales up 10 per cent to Pounds 205m (Pounds 187m). However, the group said that market pressures had reduced sales and profits from the paper side of its business. Mr Harry Tuley, chairman, said: 'The overcapacity situation which has been a feature of the paper-making industry in recent years appears to be coming to an end. Operating rates at paper mills are rising and output volumes are increasing at a faster rate than last year. 'The engineered fabrics division, which has continued to gain market share throughout the period, is in an excellent position to take advantage of the improving prospects. Current order books are strong and we are looking to the future with increasing optimism.' However, Mr Tuley added that the changing structure of the paper and board industry and the introduction of corporate and partnership sourcing for paper machine clothing would continue to keep the pressure on supplier prices. Because of these pressures, it was restructuring its engineered fabrics business outside of the UK. A reorganisation charge at the full-year stage is expected to be below Pounds 5m, but the group said the resulting improvement in profitability would produce an early payback. Considerable progress had been made in expanding the other businesses - such as speciality tapes and filtration products - which increased operating profits by 50 per cent over the period. The non-paper businesses now account for 32 per cent of operating profit, compared with 23 per cent at the same stage last year. Mr Tuley said the speciality tape business was performing particularly well. Synergy from French and Italian acquisitions was enhancing growth. Earnings grew marginally to 6.2p (6.1p), while the interim dividend rose to 1.7p (1.65p). COMMENT After four hard years, Scapa is at last seeing orders for new paper machines and some increases in prices for the rollers and fabrics which it supplies to papermakers. But the group stressed that the recent bounce in paper prices would not directly affect its profitability - not least because the long-term relationships which it has forged with the industry preclude making a quick killing as soon as the cycle turns. Although these figures were depressed by several one-off factors, the prospect is therefore of steady rather than spectacular profits growth. It is for this reason that Scapa wants to plough its cash into less capital-intensive areas such as speciality tapes and filtration. Disregarding the Pounds 5m restructuring charge, the shares  - down 6p yesterday at 200 1/2 p - are trading on a prospective market average multiple of 14.4, which seems fair.</p>

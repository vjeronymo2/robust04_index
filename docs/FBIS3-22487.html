The outbreak is a potential threat to the  multi-million-dollar poultry and ostrich export trade, if left  uncontrolled.    The Department of Veterinary Services has mounted roadblocks  on all roads out of Sengwe and Matibi Two and vehicles are being  searched to ensure they are not carrying chickens, chicken meat,  eggs or chicken cages.    Dr. Stuart Hargreaves, the director of veterinary services,  said in an interview yesterday that the outbreak, the first in  eight years, was reported on Christmas Eve and roadblocks were  mounted immediately.    A veterinary team, comprising 50 vaccinators, had been  deployed and had so far vaccinated over 70,000 chickens in the  communal areas.    The exercise is expected to be completed this week in the  most affected areas and could last for a month in the  surrounding areas, where surveillance had been intensified.    The outbreak is still confined to the estimated 200,000  village birds in the two districts which are very far from  commercial poultry production areas. Zimbabwe has an estimated  population of between 15 and 30 million village birds.    The disease is believed to have spread from South Africa,  which had reported large numbers of outbreaks recently. People  crossing into Zimbabwe, from Vendaland, which is adjacent to  Sengwe, could have brought chickens affected with the disease.    South Africa's Newcastle outbreak covered most of the  Transvaal in December last year, and later moved into parts of  the Orange Free State and Northern Natal, with some mortalities  in some incorrectly vaccinated flocks as high as 30 percent.    Large-scale poultry producers, due to these developments in  South Africa, had since formulated an effective monitoring  programme for day-old chick producers to enable them, if  necessary, to accurately assess the disease status of their  flocks and prevent the spread.

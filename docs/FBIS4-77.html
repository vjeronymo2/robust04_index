			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commonwealth says it is unlikely to send a  peacekeeping force to South Africa if civil unrest escalates  before and after next month's first all-race elections.  Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku said the  Commonwealth was not a peace-keeping organization. He said it  was only acting as a mediator to help strengthen democracy in  South Africa. The Commonwealth, a loose association of former  British colonies, has sent a mission of observers to South  Africa for the elections from the 26th to the 28th of next month.</p>

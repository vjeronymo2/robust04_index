			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace recession behind 35% contraction at JFB THE DEEP recession in the aerospace industry dealt a heavy blow to profits at Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering company which yesterday revealed a 35 per cent drop in interim profits from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 3.31m pre-tax. Mr David Hall, joint managing director, said the group had been forced to sustain 'constant pressure on margins to . . . maintain market share'. Operating profits at the Firth Rixson subsidiary, which relies mainly on aerospace customers for its rolled rings used in engines, collapsed from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 673,000 as a result. On a brighter note, Mr Hall said the group was beginning to see signs of life in aerospace. Mr George Hardie, joint managing director, said that orders in the second quarter had been better than the first and that trend was continuing. 'But it is a very shallow line, and we are not expecting a massive upsurge,' he added. During the year JFB sought to cut costs by reducing its workforce, mainly in Firth Rixson, by more than 10 per cent. The Pounds 250,000 redundancy costs had been taken out of profits in the first half. Sales for the six months to March 31 were marginally lower at Pounds 60.3m (Pounds 60.9m), but were buoyed by the inclusion for the full half year of Monroe Forgings in the US and Cobden Chadwick. Two further acquisitions were made during the half year at a cost of Pounds 3.5m. Benefits to the rest of the company of the Monroe acquisition, which opened the door to aerospace engine giants such as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, were not expected to come through for at least another 12 months, Mr Hall said. However, JFB was now for the first time included on the tender lists for orders from companies such as GE. Light engineering suffered a gentle decline from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.2m, cushioned by a series of small acquisitions, Mr Hardie said. Casting benefited from acquisitions to contribute Pounds 783,000 (Pounds 465,000). Capital expenditure was running at roughly double the Pounds 3.5m annual depreciation charge. Net cash balances totalled Pounds 12.5m. Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 1.6p; the interim dividend is maintained at 1p. JFB also announced the appointment of Mr Martin Llowarch the former British Steel chief executive, as deputy chairman. 'We are very pleased,' said Mr Hardie. 'We consider it quite a coup.'</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / People: Naylor bowls into MAM If James Naylor, the new chief executive of Chrysalis's MAM Leisure business, were to admit to making a mistake, it would be his decision to branch out on his own at the peak of the last economic upswing. Having helped organise the Pounds 37.5m (Dollars 71.6m) management buy-out of First Leisure from Trust House Forte in 1983 - First Leisure is now worth Pounds 450m - Naylor left in 1987 to set up Whitegate Leisure, a bowling alley and discotheque operator. Naylor's departure coincided with the downturn in leisure spending, Whitegate ran into serious financial difficulties, and Naylor resigned in January following policy differences. By contrast, his fellow joint managing director at First Leisure, John Conlan, stayed put and less than a year later took over as chief executive of what has become one of Britain's most successful leisure businesses. Naylor, 46, who has an MBA from New York's Columbia University, has spent nearly 20 years in the leisure business, including stints at Cunard and Thorn EMI. He says that his skills lie in 'taking a business that is a bit moribund and bringing a fresh approach to bear'. He takes over as chief executive from Peter Hazlerigg, a main board director who, in addition to his board responsibilities, will remain non-executive chairman of MAM which takes in Chrysalis's amusement machine business. ***** Robert Jeens, finance director of Kleinwort Benson Ltd, has been appointed group finance director of Kleinwort Benson. ***** Angus MacLennan has been promoted to general manager of the London branch of DEN DANSKE BANK. His predecessor Bo Jagd is to become managing director of DANISH SHIP FINANCE. ***** Charles Avis has been appointed md of LIBERTY EURO BROKERS. ***** Denyse Anderson and David Norris have been appointed directors of the LAW DEBENTURE TRUST CORPORATION.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Criteria for Amendments of Appendix I and II. The existing CITES listing criteria, known as the ``Berne Criteria,'' were developed at the first CITES Conference in 1976 in Berne, Switzerland. The move to revise them originated at COP8 in Japan. At COP8 the Parties agreed to start a process, coordinated by the Standing Committee, to develop a scientifically sound revision for consideration at COP9. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) was asked to do a first draft, which would be revised at a joint meeting of the CITES Standing, Animals, and Plants Committees, and put into CITES resolution form. The United States participated in the joint meeting in Brussels in September 1993, which reviewed the IUCN draft and produced a draft resolution that was circulated to the Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the September 1993 joint committee meeting, the Service received comments from 46 organizations and private individuals regarding the proposed revised listing criteria. After the September 1993 Standing Committee meeting, in response to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of November 18, 1993, the Service received comments from 18 organizations. The Service carefully reviewed and analyzed all comments received. Five organizations basically supported the new criteria. The Service received comments from 13 organizations that either opposed the new criteria, opposed parts of the new criteria, or recommended that the United States submit an alternative to the joint committee draft resolution. All comments were taken into consideration by the Service in formulating comments to the draft resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service submitted comments for the United States to the Standing Committee, after consultation with other Federal agencies and after reviewing the extensive public comments received. Comments received by the CITES Secretariat from other governments were also reviewed. The U.S. comments maintained that much of the draft resolution was not valid scientifically, and was not acceptable from conservation, management or practical perspectives. The United States believed that the criteria as proposed met neither the CITES treaty's requirements for the conservation of species in their ecosystems, nor the diverse needs of the CITES Parties. The U.S. comments and those of other Parties were discussed at the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee, in Geneva in March 1994. Some of the U.S. comments were taken into consideration in developing the final Standing Committee draft resolution. The final Standing Committee resolution was not available to the United States or other CITES Parties until after the June 10, 1994, deadline for submission of resolutions and proposals to the CITES Secretariat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standing Committee resolution contains six annexes, several of which the United States looks forward to discussing further with the CITES Parties at COP9. In particular, the United States believes the Standing Committee draft is an improvement on the Berne Criteria as regards precautionary measures. However, the United States believes that Annex 1 (Biological criteria for Appendix I) and Annex 2 (Criteria for inclusion of species in Appendix II) are in need of revision, particularly from a scientific perspective. The United States is particularly concerned about the utility and scientific validity of arbitrary numerical cutoffs for decision-making regarding the appendix within which a species should be included. After detailed review of the scientific literature and consultations with NMFS and other Federal agencies, the Service has submitted alternatives to these Annexes to the Secretariat, along with some additional material for inclusion in the resolution. With regard to the five comments referred to previously as supporting the joint committee's draft resolution, there was nothing in these comments that was inconsistent with the revised Annexes 1 and 2 submitted by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States could have waited to present these alternative Annexes 1 and 2 at COP9. However, the United States preferred to provide ample time for this review by the CITES Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Annex 1 lists a series of interdependent factors to be included in an assessment of the status of a species, and thereby the determination that it is threatened with extinction. The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex 2 (in accordance with Article II paragraph 2(a)), involve a determination of whether a species may become threatened with extinction, and in order to avoid utilization incompatible with its survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Standard nomenclature. This resolution was submitted at the request of the CITES Nomenclature Committee, and deals with nomenclature and taxonomy of CITES species. The resolution submitted was discussed and agreed upon by the Nomenclature Committee at its May 1994 meeting in Beijing, China. The Service is aware that the names of genera and species in several families are in need of standardization, and that the current lack of standard references with adequate information decreases the effectiveness of the implementation of CITES in conserving the many species that are listed in the Appendices. The Service also recognizes that the taxonomy used in the appendices to the Convention will be most useful to the Parties if standardized by nomenclatural references.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This resolution consolidates recommendations from several previous resolutions and clarifies or updates previous recommendations. The resolution discusses inclusion of subspecies in the Appendices, use of references in proposals, synonyms, other naming conventions, and the role of the Scientific Authorities in nomenclatural issues. The resolution also recommends several standard references for species listed in the CITES Appendices, i.e., for mammals, birds, amphibians, cacti, cycads, ferns, and other plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agenda Items Submitted by the United States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service submitted the following two items for inclusion in the COP9 agenda, but did not submit a resolution or discussion paper. The Service intends to submit a discussion paper on both items to the Secretariat, for transmission to the Parties, prior to the COP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Items Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Shark trade. There is information about a recent increase in international trade in shark parts and products, particularly in fins for the food market. However, there are insufficient biological and trade data on which to base a listing proposal at this time. Data on these species are difficult to obtain and will require the cooperation of all Parties and organizations interested in conserving these species. The Service believes that this is an important issue for the Parties to discuss. The Service is considering requesting that the Animals Committee assess methods for obtaining information on the biological and trade status of shark species in international trade, and providing advice to the Parties on possible approaches toward conservation efforts for these taxa. No international body is currently responsible for the management of shark species, including recommendations of catch quotas, minimum sizes, time and area closures, gear restriction, etc. By placing this item on the agenda for COP9, it is not the intent of the United States to propose that CITES take on this responsibility. However, because CITES is the international treaty responsible for trade in wildlife, it provides an ideal forum for the discussion of collection of data on this trade. The Service, in consultation with NMFS, will develop a background paper on this agenda item for submission before COP9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

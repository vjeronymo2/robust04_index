			<p>BFN     [Text] ASEAN has agreed on group cooperation in the areas  of telecommunications and transportation. An agreement was  reached at the meeting of ASEAN senior economic officials in  Indonesia on the setting up by ASEAN of a department to study  group cooperation in telecommunications and transportation; a  proposal on this is to be forwarded to the ministerial meeting  in Thailand around September. The project will be treated as  urgent. The meeting also agreed to have the Philippines study  the framework of ASEAN cooperation in the service sector.    Karun Kittisathaphon, deputy permanent secretary of the  Commerce Ministry, reported that the senior officials' meeting  in Indonesia on 6-8 June studied Thailand's proposal for group  cooperation in service trading. Although this does not mean  there is a need to open up markets for the service trade, the  cooperation will support and stimulate the implementation of the  ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA. Thailand's proposal was  accepted at the meeting, which assigned the Philippines to take  the lead in studying the framework of cooperation.    The meeting also agreed to conduct a survey on tariffs on  service goods in telecommunications and transportation in order  to contribute to the AFTA plan. Each country will appoint a  delegation to attend a meeting on this subject. A proposal will  be made to the ASEAN ministers' meeting for study after which it  will be forwarded to the ASEAN summit, which is scheduled to be  held in Bangkok early next year.    The deputy permanent secretary for commerce added that the  meeting of the senior officials in Indonesia reviewed the  implementation of the AFTA plan and proposed that efforts be  made to shorten the span of tariff reduction from 8 to 5 years  and also to include unprocessed farm products in the AFTA plan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad (APP) -- Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ahmad Ali said here Saturday that there was a total alienation  with Indian rule in occupied Kashmir and, the Kashmiri people  wanted only freedom.    Speaking on the topic "foreign policy agenda of Pakistan",  at  the round-table with the government organised by the economists  conferences, at a local hotel, he said, "it is our considered  opinion that India will not succeed in crushing the Kashmiri  freedom struggle".    "This is the lesson of history, even recent history", he  said, adding, "India is unlikely to be able to promote a viable  internal political process in Kashmir. There is total  alienation with Indian rule. The Kashmiri people want only  freedom, Azadi", he said.    Pakistan, he said, believed that United States and its  Western allies, as well as China, Russia and Japan, could play a  critical role in promoting peace and security in South Asia. He  said, the United States enjoyed considerable influence with both  India and Pakistan. "This can be used to convince New Delhi  that in the emerging era, the path to greatness does not lie  through the accumulation of arms or nuclear weapons or missile  capability but through economic and social progress and  modernisation", he stated.    He said, the past experience indicated that Pakistan and  India would be able to resolve their mutual disputes only with  the intercession of a third party. "Therefore, we welcome the  recent proposal of the United Stated to promote multilateral  talks on South Asian security. These talks will deal with the  inter-related problems of non-proliferation, conventional arms,  and development of weapons of mass destruction", he added. In  the emerging era of international relations Sardar Asif said,  Pakistan was faced with a series of challenges. But, it was also  offered a number of opportunities. "With wisdom, patience, hard  work and with the help of our friends, Pakistan can overcome the  challenges and seize the opportunities", he said.    Elaborating the challenges, he said, these were mostly the  legacy of the past of the colonial and cold-war eras.    Continuing, Sardar Asif said, "we are now entering into a  new  phase where Pakistan and the United States have agreed to  develop their relationship despite the Pressler law which both  governments have recognised as bad law and worse policy".    "A new cooperative engagement between Pakistan and the  United  States was agreed during the recent visit of the Deputy  Secretary of Sate Talbott to Islamabad", he said.    About Sino-Pak relations, he said, despite strategic  changes,  "these remain firm and unchangeable". "Both countries are  continuing to cooperate in a number of areas, encompassing  economic, commercial and defence. Chinese trade and economic  cooperation can in future be promoted through Pakistan with  other countries in Central Asia, West Asia and South Asia. If  peace can be established between Pakistan and India and in  Afghanistan, exciting possibilities could be created for  economic cooperation among the countries of these adjacent  regions. This would open massive markets and unleash enormous  potential for production and consumption", he maintained.    The emergence of independent states in Central Asia, he  said,  was a decisive and historic watershed.    "It ushered in a new era for a vast region stretching from  the Aral to the Arabian Sea. We rejoice at the return to  history and at the rich prospects of reviving our common  traditional and cultural heritage. But the fundamental fact is  that these newly-independent states are all landlocked. Their  future progress and prosperity will, in large measure, depend on  the exploitation of the shortest access to regions beyond. The  ending of their isolation has only heightened their quest for  alternative routes to the rest of the world. Central Asia needs  to sell its surplus energy including gas and oil to the  voracious markets in East Asia. We ourselves can benefit from  these resources. Pipelines to our coast can provide the most  economical route", he stated.    The shortest route to the sea for Central Asia is through  Pakistan, he said, adding: "We offer the most convenient  transit facilities for their exports to other markets. He said,  there existed the requisite road and railway systems that could  be extended to Central Asia. "Then, there are port facilities  we can share with them. In reverse, our port city of Karachi  has a vibrant commercial sector and can provide an ideal  launching pad for the commercial operations of multinationals in  Central Asia.    About Afghanistan, he said, it would always be vital to any  strategic access to Central Asia. "In Afghanistan, the fruits  of a heroic victory have been lost to parochial ambition.  Instability in Afghanistan has direct implications for  Pakistan, among other things, in the shape of drug smuggling and  banditry on our borders". Pakistan, he said, was engaged in an  active process of rebuilding peace in Afghanistan. "A durable  solution can only be achieved through compromise among the  Afghans themselves. "We hope to present some ideas to the  Afghan leaders in the near future", he said, adding, Pakistan  remained hopeful of success. [quotation marks as published]    "However, as in Kashmir, so also in Afghanistan there is an  opportunity waiting to be grasped within a crisis that requires  urgent solution. It should be remembered that there is relative  peace in many parts of Afghanistan. With some courage and  imagination, trade between Pakistan and Central Asia can be  commenced through the southern route traversing Kandhar and  Herat. New opportunities for trade, and more credible hope of  receiving international assistance, can help to convince Afghan  leaders that there is a greater premium in commerce than in  further fighting", he added.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ROAD TO MIAMI: SUPER BOWL XXIII;  </P> <P> MONTANA AGAIN IS A WINNER;  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK HAS BIG DAY; 49ERS ROUT VIKINGS, 34-9  </P> <P> A year after suffering his most painful pull outside of a dentist's office,  quarterback Joe Montana was removed from the starting lineup again Sunday, sent  to the bench with 8 minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Same place, same playoff opponent, same stakes. But hardly the same ol' Joe.  </P> <P> This time, the 32-year-old Montana left as conquering hero, having played a  game with the hunger of a man who hadn't thrown a playoff touchdown pass in 4  years.  </P> <P> In fact, Montana hadn't.  </P> <P> But those ghosts, along with others, were finally purged from the souls of the  San Francisco 49ers, who snapped a 3-year, first-game playoff losing streak  with a 34-9 win over the Minnesota Vikings to advance to next week's NFC title  game against the Chicago Bears.  </P> <P> Montana, who would throw his first postseason scoring pass since Super Bowl  XIX, played brilliantly early and made it stand up. Montana finished with  scoring passes of 2, 4 and 11 yards -- all to receiver Jerry Rice, all in the  first half.  </P> <P> A more complete reversal of last season's loss to the Vikings is difficult to  imagine.  </P> <P> It was here at Candlestick Park that Montana was breaded and deep fried in a  playoff loss a season ago, a humbling performance that led to his second-half  benching and the dawning of a new-age quarterback controversy with Steve Young.  </P> <P> Sunday, before a crowd of 61,848, Montana left the game only after his work was  done, his good name and a game's outcome having long been satisfied.  </P> <P> And it's not that the 49ers were sensitive about their little run of bad luck  in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "The past 3 years have been glorious years," Coach Bill Walsh said, responding  to a pointed question afterward. "I don't know where you're from. We've been to  the playoffs every year. We haven't won the Super Bowl in 4 years. People will  look at the negative side about that. But what other team has done more than we  have? We have no apologies for anyone."  </P> <P> Especially not after Sunday, when the 49ers reversed virtually every trend from  last season's Vikings loss.  </P> <P> None was more important than the elimination of Anthony Carter from the  Vikings' game plan. Last time, Carter cut through the 49er secondary for a  playoff-record 227 yards with 10 catches. Sunday, Carter did not have ball  thrown his direction in the first half.  </P> <P> He made his first catch with 13:21 left in the third quarter and finished with  3 catches for 45 yards. Viking quarterback Wade Wilson threw Carter's way just  5 times all day.  </P> <P> Cornerback Tim McKyer, who admitted he and the boys did a pretty nice  double-coverage blanket job on Carter, still couldn't believe the Vikings  didn't take a chance on their home-run king.  </P> <P> "I don't know what their game plan was," McKyer said. "But I know if I was the  coach, I would throw him the ball."  </P> <P> The 49ers, for example, don't seem to mind how many people are covering Rice.  Great receivers make great catches, they figure.  </P> <P> Carter, of course, has been through this before with his coaching staff and  wasn't pleased with his snubbing Sunday.  </P> <P> Viking Coach Jerry Burns said the 49ers' heavy pass rush and double coverage  took Carter out of the game.  </P> <P> "They didn't do anything differently," Burns snapped later. "They just did it a  hell of a lot better."  </P> <P> Carter basically said that Burns took him out of the game. And for Carter,  those lonely pass routes were tough pills to swallow.  </P> <P> Double coverage?  </P> <P> "That's not what I saw," he said. "I saw a lot of zone. They just didn't call  my number."  </P> <P> Today, Viking coaches can reach Carter at home.  </P> <P> It was true, though, the 49ers' defensive front put an excessive amount of heat  on Wilson, who sometimes had trouble getting the ball out of his own hand, let  alone to his receivers. Wilson was sacked 6 times on the day for minus-47  yards.  </P> <P> "Even if we didn't sack him today, we wanted to be in his face and get a hand  up," 49er defensive end Larry Roberts said. "By keeping a lot of pressure on  Wilson and playing AC (Carter) up tight, we knew we pretty much had them where  we wanted them."  </P> <P> And that, of course, was in trouble.  </P> <P> On the flip side, San Francisco's offensive line protected Montana well, much  better than last season when the Vikings sacked him 4 times. Sunday, Montana  was sacked once.  </P> <P> Against the likes of Keith Millard and Chris Doleman and the rest of  Minnesota's No. 1-ranked defense, that was big news.  </P> <P> "Our offensive line had a great day," Montana said.  </P> <P> Defensive tackle Millard, twice called for offsides, grew more frustrated as  the day wore on. After Roger Craig's 4-yard run put the 49ers up, 28-9, with  13:41 left, Millard sauntered over and took a shot at Montana's jaw.  </P> <P> Montana, certainly not foolish enough to exchange blows, instead wagged his  finger at Millard as he ran off the field. Millard, of course, wagged back.  </P> <P> "It was just the heat-of-the-moment-type thing," Montana said. "I was just  congratulating my offensive line and got an elbow across my face."  </P> <P> In the end, Millard's face was stained only with egg.  </P> <P> Montana, whose mobility this season has been hampered by various injuries,  seemed strong and sharp Sunday, especially in the first half, when he completed  11 of 14 passes for 111 yards.  </P> <P> Things might have been worse had the Vikings not squandered a nice 6-minute,  12-play drive on their opening drive, settling for a 47-yard Chuck Nelson field  goal. Minnesota's only lead of the day, 3-0, would last just minutes.  </P> <P> Montana drove the 49ers 48 yards late in the quarter before finding Rice open  for a 2-yard scoring pass.  </P> <P> Nine seconds later, 49er safety Ronnie Lott intercepted a Wilson pass intended  for Darrin Nelson, returning it 5 yards to the Minnesota 30.  </P> <P> A 21-yard reverse run by Rice took it down to the 9, setting up a 4-yard  touchdown pass play, Montana to Rice.  </P> <P> Late in the half, after the 49ers had driven 59 yards down to the 11, Montana  faked right and looked left to Rice, who froze Viking corner Reggie Rutland  with an inside move. Rice went outside. Touchdown and 21-3.  </P> <P> The Vikings only made a game of it twice. On their first possession of the  third quarter, they finally discovered Carter hit him twice on pass plays of 21  and 14 yards to set up a 5-yard scoring pass from Wilson to Hassan Jones.  Nelson missed the extra point, cutting the lead to 21-9.  </P> <P> The play that turned the game came with 2:26 left in the third quarter.  Rutland, anticipating a Montana pass to Rice in the left flat, cut in front of  the receiver at his own 40 and seemed in perfect position to make the  interception and take it 60 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> "We both had the ball in our hands," Rutland said, describing the play. "We  came down with it."  </P> <P> The ball, in fact, went past Rutland's fingertips into the hands of Rice, who  turned it into a 28-yard gain.  </P> <P> In last season's game, Rutland took a similar gamble and returned a Montana  interception 45 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> As Rutland would say, there were many things different about this game.  </P> <P> "It could have went either way," Rutland said. "In another situation, it might  have been different. I'd play it the same way each time. I'd just come down  with it each time."  </P> <P> Instead of a 21-16 game, Rice's catch set up the touchdown that put the 49ers  up, 28-9.  </P> <P> Roger Craig removed all comeback doubts when he turned a simple pitch into an  80-yard touchdown run with 9:04 left. It was the longest run of Craig's career  and the longest day in recent Viking memory.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, that run was by design," Walsh said of Craig's run. "It  broke like we had hoped. But after the first 5 yards, it was all Roger."  </P> <P> Craig, who had been mostly frustrated until his big run, finished with 135  yards in 21 carries.  </P> <P> Young replaced Montana with 7:46 remaining. Redemption was sweet, Montana would  say. And complete.  </P></p>

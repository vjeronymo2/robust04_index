			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wall Street bankers keep a wary eye on the Fed - Patrick Harverson analyses an unprecedented period of profitability for the US securities industry WINTER is approaching and New Yorkers, already worried about high levels of crime and unemployment, are just recovering from a dispiriting Mayoral election race. Yet, on Wall Street, the city's investment bankers and stock brokers are still striding out to work every day with a spring in their step. They have every reason to be confident. Results released in recent weeks showed that in the third quarter, US brokerage houses and investment banks maintained the record-breaking pace of profits growth they have set over the past two and a half years. Every big publicly-quoted securities firm reported growth in third-quarter earnings. On average, earnings rose by 63 per cent between July and September, well ahead of the average 24 per cent increase achieved by US corporations during the quarter. As in the previous 10 quarters, Wall Street's profits were fuelled chiefly by three factors Low short-term interest rates, which sustained high stock and bond prices and allowed firms to borrow cheaply and invest the money in higher-yielding assets, thus boosting net interest income and trading profits; Heavy corporate demand for securities underwriting services, which kept investment banking revenues buoyant; Strong interest among individual and institutional investors in the stock and bond markets, which translated into high brokerage commission revenues and asset management fees. A more recent development was also apparent in the latest earnings data  - the rising contribution from firms' mergers and acquisitions business. Over the past year the once-dormant domestic M&amp;A market has enjoyed a resurgence, and Wall Street firms have earned huge fees advising companies involved in billion-dollar transactions in the telecommunications, media, healthcare and banking industries. The result has been an unprecedented period of profitability for the securities industry. Yet, while it is well into its third year of record earnings, Wall Street is aware the good times cannot last for ever. The performance of the securities industry has always been tied closely to the fortunes of financial markets and the level of interest rates. When rates are low and markets strong, Wall Street prospers. When rates start rising, however, markets can stumble, and the industry's earnings can shrink quickly. The downturn in this cycle often hits Wall Street especially hard, because in the good times the industry has a tendency to lose control of its costs by paying its employees too generously and by hiring too many extra staff. This is what happened at the tail end of the 1980s, a period which culminated in the industry-wide losses of 1990. Today, however, Wall Street is in better shape to cope with any downturn in the industry's business cycle. For a start, firms have generally kept a tight rein on costs. Although employee compensation (the largest component of industry costs) has risen with profitability, management has adopted a more rigorous approach to pay policy. Bonuses are now more closely related to performance, and firms have been awarding a larger part of employee bonuses in the form of stock. As a result, compensation takes up less of firms' net revenues. At the end of June, compensation expenses accounted for 50.1 per cent of net revenues at New York Stock Exchange member firms. By comparison, at height of the last profits boom in 1987, compensation expenses took up some 56.5 per cent of net revenues. As Mr Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in New York, explains: 'The industry has taken great steps in controlling costs. Its cost structure this time around is in a much better shape than in the past. 'Employees are paid more like shareholders, and management has been very careful in adding staff during this cycle. The result has been a significant improvement in productivity and profitability,' he added. Keeping a lid on staffing levels has been particularly important. At the end of June, 228,600 people were employed by NYSE member firms, only 9.4 per cent more than were employed when the industry's employment cycle last hit bottom, in early 1991. Mr Flanagan says: 'The underlying theme to employment policy has been to let revenues develop before increasing staff and overheads accordingly. In the past, staffing and overhead expenses led revenues.' Yet, while cost management may have improved, Wall Street remains hostage to market-related cycles. This is in spite of the progress firms have made in developing businesses which provide a steady stream of cycle-proof revenues. Over the past five years, Wall Street has built up its asset management businesses in the hope that the recurring revenues they generated would smooth out the bumps in the industry's always volatile earnings stream. The contribution of asset management revenues to the industry's bottom line, however, remains dwarfed by revenues from investment banking, proprietary trading and brokerage commissions. Industry leader Merrill Lynch, for example, has made some of the biggest strides in asset management, yet earnings from the business still account for only 9 per cent of total net revenues (up from 7 per cent five years ago). By contrast, proprietary trading profits account for 29 per cent of total revenues (up from 22 per cent in 1988), commissions for 26 per cent (up from 23 per cent), and investment banking for 17 per cent (unchanged from 1988). The picture is much the same at other big securities houses. And, those firms which have mostly ignored asset management or other repeat revenue businesses, like Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, remain particularly vulnerable to market-related downturns. Witness Salomon's Dollars 173m loss on proprietary trading in this year's third quarter, a loss which dragged group profits down from Dollars 433m in the previous quarter to just Dollars 20m. With the US economy recently showing signs of renewed life, the danger for Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year to restrain future inflation. Higher interest rates would quickly translate into lower trading and net income revenues, and weaker financial markets, which would result in lower investment banking and commission revenues. If that happened, there would be little Wall Street firms could do but grin and bear it.  ---------------------------------------------------- US SECURITIES FIRMS EARNINGS (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------                           3rd qtr    3rd Qtr      Chg                              1993       1992        %  ---------------------------------------------------- Alex Brown                 15.228     11.126      +37 Bear Stearns              104.303     62.956      +66 Edwards (AG)               35.606     26.915      +32 Legg Mason                 11.360      6.844      +66 Merrill Lynch &amp; Co        359.687    228.689      +57 Morgan Stanley*           224.248    119.013      +88 PaineWebber Group          59.123     51.672      +14 Quick &amp; Reilly              9.947      5.211      +91 Raymond (James) Fin'l      14.562     10.197      +43 Salomon Inc                20.000      6.000     +233 Schwab (Charles)           22.200      7.800     +185  ---------------------------------------------------- Total                     876.264    536.423      +63  ---------------------------------------------------- *Morgan Stanley reported income for its fiscal second quarter (May-July)  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

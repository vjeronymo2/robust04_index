Ubaidullayev said four suspects of a murder of nine people  in  the village of Novobad near Dushanbe late at night on December  30 were arrested yesterday. He added that the suspects did not  conceal that they had committed the crime with the aim of  robbery.    Ubaidullayev also said that the motive for the murder of  Father Sergy, a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church in  Dushanbe on the same night, still remained unclear. The  investigating bodies were working on a number of likely  versions, the high official said.    The Tajik Interior Ministry announced a considerable  financial reward for information helping to solve the case.    On behalf of the republican government, Ubaidullayev  expressed condolences to the family and friends of the murdered.</p>

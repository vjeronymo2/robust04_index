			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Observer: Soulful In a TV interview last week William Waldegrave, new chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, expatiated on the friendly atmosphere and team spirit of the Major cabinet. 'People call it collegiate,' he said, 'but actually colleges aren't like that. I used to be on the governing body of one, and there was a lot of backbiting. . . .' The college in question was, of course, All Souls, Oxford, where Waldegrave did come in for some snide remarks from other fellows for his low attendance record, as political or business engagements often kept him away. Quite the least forgiving among his then colleagues, as it happens - going so far on one occasion as to call Waldegrave a 'pot-hunter' - was one Robert Jackson, now MP for Wantage and the junior minister in Waldegrave's new department.</p>

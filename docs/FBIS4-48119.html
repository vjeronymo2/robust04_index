			<p>BFN     [Text] Klerksdorp May 12 SAPA -- The African National  Congress' Western Transvaal region on Thursday [12 May] welcomed  the verdict handed down on six rightwingers sentenced to death  for the killing of four black people on the West Rand last year.    A statement issued on Thursday said: "Although the ANC is  opposed to capital punishment, we welcome the verdict handed  down by the court and hope that this will serve as a deterrent  to other rightwingers who were bent on creating havoc in this  province."</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kraft in talks on disposal of Birds Eye KRAFT General Foods, the US food products company, revealed yesterday it was considering the sale of its Birds Eye frozen vegetables and fruit business. The company, part of the Philip Morris group, said it was in negotiations with several parties over a possible disposal of the operation, which generated about Dollars 280m in sales in the year to September. Mr James Kitts, president of Kraft USA, said Birds Eye had 'significant sales potential'. 'However, we are evaluating various strategic options, and one of them is to sell the business,' he said. Kraft declined to identify the companies involved in the discussions, or to comment on the nature of the alternatives it was also considering. The move by Kraft to entertain offers for Birds Eye highlights the company's recent efforts to divest itself of its less-profitable grocery lines to concentrate on products such as breakfast cereals and refrigerated foods, which deliver higher operating margins and show more growth potential. The Birds Eye announcement comes just a month after Kraft agreed to sell its entire frozen dessert business to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, for an estimated Dollars 300m. The business, which included such well-known ice cream brands as Breyers and Sealtest, had about Dollars 500m in sales last year. The Birds Eye business has about a 15 per cent share of the Dollars 1.9bn US frozen vegetable and fruit market, according to Nielsen Market Research.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dakar, 19 Jun (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe today strongly commended Senegalese President Abdou Diouf  for having agreed to "involve himself in the French humanitarian  mission in Rwanda and provide Senegalese soldiers."  Reiterating "the excellent" nature of Franco-Senegalese  relations, the French minister, at the end of a 24-hour visit to  Senegal, added: "Senegal has given the example," hinting that  other African countries could take part in the French mission,  which, according to Mr. Juppe, could "take place next week." He  however refused to specify the number of Senegalese soldiers who  "will be operating alongside the French soldiers."    Authorized sources in Dakar have advanced the figure of 300.  Senegal has already agreed to provide 800 soldiers for the UN  Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda. During his visit, the  French foreign minister was received by President Diouf, Prime  Minister Habib Thiam, and his counterpart Moustapha Niasse. He  left Dakar late this morning for Paris.</p>

Attending the function  were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the Political Bureau and  secretary of the Hanoi party committee, and representatives of  the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare and  other concerned sectors.    In 1993, the Hanoi Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare  Agency patterned its action program after the city's political  tasks and 10 fundamental orientations. Thanks to well-defined  guidelines and positive steps, the agency gave advice to local  party committee echelons and administrative organs on ways to  ensure the positive implementation of labor, war invalid, and  social welfare policies. Satisfactory steps have been taken to  generate jobs. More than 20 billion dong has been drawn from  different public funds to create jobs for 33,500 unemployed  people. A total of 181 households with 345 working people have  been sent to various new economic zones.    Due effort has been made to look after the well-being of war  invalids and survivors of fallen combatants. Altogether, 91  houses have been built and 4,265 savings accounts have been  opened for distribution to families that rendered meritorious  service to the revolution. Furthermore, 560 seriously ill  soldiers and 60 parents with two or more children listed as  fallen combatants have undergone treatment or been admitted to  nursing homes. The agency has also made extra efforts to  educate and provide vocational training to drug addicts and  prostitutes.    In 1994, the agency will work out a program to eliminate  hunger and reduce poverty. It is expected that by 1995, no  family in the city will be affected by hunger.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Moscow, April 20 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat  called here Wednesday [20 April] for Russian leaders to press  Israel "not to waste time" in launching Palestinian self-rule  when they meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin next week.    'Arafat, at the end of a two-day visit, said that continued  "manoeuvering and marking time" by Israel in concluding the  Israeli-PLO autonomy deal would only "give a chance to all  extremist elements on both sides to undermine the peace process."    "The 13th of April, the final day to finalize the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho passed and nothing concrete  happened," he said during a press conference before his  departure.    He added that Israel "must bear responsibility in all  events"  and accused Rabin of stalling the peace negotiations on purpose.    "Rabin is not in a hurry because he has received from  America  the price of peace: all kinds of armaments, state of the art,  including 25 airplanes, the hugest and very sophisticated  computers, a garantee for a 10-million-dollar credit, all kinds  of financial, economic, political and diplomatic help," he said.    "This had been achieved before the implementation of the  accord."    'Arafat called for Russia as a co-sponsor of the Middle East  peace process along with the United States to press the Israeli  prime minister, when he visits Moscow next week, "not to waste  time."

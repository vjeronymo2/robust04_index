			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago attempts to put a price on pollution THE small and misunderstood sale of pollution rights by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Chicago Board of Trade last week was the latest step in the evolution of a market. Pricing pollution is no different from pricing bonds, according to Nobel laureate Professor Ronald Coase of the University of Chicago. His work on determining economic costs of social problems forms the basis of the EPA's market-based pollution reduction programme. 'People basically think they need something physical to trade. The point is you never, ever trade in physicals. You always only trade the rights to something. Once that's understood, it becomes much easier to see trading in intangibles,' Prof Coase says. He says the great advantage of a market-based system for allocating pollution is that it achieves a set level of pollution reduction at the lowest possible cost. Eventually, information from that market can become a valuable public-policy tool. 'Over the long run, it allows us to determine what the costs of pollution are, and will allow the EPA to balance better the costs and benefits of pollution control.' For industry, a secondary market for pollution permits would communicate the real costs of emissions, forcing producers to factor those costs into the price of their goods. Even environmentalists like the concept. They can use their dollars to buy pollution rights and retire them. The pollution permits scheme will falter, however, if a liquid secondary market does not develop soon. Only a handful of the permits have traded privately, and last week's auction also failed as a secondary market. All the permits sold had been donated by the EPA, not contributed by utility owners. The EPA is late in launching its on-line system for clearing secondary trades, forcing counterparties to construct expensive contracts. Regulatory and tax uncertainties also stifle the market. Some investment bankers say the needs of electric utilities are so diverse, that custom-tailored transactions are likely to win out over mass-market trading systems. This view conflicts with that of Mr Richard Sandor, a principal inventor of financial derivatives and now an advocate for a CBOT futures market in air pollution permits. He expects the pollution-rights market to mimic the architecture of the credit markets: screen and telephone-based cash trading; dynamic, customised off-exchange derivative trading, and an on-exchange futures market as the ultimate public pricing and risk-management vehicle. Mr Sandor is willing to be patient - like the bond markets, he expects pollution market synergies to take two decades to achieve. It may take longer. Nevertheless, Chicago's deep-pocketed trader-entrepreneurs have historically been willing to back applications of the latest pricing theories. The CBOT is starting a low-cost electronic bulletin board to highlight allowance bids and offers, and will hold periodic auctions to provide necessary spot market infrastructure. The CBOT has competition in this area, because other exchanges - floor and screen-based - also view pollution rights as a potentially lucrative new venture. Even if trading fails to blossom, the existence of the permits has provided an economic alternative to more expensive pollution abatement techniques. They have intrinsically brought down costs of environmental compliance. Regulators are already working to adapt the concept to other forms of pollution - including nitrogen oxide, a chemical precursor to the noxious air pollutant, ozone, and to some water pollutants. Prof Coase would like to see his ideas applied to broadcasting, where he advocates market-based allocation of radio frequencies and other common carriers. Prof Coase's theories are becoming increasingly popular, perhaps because of the growing realisation that the most plentiful of resources  - even air and water - are finite and thus have a determinable and defendable value.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army troops have withdrawn from Federal Police [PF]  buildings in Porto Alegre and Foz do Iguacu, but they are still  occupying PF facilities in Sao Paulo.    The order to withdraw from Foz do Iguacu came late in the  afternoon. The 180 Army soldiers who have been guarding the  Brazilian border with Paraguay for the past four days quickly  boarded their trucks and returned to barracks.    Army troops are still occupying the three PF buildings in  Sao  Paulo. Traffic remains closed and pedestrians have only limited  access to the area. Army sentries continue to monitor the area  from the roof of the main building.    Although Planalto Palace authorized the withdrawal of  troops,  the Army will not withdraw in Sao Paulo until it becomes certain  that the PF strikers will resume basic services. The Army  southeast regional commander will decide when to withdraw the  troops.    Complying with orders from President Itamar Franco, Justice  Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat will meet again tomorrow morning  with members of the Chamber of Deputies National Defense  Committee in an attempt to resume negotiations and end the PF  strike.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 18 May (TANJUG) -- Talks were held today  between Momir Bulatovic, Montenegrin president and member of the  Supreme Defense Council, and top Yugoslav Army officers. At the  talks, they concluded that officers and commands of the Yugoslav  Army have displayed a high degree of responsibility for the  overall combat readiness of their troops under very complex  circumstances.    As it has been announced, the commanders of the First,  Second, and Third Armies -- Generals Jevrem Cokic, Bozidar  Babic, and Dusan Samardzic respectively -- General Ljubisa  Velickovic, commander of the Air Force and anti-aircraft  defense, and Navy Commander Admiral Dojcilo Isakovic informed  Bulatovic about the level of combat readiness of the strategic  formations under their command, the implementation of measures  set by the Supreme Defense Council relating to the security of  the state territory under present conditions, further  transformation of the Yugoslav Army, and other issues.    Stable financing, in line with the capabilities of the  state,  will enable the speedier resolution of problems in supplying  units with state-of-the-art equipment and in securing better  living standards for the Yugoslav Army.</p>

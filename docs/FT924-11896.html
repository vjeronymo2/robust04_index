In the talks, he explored the possibility of adding 'a carrot', the sale of oil, to 'the stick' of the programme to eliminate Iraq's advanced weapons. Mr Ekeus said the UN oil embargo, introduced in August 1990, was costing Iraq an estimated Dollars 30m a day. Stressing that Baghdad was continuing to obstruct UN weapons inspectors, he said: 'We have to ask whether those weapons are so valuable that they (the Iraqis) are prepared to lose the oil income?'</p>

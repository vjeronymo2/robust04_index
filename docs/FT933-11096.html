			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Government 'would look at Fnac deal' MR EDMOND Alphandery, France's economy minister, yesterday said the government would examine the impact of a change of ownership at Fnac, France's largest books retailer. GMF, the mutual insurance group that owns Fnac, has announced plans to sell a 55 per cent controlling stake to Altus Finance, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Generale des Eaux, the utility and media concern. However, the prospective purchasers have only agreed to take an option on the stake and have until October to decide whether to exercise it. Mr Francois Pinault, head of the Pinault-Printemps retailing group, has also indicated an interest in Fnac. Mr Alphandery said the government 'would not shirk from examining the effect' of a change in Fnac's ownership 'whoever takes over the company'.</p>

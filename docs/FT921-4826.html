			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (4): Fees: the lesson is, start early - How parents can fund the heavy burden of charges LAST YEAR'S Budget recognised the difficulties families face in paying independent school fees. It produced two concessions - National Savings Children's Bonus Bonds, and Friendly Society Baby Bonds - which added to the opportunities to save tax-efficiently on behalf of children. These measures were overdue. School fees inflation over the last decade has consistently been around double the rate of increase of the retail prices index, and the FT's new survey gives no reason to expect this to change. Saving could be sustained while the economy was growing, but now parents are feeling the pinch. This can be seen particularly in the high rate of surrenders of the life assurance policies which are frequently used as savings vehicles to pre-pay for school fees. Anthony Murrell, director of the school fees consultant Fraser Marr, reports that his own company has seen as many surrenders in the last year as it had in the previous ten put together. The cause, he says, is rooted in the consumer boom of 1988. 'Just as people took out mortgages at cheap rates and now find they cannot afford them, so they also started commitments to pay for school fees plans. They are being abandoned as well.' The increase in fees has led to an improvement in the technology used to plan for their payment. Advanced software programs now include up-to-date records of the fees currently charged by all the independent schools in the country. You can then feed in different projected rates of inflation. Murrell suggests, in the light of school fees' ability to out-distance inflation, that you should project inflation of 10 per cent, even if you are confident that RPI will stay well below this. 'Baby bonds' allow you to save up to Pounds 18 per month on behalf of a child, with a friendly society. The fund in which it is invested pays no tax, and the lump sum when the bond matures (after at least ten years) is also untaxed. Several friendly societies have very competitive investment records, making this an attractive way to help save for school fees. National Savings Bonus Bonds are arguably even better, particularly for the risk-averse. They allow you to invest up to Pounds 1,000 on behalf of a child aged under 16 at the outset, and guarantee a compounded annual return after five years of 11.84 per cent. Programs can also recommend the amounts of money you will need to put into the various tax-efficient vehicles now on offer to meet your school fee requirements. If you have just started a family, and want to start out on the road to an independent education, you have a number of routes. Three basic sources of income are open to you: income, capital, or as a last resort, a loan. Paying out of income You will probably have to start when the children are very small. The standard life assurance route, rich in commission for advisers, means that you should start at least eight, and preferably ten years before the first fees need to be paid. This allows time to take out a 'qualifying' endowment policy, which attracts top-rate income tax relief on the lump sum payable at the end. The proceeds of the endowment then meet the fees, possibly after being put into an annuity. Endowments offer a sum 'guaranteed', and the life cover they provide is also helpful when planning for children. But they have the disadvantage of being inflexible. If you have difficulty keeping up the premiums on an endowment, Murrell suggests that surrender should be your last option. Options he lists include: Making the policy 'paid up' - you do not add to the money in the endowment, but wait for the amount you have already amassed to mature in the usual way. This can offer a decent return. Selling the policy to a marketmaker - this normally gives you a better rate than an insurance company surrender value, and is useful if you need cash quickly. Borrowing against the policy - many companies offer competitive loan rates of around 12 per cent. This allows you to complete the endowment, although it can drastically affect the maturity value. Taking a premium holiday - if you have chosen an office with a sufficiently flexible contract, this is probably the best option, provided you are confident your income will pick up again in the near future. A regular unit trust savings scheme, held in a Personal Equity Plan, would set you free from all these complexities. This is free of both income and capital gains tax (unlike an endowment), and is likely to produce superior growth. The case for using it, at least as a supplement to an endowment, is strong. Paying Out Of Capital This is an option only if you (or more likely your parents) happen to be wealthy. Capital schemes make most sense if started early, and take advantage of tax concessions for charities by paying into an educational trust. The trust must be made out in the name of one child, but can be paid out to any school at a month's notice, so it can accommodate moves between schools. The schemes certainly cannot be described as risky, as they use life assurance funds to grow to the fixed required level of fees. Once the lump sum has been paid, it should increase in value until the first fees have to be paid. Then the insurer will purchase an increasing annuity, which pays the fees each year. Royal Life and SFIA (the School Fees Insurance Agency) both offer these schemes, while similar plans are available from Equitable Life (complete with an ambitious range of annuities) and Save &amp; Prosper. All make life much easier by removing the hassle. Usually the insurers will write out the cheques to the schools, so you can pay your money while the child is infancy, and need literally never bother about school fees again. Using A Loan Scheme In the current climate this does not look appealing. But if you have made no prior plans it could be the only option. The Independent Schools Information Service offers a loan plan in conjunction with NatWest Bank, which lets you borrow new amounts for each term's fees, while interest of 2.5 percentage points above base rate accrues on the outstanding funds. You have to buy an endowment to ensure that the loan is ultimately repaid. This means that you part with more than the total amount of money the school receives, whereas with pre-planning, you pay less, in nominal terms at least, than is eventually paid to the school. Advisers - including John Bridel of Towry Law  - suggest that you could get a cheaper loan by remortgaging your house. As a rule, home-secured loans offer the cheapest credit. But the current repossessions crisis in the housing market should remind everyone of the health warning which must be pinned on such a scheme. Shop around before committing yourself to debt, and make sure the terms are an improvement on the Isis scheme.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE: GAUER POWER;  </P> <P> VINEYARD'S FIRST RELEASE IS A SILKY CHARDONNAY  </P> <P> WHEN I FIRST visited the Gauer Estate Vineyards last month in the mountainous  backdrop of the Alexander Valley in northern Sonoma County, two oft-heard  phrases came to mind: "Wine is made in the vineyard" and "the Chardonnay vine  is a tool for extracting flavor from the soil."  </P> <P> The particular soil at Gauer is volcanic, of a complex composition, and has  resulted in grapes that have led to gold-medal wines for several north coast  wineries. But Gauer, now intent upon extracting the wonders of the soil for its  own benefit, has produced a wine under its own label.  </P> <P> Gauer President Allan Hemphill, wine maker Kerry Damskey and I drove up from  the valley floor to the vineyards, which include the Pinnacle and the  Wellspring, both set at an elevation of 1,600 to 2,000 feet, and Monument  Vineyard, between 800 and 1,200 feet high.  </P> <P> From the ridge back of the Pinnacle Vineyard, we could trace the red volcanic  soil between the vine rows to a point where the rows descended to an  outcropping of gray basalt earth. From there, they went upward again to the  craggy Wellspring, then down to the Monument Vineyard, strewn with granite  boulders. The porous soil gives the roots ideal drainage. We were aware of the  natural air-conditioning system -- cool marine air being drawn in from the  Pacific, providing even-ripening weather. All the vines, which appeared  virtually manicured, are individually drip-system irrigated with natural spring  water.  </P> <P> "Our object," Hemphill said as we made our way down the mountainside, "is to  bottle the essence of these wonderful vineyards."  </P> <P> The vineyards, all part of the 5,000-acre Gauer Ranch, began with Ed Gauer, who  planted them in 1970. Now 86, Gauer maintains his home there, although he sold  the ranch in January to the Huntington Beach Co., a division of Chevron.  </P> <P> Vinwood Cellars, the wine-making facility on the valley floor, offers custom  crushing services for both small lots and major vineyards.  </P> <P> Inside, Damskey drew samples of an '88 Cabernet Sauvignon from Nevers  oak-barrel storage. Beyond the soft tannins were plummy tastes of potential  elegance. These samples were followed by an '88 Cabernet Franc, almost  green-peppery in taste. And finally a blend of these and 5% Merlot was tasted.  The blend is delightfully greater than the sum of the individual parts. It will  be released in 1992.  </P> <P> At lunch, I tasted the first released wine of the Gauer Estate Vineyard, the  1987 Alexander Valley Chardonnay ($16), the golden essence of those mountain  vineyards. Damskey vinified grapes from four vineyards separately. Eighty  percent of the final blending underwent malolactic fermentation, and the wine  was aged in two French oak barrels, Vosges and Nevers. The Chardonnay is  delicate. It has aromas of fruit and flowers and is silky soft.  </P> <P> This wine is an arresting California experience. Although it is one of the  newest entries in the Chardonnay derby, its California origins should be one of  our rightful sources of pride.  </P></p>

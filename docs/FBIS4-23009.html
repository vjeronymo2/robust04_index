Shalamay, Molecular Biology and Genetics Institute at the  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 547.963.32:466.057]    [Abstract] The use of phosphamide nucleopeptides for  simulating the protein-nucleic structure bonds and the use of  oligonucleopeptides (the prefix ``desoxy-'' is omitted in the  oligonucleopeptide (ONP) designation) as chemical probes,  markers, and affine agents prompted a search for highly  efficient and specific selective reagents for their synthesis.  In the authors' opinion, the redox condensing agent--a mixture  of triphenylphosphine (Ph[.sub]s[/]P) and  2,2'-dipyridylsulfide (Py[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]2[/])--which was  used for making oligonucleopeptide phosphamines meets these  requirements. An attempt is made to analyze the course of the  reaction and the formation of byproducts as well as outline the  bounds of redox condensing reagent (AVKR) applications for  producing oligonucleotidyl-(PN)-peptides. The source  materials and synthesis procedure in the presence of various  nucleophilic catalysts are discussed in detail. The study shows  that the reaction is especially sensitive to strong bases and  terminates in the their presence by forming a symmetric  pyrophosphate. The use of the redox condensing agent without the  catalyst makes it possible easily to phosphorylate the weak-base  amines while the catalyst retards the reaction with them and  facilitates it with more basic amines. The best results are  obtained with peptides whose pKa9. The findings confirm that  synthesis occurs with the formation of a phosphamide bond both  in the 3' and 5' oligonucleotide position. Both nucleophilic  catalysts and the basic properties of peptide amino groups as  well as the end phosphate position directly affect the course of  the reaction and the oligonucleopeptide and byproduct formation.

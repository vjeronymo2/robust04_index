			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / John Sculley's sorry foray Mr John Sculley, former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, has claimed he was duped into joining Spectrum Information Technologies, and has filed a suit against Spectrum's president, Mr Peter Caserta. Mr Sculley alleges that Mr Caserta's 'short-term goal was to reap huge profits by selling large blocks of Spectrum stock driven up in value by the public announcement that Sculley had joined the company'. Spectrum said Mr Sculley was 'fully aware' of the company's problems and had disregarded his responsibility to shareholders. Sculley's gem, Page 30</p>

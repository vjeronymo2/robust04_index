			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Chinese fund project boosts Shanghai A shares Activity eased on continued worries over the movement of the yen, and the Nikkei average closed marginally lower on selling by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index lost 46.71 to 19,852.37 after a high of 19,952.89 in the morning and a low of 19,830.57 in the afternoon. Some foreigners were seen selling export linked stocks and buying domestic demand related stocks. Volume was 180m shares against 238m. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 3.75 to 1,575.19 and the Nikkei 300 fell 0.93 to 288.00. Losers led gainers by 538 to 400 with 235 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.53 to 1,295.28. Investors were awaiting the listing of Japan Tobacco on Thursday. Although worries have receded about a wave of selling similar to that seen when East Japan Railway was listed last year traders said that price fluctuations in the stock would still affect investor confidence. Nikko Securities reported that the market was approaching a 'high risk zone' because of the high number of new equity issues which have been made amid the current low trading volumes. Japan Telecom, the benchmark for former state owned companies, fell Y50,000 to Y3.75bn. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y5,000 to Y890,000, while East Japan Railway was unchanged at Y483,000.

Tsumura, a Chinese herb medicine maker, failed to trade following last week's reports alleging that the company had been involved in fictitious deals to boost revenue. Although the company denied the reports, the stock closed at an offered price of Y1,120, down by its daily limit of Y200. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 45.03 to 22,096.91 in volume of 33m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y120 to Y5,180. Roundup Chinese initiatives moved equities in Hong Kong and, more obviously, on the mainland. The Shanghai Securities News quoted an official in the Securities Commission of the State Council as saying that urgent measures must be taken to stabilise share prices, and that one avenue would be to explore and establish stock investment funds 'as soon as possible.' In Hong Kong, meanwhile, sentiment was boosted by the Chinese negotiator, Guo Fengmin, who hoped that a financing arrangement could be worked out for the airport by early November. Wellington and Bangkok were closed for holidays, as well as Colombo on account of an island-wide curfew imposed after the assassination of Sri Lanka's opposition leader, Mr Gamini Dissanayake. HONG KONG's renewal of airport financing hopes took the Hang Seng index up from an intraday drop of 128 points to close 25.70 higher at 9,364.29. Guo told reporters that differences between the Chinese and British sides were now very small.

The fund project was first proposed by China's securities authorities at the end of July but was not mentioned again, triggering fears that Beijing might have changed its mind.

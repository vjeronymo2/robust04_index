			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Steadily doing it his own way - P V Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister who is visiting the UK next week, says India's economy is changing faster than at any time since he entered politics 25 years ago. But he believes the pro-market reforms he launched in mid-1991 should not be rushed, for fear of provoking potential enemies of liberalisation. The government must consider those who might be hurt by over-rapid change - workers in state-enterprises, bureaucrats and the poor. Sitting in his teak-panelled office dominated by a gold icon-like painting of Mahatma Gandhi, Mr Narasimha Rao speaks confidently and without notes. He emphasises his commitment to bringing the benefits of modernisation to the country's many villages, and argues there is now a consensus for change. For instance, 'the inhibition which some people had in accepting foreign investment has been reduced to a very considerable extent'. India needs a balanced approach to reform - what he has sometimes called 'the middle way'. Private investment, including foreign capital, is welcome but the large public sector also has a continuing role; workers at loss-making, overmanned plants might be made redundant but there should be no large-scale dismissals. The aim is to find a happy medium - and avoid political upsets. The prime minister's approach reflects the deep-rooted caution of a 72-year-old politician who has spent decades climbing the greasy pole and is now determined to keep his grip. He has recent experience of the fickleness of political fortune. Last summer, his government seemed on its last legs. Buffeted by the unrest which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque, by internal wrangling in the ruling Congress (I) party and by financial scandal, Mr Narasimha Rao survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence by the narrowest of margins. But in the autumn, electoral success in state-level polls in northern India restored his authority. Seen as a stop-gap when he took over from the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, he is now expected to lead his party at least until the next general election due by mid-1996. Already he has lasted longer than any other prime minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. As Mr Narasimha Rao himself says: '(Now) nobody is asking me political questions whether my government is going to last or not.' Despite his support for pro-market reforms, Mr Narasimha Rao still carries with him a fondness for the Nehruvian socialism with which he grew up. At one point in the interview, he says India needs 'massive doses of investment', including foreign investment. In a revealing flourish, he says: 'When I talk of foreign investment I don't necessarily mean foreign in the sense of a foreign country. What is outside the government is foreign.' Like Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, Mr Narasimha Rao believes strongly in India's right to determine its own future. Even though the country is opening up to international influence, India must be free to choose where it admits foreigners and where it does not. Foreigners are welcome to invest, especially in infrastructure, but not to involve themselves in culturally sensitive fields such as education. 'The World Bank is not going to build my schools for me. No foreign country is going to run my schools. I won't allow it.' The highest priority goes to developing infrastructure, otherwise bottlenecks will block growth. 'We want power. We want roads. We want massive expansion of ports,' says the prime minister. By attracting private investment into infrastructure, the government will be able to channel more of its own funds into health, education and rural projects. 'This is happening. In the next two or three years, people will actually see the change.' Mr Narasimha Rao says he has induced a sense of urgency into the bureaucracy to speed the implementation of reforms. But he warns potential investors that the administration has a pace of its own which cannot be rushed too much for fear of 'causing breakdowns' which would take time to put right. And few investors appreciate that India is a federation in which the central government has limited authority over the constituent states. 'I can only bless an investor with a cup of tea and say go ahead. Beyond that I cannot (act).' Mr Narasimha Rao says the recent annual budget fits squarely into the government's strategy. Ever the politician, he singles out for comment not the tax and customs duty cuts or the rise in public borrowing which grabbed the headlines in India's English-language press. Instead, he talks of what matters most in village India - large increases in rural public works spending. The fiscal deficit has jumped to an estimated 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product for the year ending this month, compared with a 4.7 per cent target. He admits his government is taking a risk to promote growth. 'We have had a long series of sittings on this. Whether we should take the risk. Finally we said yes.' However, labour market reforms and the management of India's bloated public sector are a rather different matter. The prime minister says that 'balance' is important in assessing the labour laws, which have been criticised by economists for the strict controls placed on employers' rights to dismiss workers. He believes the labour laws have not come in the way of investment. But the government must 'restructure the entire gamut of labour legislation' and this will 'take a little time'. Meanwhile, loss-making enterprises will be wound up where necessary and other jobs will be sought for the workers. 'So you find on both fronts - on the industrialists' side as well as the labour side - there is no complaint.' Radical change is unlikely. 'How can we hire and fire? Where does (the worker) go? This is not America. Another job is waiting for him. I just cannot do that. I have to see that he's re-employed . . . Those who are asking me these questions should also go into what kind of industrial climate I have here.' Mr Narasimha Rao also believes critics are paying 'disproportionate attention' to public sector reform. After all, there is already a large private sector in the Indian economy. 'Please exploit that first. Don't bother about what I do with my public sector . . . If it is sick, send it to the hospital. If it dies, it dies.' The prime minister suggests he might extend the present divestment programme under which up to 49 per cent of an enterprise can be sold off. 'In the course of time' this figure might rise, he says. But he also indicates his suspicion of large-scale privatisation. 'If some public sector unit is doing well, I don't see any reason why I should sell it . . . If I do it (disinvestment) immediately, I get into trouble. I get trouble from the workers. I get trouble from the political parties. I get trouble from the general public. Please understand that in this country the public sector has come to occupy a respectable place and I cannot afford to go against it.' Mr Narasimha Rao is optimistic about India's future, in part because of its huge reservoir of well-educated people. 'Our population may be large but the level of technological training is rich. So I don't see any difficulty in the rapid industrialisation of India.' He also talks enthusiastically about improving relations with Britain, including strengthening trade and investment links. He says: 'Relations between these two countries could have become bitter given the history . . . Some people used to ask me: 'How can you have any relations with those who were your masters, who exploited you?' I said history is something which we have to make. You can't avenge history. History is there. Making history. That's the only way.'</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Romanians take up privatisation offers ROMANIA'S National Privatisation Agency (NPA) distributed nearly 4.3m ownership certificates in June when the public began to register for their 30 per cent share of state equity, figures published yesterday indicate. The agency estimates 26 per cent of those eligible have already received the certificates, issued to Romanian adults on payment of a registration fee of 100 lei (17p). Mr Mircea Vierosanu, NPA director-general, said public demand for the certificates - the nearest thing to shares in Romania, which has no stock exchange - had exceeded expectation and proved privatisation in Romania was accelerating. However, he was surprised so many Romanians had already sold their certificates, and for such widely differing prices. In the Transylvanian town of Timisoara, a book of five vouchers, one in each of the public ownership funds, was selling for up to 100,000 lei (Pounds 170) while in the northern region of Moldova, the same book might fetch only 4,000 lei. He said a brokerage service would be set up at the Romanian Development Bank in the next 10 days in an attempt to unify prices. The NPA would also distribute 10m more leaflets explaining privatisation and urging the public to wait until the true value of the certificates is established.</p>

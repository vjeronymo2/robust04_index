			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Management: Of hats and heads - Moves to separate the top two jobs at UK companies John Thompson, director of UK equities investment at Standard Life, the insurance group, cites Lord Acton when explaining why he, as a shareholder, is pressing boards of directors to appoint separate chairmen and chief executives. ''Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' The principle is the same for businessmen as it is for politicians,' Thompson says. Corporate boards are apparently getting the message. Earlier this week, BAT Industries chairman and chief executive Sir Patrick Sheehy announced that he would shed his second hat with effect from April 1 in favour of Martin Broughton, currently managing director of the company's Eagle Star subsidiary. Similarly, Yorkshire-based housebuilder Persimmon announced that its chairman and chief executive, Duncan Davidson, will continue as an executive chairman but a new group chief executive is to be appointed. At British Airways, Lord King, who wore both hats, is expected to step down today as chairman, to be succeeded by Sir Colin Marshall. The board is not expected to appoint a new chief executive officer but Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry is likely to extend his responsibilities as non-executive deputy chairman. A post of managing director will also be created. Shareholders have been seeking a dilution of the chairman's power following the company's 'dirty tricks' against Virgin Atlantic and have been lobbying for Sir Michael to be appointed chairman. Institutions are apparently getting their concerns across to senior board members, according to Pensions Investment Research Consultants, a private group which advises pension funds on corporate governance issues. At the end of 1991, 63 per cent of all FTSE-100 companies had split the role of chairman and chief executive. By last week, that had risen to 73 per cent. 'I don't think companies have done it voluntarily in all cases,' said Stuart Bell, senior researcher at PIRC. Andrew Buxton, who last summer was anointed heir apparent to the roles of both chairman and CEO at Barclays Bank, has been forced to relinquish the latter role under pressure from institutional shareholders. Last year, British Petroleum was forced to split the two roles upon the unhappy departure of the man who wore both hats, Robert Horton. Still, there are several striking examples of chairmen who still do both jobs: Sir Allen Sheppard at Grand Metropolitan, Tony Greener at Guinness, Alan Sugar at Amstrad, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy at Kingfisher and Sir Richard Greenbury at Marks and Spencer. The 1992 report of the Cadbury Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance finally gave official blessing to the view that boards of directors operate best when the chairman and chief executive are two different people. Shareholder pressure for such a split had been some time in the making. More than 18 months ago, the Institutional Shareholders Committee recommended the split as best practice. But behind it lay shareholders' long memories of glamour stocks that had gone wrong. Shareholders point to the Burton Group under Sir Ralph Halpern, Brent Walker under George Walker, Polly Peck under Asil Nadir as reasons why a single forceful personality, no matter how talented, is likely to be a bad choice to wear both hats. 'I personally think the acid test is whether the board can actually say no to the person at the top,' said one member of the Cadbury Committee. 'If the answer is no, there is not the mutual respect necessary to run the company.' A strong and independent chief executive provides a rallying point for other directors who may sense that a company is losing its way and who wish to bring it back on course before any real damage is done. Indeed, shareholders say, the real issue is whether there are sufficient checks and balances within a board to stop an autocratic and misguided chairman heading down the wrong path. Paddy Linaker, chief executive of unit trust managers M&amp;G and chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, says the quality of board members is probably even more important than whether the roles of chairman and chief executive are combined. In the case of GrandMet, for instance, shareholders have probably not pressed as diligently for a split of the roles because of the perception that the non-executive directors are strong and independent. And at some other companies, Linaker said, the roles have been split, but the chief executive is no match for a charismatic chairman. 'You can have the Cadbury framework and weak people and that is no guarantee of success,' he said. But while there is considerable agreement among shareholders about the best way to structure board roles, many privately admit that they too often fail to make a strong case until a company is in trouble. 'A rising stock price is like a blindfold,' said one shareholder. PIRC's Bell noted that plunging dividends tend to concentrate shareholders' minds. Indeed, some of the most notable cases where boards have voted for separate chairmen and CEOs have occurred long after the company's woes were reflected in the share price. Linaker says that despite that, there are signs that institutions are changing. 'In the good old days, institutions didn't vote much.' But increasingly, institutions are exercising their proxy votes and signalling to management that board structure is an issue to which attention must be paid. 'We don't just wait until something goes wrong. It's the sort of thing we mention to managements whenever we see them,' he said.</p>

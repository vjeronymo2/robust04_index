			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and </F> European Commission President Jacques Delors at a dinner in the  Grande Bretagne Hotel in Athens--live; Papandreou speaks in  Greek followed by French translation; Delors speaks in French  followed by Greek translation]    [Text] [Papandreou] Ladies and Gentlemen Commissioners, we  are very pleased to welcome you to Greece and with your presence  inaugurate the third Greek Presidency. I believe this reflects  the very fruitful cooperation of past Greek Presidencies with  the European Commission. Together we have solved many problems.  I will not list them now but I will remind you of the joint  funds, the term cohesion and its meaning, and the Mediterranean  programs. These are not the only issues. We have worked  closely with common goals and we have succeeded. We hope this  Presidency will develop in the same way. Cooperating closely  with you, we will proceed to lay another foundation stone in  building the European Union [EU].    We are assuming the Presidency at a very difficult time for  the world, Europe in particular. There is major recession and  we cannot see its end on the horizon, at least not on the near  horizon. A large part of the workforce is unemployed. There is  recession and unemployment. We are called upon to deal with  these problems at a period when economy has become a universal  problem, when economic borders among states are collapsing fast  and technology is racing forward.    This is why the latest EU summit in Brussels, which approved  Jacques Delors' white paper, is a great historical step. For  the first time, employment--apart from the prominent monetary  and symbolic goals--becomes a primary issue for a united Europe,  focusing on reducing unemployment and increasing  competitiveness. Delors' contribution is great, leading us to  believe that the 1996 intergovernment conference will openly and  clearly include employment and development in the Maastricht  Treaty.    Indisputably, the two goals--competitiveness and  employment--are often contradictory. The measures that are  often adopted to increase competitiveness can harm employment.  I believe our own effort should focus on improving  competitiveness without reducing or losing the achievements of  the working class in Europe. When there is a contradiction, we  must consider that the workforce alone cannot pay for  competitiveness.    I close my short welcoming statement by saying it is a  special honor for us to host European Commission President  Delors, whose contribution to a united Europe's course remains  decisive. It is with great pleasure that I raise my glass to  you and your associates and wish you every success.    [Delors] Prime Minister, Dignitaries, Ladies and Gentlemen,  first, allow me to thank you for your most friendly and warm  welcome to me and my European Commission colleagues. I would  like to make a friendly statement to the Greek people, who are  full EU members, never mind what you may read here and there.  The European structure surely represents a very ambitious plan.  The European people show many differences and have special  characteristics. Europe is rich in differences and  characteristics. Prime Minister, we will cooperate with the  Greek Presidency and the Greek Government--as we did in the  past--to serve the goals you have set out.    The European structure has reached its 37th year. It is a  unique attempt to unite sovereign peoples who have chosen this  road without any of the members being sovereign or in charge and  is happening at a time that is free of the Cold War's  limitations or fears. Prime Minister, as you have stressed,  Europe is going through the worst recession since World War II.  Along with the other goals of the Maastricht Treaty, Europe  wants to give the European people the right and the dignity of  work, the right to employment. The European Commission  submitted and presented the white paper; no member is forced to  follow it closely. But the principle of assistance will be  implemented everywhere. Every member state will implement its  own rules keeping in mind the principle of assistance. Every  member state will be based on the strong points and try to  overcome any weaknesses. So, Prime Minister, I would like to  thank you and assure you that we will cooperate as effectively  as possible.    The world has changed. The world has moved faster than us.  But, thanks to recent efforts, we are now in the pleasant  position of watching the developing countries on the road to  prosperity. We see the South approaching the North's level of  prosperity and living conditions. But we must not let this go  unexploited. We must continue our efforts, because everyone  must deal with the fear and danger of decay. We must now deal  with problems caused by refusal to talk and by intolerance. As  you have very correctly stressed, Prime Minister, this economic  effort should lead us to new efforts. We must show even more  courage and anticipation. This spirit must prevail in all our  efforts. Greece's geopolitical position is particularly useful  in this. Because of you, Prime Minister, we can become more  familiar with today's Europe. I raise my glass and thank you  and Mrs. Papandreou and wish the Greek Presidency every success.</p>

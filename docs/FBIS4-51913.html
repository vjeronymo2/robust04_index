			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- Senior government and  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) officials are far from  impressed by Chong Chu-yong's announced intention to stay away  from management of the Hyundai Business Group, it was learned  Tuesday.    Chong announced his retirement from his group's management  Tuesday morning at a press conference held shortly before his  departure to Japan.    But since he said he would stay on as Hyundai's honorary  chairman and provide advice to the group if necessary, officials  at Chongwadae [presidential office], the presidential mansion,  and the DLP do not think Chong will actually withdraw from the  group's management.    A Chongwadae official, citing these reasons, called Chong's  press conference "of no avail."    In spite of Chong's proclaimed retirement, the strained  relations between the government and Hyundai caused by his quest  for the presidency and his allegedly illegal means of financing  his election campaign are expected to continue, according to the  officials.    Since the presidential election in December 1992, Hyundai  has  received no financial support for facility investment from the  Korea Development Bank and has not been allowed to open  subsidiaries or to register in the over-the-counter market.</p>

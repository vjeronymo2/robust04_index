			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sustainable pay rise, not minimum wage Sir, John Monks, secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, indicated in his letter (November 14) that the union movement is considering seriously its policy on a national minimum wage. We in government share Mr Monks's wish for there to be a sustainable increase in levels of pay. However, Mr Monks and his colleagues have failed to tell us how they would handle the implications of a minimum wage on differentials. Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, has already indicated that his union would oppose any squeeze on pay differentials. The unhappy experience of a minimum wage in Spain and France emphasises the need for pay to be determined between employers and workers in the light of their particular circumstances. This enables increases in pay and investment to be sustained through increased productivity. The only way to ensure sustainable increases in pay in the UK is to boost our economic competitiveness by achieving monetary and fiscal stability. One only has to look at the increase in productivity since 1979 to see that we have made progress in this field, but we must ensure that this progress continues. Our success with this policy can be illustrated by the fact that the real take-home pay of a single man in the bottom 10 per cent of the full-time wage distribution is 23 per cent higher than in 1979. Under the last Labour government, it fell by 1 per cent. Phillip Oppenheim, parliamentary under-secretary of state, Department of Employment, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NF</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pages of all affidavits and deposition transcripts would be required to have sequential numbers that would also serve as the record page numbers for the affidavits and transcripts in the party's record when it is filed under &sect;1.653. Likewise, the exhibits identified in the affidavits and deposition transcripts and any official records and printed publications served under &sect;1.682(a) would be required to have sequential numbers which would serve as the exhibit numbers when the exhibits are filed with the party's record. Affidavits and &sect;1.683(a) testimony would have to be accompanied by an index giving the name of each witness and the number of the page where the testimony of each witness begins. The exhibits would have to be accompanied by an index briefly describing the nature of each exhibit and giving the number of the page of affidavit or &sect;1.683(a) testimony where each exhibit identified in an affidavit or during an oral deposition is first identified and offered into evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An opponent who objects to the admissibility of any evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.682(b), 1.683(a) and 1.688(a) would have to file objections under &sect;&sect;1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) and 1.688(b) no later than the date set by the administrative patent judge for filing objections to affidavits under paragraph &sect;1.672(c). An opponent who fails to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under &sect;&sect;1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) would not be permitted to move under &sect;1.656(h) to suppress the evidence on that ground. If an opponent timely files an objection to evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.682(b), 1.683(a) or 1.688(a), the party may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and, in the case of objections to evidence filed under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.682(b) and 1.683(a), may also file supplemental official records and printed publications. No objection to the admissibility of supplemental evidence shall be made, except as provided by &sect;1.656(h). The page numbers of the supplemental affidavits would be sequentially numbered beginning with the number following the last page number of the testimony served under &sect;&sect;1.672(b), 1.683(a) and 1.688(a). Likewise, any additional exhibits identified in the supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records and printed publications would be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last number of the previously identified exhibits. After the time expires for filing objections and supplemental affidavits, or earlier when appropriate, the administrative patent judge would set a time within which any opponent may file a request to cross-examine an affiant on oral deposition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If any opponent requests cross-examination of an affiant, the party shall notice a deposition at a reasonable location within the United States under &sect;1.673(e) for the purpose of cross-examination. Any redirect and recross shall take place at the deposition. Within 45 days of the close of the period for taking cross-examination (&sect;1.678 is proposed to be amended to change the time for filing certified transcripts from 45 days to 30 days), the party would serve (but not file) a copy of each deposition transcript on each opponent together with copies of any additional documentary exhibits identified by a witness during a deposition. The pages of the transcripts served under this paragraph and the accompanying exhibits would be sequentially numbered in the manner discussed above. The deposition transcripts would be accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where cross-examination, redirect and recross of each witness begins, and an index of exhibits of the type specified in &sect;1.672(b). At this point in time, the opponent will have been served with all of the testimony that will appear in the party's record (with the same page numbers) as well as all of the documentary exhibits that will accompany the record (with the same exhibit numbers). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the proposed amendments to &sect;1.672 would require a party, during its testimony period, to file all affidavits on which it intends to rely at final hearing, it is proposed to delete as unnecessary paragraph (e) of &sect;1.671, which requires a party to give notice of intent to rely on an affidavit filed by that party during  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prosecution of an application or an affidavit under &sect;1.608 or 1.639(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Withdrawal of Previous Notices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the clarifying and housekeeping amendments proposed in part VI below originally appeared in the same or similar form in two previous notices of proposed rulemaking, which are hereby withdrawn: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) RIN: 0651&hyph;AA53_``Patent Interference Practice_Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,'' 57 Fed.

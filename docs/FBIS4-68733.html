			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Discussion with Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities </F> and regional policy, deputy prime minister, and leader of the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord, at the ROSSIYA editorial  office, recorded by Andrey Zhdankin; date not given: "I Am Not  About To Become Involved in Wrangling"]    [Text] Politicians are always better informed than  journalists. This applies also to Sergey Shakhray, minister for  nationalities and regional policy and deputy prime minister. He  is, in addition, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (PRES). Sergey Mikhaylovich met with the members of the  editorial office and shared his vision of the present  situation.    [Shakhray] The picture of the situation will be sufficiently  full and accurate if it is seen from three positions, three  levels: the state of society, then the problems and  contradictions of the economy, and, third, how economic  interests are superimposed on the political structure.    The period of diarchy: the unnatural "cohabitation" in the  constitution of two types of power, ended tragically with the  events of 3 and 4 October, which we consider an episode of civil  war. The state is attempting to "crawl out" of the consequences  and to find its feet. Society, however, does not have the  immunity to protect itself. The recent elections confirmed that  society is in a state of apathy. All the questions of power and  economics may be decided within the framework of the Sadovoy  Beltway.    Enough has been said about the fact that the economy is in  profound crisis. From my viewpoint, it resembles a layer cake  and consists of three levels linked by a system of communicating  vessels. The upper level is the legal economy, and concerning  this there are the basic data of the State Committee for  Statistics, forecasters use them, and the attempts to form the  budget are based on them. Below is the level of the shadow  economy, and lower still, the criminal economy. All attempts to  do anything at the legal level, to raise taxes, for example,  lead to capital flowing to the shadow and criminal "floors." The  legal sphere is being squeezed constantly, like shagreen leather.    The economic situation is being made worse by regional  disproportions. Only 22 components of the Federation "feed"  themselves, and the federal budget is sustained on what is  produced on these territories, and 67 components are subsidized.    The actions of the government, whoever is a part of it, will  for this reason consist of maintaining a balance between an  austere financial policy and social explosion. Neither the  communists nor the patriots nor the democrats (whoever calls  himself this) can any longer deny either private property or  land reform or attempts to transform the system of  administration of the government of the country. Both  territorially and politically.    [ROSSIYA] What should the government's priority measures be  in this situation?    [Shakhray] A set of measures to bring financial discipline  to  bear must be engendered in the government: a reduction in the  burden of arrears, the conveyance of funds to the addressees, a  fight against the existence of enterprises' parallel accounts.  It is necessary to prepare for a change in the tax system and  move toward a sharp reduction in the rate of tax. The sole  problem whose resolution no one is offering as yet is how to  live between point A (the moment when taxes are sharply reduced)  and point B (when, on account of this, there is a revitalization  of the economy, and the treasury receives the same or even more  funds).    Currently economics has become a hostage of politics. There  is no time for it at the federal level--an unconcealed power  struggle is under way. In politics and, through it, in economics  also everything is being determined by the struggle of three  politico-economic groups, elites.    [ROSSIYA] Which precisely?    [Shakhray] There are three determining sectors in our  economy: the fuel and energy complex, the military-industrial  complex, and the agrarian complex. The economic and political  interests of millions of citizens and thousands of enterprises  are tied up in these complexes. The reflection of this complex  combination of three sectors with regional structures in  Moscow's corridors of power signifies a complex configuration of  the capital's political elite. More than 70 percent of the  country's entire finance capital here is concentrated in Moscow,  which means the impossibility of the realization of a single  serious investment project in any region of Russia without the  attraction of these bank resources of Moscow.    [ROSSIYA] Things are more or less clear when it comes to the  elites. But what position should the authorities adopt in this  struggle?    [Shakhray] The role of the government, the president, and  parliament under such conditions is exceptionally big. They must  assimilate the functions of arbiter among these three main  groups and their representatives. Unless the Government of the  Russian Federation finds a format of ascertainment of the  interests of these complexes and ways of resolving the  contradictions among them, the situation will become complicated  and will periodically signify political cataclysms.    [ROSSIYA] As we all know, your party "distinguished" itself  by voting in the Duma for amnesty for the Lefortovo inmates.  Passions in this connection have not subsided even today.    [Shakhray] An analysis of the situation led us to conclude  that unless there was a change in the situation, society could  become an overheated steam boiler. It was for this reason that  the PRES Party consciously voted for the amnesty. Prior to the  amnesty, everything had been prepared for shooting in April-May:  an ultimatum to the president and resignation of the government,  up to and including the power version. The publication of  Version 1 was a trial balloon for the elimination of the entire  power Olympus for its replacement by a new administration. But  society gained a breathing-space. We have time until  September-October, I believe. All problems of the sharing of  power must be resolved at the 1996 elections. A shorter  timeframe would be an attempt to rush to divide up power without  the rules of the game having been agreed.    [ROSSIYA] Sergey Mikhaylovich, the problem of Chechnya is,  evidently, one of the most acute for Russia. The negotiations  are proceeding in very contradictory fashion, and there is no  way out of this situation in sight, it would seem. What is the  situation now?    [Shakhray] The sequence of the decisionmaking chain is this:  a message of the president, a decree of the government, acts of  the State Duma and the Federation Council. A common approach to  the Chechen problem for all organs of power has been observed in  accordance with this format for the first time.    The approach is built on a recognition of the impossibility  of a power solution of the question. Then, and primarily,  affirmation of the fact of multiple authority in Chechnya. This  demands the conclusion that a political settlement of the  conflict means negotiations with all real political forces: with  Dudayev and with Nadterechniy District and with the Provisional  Council and with the illegally dissolved Checheno-Ingush  Republic Supreme Soviet Presidium. The subject of the  consultations is a treaty on a delineation of authority and  terms of reference.    The negotiations should begin momentarily, their purpose  being the treaty. But signatures to it will only be appended  following free elections in Chechnya. If they are held this  year, very well, in 1995, certainly. We are not dictating or  determining the timeframe. At this time we, I allude to the  federal authorities, are prepared to discuss and tackle specific  issues. I, for example, am currently dealing with pensions for  the citizens of Chechnya.    [ROSSIYA] Could it be that this prudent path will not be  realized and that separate negotiations will begin once again?    [Shakhray] As long as I am working here, I will be  responsible for all negotiations. If there is a retreat from  this format, I will simply step aside because this would then be  deception.    [ROSSIYA] How do you evaluate the policy in respect to the  Cossacks, does it not look, rather, like flirting? Another state  committee for the Cossacks is being set up. A democratic  government is attempting to support a public organization whose  mission is the restoration of Russia within the 1914 borders,  which is not taken seriously.    [Shakhray] I know what is making this committee's ears  "stick  out." It is the manifestation of an amateurish approach, on the  other hand, the uncoordinated work of two departments--the  Executive Office of the President and the government. State  committees may be created only following a recommendation of the  prime minister and within the system of executive power. The  formation of the above committee by someone else is the promise  of a carrot, which will in a week or two be taken away.    It is particularly dangerous acting this way in respect to  the Cossacks. The Cossacks are 2.5 million people, and with  their families, more than 10 million. They are capable in almost  any part of Russia of putting together a detachment of 100,000  men within three days. This is a force which could be  unconstructive in certain situations.    The state should say that the debate as to whether the  Cossacks are a "people" or "not a people" is for scholars. The  Cossacks are interested in a state from the viewpoint of public  service. This is a particular type of public service, military,  border service primarily, included. The community is issued  land, and when the Cossack goes "to arms," the community works  the land for him and supports his family. Land legislation has  been drawn up on these matters here also.    [ROSSIYA] In order for the concept to become a guide to  action, not simply an interesting idea of Sergey Shakhray's,  should some documents be signed?    [Shakhray] The basic provisions of the concept of official  policy in respect to the Cossacks and the assignments pertaining  to the preparation of drafts of the corresponding prescriptive  enactments have already been signed by the prime minister. There  is a Security Council decision.    For me the revival of the Cossacks is a good opportunity for  the resolution (albeit partial) of a very serious geopolitical  problem. Thirty-two million persons reside here at this time  between the Urals and the Far East. According to the forecasts,  8-10 million will remain on this entire vast territory by the  year 2010. China, Japan, and Korea are looking in this  direction. No wars would be needed with such a development of  events, territories could "fall away" from Russia of their own  accord. If the Cossacks are implanted there along the border--if  they are given land free of charge, taxes for them are  abolished, and they are allowed to live and work the land--they  would thereby strengthen the borders.    [ROSSIYA] It is being rumored in the journalist fraternity  that your appointment as deputy prime minister was compensation,  a counterweight for the departure of Gaydar upstairs, and a new  rapprochement with the president?    [Shakhray] I do not regard Gaydar as an alternative to  myself. I believe that the dependence here is totally different.  We have to wait for the allocation of duties. Aside from  regional and nationalities policy, the government's interaction  with the media and parliament will, possibly, be entrusted to  me. I will not ultimately be entrusted with the press--it is too  important a sector--but I could perfectly well be entrusted with  exchanging abuse in the Duma. I am not about to become involved  in wrangling, for that matter, I am of a mind, like the  government as a whole, for constructive interaction.</p>

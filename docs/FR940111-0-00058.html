			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 179(a) does not define required activity. Rather, EPA believes this introductory phrase under section 179(a) refers to submittals required under part D of the Act. The four general categories of activities listed in section 179(a) are the four possible types of State failure with respect to the required activities under part D. The types of failure are not synonymous with required activities under the introductory language of section 179(a). Finally, the City of Chicago contends that the definition of ``required activity'' is too open-ended because of the language ``may include, but is not limited to.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA interprets the term ``required activity'' for purposes of section 110(m) in a manner similar to that for section 179(a); however, EPA recognizes that for section 110(m), ``required activity'' refers to any plan or plan item requirement under the Act, not just those required under part D. Finally, EPA agrees that the language ``may include, but is not limited to'' may provide broader authority than that granted under section 110(m). Therefore, EPA has changed the definition in the final rule to provide: ``The term `required activity' refers to the submission of a plan or plan item or the implementation of a plan or plan item under the Clean Air Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OCTA and the U.S. DOT request clarification of the term ``political subdivision.'' Both commenters appear concerned about whether EPA in making a determination of ``principal responsibility'' may consider less than the entire nonattainment area. The OCTA notes that California has several regional authorities that each are composed of numerous local jurisdictions. These local jurisdictions often have the responsibility for ``adopting and implementing air pollution controls.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``political subdivision'' set forth in &sect;52.30(a)(1) includes all types of governmental entities, including local jurisdictions. The EPA could sanction less than an entire nonattainment area based on a determination that a local jurisdiction was principally responsible for the deficiency on which the sanction is based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OCTA comments that the proposed rule should include a definition of ``plan item.'' The OCTA notes that section 110(m) reads in part ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the Administrator). *&blank;*&blank;*'' The OCTA cites the example of the California SIP, which is partially composed of regional plans. Some regional plans require local jurisdictions to take certain actions, which to the commenter appear to be plan items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed earlier, to make this clearer, EPA replaces the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' under &sect;52.30(a)(2) with the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' Although EPA interpreted the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' to essentially mean the same as the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' this replacement is more consistent with the language of section 110(m) which refers to ``plan or plan item.'' ``Plan and plan item'' are also defined under &sect;52.30(a)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Comments on Policy Stated In Preamble to Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Choice of Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Texas DOT, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC) asked EPA to identify which sanction will be applied for various types of SIP deficiencies. These commenters all state that the sanction should be tied to the underlying deficiency. For example, the commenters state that highway sanctions should only be applied when there is a SIP deficiency relative to mobile sources and the offset sanction where the deficiency is relative to stationary sources. The CMA recommends adding extra language to the rule as follows: ``The EPA will assess the nature of the deficiencies and take this into account when determining which sanction to apply.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIRPC further asserts that only those projects which have the potential for increasing emissions should be targeted; withholding highway funds which may correct a problem is inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The type of sanction to be applied and the selection procedure are not part of this rulemaking. Sanction determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis. The EPA will go through notice-and-comment rulemaking on selection and imposition of sanctions under section 110(m). The notice will propose for comment which sanctions or sanction will be applied. In addition, the Act sets forth those projects exempted from the highway funding restrictions. The EPA will act consistently with the requirements of the Act in imposing the highway funding restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Impact of Rule on Title 23 Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The American Public Transit Association is concerned about how EPA's sanction determination process could affect the process and procedures of transferring flexible funds (i.e., certain title 23 program funds) from highway to transit purposes. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority requests clarification of how any imposed restrictions on highway funds would affect funds previously flexed to transit as provided for in the ISTEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

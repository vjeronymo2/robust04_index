			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Slower rise in German inflation rate forecast THE underlying rate of west German inflation will slow 'relatively quickly' as a result of this year's moderate pay settlements, according to a leading Bundesbank official. At more than 4 per cent, the current rate of prices growth was still 'worrying', Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's directorate said yesterday. But he made clear that the worries were not great enough to affect the bank's policy of cautiously reducing interest rates, which continued last week with the third cut so far this year. Inflation was a lagging indicator, he noted, and as such was not suitable on its own as a guide for monetary policy. The internationally important discount rate, the effective floor for money market rates, is now 7.25 per cent compared with its most recent peak of 8.75 per cent, reached in mid-1992. Mr Issing's comments, which coincided with preliminary April figures from four key states showing regional consumer price indices still rising by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent annually, indicated that the bank is for the present satisfied that the main controllable source of inflation has been effectively dammed. Pay deals averaging 3.5 per cent represented a marked reduction after rises of 7 per cent in 1991 and nearly 6 per cent last year, Mr Issing said. Commenting on a value-added tax increase in January which generated an unwelcome surge in inflation, he said tax rises did not stem solely from the authorities' need for revenue. They were also a consequence of high wage awards in the public sector. The braking effects of wage restraint on inflation were not felt immediately, but basic developments were going in the right direction, Mr Issing said. According to most estimates, annual inflation rate will be down to 3.5 per cent by this year's final quarter, by which time the Bundesbank is expected to have cut its discount rate to around 6 per cent. A severe housing shortage is maintaining upward pressure on rents, which account for 18 per cent of the basket of goods and services included in German inflation figures. However, recession and falling demand - the federal consumer confidence index fell to a record low of 75.5 per cent in March - leave manufacturers and retailers little scope for price increases.</p>

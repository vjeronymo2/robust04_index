This is reported  by the Political Department of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna's defense ministry. [passage omitted]    At a news conference today, Jadranko Prlic, the prime  minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, reiterated the  demands contained in the Croatian Government's letter on the  overall reassessment of relations with the Muslim leadership in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He justified this by saying that  Izetbegovic is continuing the Muslim offensive against the  Croat-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He stressed that the Muslim leadership has stolen from the  other two peoples everything that made Bosnia-Herzegovina an  internationally recognized state. All Bosnia-Herzegovina  consulates in the world are purely Muslim. Mr. Prlic cited the  example of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb,  where all 127 employees are of Muslim nationality. The world is  beginning to realize that Izetbegovic is an aggressor, not a  victim. Is the evacuation of Croats from central Bosnia being  planned, a foreign correspondent asked Mr. Prlic. The reply was  emphatic:    [Begin Prlic recording] As I said in my introductory  address,  we shall defend those regions at any cost. Vitez, Busovaca,  Novi Travnik, part of the Travnik municipality -- the  Owen-Stoltenberg plan envisages these areas as a constituent  part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Therefore, we will  do all we can to defend these areas. [end recording]    We had to pay a bloody price for our alliance with the  Muslims, but despite everything, we are ready to negotiate with  both the Muslims and the Serbs. The international boundaries of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly defined, while the internal  ones depend on how large an area can be defended, Jadranko Prlic  pointed out.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (9): Currency crossfire - Exports stumble after five years of growth This has been a dismal, and atypical, year for Danish exporters. Since a squeeze was put on domestic demand in 1986, exports have shown exemplary growth, increasing by 5 - 6 per cent a year until this year, when they have fallen by about seven per cent in value and 4 - 5 per cent in volume terms. The Danes were suddenly rendered uncompetitive in some of their main markets by devaluations last year by European countries accounting in all for about 36 per cent of the country's merchandise exports. At the same time, the German market, which accounts for about 24 per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports, went into recession. The Swedish krona has depreciated by 26 per cent against the Danish krone over the past year. Sweden accounted in 1992 for 10.6 per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports. In the first half of this year exports to Sweden fell by 16 per cent. Exports to the UK, accounting for about nine per cent of 1992 exports, were down by 18 per cent, although sterling has recovered most of its value against the krone since the autumn of 1992. The trade-weighted value of the krone this winter is back to the level of summer 1992, before the European Monetary System was rocked by currency speculation, but the statistical average is small consolation for those who export to Sweden or compete with her in third markets. However, voices calling for devaluation have been few and far between and they received no support from the leading business organisations or from either the government or the opposition. Denmark spent a decade after 1982, when a Conservative-led government took office after a long period of Social Democratic domination, proving that it is committed to low inflation and a stable currency. When the European Monetary System to all intents and purposes collapsed in August this year, the government sought to avoid a significant depreciation of the krone. The Central Bank maintained the average value of the krone unchanged against the Ecu, and after an initial weakening against the D-mark, with the exchange rate going from DKr3.88 to 4.14, the krone has strengthened again recently to a rate of around DKr3.96. Danish exports are geographically concentrated on neighbouring markets, with some 75 per cent going to EC and Efta countries. In products terms, manufactures are about 75 per cent of merchandise exports and agricultural exports for about 18 per cent. But the food industry is more important than figures suggest. With fish, processed fish products, sugar, and machinery, equipment and other inputs for the food industry (and not forgetting farmed mink pelts, where Denmark is a world leader), the total food and agricultural sector accounts for well over a quarter of the country's exports. The EU's agricultural policy reforms and the Gatt reforms (not yet agreed, of course) will hit agriculture hard, cutting the value of agricultural production by about 10 per cent, according to Danish government calculations. Dairy exports will be hit especially badly, but pigmeat is one of the products which will suffer least from the reforms, which is a Danish advantage: pigmeat accounts for about eight per cent of total exports and 45 per cent of agricultural exports. Despite the troubled future for agriculture in the medium term, there is no inclination on the part of the government or the agro-industrial sector itself to write off the agricultural and food industries. On the contrary, a report this autumn by the Ministry for Business Policy Coordination identified the food and food technology industries as one of the segments in which Denmark has a strong competitive advantage with an accumulated know-how. A report to the government by the Institute for Food Studies and Agro-industrial Development in 1992 claimed that the value of agro-industrial production could be doubled over the next 20 years. While the government does not necessarily accept the report's conclusions, it has shown its commitment to the agro-industrial industries through the Food Industry Technology research programme. Government and industry on a 50-50 basis together put about DKr800m into the programme over the period 1990-94 and plan to invest DKr1bn over the next five years in stage two of the programme, which is by far the largest Danish government-funded programme ot its type.</p>

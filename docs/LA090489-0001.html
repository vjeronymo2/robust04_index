			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RESTRICTIONS KEEP MIGRANT HOUSING FUNDS IN LIMBO  </P> <P> Half a million dollars sits in a bank account in Sacramento, just waiting to be  used on desperately needed housing for migrant farm workers in San Diego  County.  </P> <P> And it will continue to sit, as long as a formidable wall of regulations  separates the money from the people who need it.  </P> <P> The money, as approved in the state budget two months ago, comes with  restrictions that critics say are utterly impractical.  </P> <P> "That program has so many strings attached to it that it's virtually useless  for San Diego County," said Oceanside Housing Director Richard Goodman.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), the driving force behind the budget  item, was thrilled last July when Gov. George Deukmejian approved the spending  blueprint with the $500,000 allotment intact. Frazee remarked at the time that  it was "nice to win one" after seeing a similar proposal jettisoned last year.  </P> <P> However, early applause for the success of the budget appropriation has given  way to grumbling by agencies eager to provide housing, but who have discovered  their plans do not qualify under the state's restrictions on use of the money.  </P> <P> Among the restrictions that make the money difficult to obtain are provisions  that the funds be used only for permanent structures, which must be built on  land that is either owned or leased for a minimum of 20 years by the city or  agency proposing to construct the housing. Also, the housing is for families  only and is not to be used year-round.  </P> <P> Frazee's staff is back at the drawing board, reviving an Assembly bill to make  the money more accessible. Frazee reportedly is trying to push the bill through  the Legislature in the two weeks remaining before the session ends Sept. 15.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Doesn't Qualify  </P> <P> Oceanside, host to an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 migrant laborers each year, has  a plan for farm worker housing but is ineligible to use the state money, which  will be disbursed by the state Office of Migrant Services via the Farmworker  Housing Grant Program. The project would involve leasing trailers directly to  the farmers to provide shelter for the year-round work force.  </P> <P> "We have been talking with the growers, and we know they are ready, willing and  able to join us in doing this," Goodman said. "The money has been appropriated,  and the need is outrageous. But the state has got so many strings on that money  we can't use it."  </P> <P> After a meeting in Sacramento, Goodman said state officials appeared unaware  that the agricultural areas of San Diego County operate under completely  different circumstances than the rural farms in California's Central Valley.  </P> <P> "They keep saying, 'Get some land,' but property here is too valuable and too  scarce for us to just go out and buy some," Goodman said.  </P> <P> "Also, in a place like Oceanside, the farmland is around where all the  well-heeled people live," he said. "Getting a high-density apartment complex  for migrant workers approved would be a political nightmare."  </P> <P> The amended bill would make the money usable for temporary housing for single  farm workers on a year-round basis and would also seek to set aside $100,000  for use on a project similar to the one proposed by Oceanside. Though the  $100,000 would technically be available to any agency with a plan to house  migrant workers, "for all practical purposes, Oceanside is the only game in  town unless someone else really moves fast," Frazee's chief of staff, Richard  Ledford, said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Portables for Oceanside  </P> <P> Oceanside plans to purchase portable trailers, then lease them to the growers  at a nominal rate, probably $1 a year, Goodman said. The growers would be  responsible for installing water and power lines to the trailers and  maintaining the units, which would house up to seven people each. The growers  would have to invest $5,000 to $10,000 for each trailer, Goodman said.  </P> <P> Frazee's bill, AB-617, was already in the works while the budget was being  hammered out.  </P> <P> "We felt 617 was on track," Ledford said. "But our negotiations with the  administration came out a little more positive than we thought they would.  Rather than wait for Jan. 1 for the new legislation to take effect, Frazee made  a decision to see if we could get it in the budget.  </P> <P> "I never imagined we would have the problems with it that we did. In  retrospect, I wish we had been a little more specific about how the money could  be spent."  </P> <P> Now, the legislation has been resurrected as a "trailer" bill, intended to  clean up the details left out by the $500,000 budget appropriation.  </P> <P> As of last week, AB-617 had successfully cleared the Housing and Urban Affairs  Committee and was being considered on the floor of the state Senate, carried by  Sen. William Craven, (R-Oceanside), according to Ledford.  </P> <P> The current program does allow for the housing to be built on land in which the  city has a 20-year "controlling interest," but Goodman said even that provision  would not be sufficient. "There's no grower that's going to commit his property  for that long in the future," he said, in light of the rapid pace at which  farmland is being sold to developers in the North County.  </P> <P> "Their rules and regulations just don't mesh with reality in Southern  California, especially San Diego County," Goodman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Called 'Flexible'  </P> <P> Bill Vangundi, state deputy director of housing, defended the state's stance,  saying the Farmworker Housing Grant Program is "a very flexible program."  </P> <P> "Right now the funds are there," he said. "They are for use for farm-worker  family housing in San Diego, and that's what it will be used for." But the  local officials who are desirous of using that money have to "reformat their  thinking," Vangundi said.  </P> <P> "What they wanted to focus on as a solution wasn't going to work," he said,  referring to Oceanside's trailer plan. The state would balk at allowing the  trailers to be put on the farmers' property, he said. "We're the lender of the  taxpayers' money . . . and the taxpayers are not going to be happy about  putting money on a private landowner's land, if he can turn that site over to  some other use next year."  </P> <P> "They will need to have that land or long-term control of that land," Vangundi  said. "That is definitely a major string, but it's one that they are going to  have to come to grips with."  </P> <P> Vangundi suggested that Oceanside approach Camp Pendleton about obtaining a  long-term lease for farm-worker housing on the Marine base. The problem of  farmland being sold to developers was also not insurmountable, he said. "If  some of that agricultural land converts to residential down the road, it  doesn't preclude them from still having farm-worker housing there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Land Purchases OK  </P> <P> Vangundi pointed out that the money may also be used for things besides  construction, such as site acquisition, feasibility studies and environmental  reviews, or as a down payment for federal grant programs that require matching  funds.  </P> <P> "Because of the way it was written by the legislative staffers, the thing kind  of got a little bit garbled," he said.  </P> <P> Additional misunderstandings may have occurred because the state defines  "migrant workers" as laborers who migrate from crop to crop, not as migrants  from Mexico or other countries, he said.  </P> <P> Despite the apparent difficulties, Vangundi said, "We're not giving up. There's  going to be a solution."  </P> <P> Local officials, unconvinced that the state is on their side, are now relying  on Frazee's efforts to help them obtain the money.  </P> <P> Though Oceanside appears to be the front-runner for state funding, other social  service agencies in North County are moving ahead with plans to build housing  for farm workers with or without the state money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Valley Center Site Possible  </P> <P> Amy Rowland, director of the North County Housing Foundation, said her  nonprofit organization has been working on plans to establish farm-worker  housing in Valley Center or in Fallbrook.  </P> <P> The Valley Center plan, however, has stalled because of the difficulty of  finding an appropriate site, she said. Most of Valley Center is under a  county-mandated building moratorium because the high ground-water level has led  to problems with the septic systems.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to find a site yet, but no matter where we build, it's  going to be used," she said. "There's enough need out there to do hundreds of  projects."  </P> <P> Rowland said she is considering the state money as one possible source for  financing the Valley Center project but has not been encouraged by reports of  the inaccessibility of the money. "It looks like the way that funding is  allocated currently it would be tough to use in San Diego in any way that would  make sense," she said. "I think whoever uses the money, it's going to have to  be coupled with other resources."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Encinitas Project Planned  </P> <P> The North County Chaplaincy is also moving ahead on a housing project in the  Encinitas area and probably will apply for a share of the state money,  spokeswoman Millie Gordon said. "We've got everything taken care of," Gordon  said. "We're just now going insane trying to find funding."  </P> <P> The Chaplaincy project will utilize prefabricated units that will house eight  people each, and arrangements already have been made to lease land and provide  utilities and social services, Gordon said. The housing will be open to farm  workers, immigrants and the general homeless population, she said.  </P> <P> "All we need is money," Gordon said. "With $250,000, we could set up 20  families, up to 100 individuals, in their own homes within a month."  </P> <P> Gabriel Rodriguez, county housing department chief, said the county supports  the nonprofit agencies in their quest for the state funds. The county itself  does not have any proposals to build farm-worker housing, he said.  </P></p>

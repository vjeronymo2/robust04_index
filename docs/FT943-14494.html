			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Arts: She Loves Me - Musical It is true to say that the 1963 musical She Loves Me, now revived at the Savoy, is by far the best musical in town, but it is not enough to leave it there. It is the kind of musical nobody writes any more; and it is all too possible that people today will be too sophisticated to take it seriously. Who cares about staff squabbles in a Budapest parfumerie and two correspondents in a Lonely Hearts Club? Who cares about innocent charm? Well, thanks to She Loves Me, I do - and I am not alone. I would gladly swap the whole of Lloyd Webber and Sondheim for it. Its scale is miniature, but it is radiant with rhythm, vitality, and human variety. No, it is not a great musical, but it is exceptionally dear. Though there are several highly effective hits here for the leading four characters, I believe that this musical's spell really lies in its ensembles. The action begins, so simply, with shop assistants arriving at work, singing 'Good morning,' 'Good day,' 'Isn't this a beautiful day?' 'How are you this beautiful day?' - which could be cloying, (the lyrics are by Sheldon Harnick), save that the words are so timed by Jerry Bock's music that their good manners become intoxicating. Somehow, Bock catches the rhythm of shop life and the way that assistants have to suppress their sincerer emotions behind the brio of salesmanship. Wonderful. The music draws on a wide panoply of rhythms, and it is this, above all, that make Amalia and Georg (the two parfumerie assistants who do not realise that their anonymous Lonely Hearts correspondence is with each other) large to us. Not only them, but also Miss Ritter (who keeps falling for the wrong man) and even Mr Kodaly (who makes a career out of being the wrong man for whom women fall) and their whole milieu, down to the ingenu delivery-boy Arpad. How judicious the way the emotionally perilous tango of the cafe where Amalia waits to meet her correspondent for the first time suddenly switches into a hysterical Viennese waltz as she sends Georg packing; how witty the way Miss Ritter's big number, 'A Trip to the Library', begins as a bolero and then changes into a quickstep. The West End staging almost exactly reproduces the 1993 Broadway revival, but the opening-night performance here was certainly fresher than the midweek-matinee I caught of the latter this February. One can find some fault with the two leads, though the audience certainly seems not to. As Georg, John Gordon-Sinclair not only carries no hint of the supercilious pride of which Amalia initially accuses him, he also overdoes the character's gaucherie; and, as Amalia, Ruthie Henshall tends to a certain hard-boiled glassiness around the smile, eyes, and high notes. He is dynamically a bit slack, and her singing would be more engaging if she did not squeeze into her vibrato and if she conceived each number with a surer sense of its overall architecture. A few of their numbers - notably 'Tonight at Eight' and 'Where's My Shoe?' - are too obviously choreographed for cute effect (rather than for emotional sincerity). But the bright gleam of her voice is a rare pleasure in musicals today, and the freshness with which she inflects the lyrics ('Will wonders never cease?') is winning. She and Sinclair perform with exemplary manners as part of a larger ensemble, and they catch both the pathos and the comedy of their characters' situations. The most successfully re-thought characterisation is Tracy Bennett's as Ilona Ritter. She not only catches just the right amount of caricature in this weary good-time girl, she also packs her full of big-time vigour. In her 'Library' hit, she delivers 'He read to me all night long' on an ecstatic climax and immediately adds 'Now how about that?' in a glowing murmur: adorably funny. Gerard Casey, David de Keyser, Simon Connolly, Barry James, and David Alder all contribute good performances. My only serious problem is with the exaggerated facial expressions of Jon Peterson as the Busboy (much better played deadpan), and Robert Scott's sometimes slack musical direction. Scott Ellis's direction, Tony Walton's set, and Rob Marshall's choreography sometimes combine to make the show more neat and cartoon-like, and less touching than it really is. But the whole production has just enough poignancy and bags of flair. This musical has the kind of charm that others have been trying to banish from the genre for decades now. At its heart lies real heartbreak, as well as good manners and comic vitality: an enchanting confection. At the Savoy Theatre (071-836 8888).</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTORS IN HONG KONG TURN TO U.S. AS TURMOIL IN CHINA ROCKS ECONOMY  </P> <P> Hong Kong investors have begun moving more capital out of the British colony  and expressed heightened interest in U.S. real estate amid the escalating  unrest in China and the plunge in Hong Kong stock and real estate prices.  </P> <P> So far, the new wave of capital flight does not appear to be a mass exodus. But  the outflow is expected to grow if violence and instability in China continue  or a new government emerges that is hostile to preserving the free-wheeling  economic system in Hong Kong when China takes over in 1997, U.S. bankers and  others said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We've seen some activity in wiring money out of Hong Kong, but it's not  significant yet," reported Dunson Cheng, president of Los Angeles-based Cathay  Bank, which has depositors from Hong Kong.  </P> <P> "In the last day or two, we've had a couple of modest transfers, but it's  nothing like you could say there's a tremendous flight out of Hong Kong," said  an official of a major U.S. bank with operations in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Despite a strong economy in recent years, Hong Kong already has an exodus of  people and money, stemming from the 1984 agreement by the British government to  turn over the colony to China.  </P> <P> No one knows for sure just how much money has left Hong Kong in recent years,  but 75,000 of the colony's residents are estimated to have emigrated in the  past two years. Seven of every 10 people in Hong Kong either fled from  communism in China or have at least one parent who did so, and thus there is a  large mistrust of the Chinese government and its promises to preserve Hong  Kong's entrepreneurial freedoms.  </P> <P> Following news of the Beijing massacres, Hong Kong investors in recent days  have increased investments in U.S. and other overseas savings deposits and  Treasury securities, experts say. Bankers also report widespread conversions of  Hong Kong dollars into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. Some of this  investment helped boost prices of the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds Monday.  </P> <P> Hong Kong share prices Monday registered their worst loss since the worldwide  market collapse in 1987, but rebounded slightly Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index of  blue chip stocks closed at 2,149.71, up 56.1 from Monday, when it fell 581.77.  Meanwhile Tuesday, the Hong Kong dollar continued to come under strong selling  pressure as investors sought a safer haven in the U.S. dollar.  </P> <P> "You are seeing funds being transferred out of Hong Kong into a lot of  short-term investments" such as one- or three-month certificates of deposit,  said an official of a large multinational U.S. bank who handles clients from  Asia.  </P> <P> Some Hong Kong investors also are inquiring about American real estate in the  wake of reports that prices of some real estate in Hong Kong have dropped as  much as 20% in recent days.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how fast it's happened," said Clifton K. Chang, a partner at  Altair Investment Co., a Los Angeles real estate development and investment  firm. He noted that some Hong Kong investors flew here just in the past two  days to investigate commercial properties in Southern California.  </P> <P> "In Hong Kong, business runs on fear and greed," Chang said. "For the past two  years, greed's been driving it. For the past week, fear's been in."  </P> <P> Any continued capital outflow, experts say, would reflect more than just fears  that China may renege on its promise to maintain the capitalist system in Hong  Kong.  </P> <P> Heightened capital flight also would reflect a redirection of Hong Kong  investment away from China. Hong Kong has been the largest foreign investor in  China, surpassing Japan and the United States. But Hong Kong investors, like  those anywhere else, prefer nations with political and economic stability,  conditions which may no longer be assured in China.  </P> <P> New outflows also could reflect the growing international exposure of the new  generation of Hong Kong business leaders. Many are in their 30s and 40s,  studied in the United States and have many friends here.  </P> <P> Taking capital out of Hong Kong is not difficult. Many large U.S. and European  banks maintain branches there. A Hong Kong resident can simply open an account  and have funds wired overseas for safekeeping.  </P> <P> Or a Hong Kong resident can buy deposits in the form of Eurodollars -- a term  for U.S. dollars deposited outside the United States, says Cheng of Cathay  Bank. They pay higher rates, but the money is still considered to be in Hong  Kong.  </P> <P> Some wealthy Hong Kong investors also have created "shell" corporations to  invest their money in such unregulated havens as the Bahamas.  </P> <P> Canada also is another popular destination of Hong Kong money, because that  nation grants immigrant visas and eventual citizenship to Hong Kong residents  who invest large sums of money there. Canada also pays high interest rates,  averaging about 13% to 14% for large multimillion-dollar deposits, versus about  9% to 10% in the United States, said one U.S. banker.  </P> <P> But despite the lure of overseas havens, many Hong Kong investors don't yet  appear to be rushing to take out all their money, wanting to see how things  shake out in Beijing, bankers said.  </P> <P> "I think there is a lot of wait-and-see attitude right now, (waiting) to see  which way this is going to go and who is going to take charge," said one U.S.  banker with Asian operations.  </P> <P> However, a surge of interest among Hong Kong investors in Southern California  real estate could reverse recent buying patterns.  </P> <P> Hong Kong real estate investors -- while continuing to make acquisitions -- had  kept a lot of their money back home because Hong Kong real estate prices had  risen as much as 25% to 35% a year, real estate developer Chang said.  </P> <P> As a result, Hong Kong investors generally have not purchased "showcase"  properties in North America, as have the Japanese. Two notable exceptions were  the purchase of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel by a Hong Kong investment firm and  the acquisition of the Vancouver world's fair site by wealthy Hong Kong  industrialist Li Ka Shing.  </P> <P> But Chang predicted that Hong Kong real estate investments here now could surge  in the next six months, because Hong Kong investors -- unlike the Japanese --  move quickly.  </P> <P> "The Hong Kong guys are traders at heart," Chang said. "Wherever the winds are  blowing they are quick to sense it and react. Two years is long term for the  Hong Kong guys."  </P> <P> Added Chang: "Some of the people who were interested before but said, 'Now is  not the time,' are now saying 'Now is the time.' "  </P> <P> GOLD PRICES RISE: Gold rose nearly $12 an ounce Tuesday, while the dollar  slipped.

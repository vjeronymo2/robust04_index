			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tax lesson escapes many Tory memories - Philip Stephens draws a parallel between this Budget and Sir Geoffrey Howe's in 1981 POLITICIANS have short memories. As the Commons debated the recession yesterday only a handful of Conservative MPs would admit that Mr Norman Lamont should do anything but cut taxes in his Budget on March 10. The orthodox wisdom on the government benches is that a pre-election boost to the economy through lower income taxes would represent a perfect coincidence of economic good sense and political advantage. A Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn tax cut - and some Conservative MPs are now suggesting that would be a modest reduction - would be entirely consistent with the party's reputation for prudence, because of the depth of the recession. A jump in the public sector borrowing requirement to more than Pounds 20bn, the argument runs, can be brushed off as simply a mirror image of the economic cycle. It will gradually disappear naturally once the economy returns to growth, in line with the policy of balancing the budget over the medium term. The fact that 1p off the basic rate of income tax or a sharp rise in thresholds would also define the essential difference between the Conservatives and Labour just before the election is no more than chance. No one seems to remember 1981. That was the year when Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government was battling with a similarly deep recession. Sir Geoffrey Howe, then chancellor, faced intense pressure from the Opposition, from some in the cabinet, and from the economics establishment to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes. He did the reverse, putting them up by Pounds 3.6bn. The budget provoked a storm of criticism culminating in its condemnation by 364 respected economists. It sparked a debate about the role of fiscal policy which lasted for most of the 1980s. If Mr Lamont followed Sir Geoffrey's example he would put taxes up by about Pounds 7bn. The parallels are striking. In the spring of 1981 it seemed that the economy was locked in recession, but subsequent evidence showed that a recovery was already under way. Mr Lamont insists the same will be true of this year. The pound was then strong, although it was already slipping from its extraordinary rise of the previous year. Inflation, as now, was falling fast. Ministers insist the differences are just as important. The government was then following a money-supply target which included public borrowing as a key component. That has been replaced by sterling's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, in theory a tighter constraint on cuts in interest rates. (Few remember that the 1981 package was followed by a rise rather than a cut in borrowing costs). Sir Geoffrey was faced with a much higher structural budget deficit and a substantially larger national debt than that confronting Mr Lamont. The present chancellor can argue that large debt repayments during the 1980s provide room for higher borrowing during a recession. The few Conservative MPs whose memories stretch back to 1981 - and they tend to be unreconstructed monetarists - are not convinced. They recall that once it was clear that Sir Geoffrey's budget had not stifled the recovery, ministers argued consistently that the rise in taxes had helped rather than hindered the economy's emergence from recession. Mr Nigel Lawson insisted repeatedly that attempts to influence the economic cycle through fine-tuning of fiscal policy were inevitably misguided. He stuck firmly to that principle when he cut taxes when the economy was growing strongly. For most of Mr Lawson's tenure at the Treasury 'fiscal stabilisers' was a proscribed phrase. Now the government's supporters expect Mr Lamont to offer a seamless justification for reducing the tax burden during a recession as well as in a boom. But, as one survivor of that first administration recalls, there is one essential difference between then and now. Sir Geoffrey's package was unveiled two years rather than at most two months before a general election.</p>

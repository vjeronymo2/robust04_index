Government Minister Fabio Villegas, the minister in charge  of  political issues, said the position voiced by the high-ranking  tribunal [as heard] does not obligate the government to  immediately withdraw the troops, which are in Juanchaco and  which have created a serious controversy among various sectors  of the country.    He insisted the Council of State did not issue a ruling,  rather, an opinion that will now be debated at the Charges  [Acusacion] Committee of the Chamber of Representatives and will  be studied by the Attorney General's Office.    The Executive Branch stated in a communique the president of  the Republic violated neither the letter nor spirit of the  Constitution. The executive branch will not avoid the political  debate at the Congress of the Republic. It is not our goal to  deceive anyone, because the documents which contain these  agreements have been at the Colombians' disposal, and thus,  there is nothing secret, the government minister added.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTIONISTS CONSIDER D.A.'S OFFER ON CHARGES IN CYPRESS PROTEST  </P> <P> About 370 defendants charged with unlawful assembly in a March 23 anti-abortion  protest in Cypress appeared at West Municipal Court in Westminster this morning  to enter their pleas.  </P> <P> In an attempt to avoid the expense of individual trials, the Orange County  district attorney's office offered to reduce the misdemeanor charge to an  infraction and charge each defendant $75 to $125 in court costs. The  arrangement, however, depended on all 370 pleading either guilty or no contest  today.  </P> <P> Randall Terry, a leader of the national Operation Rescue, sent word to the  defendants not to accept the district attorney's arrangement, according to  Kenneth Tanner of Rancho Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> The defendants were granted a recess at noon to discuss the deal.  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: European airlines begin to anticipate a recovery - But industry prospects are uneven European airlines are facing the prospect of further losses in 1993 following a depressed performance last year. While passenger levels have risen slightly this year, earnings forecasts remain negative. However, there may be some good news for airlines as the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK economies show signs that they may be emerging from recession. Mr James Halstead, Swiss Bank's transport analyst, comments that the sector looks as if it is at the bottom of the downward cycle. But he draws a distinction between those carriers flying the transatlantic routes, such as British Airways, and those more dependent on Europe, Lufthansa for instance. While operators using the transatlantic routes are beginning to see a pick-up in activity, those more dependent on continental European routes will continue to have problems as the recession there begins to deepen, he comments. Mr Mark McVicar, transport analyst at NatWest Securities, is a little less optimistic and believes that an upturn in the sector will be delayed until 1994. 'This is about the earliest time before supply and demand begin to achieve any sort of balance,' he says. Lufthansa surprised some observers when it blazed a trail at the beginning of the year under a European Community liberalisation directive allowing cheaper ticket pricing. The shares moved quickly ahead, reaching a year's high of DM122.50 before beginning to slip back. The stock closed yesterday at DM111. The German carrier had not previously been induced into the pricing war against competitors but a tough couple of years has forced its hand: Mr Halstead comments that Lufthansa found that it had to discount following substantial losses in 1991 and 1992. However, Mr McVicar observes that Lufthansa, which has made efforts to reduce its cost base, needs to go much further and quicker in that area. 'Lufthansa has said that it intends to break even by 1995/1996,' he says, 'but the equivalent cost-cutting measures were implemented by British Airways in almost half the time.' He adds that the airline faces more difficult industrial obstacles in, for instance, reducing staff levels than the UK operator. By contrast KLM is seen by many analysts to be in a good position to benefit from any economic upturn, having made concerted efforts to cut its cost base. After a volatile performance since the beginning of the year the shares currently stand some 11 per cent higher. Although, in the short term, the group's prospects are no better than most competitors, with another net loss in earnings forecast for 1993/94, the longer term scenario appears more secure. Mr Richard Brakenhoff, transport analyst at Amsterdam brokers Pierson, points to benefits which will accrue from the agreement between the Netherlands and US over routes, the 'open skies' arrangement. Even its commercial links with Northwest Airlines, the troubled US carrier which had exerted a negative effect on KLM's results - the latter said last month it was writing off its 20 per cent stake in Wings, Northwest's holding company  -may eventually prove valuable because of the US route network. However, KLM's route to greater profitability depends a great deal, says Mr Brakenhoff, on whether or not it can reach an agreement with the present members of the 'European Quality Alliance' - SAS, Austrian Airlines and Swissair - on tighter links. At present KLM has a European market share of just above 3 per cent, compared with Lufthansa's 14 per cent, SAS's 9.8 per cent, 4.4 per cent for Swissair and 2 per cent for Austrian. The outcome of these talks is uncertain, with the chairman of SAS having already said that he does not expect discussions to lead to a merger. Finally, SAS could benefit from economic recovery, says Mr Torben Sand, analyst at Unibors, having realised the need for very dramatic cost reductions and restructuring which has already resulted in staff numbers being reduced by 3,500. But its long-term prospects are also tied to the future shape of the 'alliance'.</p>

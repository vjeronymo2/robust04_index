			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Poll figures may flatter Labour: But there is no doubt a landslide is in the making The European elections are hard to predict. The low turnout and the likelihood of tactical voting present special problems to the pollsters. There will be relatively few surveys during the campaign. There may not even be any exit polls to tide curiosity over the gap between the vote on June 9 and the count that takes place three days later when all the other countries have cast their ballot. The Conservatives' prospects are bleak. Recent nationwide polls are running about 45 per cent for Labour to 25 per cent for the Tories and 25 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections yielded 41 per cent for Labour, 27 per cent for the Conservatives and 27 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Recent experience suggests that opinion-poll figures may flatter Labour. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a Labour landslide is in the making. But what will happen in the Tory seats of the south. How far will the Liberal Democrats' breakthrough go? The only published polling this week has been about the Labour leadership and those forecasts are not polls in any meaningful sense. The 'don't knows' and the 'won't says' are too numerous, and nobody is in a position to construct a reliable sample frame for the constituency activists or for the trade unionists who will actually vote. But there is some data on what may happen when the votes are cast in the Euro-election 17 days hence. Different analyses of the local elections and of two opinion polls taken just before John Smith's death give a clear range for the likely division of the newly redrawn UK Euro-seats. The Conservatives, who won 32 seats in 1989, are forecast to gain a maximum of 20 seats this time and a minimum of eight. Labour, which has 45 seats, is given a maximum of 66 and a minimum of 52, and the Liberal Democrats, who have no seats, a maximum of 14 and minimum of three. But these figures take no account of tactical voting. There are almost 20 seats where Labour voters have a far better chance of ousting the Tory MEP if they vote Liberal Democrat. The outcome will turn on how effectively the Liberal Democrats put this point over. The Conservatives have leaked one interesting figure from their private polls. A total of 45 per cent of the electorate say they are 'certain to vote'. In 1989 the same poll said 35 per cent, and proved to be exactly right. But who will the non-voters be? If they are a representative sample, drawn proportionately from all parties, abstention will not matter. But it will be a very different story if disillusioned Conservatives go 'on strike' as one rightwing Tory MP has suggested, or if Euro-sceptics, with no Euro-sceptic to vote for, stay away. A 45 per cent turnout, although the lowest in Europe, may seem high in a country where just 27 per cent recognise the name of Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and fewer than 50 per cent claim to know of the European parliament. Perhaps the most interesting poll so far was a union-wide one by MORI for The European newspaper. This tackled the central issue of the community's future. Just three of the 12 countries - Belgium, Italy and Greece - showed a significant majority wanting a United States of Europe. Denmark (74 per cent to 11 per cent) and the Netherlands (73 per cent to 21 per cent) showed an even greater majority against the idea than the UK (68 per cent to 17 per cent). In no country would a majority vote in a referendum for leaving the union, although, as expected, Denmark (53 per cent in, 35 per cent out) and Britain (52 per cent in, 36 per cent out) emerged as the most sceptical.

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Viag unit to take control of computer distributor Klockner, a trading subsidiary of Viag, the acquisitive German conglomerate, is to take control of Computer 2000, one of Europe's leading distributors of software, hardware and networking components. Agreement had been reached with a group of shareholders to buy a majority stake, the bidder said on Friday. Neither company could be reached for further comment. Two insurance companies, Nordstern and Colonia, together hold more than 25 per cent of Computer 2000; 21 per cent is held privately by Dr Arend Oetker; and the management and staff hold a further 10 per cent. Computer 2000 has been expanding aggressively, but has suffered from sharply shrinking margins. Earlier this month it announced plans for a five-for-one rights issue. Shareholders were told at this month's annual meeting that although turnover had risen almost 40 per cent to DM1.94bn (Dollars 1.16bn) in the first six months of the current year, pre-tax profits were up only 7.6 per cent at DM39.5m. Analysts have forecast further tightening of gross margins as competition sharpens. Klockner, which has a mixed portfolio of businesses, has also had its share of troubles, stemming mainly from difficulties in the steel business, which started in 1992 with the near-collapse of Klockner Werke, the diversified steel group. Trade in machine tools has also generated losses. No recent results figures are available. Following a cost-cutting programme which started last spring, the company has turned to acquisitions. Last autumn, it took a majority stake in Roder, which claims to be the world's leading manufacturer and hirer of tents and marquees. In April, it bought control of Montana, which specialises in metal cladding for the construction industry.</p>

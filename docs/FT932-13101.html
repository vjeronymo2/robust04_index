			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / How To Spend It: The Kenyan art of bribery - Rex Winsbury tells the chilling tale of how he imported an ice-cream machine to make his wife feel at home in Africa I LEARNT my lesson about how to do business in Kenya on the day, some four months after I had arrived there as an ex-pat manager, that my wife and two children flew in to Kenyatta Airport to join me. When my wife resigned from her job in London, her colleagues threw a party and gave her, as a leaving present, a small ice-cream maker. My wife rang from London and said: 'You don't mind if I ship out my leaving present, do you, by air freight?' - at my expense of course. I could hardly say no. I did not even know what the present was, but the principle was important. She had been doubtful about coming out to Kenya, leaving her job and friends in London, and I did not want to imperil the fragile understanding at the last moment. So I said 'yes' and, the afternoon before they were due to arrive off a KLM flight at Kenyatta Airport, I had a telephone call from our clearing agent at the airport to say that a package had arrived for me, and I had better go to the freight terminal to get it. Innocently, I decided to collect my wife and children first, and then stop to pick up the goods. They were due at 7 am the next morning, and it sounded a logical plan. So much for western logic. Their arrival was uneventful. As we left the passenger terminal I said proudly, as if to confirm their welcome: 'And what's more, your packet has arrived. what is it?' 'An ice-cream maker.' I still did not sense trouble. No one had warned me about the freight terminal. We drove to a large building on the airport perimeter. I parked the ageing company Range Rover and with an innocent: 'See you in a few minutes,' went to find Hassan, the clearing agent. Or rather, he found me. He had been waiting, and knew the vehicle of old. He took me into a dingy side office and said: 'You are late.' He led me into a huge aircraft-hangar-like depot with an ante-room where sundry Kenyans were shouting and gesticulating at each other. In the middle of the floor of this ante-room was a large cardboard box, opened, with bits of its contents on the floor beside it. It was my wife's packet. 'They say you will have to pay duty,' said Hassan. 'But it's a present, and it's for our own use, like our other belongings. We have just arrived in Kenya.' 'Here, an ice cream machine is counted as an industrial machine, it says so in the customs manual.' 'How much duty?' 'Maybe 8,000 shillings.' I began to get annoyed; 8,000 Kenya shillings was worth about Pounds 300. The machine had only cost about Pounds 200 in London. 'I won't pay that much,' I told Hassan, trying to sound every bit the authoritative white man who will stand no nonsense from the blacks. Hassan looked at me sorrowfully, took me by the arm and steered me outside again. 'You must realise that if you do not pay, they will leave it there on the floor, like that. And if it is left there, it will not be there at all by the morning.' I knew what he meant. Theft was rife in Nairobi, and I could well imagine its mysterious nocturnal disappearance, with nothing the next morning except shrugs of the shoulders. My wife and children were waiting outside. what would I say to her if her leaving present was stolen? What sort of welcome would that be to Kenya? The matter began to assume symbolic proportions. 'What do you suggest?' I asked Hassan. 'You are the expert here.' He paused, and looked into the half-distance. 'Maybe, for 4,000 shillings I can do it for you. Come back later with money.' I was in a fix. I agreed to be back at noon with money. I rushed back to my impatient jetlagged family and took them home. I telephoned the office, arranged to have the money ready at my office, drove into town to collect it, then back to the airport freight terminal for midday. 'The terminal is shut now,' said Hassan solemnly. 'What for?' 'Lunch.' 'So what do we do now?' 'Have lunch.' We went to the airport canteen, a greasy self-service cafeteria reminiscent of British Rail in the 1950s. He chose a large meal, I chose a small one. He left me to pay the bill. Then I had to sit with him for an hour, a total stranger, one white man in a black canteen, everyone knowing why I was there. Finished, he sucked his teeth, and said: 'OK, go now.' Back at the terminal building, he led me along sunless corridors and from one office to another, bypassing queues of people. In each office he nodded vigorously to the occupant in my direction. I suppose he was doling out my money - dishing out verbal promissory notes. It seemed to work. Hassan led me back to the ante-chamber of the transit hall. There, my package had already been taped together, and the overseer gesticulated towards it. 'OK, you take it now,' he said with a wide grin. I knew why he was grinning. Hassan made no gesture to help me. I picked up the heavy cardboard box and staggered outside, into the bright sunlight of a Nairobi afternoon. I was dazzled, breathing in fresh air, glad to be free of the claustrophobic atmosphere. But I was pulled sharply back to business. 'Now, you must give me the money. I have promised it.' 'All of it?' I felt like a baby in his hands. 'Yes, you see, their view is that you will sell that machine, tomorrow or maybe the day after, it doesn't matter, for a good profit. So they think they should have part of that profit. Not all of it. You have your share, they have theirs, for letting you bring it in without paying duty.' There was an African logic about that. I counted out 4,000 shillings in 100 shilling notes. He stared at the notes for many seconds, not taking them. Then he asked: 'what about me?' I stared back at him. 'I have done my part. So you must pay me too.' I was beginning to get angry. He was breaking the agreement between us. I felt a righteous anger - and I was in possession of the goods. 'How much?' 'What you think is fair. I did you a service.' He had got lunch off me, and the company paid him for his services. So I said, as much to get rid of him as anything else, 'Four hundred shillings.' Ten per cent seemed a reasonable tip. 'That is not very much.' 'Four hundred.' 'OK.' So I counted out four more notes, and he took the pile, shook my hand, and vanished into the building. My troubles were not over. The man on guard at the gate, dressed in dirty overalls, said: 'where are going with that thing? where is your pass?' Of course, I did not have one. But by now, I knew the game. I put the package down, pulled 40 shillings (10 per cent of 10 per cent) out of my pocket and handed it over as I walked past him. He grinned, and I was free at last. I thought my wife would be pleased. But she was furious. 'I wouldn't have paid all that for it,' she said. 'Let 'em have it or send it back to England.' But we did sell it, three years later, for 4,500 shillings. So we broke even. Except the ice cream wasn't up to much.</p>

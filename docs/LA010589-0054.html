			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JAZZ EDUCATORS' MEETING LURES A  HESITANT MARSALIS  </P> <P> This month's National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention may give San Diego its  biggest single shot of jazz in 1989.  </P> <P> Big-time talent will take to the stage at Town &amp; Country's Atlas Ballroom  on three nights, but the nitty-gritty will be the more than 2,000 jazz  educators, musicians and aficionados expected Jan. 12-15 for clinics, new  product displays and the chance to mingle with influential jazz figures.  </P> <P> Among those who will make the scene is 28-year-old sax virtuoso Branford  Marsalis, who decided, after initial reluctance, to become involved with the  Southern Comfort "All That Jazz" Collegiate Competition. He'll play a set with  the winning jazz band Jan. 14.  </P> <P> Marsalis, brother of acclaimed trumpeter Wynton, isn't performing because he  thinks formal jazz education is essential.  </P> <P> "Most of the people we idolize -- Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins -- didn't go to  music school. If they did go to school, they were trained in classical music."  </P> <P> Nor is he coming to San Diego because he thinks Southern Comfort is the right  sponsor for a black jazz musician.  </P> <P> "Being a black American, I was extremely hesitant to hook up with a liquor  company. If you look at the situation in terms of advertisement, especially in  the black community, the majority of things are cigarettes and liquor. But in  the past five years, Southern Comfort has given $1 million to jazz education in  America. That outweighs any stigmas that could be attached.  </P> <P> "There are so few people willing to do anything for jazz, we'll take help from  anywhere we can get it."  </P> <P> Marsalis just finished touring with rock star Sting. "In a half-hour jazz gig,  I play more notes than during a 2 1/2-hour Sting concert," he said. "Once you  do a rock 'n' roll gig, it takes awhile to get your jazz chops back."  </P> <P> Marsalis might jam when he's here. His father's coming for the convention, as  is younger brother Delfeayo, who plays with one of the three collegiate  competition finalist bands.  </P> <P> Jazz/blues greats Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff opened a two-week run at  Elario's last night. Alto saxman Crawford, who likes to play "as if I were  singing a song," got his big break in 1958 when he joined Ray Charles' band on  baritone sax. Even in high school, he backed up bluesmen like B.B. King, Bobby  "Blue" Bland, and Junior Parker.  </P> <P> In 1986, he hooked up with fellow Milestone artist Jimmy McGriff, a master of  the bluesy Hammond B-3 organ. McGriff and Crawford have Ray Charles in common.  The organist scored a hit in 1962 with his instrumental version of Charles'  "I've Got a Woman," which made No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart and 20 on the  pop chart. Though he also plays several synthesizers, McGriff's heart is with  the blues and the B-3.  </P> <P> A three-month gig has turned into a yearlong stint at the downtown Marriott for  Los Angeles guitarist Ron Eschete. "The general manager, Joel Rothman, is a  dear friend of mine, and a big jazz fan," Eschete said. "I've known him for  eight or nine years, since he used to manage the Anaheim and Newport Marriotts.  He always told me he'd use me if he got the right room, and low and behold,  last December he called after he'd just moved to the San Diego Marriott."  </P> <P> Dave Pike, Gene Harris, Hampton Hawes, Warren Marsh, Milt Jackson, Ray Brown,  and Dizzy Gillespie are among the talents that Eschete's played -- and recorded  -- with. In San Diego, he's performing with locals Hank Dobbs (bass) and Ron  Ogden (drums).  </P> <P> Eschete's wife and son remain in L.A. while Eschete lives most of the week in a  room at the hotel, where he plays Tuesday through Saturday evenings just  outside of D.W.'s Pub. He's recorded five albums, including two on the Muse  label. A new album of Cole Porter classics (such as "Love For Sale," "Every  Time We Say Goodbye," and "What Is This Thing Called Love") should be out  within the next few weeks. A typical set roams freely from Porter to Parker,  from Jerome Kern to Antonio Carlos Jobim.  </P> <P> 'I'm a song person," Eschete said. "I just like good songs."  </P> <P> Eschete expects to be at the Marriott for at least another three months.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Last Thursday's KPBS-TV "Club Date" taping of jazz/blues singer Mose  Allison marked the start of a series of six new shows. Also slated for taping  are blues greats Hank Crawford with Jimmy McGriff, Tommy Flanagan with George  Maraz, Joe Pass, and Cedar Walton with Billy Higgins . . .

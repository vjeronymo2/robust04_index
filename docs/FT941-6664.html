			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / SIB bans Levitt from securities Mr Roger Levitt, disgraced former chairman of the Levitt Group which collapsed owing Pounds 34m, is the first person to be indefinitely banned from the investment business in the UK, Norma Cohen writes. The Securities and Investments Board said yesterday that, for the first time, it had exercised its powers under section 59 of the Financial Services Act. SIB said its powers under the act did not actually allow it to publicise the names of individuals who are banned but anyone reading the register, kept under section 102 of the act, would be able to keep track of such actions. Mr Levitt was convicted of deceiving Fimbra, the self-regulating body, about the financial condition of his company and was sentenced to 180 hours of community service.</p>

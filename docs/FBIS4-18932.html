			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Snub"] </F>   [Text] Paris -- How many Western politicians have headed to  Beijing with a smile on their lips and their minds filled with  dreams of securing various contracts, only to meet with a rude  awakening when faced with the harsh realities of Chinese  realpolitik? Mr. Balladur is currently going through the same  unpleasant experience. The leaders of the Forbidden City are  past masters in the art of the snub, of contempt, provocation or  -- even better -- a lack of conscience in international  relations.    Faced with leaders for whom foreign policy is no "gala  dinner" but rests essentially on a relationship based on a power  struggle, diplomatic subtleties barely count for anything. Nor  is it merely a question of generously smiling, bowing and  scraping, and making concessions in the hope of being paid back  in return. It is more effective to gain respect by maintaining  a coherent attitude that is firm when required, flexible when  necessary, and -- above all -- by knowing one's dossiers inside  out.    It was obvious to anyone with even the slightest knowledge  of  China that Mr. Balladur was going to run up against the wall of  human rights. The U.S. foreign secretary underwent the same  bitter experience only recently. And yet this experience does  not appear to have been in vain. New dissidents have been put  behind bars, forcing the French prime minister, who had hoped --  wrongly as it turns out -- to limit the debate to a few  generally worded formulations, to devote a large proportion of  his time to that subject, at the expense of laying the  groundwork for the "major contracts" so dearly sought following  the normalization of relations last January.    China has also placed Mr. Balladur in an untenable position  in France, where both his "friends" and the opposition were  awaiting his return without a kind word to say to him. Anyway,  by publishing an interview with Jacques Chirac in THE PEOPLE'S  DAILY NEWS one day after his arrival, Beijing clearly showed  which candidate it is supporting for the presidential election  in 1995. And it is not Mr. Balladur.    China, that major new superpower and product of a new  economic miracle, might have been expected to behave responsibly  -- both in the international arena and at home, where the notion  of freedoms that it defends is only distantly related to the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The remarks made by one  Chinese official regarding the individuals NEWSWEEK had reported  as being condemned to death are enough to send a cold shiver  down anyone's spine: "If the families do not claim their  bodies, we will use them as fertilizer."    However, diplomacy is merely the art of doing what is  possible. And it might have been hoped that the visit by Mr.  Balladur would take greater account of Chinese reality as it  actually is, and less account of a China idealized by its  sycophants and certain businessmen.</p>

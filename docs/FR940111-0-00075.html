Market price-sensitivity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consumers' demand for funerals, of course, is price inelastic. Record evidence indicates, however, that consumers' selections of individual funeral providers, overall types of funeral service, and individual funeral goods and services are price-sensitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumers value available price information in selecting a funeral home and in making specific funeral arrangements, particularly when they receive the price information early in selecting funeral goods and services. With respect to the selection of a provider, 52% of NSM survey respondents in the years 1983&hyph;1988 said that they considered price ``very important'' in their funeral home selection, although other factors appeared to be more important; only 19% considered price unimportant. <FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, ``low-cost'' funeral homes, where they exist, have increased their business substantially in recent years as a direct result of their competitive pricing practices. <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  Regarding the selection of specific goods and services, many consumers are purchasing competitively-priced caskets from third-party sellers when they are available, <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>  are increasingly choosing the significantly less-expensive cremation alternative, <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>  are purchasing significantly fewer caskets and requesting embalming for cremation less frequently than in 1981, <FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>  and are declining items that used to be included in funeral ``packages.'' <FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>  Replication Study consumers who received price information early in the transaction spent $252 less for their specific arrangements than those who did not get that timely information; <FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>  the earlier consumers received price information, the more likely they were to consider the information important to their choices in making funeral arrangements. <FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The analysis is based on R&hyph;J&hyph;11, NSM Summary sheets, Question 1.f. See also, R&hyph;M&hyph;5 at 7&hyph;8. The NSM Survey results are remarkably similar to those of the RS concerning the importance of price. That data indicate that 56% of the survey respondents reported that the cost of funeral arrangements was ``very'' or ``somewhat'' important in their decision to select the funeral home they used; 15% reported that cost was somewhat or very unimportant.

Vol. III, 1269, 1325 (based on the surveys his firm conducts, 85% of his clients choose his funeral home because of its low prices); Peebles, Tr. Vol III, 1551&hyph;1552 (the majority of his customers come to his funeral home because of its competitive prices); Heffner, HX&hyph;33 at 11 and Ex. T (annual funeral calls at the firm he recently purchased have increased 400% as a result of his discount price advertising); and Showalter, Tr. Vol. II, 130 (two discount funeral homes have captured 10% of the market in Phoenix, even though there are some 50 homes in that area, because they offer ``traditional'' funerals for less than $1,200).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 124&hyph;127.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BE analysis showed that cremation selections increased from 11% in 1981 to 14% in 1987, and that the average cremation cost to 1987 respondents was about one-third of the cost of open-casket funerals ($1,054 vs. $2,818). HX&hyph;122 at Table II, p. 6, Table III, p. 7. BE staff noted that the close similarity of the survey results to cremation statistics provided by the CANA suggests that the BLS and RS are representative of the national population.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at n. 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thirty-four percent of cremation buyers in 1981 also purchased caskets, and 35 percent bought embalming services; those selections dropped in 1987 to 19% (caskets) and 25% (embalming). R&hyph;B&hyph;3 (BLS) at Table 3, p. 23; R&hyph;B&hyph;2 (RS) at Table III&hyph;44, p. III&hyph;71 (caskets) and Table III&hyph;42, p. III&hyph;67 (embalming). Similarly, CANA member surveys indicate a reduction in the purchase of caskets for cremation from 22% to 17% between 1983 and 1987, a reduction which the CANA attributed to the Rule. See Kelsey, Tr.

In the first three periods above, 41%, 31%, and 22% of respondents, respectively, said that price information was ``very'' important. The analysis is based on consumers' answers to RS questions 27 (when price information was first received) and 35(c)(5) (importance of price information in arranging the funeral).

Pro-competitive/informational benefits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite the 31% overall industry compliance level with four of the Rule's key requirements <FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>  and the lack of price competition among funeral homes, competitive and informational benefits that are at least partially attributable to the Rule have begun to manifest in the funeral market. Testimonial evidence establishes that the Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure provisions have encouraged third-party casket sellers and low-cost funeral homes to enter the market and have helped them compete, <FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>  in part because the GPL and telephone disclosure requirements permit non-industry entities to gather and publish comparative price data. <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  Many consumers have used that data to select those lower-cost funeral providers and purchase caskets from third-party sellers where they exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 62 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Those four requirements are: to give consumers a timely general price list (&sect;453.2(b)(4)) and itemized statement of goods and services selected (&sect;453.2(b)(5)), and to refrain from misrepresenting the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation (&sect;453.3(a) and 3(b), respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 63 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Radovich, PAA, Tr. Vol. III, 1026, 1029 (virtually no third-party casket sellers existed before the Rule; casket retailers owe their existence primarily to the enactment of the Funeral Rule, which effectively allows the consumer to use a casket from an outside source); Drozda, Tr. Vol. II, 894 (``Sale of caskets through cemeteries is a relatively recent innovation. Prior to the enactment of the Funeral Rule in 1984, we were hardly aware of any cemeteries that sold caskets on their own because of the difficulty in obtaining a funeral home which would accept them and provide funeral services'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Memorial society members, journalists and others testified that collecting comparative funeral price data was, at best, a difficult task before the Rule.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by U.K., S.A.: "Will Promotion Help? Efforts to </F> Enter Difficult Japanese Market"]    [Text] The meeting of both countries' economic  committees demonstrated that, in many areas, cooperation is  developing dynamically, while the Japanese Government's decision  to unblock the granting of guarantees for merchandise contracts  and investment activity in the Polish market may particularly  enliven the cooperation, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  after a meeting with Toshikuni Yahiro, chairman of the  Japanese-Polish Committee.    Polish firms have a chance to enter the Japanese market  provided their products are qualitatively perfect and meet any  standards observed in Japan, and that they know how to win the  confidence of Japanese customers. How this should be  accomplished was the subject of the second day of debates at the  15th Session of Polish and Japanese Economic Committees.    The Japanese stressed that, in the new reality, Poland could  occupy a central position in the region, being placed between  Russia and countries of the European Union. But the Poles  should learn to promote their merchandise because export  capabilities and product competitiveness are a guarantee of  commercial success in the international market. Marketing  success depends on product quality--the Japanese have  particularly high standards in that regard--and on price,  distribution, and promotion, said Hideo Kimura of Sophia  University.    The Japanese will help us with the promotion part. Hajime  Yoshioka, director of the Tokyo International Fair, officially  invited Polish firms to participate in the 1995 fair. Within a  program of acceleration of economic reforms and development of  the countries of Central and East Europe, we can also count on  help in organizing the firms' stay in Tokyo and on product  promotion provided by the JETRO Japanese Foreign Trade Agency.    Speaking about the sources of Japanese success, Hideo Kimura  stressed the role of state interventionism and of management and  collective decisionmaking. He emphasized that state policy and  a specific strategy, as defined by multiyear plans, were being  consistently implemented.    The role of corporations and holdings in the economy is also  worth emphasizing. Only such strong  industrial/commercial/financial organizations are currently  capable of meeting the requirements of international markets.    But, due primarily to a big cultural difference, not all  Japanese experiences can be directly implemented in Poland.  Japan is a large and perfectionist market, while Polish  products are often far from meeting the quality standards in  effect in Japan, Wladyslaw Szczepankowski, chairman of the  Agropol company, told NOWA EUROPA. But my company has been  active in the Japanese market, and we score quite decent  results--$80 million in mutual exchange. We sell mostly grocery  products but also crystal and furniture. But it is hard to  speak of promotion or marketing because that requires very high  expenditures, which Polish producers simply cannot afford.</p>

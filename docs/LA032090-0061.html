			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: ALPHAREL INC. OF CAMARILLO REPORTS $5.19-MILLION LOSS  </P> <P> Alpharel Inc., the struggling Camarillo maker of computer data storage devices,  reported that for the three months that ended Dec. 31, 1989, it lost $5.19  million on sales of $1.01 million, compared to a loss of $2.08 million on sales  of $2.35 million a year earlier. The large loss was due in part to Alpharel's  $3.54-million writedown of some assets.  </P> <P> For the full year 1989, Alpharel said, it lost $12.26 million on sales of $4.38  million. In 1988, Alpharel lost $10.62 million on sales of $5.43 million.  </P> <P> Alpharel also announced that its revenues under a contract with Apple Computer  Inc. would be $200,000 less than previously expected because the scope of the  contract has been reduced.  </P> <P> Alpharel further announced that Robert J. Shea, executive vice president and  chief marketing officer, had left the company "as a continuation of its  restructuring," and his position was eliminated. Alpharel's marketing group  will now report to chief executive John A. Fasching.  </P></p>

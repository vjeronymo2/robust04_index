Alarcon acknowledged France's position during a gathering  with 138 members of a French solidarity airlift to the Caribbean  nation. The French brought a donation of six tons of medicine  and other supplies to this capital.    Alarcon expressed that within French society there are  forces  that favor friendly ties between the two countries, regardless  of the fact that there is no political or ideological  concurrence. He noted, however, common French and Cuban  positions on different issues such as the U.S. blockade against  Cuba, which France has voted against twice at the United  Nations. He added that what is taking place in the island, which  is now experiencing its most difficult and complex moment, must  be a cause of interest for those who hope for a better world, no  matter where they live.    Alarcon stressed that the economic difficulties facing the  country -- mainly the internal financial imbalance, high fiscal  deficit and excess currency -- will be resolved through measures  that preserve the social justice system developed 35 years ago.    Jacques Coubard, assistant chief editor of the daily  L'HUMANITE; Julien Garavito and Helene Duberos, vice president  and secretary general respectively of the France-Cuba Society;  and Communist Senator Jean Garcia from the region of Seine-St.  Denis are among the visitors.    The tour, which began on 30 December and which will conclude  tomorrow, was organized by the daily L'HUMANITE, mouthpiece of  the French Communist Party, and the France-Cuba Society, so that  its members could learn about the Cuban reality first-hand.</p>

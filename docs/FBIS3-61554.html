Malafeyev; UDC 546.791.6+546.799.4]    [Abstract] The distribution of uranyl and plutonium  nitrates and nitric acid in the PUREX process has been well  studied and the results for systems employing 30 percent TBF  (tributyl phosphate) solutions in paraffins have been presented.  However, a gap remains in the published experimental data:  missing are data on the distribution of uranium and plutonium in  this system at higher temperatures. Interest in these data  intensified following publication of a method for the joint  extraction of uranium and plutonium at a higher temperature  (55 C), combining the uranium and plutonium into the  raffinate to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively. This  approach to the extraction of these metals may be used in the  regeneration of spent nuclear fuel. In the present work a study  was made of extraction equilibria in aqueous solutions of  (UO[.sub]2[/])(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]-  Pu(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]4[/]-HNO[.sub]3[/] in 20 and 30  percent TBF in n-dodecane at 25 and 60 C. The data were  obtained in the stable region of a two phase system. The regions  in the vicinity of the critical point were also studied  (formation of a second organic phase at high plutonium nitrate  concentration), as well as the behavior of protactinium in the  system.

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Canada criticised for high tariffs Canada has made considerable strides in liberalising trade and industrial policies but lingering high trade barriers remain an obstacle to growth and job creation, according to the Gatt secretariat in a report published yesterday. The report, the third on Canada's trade policies and practices by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, singles out for criticism high tariffs on imports of farm produce, barriers to trade between the provinces and the proliferation of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits over the last two years. It also expresses concern over Canada's rapidly expanding trade with the US, noting the fears of trading partners that they may be the losers in diversion of trade to the US and Mexico, Canada's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Gatt points out that rising exports have helped fuel Canada's economic recovery since 1992 but this has been largely due to higher deliveries to the US. The US share in Canada's exports has risen from around 75 per cent in 1990 and 1991 to more than 80 per cent in 1993. Exports to other countries stagnated over this period. Worries that Nafta, which came into force at the beginning of this year, could spur trade diversion featured prominently in yesterday's discussion of the report by Gatt's governing council. In reply, Canada said it was trying to diversify its trade, especially towards Asia. Under the Uruguay Round global trade accords, Canada will reduce industrial tariffs by 40 per cent, a little above the average for developed nations. But its farm trade barriers will remain relatively high. In the short to medium term, the dairy, poultry and eggs sectors will be effectively closed to imports, Gatt notes. Over 100 agricultural import quotas will be replaced by tariffs averaging 205 per cent in 1995 and 174 per cent in 2000. The report says the estimated 500 or so inter-provincial trade barriers have become a major problem for Canadian business, hampering the free internal flow of goods and services. It also points out that the number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions has increased markedly since the last report in 1992, largely concentrated on steel. With over 80 anti-dumping measures covering 23 products currently in place, Canada is the third largest user among Gatt members, the report says.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS APPEAL HALFWAY HOUSE PERMIT  </P> <P> As expected, a group of Wilson Park homeowners has appealed a vote by the city  Planning Commission allowing developers to build a 24-bed halfway house for  recovering alcoholics and drug addicts in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> The matter now rests with the City Council, which is expected to decide during  its Sept. 5 meeting.  </P> <P> In its appeal, said Michael Migan, an attorney for the Wilson Park Homeowners  Assn. and other nearby residents, argued that building the recovery facility  would cause property values to drop, traffic to increase and crime rates to  rise.  </P> <P> The appeal cites the fact that more than 650 area residents have signed  petitions expressing their opposition to the project.  </P> <P> "The applicant has not shown why he cannot simply build his drug and alcohol  rehabilitation facility in a more suitable area of Costa Mesa (or in another  city, for that matter)," Migan wrote in his application for an appeal.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission voted 3 to 2 on Aug. 14 to recommend that developers  Don and Dee Ward be given a conditional-use permit to replace the six-bed  facility at 380 W. Wilson St. with a building that would house 24 men and  women.  </P> <P> The Wards, a father-son team who are themselves recovering alcoholics, said  they would go ahead with the project if the City Council approves the Planning  Commission decision.  </P></p>

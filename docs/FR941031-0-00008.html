The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, California raisins are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable raisins handled during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 5,000 producers of California raisins under this marketing order, and approximately 20 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of California raisin producers and a minority of handlers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of California raisins. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected acquisitions of California raisins. Because that rate will be applied to actual acquisitions, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee, with headquarters in Fresno, California, met August 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $1,324,000, which is $744,940 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $123,000 ($90,000), fieldman salaries, $44,000 ($42,600), Payroll taxes, $30,000 ($27,500), employer retirement contribution, $20,000 ($18,200), general insurance, $8,000 ($6,000), group medical insurance, $40,000 ($37,000), rent, $43,000 ($17,900), telephone, $15,000 ($4,000), postage, $20,000 ($12,000), office supplies, $30,000 ($20,000), repairs and maintenance, $10,000 ($5,000), audit fees, $20,000 ($3,600), office travel, $14,000 ($12,000), Committee meeting expenses, $7,500 ($5,000), miscellaneous expense, $15,000 ($10,000), objective measurement survey, $14,750 ($14,000), and reserve for contingencies, $142,400 ($55,810). The Committee also recommended employee benefit expenses of $2,500 and export program funding of $50,000 for travel and $350,000 for foreign program administration, for which no funding was recommended last year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghan guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only paved road from Kabul to  Jalalabad, the Afghan government said, disrupting supplies to the city chosen  as the rebels' first major objective after the Soviet troop withdrawal was  completed last month. But a spokesman said that three other roads, all unpaved  and more circuitous, remain open. He said the bridge near Sarobi, about midway  between the capital and Jalalabad, 75 miles to the east, was one of about 100  on the highway. Muslim rebels launched their offensive against Jalalabad on  March 6, but their drive has bogged down in the face of strong opposition.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 18 TASS -- Pacific Fleet officers  have appealed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin to reconsider  the sacking of the fleet commander, Admiral Georgiy Gurinov.    The appeal was adopted today at a meeting of the officers of  the fleets headquarters and administration. The message says  that despite the complicated situation, especially after the  blast at the fleet's ammunition storage facilities, Admiral  Gurinov during his brief term of office succeeded in stopping  the worsening of combat capability of the fleet's ships and  units, stabilising the training, lowering the incidence of  traumas and the rate of death among the servicemen.    The appeal stresses that Admiral Gurinov was attentive to  the  needs and interests of the servicemen while demanding discipline  at all levels. This is why the officers and admirals of the  Russian Pacific Fleet are sure that the fleet needs Admiral  Gurinov as its commander, whose moral and professional authority  is recognised by the force.    Admiral Gurinov was relieved of his duties on Tuesday, and  Vice- Admiral Igor Khmelnov was appointed acting commander of  the fleet. According to sources in the Russian Defence Ministry,  the sacking came after President Boris Yeltsin's unwritten order.</p>

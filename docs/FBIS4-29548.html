			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A senior North Korean  official told a visiting Japanese group in Pyongyang on Friday  it is "impossible" for North Korea to challenge the U.S. nuclear  arsenal, officials of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said.  The LDP officials said Hwang Chang-yop, a secretary of the  (North) Korean Workers' Party [WPK], made the observation in a  meeting with an LDP mission led by former Defense Agency chief  Taku Yamasaki.    Hwang also reportedly told the LDP group that it is  "meaningless" for his country to have nuclear weapons. He  proposed an end to power diplomacy and warned that North Korea  will retaliate if economic sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang,  according to the LDP officials who talked with the Yamasaki  group after the meeting in the North Korean capital.    Yamasaki explained Japan's commitment to the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized that a nuclear-free  Korean peninsula is essential for peace and stability in North  Asia, the LDP officials in Tokyo said.</p>

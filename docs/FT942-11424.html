			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Textiles easier Courtaulds Textiles shed 9 to 546p in spite of a confident annual statement from a traditionally cautious chairman. The shares have traded within a 50-point range for more than a year and underperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index by 10 per cent over 12 months. They held up well for most of the day but reacted to the sharp fall in the FT-SE 100 Index late in the afternoon. Smith New Court has highlighted the stock as its key recommendation in its latest sector review, arguing that general concerns over the rising price of raw materials are overstated. Coats Viyella, which is to hold its annual meeting today, lost 6 at 232p.</p>

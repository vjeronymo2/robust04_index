			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The National Council of  Christian Churches of South Korea released a statement Wednesday  denouncing the U.S. imperialists for heightening the situation  with each passing day, according to a radio report from Seoul.    In the statement published in the name of the reunification  committee it said the recent tension on the Korean peninsula is  attributable to the wrong international order orchestrated by a  nuclear power. The "nuclear issue" should be solved through  dialogue, not by means of pressure or "sanctions", it stressed.    The statement urged that "the United States should give up  its dream of settling the North's `nuclear issue' through  sanctions and war."    It also urged the "government" authorities to make sincere  efforts for reconciliation and unity, understanding that those  in the North are fellow countrymen with the same blood and  brothers who should work together to build a reunified country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamud Munsir: "Danger of Tribal Dispute and </F> Political Isolation Threaten Yemeni Reform Grouping"]    [Text] Sanaa -- The Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] -- the  third partner in the ruling coalition in Sanaa -- is faced with  two problems: One at the tribal level, namely with the main  tendency in its formation, and another at the political level.  The two problems threaten to reduce its role in power in the  future as a result of the tribal dispute between the Hashid  tribe, from which the grouping's leadership comes, and the Bakil  tribe. And also because of the external moves and bilateral  contacts between its partners in power: The General People's  Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. [passage  omitted)    Corroborated information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says  that the Nasirite Unionist Party -- an opposition party -- has  not yet decided to open a dialogue with the YRG, because the  latter is a partner in government. Meanwhile the YRG feels  isolated because of its exclusion from many of the consultations  inside the ruling coalition, especially after the YSP sensed  some contradictions between the GPC and the Reform Grouping and  thus began to exploit them.    However, observers point to a kind of breakthrough toward a  solution to the crisis in the light of the mediation efforts  made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. They expect a  meeting to be held between President Salih and Vice President  al-Bid in Cairo at the beginning of next month at the latest to  restore stability to Yemen before the unity anniversary on 22  May.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Biotrace shares jump 17p Shares in Biotrace International rose 17p to 152p yesterday after the microbiological testing company, which was floated in November, said that sales to date of its Uni-Lite system were ahead of expectations. Biotrace said it was encouraged by Uni-Lite's results, which followed the first marketing phase of the system in the US by the Klenzade division of Ecolab, the company's new marketing partner. Sales to date were 'substantially ahead' of the original plan. In the UK, Biotrace had secured new key accounts with Carlsberg-Tetley, Hazlewoods and Hillsdown.</p>

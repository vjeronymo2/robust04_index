			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Branching out at Delta What would Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council and Postel Investment Management, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank and the Commercial Union, non-executive director at Marks &amp; Spencer et al, want with a non Footsie company involved in power cables, circuit protection and extrusions? Sir Martin, who turns 64 next month, was yesterday named chairman designate of electrical engineer Delta, 'a very fine little company' which interests him given the 'vital importance of the manufacturing sector at this juncture'. A distinguished City grandee, Jacomb was obviously wooed by Delta for something other than his skills in electrical engineering. As chairman of BZW, he knew the company well, though it was not until after he stood down from the BZW post, in 1991, that Delta changed its merchant banking advisers from Kleinwort Benson to BZW. He certainly fits into a line of rather pukka Delta chairmen - and luckily has the right school-tie. Lord Caldecote, Delta chairman for a decade from 1972, is an old Etonian, as is outgoing chairman Geoffrey Wilson, who is the son of Lord Moran, Churchill's doctor. Jacomb was in the same year at Eton as Wilson, although the two only got to know each other much later. If Jacomb seems to have his plate full already - he is also on the board of the Daily Telegraph and RTZ - it could well be that the Delta job presages a shift away from other commitments. Now that the top job at Barclays has been split, and Martin Taylor brought in as chief executive, it may be that Jacomb will not tarry long on the clearing bank board.</p>

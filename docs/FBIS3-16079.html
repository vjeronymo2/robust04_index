However, no final document was adopted.    State Duma's First Deputy Speaker, Mikhail Mityukov, who  chaired the session, proposed to vote for continuation of the  session's work after its time had expired (at 18:00). However,  the majority of deputies rejected the proposal.    The final document may be adopted at the State Duma's next  plenary session on March 16 Wednesday.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Letter: Arms to Iraq - the complex objectives and high cost Sir, One moral of the Matrix Churchill affair is liable to be lost among the excitement about 'cover-ups': if government departments believe they have a simple objective, such as increasing British exports, they are liable to behave foolishly. Mr Alan Clark appears to be doing little more than express a departmental view when he says his job as minister of trade was 'to maximise exports despite guidelines which I regarded as tiresome and intrusive'. Prime ministers should ensure that ministers understand that the national interest, and therefore government policy, represents a balance between conflicting objectives and interests; and officials should understand this fact. Simple objectives such as increasing UK exports are only appropriate as low-level objectives for low-level staff. Other considerations should be fed into the decision process before issues reach ministers; if they are not, the ministers should demand that they are. Matrix Churchill represents a failure of leadership. Junior ministers and officials were allowed to work on the over-simple objective of maximising British exports because no superior told them otherwise; and the injection of other considerations usually came from junior foreign office ministers. The Foreign Office sometimes won the subsequent debates, where weapons were involved; but the guidance from above seems to have been that exports were always good. The prime minister and his cabinet should realise that they can only avoid repetition of such embarrassments if they work to more complex and adult objectives and ensure their officials do so too.

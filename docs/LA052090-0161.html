			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / SAM FARMER;  </P> <P> CITY BASEBALL SEEDINGS PRODUCE BITTER FRUIT FOR POLY IN FIRST-ROUND UPSET  </P> <P> To hear Jerry Cord tell it, Taft High should not have been sharing the same  field with Poly.  </P> <P> At least not in a first-round game of the City Section 4-A Division baseball  playoffs.  </P> <P> Taft's competence was not in question: The Toreadors proved they were worthy  Friday, upsetting top-seeded Poly, 7-6, in 12 innings.  </P> <P> Cord, Poly's coach, takes exception only to what he says was a last-minute  switcheroo by City Section officials. By Cord's understanding, Poly was to open  against North Hollywood, the second-seeded wild-card team. Taft, seeded No. 1  among the four wild cards, was to play El Camino Real.  </P> <P> Poly and North Hollywood are both in the East Valley League and had played each  other three times this season; El Camino Real and Taft are in the West Valley  League. In an effort to add variety to the playoffs, the seeding system was  scrapped and the pairings were changed to pit Poly against Taft and El Camino  Real against North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Cord, who scouted the North Hollywood-Granada Hills game Wednesday, did not  learn of the new pairings until he got a call from El Camino Real Coach Mike  Maio on Thursday.  </P> <P> "He called and asked me who I thought we were playing Friday," Cord said.  </P> <P> Maio said he learned of the rescheduling when he called City officials Thursday  to confirm his opponent and site.  </P> <P> "We knew nothing about Taft," Cord said Saturday, clearly aggravated. "We  didn't care because we were told we weren't going to play them."  </P> <P> Still, Cord offered no excuses for the loss. Poly (22-3) stranded 16 runners,  including two in the 10th and 11th innings. The Parrots also yielded six  unearned runs, each of which scored with two out.  </P> <P> "When you can't make that third out you don't deserve to win," he said. "We  hadn't played like that all year long, not even close to that."  </P> <P> Add Poly: Cord might consider the playoff format a form of gerrymandering, but  City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness is largely unsympathetic.  </P> <P> Harkness said the decision was made by the coaches in a meeting May 9.  </P> <P> "(The coaches) were adamant that they wanted to play teams that were not in  their own conference," he said. "We said if the wild-card teams work out that  way, then we'll do it.  </P> <P> "We seeded to their wishes. The bottom line is, what difference does it make  who you play in a first-round game? Baseball is baseball.  </P> <P> "If the wild-card situation continues to be a problem, then we'll eliminate the  wild card from the playoffs and just take the first- and second-place teams."  </P> <P> Puffy-eyed prognosticator: Maio, who is also co-coach of the El Camino Real  football team, played fortune teller last fall when he informed the football  team of his three dreams. In each, the Conquistadores upset mighty Granada  Hills. Lo and behold, the team defeated the Highlanders in the playoffs.  </P> <P> No predictions for baseball, however -- the soothsayer is sleepless.  </P> <P> "Right now, I'm just staying up all night," he said. "I haven't had time to  dream."  </P> <P> Walk on the wild side: Kate Stoll hurled a no-hitter Friday to lead Ribet  Academy to a 7-3 defeat of Oakwood in a Southern Section Small Schools softball  playoff game. No one could touch her pitches, including, at times, her own  catcher. Stoll walked 14 batters, which explains Oakwood's three runs.  </P> <P> "Kate's not a pitcher and she does it because we have nobody else," Ribet Coach  Judy Howard said of the converted catcher. "She's doing this because she's  naturally talented."  </P> <P> Natural talent or not, you can bet Stoll wouldn't want to catch those pitches.  </P> <P> Absolute absolution: It seems Westlake third baseman Todd Preston redeems  himself more often than a recycled aluminum can. Three times this season,  Preston has committed a crucial error in a game and come back to drive in the  winning run in that game.  </P> <P> Preston is batting a cool .197 with 13 hits in 66 at-bats. He has, however,  made the most of his precious few hits, driving in 15 runs.  </P> <P> Friday against Mira Costa, Preston committed errors on the game's first two  ground balls, which led to two unearned runs. Later, Preston absolved himself  by rapping an RBI double in the sixth that broke a 4-4 tie. Westlake won, 6-5.  </P> <P> Preston executed similarly against Camarillo and Thousand Oaks this season.  </P> <P> Noted Coach Rich Herrera: "When he does get the hit, he does do the damage."  </P> <P> Thriving on diving: John Kiani and Katie Savage, seniors at Granada Hills High,  plunged to City diving championships recently at Venice High. Both Highlanders  are used to success, however.  </P> <P> This was Kiani's third consecutive City title; he has not lost in high school  competition. Kiani won this year with a score of 491.90 for 11 dives.  </P> <P> This was Savage's first City title but it helped erase the disappointment of a  fourth-place finish last year. She posted an upset this year with a score of  492.00.  </P> <P> "In warmups she was missing every dive," said Tom Wagner, the Granada Hills  swim coach. "But her first dive was outstanding and from then on she did  fantastic."  </P> <P> Kiani and Savage are members of the Los Angeles Diving Team and receive expert  instruction from Coach Van Austin. Savage is also coached by Dennis Taylor.  </P> <P> "Van Austin comes to our meets and actually coaches them even though he isn't  connected with the high school," Wagner said.  </P> <P> Their hard work has paid off in diving scholarships. Kiani will attend  Michigan; Savage is headed for Nebraska.  </P> <P> Although Birmingham has long been a City diving power, Granada Hills has been  best off the board for several years. Savage followed in the footsteps of Janet  Lautenschlager, who won the City title in 1988. Lautenschlager, now at Arizona  State, finished seventh in Division I this year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Janine Lazarus] </F>   [Excerpts] Police fear South Africa could be on the brink  of a new drugs craze with the re-emergence of a deadly  translucent powder called ice. [passage omitted]    This, the latest "designer drug" to find its way on to the  streets, last surfaced several years ago when a man was arrested  in Johannesburg for being in possession of a small amount of the  powder.    SANAB's [South African Narcotics Bureau] Cape Town branch  commander Captain Hennie Marais says use of the drug in this  country could become a massive problem. "In Europe and America,  usage has reached epidemic proportions." He says addicts are  inclined to test anything new on the market. "If he can afford  it, he will test it."    Captain Eddie Lightfoot, who heads Johannesburg's Drug Unit,  says international drug syndicates are always looking for new  destinations. "Now that South Africa has opened up, I think  people are looking at using the country as a drug base and a  possible conduit to other countries." [passage omitted]    The drug, which can either be injected when mixed with water  that is then heated up, smoked or taken orally, is also known as  "glass crystal", "candy" or "poor man's cocaine"--although it is  not a cocaine derivative. Sold in five sachets each containing  0.2 g, ice's street value is between R[Rand]30 and R35 per  sachet, or about R150 a gram.</p>

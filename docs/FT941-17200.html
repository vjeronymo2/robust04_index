			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Government may review its use of private consultants The government is considering launching a wide-ranging review of how departments award consultancy work, which is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 100m a year. The Cabinet Office's efficiency unit is looking at whether private consultants are giving taxpayers value for money, how consultants are appointed and whether there is scope to make the system more competitive, according to a senior official. Whitehall departments are increasingly taking on management consultants, merchant banks and accountants as outside advisers on big projects. In many cases the government is the biggest customer of private consultancies. Senior civil servants from all government departments which use outside consultancies, such as the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, would be involved in any review. An investigation into the use of the private consultancies would be the government's strongest response to date to criticism that lucrative private contracts are often made on an ad hoc basis. An increasing number of government departments have taken to hiring merchant banks and accountants. The DTI for example, hired Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, and KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, to advise it over the future of the Post Office, while the Department for Education recently took on Rothschild, another UK merchant bank, to look at ways of attracting private investment. Whitehall officials predict that the government's determination to break new ground in developing public sector projects with private finance and to contract many services to the private sector as part of its market testing programme will lead to more contracts for consultancies. 'The efficiency unit is already looking at whether these consultancies offer value for money' said a Whitehall official. Private companies have also been used to advise government on significant political changes, such as the reform of the National Health Service, which has seen a large increase in the use of consultancies.</p>

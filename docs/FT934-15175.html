			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Germany The German constitutional court decision on the Maastricht Treaty was at the benign end of the spectrum as far as the markets were concerned. There is no need for a referendum, and such conditions as the court did impose were not onerous. So it seems surprising that the main beneficiary at the end of the day should have been the D-Mark, rather than the other European currencies which stand to gain from monetary union. One reason may be that while the court has done nothing to impede European currency union, its decision has not actually hastened it either. Economic convergence remains some way off. The D-Mark will also retain a certain safe-haven status as long as France clings to untenable interest rates. Finally, the court decision has no immediate bearing on monetary policy. Inflation and money supply growth are heading lower, but after yesterday's 6 per cent wage demand by the IG Metall engineering union, the Bundesbank still has reason for caution over interest rate cuts.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS in the derivatives reported a dull but volatile session which saw turnover return to more modest levels, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the December Footsie contract opened strongly at 2,495 following the sizeable overnight bounce on Wall Street, the improved performance of sterling and a squeeze as several dealers moved to cover short positions. After a brief reversal which followed a bout of profit taking, the contract traded in a narrow range of 2,500 and 2,520 for the next few hours with traders seeing 2,510 as a selling opportunity. The poor opening on Wall Street led to a sharp decline in December in the afternoon when the contract fell to 2,487, the low point of the day before bargain hunting helped steady nerves and led to a recovery, though this was curtailed by a large selling order at the close in which traders continued to deal in after hours trading. December closed at 2,511, up 51 on Monday's poor close but around 6 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was a meagre 7,300 contracts. Turnover in traded options reached a poor 24,629, down sharply on Monday's total of 40,670 lots. Some 8,723 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 options contract, while Amstrad was the busiest stock option at 2,140 trades.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Wellcome There has always been more to Wellcome than its Retrovir anti-viral drug. Judging by the market's enthusiastic reception for yesterday's figures - the shares outstripped even the 10 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits - the group may finally have pushed this message home. It was Zovirax, an older anti-viral drug, which proved the engine of an impressive performance, sales rising nearly 30 per cent in local currency terms. Adjusting for currency and the extra week last year, sales in the prescription and consumer divisions rose by 18 and 11 per cent respectively. And as dosage levels stabilise, Retrovir should resume the heady growth of the late 1980s. The new management cannot yet rest on its laurels. Attempts to squeeze costs out of the business are by no means complete, in spite of the gratifying rise in operating margins to 24.3 per cent. Indeed, without an Pounds 8m pension surplus benefit, taken directly into UK trading profit, the margin would have been a full point lower. Put another way, the pension fund contributed 47 per cent of the profits rise. A similar surplus will boost the second half and the foreseeable future, but will be accounted for separately in the full-year figures. Assuming Pounds 370m pre-tax this year, yesterday's rise leaves the shares on a prospective p/e of 21, or a 44 per cent premium to the market. Glaxo, which has out-performed the market by nearly as much as Wellcome has under-performed it since the start of 1990, is on a lesser premium of around 30 per cent; but Wellcome is starting from a lower base and seems to be growing more rapidly. The rating looks justified.</p>

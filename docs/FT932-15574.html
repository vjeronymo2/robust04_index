			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Haggling on Nafta unlikely to satisfy opponents TRADE officials from the US, Canada and Mexico today will resume negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, although the labour and environment side pacts being proposed by the US are unlikely to mollify the strong opposition to the pact in the US Congress. According to a senior US trade official, the negotiators, meeting in Mexico City this week, will 'put flesh on the skeleton' of ideas for the supplemental pacts, discussed in Washington in mid-March. The Clinton administration will propose to establish trilateral commissions, to promote supervision and co-operation on labour and environment. The commissions could produce reports, which would not be binding, and 'the kind of transparency and scrutiny of what governments are doing that would ensure that non-enforcement would be much harder to justify,' the official said. 'Ultimately we feel there would be a need for some sort of dispute settlement between governments in situations where these international commissions reveal problems that are not being attended to on a consistent basis.' Although the administration is 'very carefully' studying whether to allow governments to impose sanctions - one demand which tops the lists of most of the Nafta's environment and labour advisers - there is still widespread scepticism about the side pacts. 'The Clinton people boxed themselves into a corner politically by promising not to change any of the original agreement,' said one Nafta opponent. 'Not only has the administration inherited all of the problems of the package negotiated by the Bush administration, it is doing little to correct it.' Ms Leesteffy Jenkins, legal adviser on trade to the Humane Society, complained of 'disingenuous' replies received during last week's briefing by a senior trade official when she asked whether the side agreements would specify the legitimacy of 'process standards' of the type which ban the import of Mexican tuna caught in drift nets. 'For an administration that was so renowned for its political cunning, I'm very confused,' said Ms Lori Wallach of Public Citizen. 'In the face of not only public opposition, but congressional demands, why are they not doing something major to turn Bush's Nafta into Clinton's Nafta?'</p>

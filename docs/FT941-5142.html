			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Gates scorns most multimedia trials Mr Bill Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, yesterday poured cold water on the value of most of the 'multi-media' trials in the US and Europe. Describing the current flush of interest in multimedia as a form of collective mania, he predicted that trials based on home entertainment would prove to be dead ends and would be counter-productive to the establishment of a viable multimedia industry. Multimedia and 'information superhighway' are descriptions of developments expected to lead to the delivery of a range of interactive services and information to the office and the home through a single channel - a telephone line, for example. Multimedia has generated considerable attention over the past six months as companies in the entertainment, communications and computer sectors have formed expensive alliances to exploit the possibilities. Mr Gates, believed to be the richest man in the US and with a record as a technology forecaster, said many of the companies experimenting with multimedia were misguided in concentrating on single services, such as 'video-on-demand', rather than a broad range, and on the home rather than business. 'Video-on-demand' implies that customers will be able to select videos of their choice from an electronic library and have them delivered to their television sets. 'The first place for widespread usage of this technology will be in business. It will involve low-cost video conferencing, electronic mail and group networking. Once business is using multimedia, then we can move to the home environment.' 'He expected early pilots to be disappointing. 'The revenues generated and the usage will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.' Mr Gates, in the UK to talk to British Telecommunications among others about multimedia collaboration, was speaking only a week after the start of largest video-on-demand trial, organised by Time Warner, the US cable television organisation, was postponed until the autumn. Mr Gates' comments must be seen in the light of Microsoft's ambitions to set the agenda in multimedia, in which it is investing some Dollars 100m a year. It has announced that it will test its software in collaboration with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator. Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on the investment for five years.</p>

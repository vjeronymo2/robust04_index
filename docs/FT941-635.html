			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Headlam surges to Pounds 3.7m on the back of acquisition profits Headlam, the acquisitive fabrics and flooring distribution group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in annual profits following first-time contributions by new subsidiaries. For the year to end-December pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 1.1m) on turnover up from Pounds 58.8m to Pounds 107m. The group, which has acquired 13 companies in the past two years, said full-year profits from 1992 acquisitions and partial contributions from subsidiaries purchased last year boosted operating profits to Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 1.72m). Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the fabrics division had enjoyed the sharpest growth with profits increasing from Pounds 705,000 to Pounds 2.4m. The flooring division - enlarged by acquisitions in Scotland and the Midlands during the year - contributed Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.4m) to group operating profits. 'It has captured 15 per cent of the national distribution market despite a fairly flat UK market place,' said Mr Kirkham. Improved performances by both divisions were offset by a Pounds 242,000 loss at R Coggins, the footwear business, which was sold off last year. While concentrating on its core businesses, the group is also understood to be considering an expansion into furnishing fabrics - a sector where it has identified several possible acquisitions. Such purchases would be financed from borrowings or net cash of Pounds 3.6m left over from the group's Pounds 5.1m rights issue last year. Earnings increased to 8p (3.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.35p makes a 3.2p (2.6p) total.</p>

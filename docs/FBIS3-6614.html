			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of 19 March, the government has decided to give  its positive support to the ROK for its candidacy to become a  nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC] in 1995.  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to tell this to ROK  President Kim Yong-sam, who is scheduled to visit Japan  beginning 24 March.    Japan is not a nonpermanent member of the UNSC at present,  but it will become eligible for membership in 1995. However,  with regard to being a nonpermanent member, which strongly  implies being a regional representative, the government has  decided to turn over the right to represent Asia to the ROK and  to concentrate on winning permanent membership for itself.    There are 10 nonpermanent member states of the UNSC. They  differ from the five permanent member states (the United States,  Great Britain, France, Russia, and China) in that they do not  possess veto rights, but they can always participate in the UNSC  deliberations.    The term for nonpermanent members is two years, and half of  the members are elected every year. Together with Pakistan,  Japan served as the representative of Asia until last December.    It has so far been said within the government that "at a  time  when Japan is intending to apply for permanent membership, this  will be a serious blow because Japan will not be able to obtain  sufficient information" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry  source). Based on this viewpoint, it has been said that to  maintain contacts with the UNSC, Japan should try to remain on  the UNSC as a nonpermanent member for as long as possible and  until a definite decision has been made on its becoming a  permanent member.    On the other hand, it has also been said that because Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at last year's UN General Assembly  session "indicated Japan's intention to become a permanent  member rather than insisting for some reasons [not further  specified] on serving as a nonpermanent member, Japan should  concentrate its efforts on seeking permanent membership" (as  stated by a Foreign Ministry source).    Under such circumstances, when ROK Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu visited Japan last September, he disclosed the ROK's  intention to apply for nonpermanent membership on the UNSC and  and sought Japan's support in this.    In this connection, the decision has been made based on the  assessment that it would be better to win Asian nations'  understanding, which is indispensable to Japan's winning  permanent membership, by supporting the ROK's position.</p>

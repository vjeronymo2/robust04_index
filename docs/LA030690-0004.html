			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARY MERRILL; COLORFUL STAGE, SCREEN ACTOR  </P> <P> Actor Gary Merrill, known for his supporting roles in the movies "Twelve  O'Clock High" and "All About Eve" and for his stormy marriage to actress Bette  Davis, died Monday of cancer at age 74.  </P> <P> Merrill, who moved to Maine in 1965 and spent most of his time playing golf and  reading poetry in schools, died at his home, a small cottage overlooking the  sea in the wealthy Portland suburb of Falmouth Foreside.  </P> <P> The colorful, spirited actor appeared in 42 films during a career of more than  40 years.  </P> <P> His last stage appearance was on Broadway in 1980 in a revival of the play  "Mornings at Seven" with Maureen O'Sullivan.  </P> <P> Merrill began his acting career on stage in 1937. His first movie role was in  "Winged Victory" in 1944. He went on to "Twelve O'Clock High" in 1949 and "All  About Eve," which starred Miss Davis and won the best-picture Academy Award in  1950.  </P> <P> Merrill's other movie roles included parts in "Phone Call From a Stranger,"  1953; "Blueprint for Murder," 1953; "Bermuda Affair," 1956 and "Around the  World Under the Sea," 1966.  </P> <P> On television, he played the gruff but understanding Dr. Gillespie in the  "Young Dr. Kildare" series and narrated "The Valiant Years" series about  Winston Churchill.  </P> <P> Merrill met Miss Davis in "All About Eve" -- he played her lover -- and married  her the day his divorce from his first wife became final. He and Davis divorced  in 1960.  </P> <P> Merrill, a native of Hartford, Conn., prided himself on an inactive life style,  telling an interviewer in 1981, "I've spent my life doing as little as  possible. . . . And I intend to keep doing exactly the same thing."  </P> <P> Merrill is survived by his son, Michael, of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter,  Margot, of Geneva, N.Y.; a brother, Jerry, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and two  grandchildren.  </P></p>

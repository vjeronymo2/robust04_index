			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television THOUGH the drama series Boys From The Bush is set mainly in Australia, it has many of the attributes of Minder: the same sort of rough diamond characters, a similar semi-criminal sub-culture, and much of the comedy. In today's episode, the last, the Toomers are back in Oz and Dennis finds that while he was in Shepherd's Bush, Reg was heading for the Australian bush, having sold his share of the business to his wife Corrie (9.30 BBC1). At Lewisham borough council, host to BBC2's cameras in Town Hall, procrastination among the Labour group in the setting of budgets finally drives the professional staff to threaten legal sanctions. Deputy leader Dave Sullivan, in charge while the Labour leader is on holiday, says he will do all he can to confuse matters (9.45). BBC1 repeats its startling documentary Marilyn Monroe: Say Goodbye To The President (10.20). It throws doubt on her suicide, fingers the Mafia, and investigates her affairs with Jack and Bobby Kennedy. The BBC asserts that since its first showing in 1985 it has never been seriously challenged, factually or legally. Viewpoint 92 is about the pursuit of wealth (10.40 ITV).</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Ringed by Coast Guard vessels and a tugboat with pollution booms aboard, a  Greek tanker began its journey to dry dock, nine days after hitting a rock and  spilling 420,000 gallons of oil into the ocean near Newport, R.I. A  Narragansett Bay pilot was aboard as the World Prodigy made its way out of the  treacherous waters surrounding Brenton Reef. The tanker's captain, who faces  federal charges of violating pollution laws, has admitted he made a mistake in  not having a pilot aboard when the accident occurred on the afternoon of June  23. The ship will be repaired at New York Shipyard Corp., on the site of the  old Brooklyn Navy Yard.  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Giants jostle for a place to grow: Trends shaping strategic thinking in the computer industry The world's computer industry, still reeling from three years of recession, seems set to enter a new, dramatically different, phase. That at any rate seems to be the conviction of Mr Bill Gates, the restless and relentlessly ambitious chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest and best known software house. In the past few months he has struck a series of deals with cable companies, telecommunications companies and satellite organisations, which suggest he wants his software applied in areas far removed from the personal computer operating systems for which it is best known. He has also instituted a company-wide reorganisation of Microsoft's sales and marketing methods. And in what seems a spectacularly speculative move, he is putting his own money into a venture with Mr Craig McCaw, developer of the US's largest cellular telephone company, aimed at creating a global satellite system for data communication. Meanwhile, Novell, a smaller, less charismatic software house, has this week struck a number of deals intended to transform it from the industry's leading network specialist to a broad-based software house. Novell's moves are fuelling speculation that Microsoft faces its first serious challenger in a decade. Another view, however, is that Novell has made its move too late. Novell paid Dollars 1.4bn of its own stock for WordPerfect, another Utah-based company which was once market leader in word processing software. It also paid Borland International, another large US software developer, Dollars 145m for its 'Quatro Pro' word processing software and the rights to sell to Borland's database programs. The acquisition of WordPerfect gives Novell combined revenues of about Dollars 1.9bn compared with Microsoft's Dollars 3.75bn. Novell's moves appear, in turn, to have acted as a spur to Microsoft. Apparently driven by fears that the company was falling behind Novell and other competitors in the software industry, including Lotus Development Corporation and Electronic Arts, in marketing, sales and support strategies, Mr Gates demanded more aggression and competitiveness from his employees. The company needed to take decisions and act on them faster, he wrote: 'It is better to take action, make mistakes and be forgiven than to wait and ask for permission'. (Microsoft's competitors may feel this is rich from a company currently under investigation by the US Justice Department for alleged anti-competitive practices.) Within days of Mr Gates' comments, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of International Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, set out IBM's plans to fight horrendous losses and re-establish a role. (see below). The impression created is of computer industry giants jostling for postion in an increasingly competitive business. The problem each faces is that it is unclear what strategy will prove most effective in the face of three broad trends. First, industry leaders expect hardware and software manufacturing to be concentrated increasingly in the hands of a few large players. Mr Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, which makes personal computers, sees conventional mainframes and minicomputers being replaced by networks of personal computers and powerful network 'servers' based on increasingly sophisticated PC technology. IBM, Apple and Compaq represent today's premier division; others will be hard put to displace them. In the software market, Novell has this week reinforced its position among a handful of large companies - Microsoft, Computer Associates, Oracle and Lotus Development Corporation - intent on carving up the cake between them. At the same time, consolidation is creating specialist powerhouses; the leaders in desktop publishing Aldus Corporation and Adobe Systems have agreed to merge, as have Electronic Arts and Broderbund Software, experts in educational software. There will be room, however, for small software houses, because as Mr Rosen, a founding director of Lotus, the developer of the best-selling spreadsheet 1-2-3, says: 'Talented software designers do not like working for big companies.' Second, the spread of common standards and sophisticated software has allowed the development of programs which integrate with other manufacturers' systems. Here Novell is in a strong position, dominating the market in networking software. It also owns the rights to Unix, networking software originally developed for minicomputers which many believe ideal for today's more powerful PCs to run company-wide networks. Microsoft has until recently had only a token presence in networking software. A new operating system it has developed called Windows NT, may redress the balance. Third, and possibly the most significant development, has been the emergence of small and medium-sized companies and individuals as prime consumers of personal computers and their software. For the past 40 years the computer industry has supplied the data processing business - the administrative systems of big companies. Now as hardware and software prices fall rapidly, individuals and small organisations are buying personal computers faster than big businesses. This provides a powerful logic to Microsoft's recent acquisitions and alliances. It is developing multimedia products with Tele-Communications, the US cable operator; it bought Soft Image, creators of computer generated scenes in the film Jurassic Park; this week it invested Dollars 30m in an advanced wireless data network being built by Mobile Telecommunications Technologies. These acquisitions signify a determined move to provide and control the software that will manage informations flows - business data, education, news and entertainment - into the home and office. Microsoft's software would become ubiquitous: controlling radio communications, cable and satellite links as well as telecommunications lines and compact disks. Mr Gates says there is usually an eight-year gap between him spotting an opportunity and the profits flowing: 'For some reason, I think this will happen faster than that'. Novell's strategy is different. It is taking Microsoft on in the traditional business of data processing. The rewards seem likely to be reasonable but the possibilities are limited. If Mr Gates is right about the future of the industry, Novell will have invested in the wrong market.</p>

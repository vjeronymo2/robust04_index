			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Irish parties in coalition talks Ireland's Labour party, the junior partner in the outgoing government, yesterday held talks with both Fianna Fail, its former coalition partner, and the conservative Fine Gael, the main opposition party, in the first steps to break the deadlock over the search for a new government. Fine Gael leader John Bruton described the talks as preliminary. A new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is still seen by most observers as the most likely outcome. However, Labour's meeting with Fine Gael has raised the prospect that the party may be prepared to accept the suggestion by Labour, the smaller of the two, that Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, be appointed as 'rotating' prime minister in a rainbow coalition of several parties. With the Dail, the Irish parliament, due to vote on the issue next Wednesday, the politicians are under mounting pressure to agree terms for a new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition last week and the resignation as prime minister of Mr Albert Reynolds. There was speculation last night that Mr Spring, who was foreign minister under the old coalition, will demand a new carve up of ministerial portfolios as his price for re-entering a coalition with Fianna Fail. Labour is said to want finance, while Mr Spring may head a newly established Northern Ireland ministry, as well as an 'open government' portfolio.</p>

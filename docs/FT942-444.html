			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / People: John Page moves from the grass roots to advise Barclays John Page, the next head of agricultural services at Barclays Bank, believes British farmers can best survive the rigours of the CAP reform by knowing precisely what market they are producing for. Page, 53, who takes over in September, comes from the agrochemicals side of the industry. He has been director of the British Agrochemicals Association since 1989, which has meant regular contact with the agriculture ministry and the departments of environment and trade and industry. The 24-strong agricultural services department of Barclays focuses on the financial and policy outlook for agriculture, advising branches on agricultural lending and farmers on business management. 'It's going to be a very exciting time for British agriculture, with new crops and new opportunities,' says Page. 'I think farming should move away from the concentration on commodities towards growing specialist crops on contract, with the purpose for which they are grown very much in mind from planting onwards. That will reduce the dependence on (financial) support that some sectors have now.' Page does not work the soil himself. But his grandfather was an Essex farmer and Page worked on a farm for two years while studying for a national diploma from the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. From there he joined a seed, fertiliser and agrochemicals distributor as a sales representative before moving to ICI Agrochemicals as technical development and marketing manager. He then became general manager of Atlas Interlates, a company which develops and markets agro-chemicals. At Barclays he replaces Paul Ingram, who is retiring.</p>

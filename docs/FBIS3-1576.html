			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Mainland Dissidents Have Been Warned Repeatedly; </F> Wei Jingsheng Refuses To Yield to Pressure, His Present  Whereabouts Are Unknown"]    [Text] Before the visit to China by U.S. officials  responsible for human rights affairs, THE NEW YORK TIMES  published a report saying that Wei Jingsheng, a famous champion  of democracy in China, and Yu Haocheng, another famous dissident  in China, recently had received warnings from the public  security authorities, who required them not to continue  contacting foreign reporters and publishing articles in the  foreign press. Both of them, however, explicitly rejected these  warnings. MING PAO tried to contact Wei Jingsheng, but people  in his family said that he would not be at home these few days.    Wei Jingsheng was arrested and jailed in 1979 for publishing  articles criticizing the authorities' antidemocracy policy. He  was released last September. According to yesterday's report by  THE NEW YORK TIMES, Wei Jingsheng received a string of warnings  from the authorities this month. He was warned against further  discussing democracy with foreign reporters and against  publishing in an overseas arena a book about his 14 years of  prison life. According to Wei Jingsheng, between 1 and 10  February he had received three warnings, and since he left  prison last September he had received seven warnings. Each  time, however, he rejected the warning and declared that he  "would not yield to excessive and unreasonable warnings."    According to the report, Wei Jingsheng took concrete action  against the warnings. THE NEW YORK TIMES said that he sent a  letter to the International Olympic Committee last week,  demanding that it impose sanctions against Beijing because of  the authorities' jailing of dissident Qian Yongmin, who opposed  China's hosting of the 2000 Olympic Games.    Qian Yongmin is one of the drafters of the "Peace Charter."  He was sentenced, without an official trial, to two years'  detention in a labor camp. Wei Jingsheng said in his letter to  the International Olympic Committee: "The detention of a person  for his opinion regarding the Olympics showed that the Olympic  spirit has gone rotten in China."    Yesterday, MING PAO tried to place a long-distance call to  Wei Jingsheng, but he was not at home. According to people in  his family, Wei Jingsheng was often out, and this time, he had  been out for several consecutive days. "We do not know where he  is now and do not know when he will return." When this MING PAO  reporter mentioned that Wei Jingsheng had been warned several  times by the public security authorities, people in his family  said that they did not know about this.    Yu Haocheng, another firm dissident, is a law expert. In the  1980's, he was a responsible person of the Qunchong Publishing  House under the Ministry of Public Security. He was detained  between 1989 and 1990, and was then prohibited from going  abroad. Last October, he received an invitation to a symposium  on human rights in Hong Kong, but he still could not attend it.  His speech was published there, anyway. His recent application  for overseas travel again was turned down by the authorities,  and he was warned that if he continued to publish human rights  articles in overseas arenas, he would be punished. Last week,  he firmly claimed that the Chinese Constitution gives him the  right to publish writings.    It is expected that China's human rights conditions once  again will become the focus of the mass media's attention. In  two days, Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human  rights affairs, will visit Beijing and discuss the human rights  issue with Chinese officials. In March, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher also will visit China in order to assess the  improvement of human rights there as a prelude to President  Clinton's final decision on whether to extend China's  most-favored-nation trade status.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / New York Post looks to Daily News IN A desperate attempt to save two struggling New York tabloids, the bankrupt owner of the New York Post yesterday offered to buy the New York Daily News. The News is owned by Maxwell Communications, and filed for the protection of US bankruptcy laws last year soon after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Peter Kalikow, the millionaire property developer and owner of the Post who filed for personal bankruptcy in August 1991, would not reveal whether he would merge the two newspapers, but said that 'the surest, and perhaps only, opportunity for the Daily News' survival lies in combination with the New York Post'. Details of Mr Kalikow's offer were not available. The Post's publisher said he would not discuss terms and conditions until he had reviewed the financial information available to prospective buyers of the News. Any acquisition would have to be approved by Mr Kalikow's main bank lenders and creditors.</p>

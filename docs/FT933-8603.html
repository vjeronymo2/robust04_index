			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Management shake-up continues at Kodak EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographic equipment group, has announced further moves among its senior executives, one week after independent directors ousted Mr Kay Whitmore as chairman. Kodak's board said that it was appointing Mr Michael Hamilton as general comptroller of the group with effect from September 1, when Mr Julian Gordon retires. Mr Hamilton will also continue to be the company's acting chief financial officer, a post he has held since May when Mr Christopher Steffen quit after disagreeing with Mr Whitmore over Kodak's restructuring plans. Kodak also announced the resignation of Mr Earnest Deavenport, president of the Eastman Chemical Company, as a Kodak director. The company said the move was expected because of the previously-announced plan to spin off the chemicals arm. Mr Deavenport, who will head the new independent company, joined the Kodak board in May 1992.</p>

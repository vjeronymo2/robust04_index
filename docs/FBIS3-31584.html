			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``Excerpts'' from open letter addressed by the Greater </F> Romania Party to President Ion Iliescu, presented by party  president Corneliu Vadim Tudor at his regular weekly news  conference in Bucharest, on 18 February: "The Greater Romania  Party Addresses an Open Letter, Full of Reproaches, to President  Iliescu"]    [Text] If before December 1989 the Romanians were worried  about the future, now they are worried about the present, since  they are no longer sure whether they are going to see the end of  the day, because of the hunger, the cold in their homes,  sickness, epidemics, and the ever growing crime rate. On the  rare occasions when I participated alongside of you in certain  events devoted to various historical commemorations, several  earnest Romanian women called out to us: "Take care of our  president, do not allow him to be overthrown by the opposition!"  If you remember well, Mr. Iliescu, we took care of you as much  as we could. We punished your unfair adversaries, massively  supported you in your election campaign, and contributed our  share to the country's stability. (...) Unfortunately, while we  took good care of you, Mr. President, and ourselves became the  targets of many arrows meant for you, you did not take too much  care of the country, since if you had done, one would have been  able to see some results after four years of experimentation.  So far, in your opinion and the opinion of certain profiteers  you have surrounded yourself with, everybody is guilty for the  country's disaster, except you, who are clean as Snow White. Is  is possible to show such a lack of responsibility? When you  were dreaming, from the wings, to become Ceausescu's successor,  what did you think that the tasks of a Romanian head of state  are? To be photographed together with singer Michael Jackson,  to partake in artistic happenings and drinking bouts in various  Bucharest establishments, or to go to theater shows and attend  musical soirees, where you could indulge in your own reveries?  Do you not think that while you fall in musical ecstasies  amidst the dressing gowns of famous ladies, we are all living  through the last moments of the Titanic, which sank while the  band was playing? Mr. President, the country is crying, in  desperation the workers of Grivita Workshops are attacking the  headquarters of the Ministry of Transport. The situation is as  explosive as during the February 1933 strikes, let alone the  strike wave that has hit the entire country -- and it would be a  mistake to think that all these actions are politically  motivated. (...) Mr. President, although you are a hydraulics  and energy engineer by profession, I am sure you have heard of  the great Roman orator Cato, who said, I quote: "The thieves  who steal from individuals end up in chains, while those who  thieve from the people live in wealth and splendor," end of  quote. Aside from having done nothing in the past four years to  curb corruption and thievery, you have now begun to openly take  the side of certain proven criminals. What kind of hold do the  likes of Petre Roman [president of the Democratic Party National  Salvation Front], Niculae Spiroiu, and so forth have on you? As  straightforward people, who clearly and openly state what they  think, allow us to point out another sad story: Against the  background of certain preconceived ideas of yours, which make  you punish the Romanians, while embracing the minority members,  certain appalling manifestations have acquired an ever greater  scope, such as the conceitedness of the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania, the impertinence of Rabbi Moses Rosen and  of other Jews who blame the Romanians for the Holocaust, and the  magnitude of the Gypsy crime rate, all of which are making  Romanians to feel like strangers in their own home, which is to  feel uncertain, threatened, and blamed by these minority  members, who are abusing our traditional humanity.    At this dramatic time for the country, the Greater Romania  Party [PRM] informs the electorate that it is suspending all  negotiations begun with the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] on a possible participation in the government. We ask  the government first to establish order in its own backyard,  institute the rule of law, and dismiss and sue the thieves,  after which we can talk again. We are not seeking public status  and positions; we have been and remain a party of the many,  simple, and poor people. (...) The country is on fire, Mr.  Iliescu. Hard times are ahead of us all and so far you have  given no indication that you can feel the true pulse of events.  We think that a possible outbreak of popular despair would be  much more ravaging than the December 1989 revolt, on whose wings  you came to power. (...) Wake up, Mr. Iliescu, if not out of  patriotism or pity for the many oppressed and dispossessed, then  out of an instinct of preservation. We are not afraid of early  elections, but why are those around you afraid of them? We  conclude this letter by assuring you of our full regard for your  real qualities and high position. We inform all Romanians who  love their country that the National Bloc awaits them with open  arms and the tricolor national flag in our hearts!    The letter is signed by the entire PRM Steering Committee.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / New Frontier party plans to form shadow cabinet Japan's new alliance of opposition parties, inaugurated over the weekend, plans to form a shadow cabinet to prepare to take power from the ruling Liberal Democratic party, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, president of the New Frontier party, Japan's second largest political group, said he planned to work with the government coalition as long as it worked for the creation of a 'good society.' But he would propose a parliamentary vote of no confidence if the coalition deviated from that path. The NFP, the result of the merger of Japan's nine main opposition groups, is the first opposition party in recent history to create a shadow cabinet. This could increase pressure on the government by offering voters a credible alternative administration. The new party, Japan's second largest, has 214 seats in the upper and lower houses of parliament. The LDP has 295. However, any concrete policy challenge to the government is likely to be limited because the NFP's policy platform is almost indistinguishable from that of the administration. The new party would pave the way for 'an ideal nation', said Mr Kaifu. His party's policies received a lukewarm reception from the few non-LDP groups to have survived recent political upheavals.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Fidelity counts - Radio THE BOOK in Radio 4's morning parliamentary slot this week is Sue Townsend's The Queen and I, which I think a very bad joke. Great Britain has become a democracy. The Royal Family is moved into council houses, so there are ready-made jokes about excessive furniture and the Queen having no coin for what is explained to her as the gas-meter. Miriam Margolyes, a player I much admire, does her best to imitate the royal voices. John Tydeman directs, doubtless out of loyalty to Townsend, for he directed Adrian Mole in its day. On the other hand, Radio 4 shows its fidelity with the Radio Times/Radio 4 Enterprise Awards, for which we shall hear about the 12 shortlisted entrants over the weeks. There are two awards annually and this is the tenth year - Pounds 10,000 for a business founded between two and five years ago, and Pounds 5000 for one founded two years ago or less. This week the entry for the top award was Deep Sea Adventure, of Weymouth, a museum that former deep-sea diver Brian Cooper equipped to show the history and the adventure of his craft. It was opened in 1988 by the Princess Royal, and has become a great success. For the other award, Richard Wilson and Carl Beeson bought an unused brewery and began to brew their own own beer, to be distributed by a wholesaler wherever there is a demand. If I can find a local pub serving Summerskill's Whistle Belly Vengeance, I shall certainly take a pint or so on its name alone. Just why Radio 4 should be subsidising private business out of my license fee is another matter, that I shall not discuss here. Howard Wakeling's A Bit of Berlin, Radio 4's Monday play, was artificial, but provocative in theme. Vic and Barbara (James Grout and Rowena Cooper) visit their son Mark (Julian Rhind-Tutt) in Berlin, where he has lived for five years without seeing them. Vic is aghast to find that his son is gay, running a gay club with a young German. But he is in hospital after a beating-up by roughs from East Berlin. Now Vic served in Berlin in 1946, and he and his mate beat up a Berliner whom they thought was a pervert. We hear the sound of this now and then. Then we get the similarly motivated attack on Mark, that has sent him to hospital. We are to see how thought has become freer since 1946, as shown, or not, in these folks' beliefs. But we we are never really in Berlin, either today, or in 1946. Little was done by author or director (Janet Whitaker) to suggest it. We could be anywhere: but not Zagreb. If you kept switched on for the next programme, The Yugoslavia Notes, you had a vivid picture of Zagreb from American reporter William T. Vollman. This is not an account of the warfare, but of the effect of warfare on its denizens. Vollman tells of a visit to the cathedral, of a man hypnotised by a women's clothes shop window, of a father and his 18-year-old son in a restaurant. His speech suggests Hemingway, intent on the significant detail, with vividly near-poetic phrases irradiating the straightforward idiom. We are to have more of Vollman, and I think it may be memorable. Authors' week on Radio 3. On Saturday, Leps gave Vladimir Nabokov's pleasant memories of catching butterflies - not live, alas, but read by Hugh Dickson. On Sunday, Somerset Maugham, though not exactly live, was heard in a recording of a live talk on his 80th birthday in 1954, dealing mostly with his previous 50 years. As a student, his flat cost him 18s. a week. A trip to Pisa, Florence and Venice was Pounds 30. Then he wrote Liza of Lambeth; and then he wrote Lady Frederick, which ran at the Royal Court for 18 months. The stammer we were accustomed to was no doubt edited out of the tape, for there was no sign of it. Next week, Compton Mackenzie.</p>

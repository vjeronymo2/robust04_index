			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL COURT SLASHES AWARD AGAINST KRISHNAS  </P> <P> In a long-awaited ruling on religious liberty, a state appeal court in San  Diego dismissed a claim that the Hare Krishna sect brainwashed a 15-year-old  Orange County girl and cut by more than two-thirds a $9.7-million verdict  against the group.  </P> <P> In addition to the brainwashing claim, the 4th District Court of Appeal also  dismissed claims that the Krishnas intentionally caused Robin George emotional  distress and libeled her. It left her only a $75,000 award tied to the wrongful  death of her father.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freedom of Religion at Issue  </P> <P> However, the court left intact a $2.9-million judgment for Robin's mother,  Marcia George, for emotional distress and libel.  </P> <P> The celebrated case began in 1977 when the George family sued the sect,  contending that the group had brainwashed Robin into joining the movement, then  hid her from her parents. The complex lawsuit included claims of libel and  wrongful death, the latter because stress allegedly brought on the heart attack  that killed Robin George's father in 1976. In 1983, an Orange County jury  returned a $32.5-million verdict against the sect, a judgment cut to $9.7  million by the trial judge.  </P> <P> In their appeal, the Krishnas contended that the verdict interfered with their  constitutional right to freedom of religion.  </P> <P> Attorneys on both sides said Wednesday that appeals of the most recent,  105-page decision are almost certain because neither side can be considered a  complete winner.  </P> <P> Robin George "got clobbered," said Lynde Selden, a San Diego attorney  representing the Georges. "And, if anybody was wronged by this Krishna  behavior, it was Robin. I think her mother agrees. Robin was injured the  worst."  </P> <P> Robin George, now 29 and known by her married name, Robin George Westerkamp, is  an interior designer living in Orange County. She said the verdict was "sad."  </P> <P> The court apparently didn't understand the "element of mind control and how  that interferes with your thinking," she said. "The court is looking at this  case and saying, 'This girl did these things and had a choice -- there must be  something wrong with her.'  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Like Joining the Baptist Church'  </P> <P> "If I hadn't gone through this myself, if I was Joe Average or something, I  would probably think I didn't deserve anything. But it's not that simple. Not  like joining the Baptist church. It's a totally different ballgame."  </P> <P> Marcia George was out of the state Wednesday, her daughter said. She could not  be reached.  </P> <P> A group of Krishnas, including about 35 who had walked to San Diego from San  Francisco en route to Tijuana to publicize the case, gathered Wednesday  afternoon at Horton Plaza downtown to celebrate what they called "a victory for  religious freedom."  </P> <P> "The court was really very wise on that brainwashing fiasco," said Mukunda  Goswami, a spokesman for the Krishnas, noting that the $9.7-million award would  have forced the sect to sell six temples -- in San Diego, Los Angeles, Laguna  Beach, Brooklyn, New Orleans and outside New Orleans.  </P> <P> "We're going to recommend that we take it to the (state) Supreme Court, if for  no other reason than we don't think the evidence will sustain any of those  causes of action as to the old lady," said W. Marshall Morgan, the Los Angeles  attorney who represented the Krishnas, formally known as the International  Society for Krishna Consciousness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney Is Troubled  </P> <P> David A. Niddrie, the San Diego lawyer who helped handle the appeal for the  Georges, said he had read only parts of the opinion, but said it "troubles me  in that it gives these types of organizations the opportunity to . . . mistreat  their own members as long as it doesn't sort of adversely affect the interest  of people on the outside. I don't think that's the state of the law in  California."  </P> <P> The decision is the latest turn in a case that began when Robin George, then a  15-year-old Cypress teen-ager, ran away from home in November, 1974.  </P> <P> She spent most of the next year in Krishna temples in New Orleans and Ottawa,  Canada. The following November, she ran away from the Krishnas and returned  home.  </P> <P> In March, 1976, less than four months after she returned home, her father,  James George, died of a heart attack. The stress caused by his dealings with  the Krishnas and his inability to locate his daughter for the year she was gone  "significantly shortened his life," an expert testified at trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Five-Month Trial  </P> <P> In October, 1977, Marcia and Robin George sued the Krishnas in Orange County  Superior Court, contending that the sect brainwashed Robin and then conspired  to hide her from her parents. After a five-month trial, a jury returned the  $32.5-million verdict. Judge James A. Jackman reduced the amount to $9.7  million.  </P> <P> San Diego attorney Milton Silverman represented the Georges at trial, but did  not take part in the appeal.  </P> <P> The "centerpiece" of the appeal, according to Justice Howard Wiener, who wrote  the lengthy opinion, was the brainwashing claim. The Georges contended that  Robin had been brainwashed and could not leave the temples even if she wanted  to.  </P> <P> According to a 1988 ruling from the state Supreme Court -- in a case involving  the Unification Church -- Robin needed to show that the Krishnas physically  restrained her from leaving, which they did not, Wiener said.  </P> <P> In that 1988 case, the court dismissed a claim brought by a former church  member who wanted to leave a retreat but was told that, if she did, she would  be "damned to hell forever." Such threats alone are "protected religious  speech," the court said.  </P> <P> The George case appears to be the first appellate test after the Unification  case, attorneys involved said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Same as Other Devotees  </P> <P> George's brainwashing theory admittedly focused on more than threats of "divine  retribution," Wiener said. But imposing liability because of "dietary  restrictions, methods of worship and communal living arrangements and schedules  is just as surely inimical to the free exercise of religious liberty as that  based on threats of divine retribution," he said.  </P> <P> Even if a physical threat was not required, George presented no evidence that  her "schedules, practices and duties" as a Krishna devotee differed from any  other devotee's, Wiener said. Without that evidence, "Robin's brainwashing  theory . . . is no more than an attempt to premise tort liability on religious  practices the Georges find objectionable. Such a result is simply inconsistent  with the First Amendment."  </P> <P> The panel dismissed George's claim for emotional distress because many of the  acts she called "outrageous" are "hardly uncommon" among cloistered religious  groups, Wiener said.  </P> <P> It also tossed out her libel claim, an element of the case that even the  attorneys involved said was complex and confusing. It stemmed from a Krishna  statement distributed to the press at an Oct. 29, 1976, press conference.  </P> <P> The statement said that when George came to the Krishnas, she complained of  being beaten by her parents. It concluded, "For all we know now, (Robin's)  accounts of brutality and beatings (by her parents) were exaggerated or totally  fabricated."  </P> <P> Since the statement included the phrase, For all we know now, it alerted  readers that the Krishnas were merely expressing their opinion about whether  Robin was lying when she gave her "supposed earlier accounts of brutality at  the hands of her parents," Wiener said. Statements of opinion, as opposed to  fact, cannot support a claim for libel, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life Expectancy Shortened  </P> <P> The court left untouched only George's $75,000 jury verdict for her father's  death, finding that his life expectancy was shortened by stress.  </P> <P> Marcia George did not file a wrongful-death claim. But the panel approved of  the award for her claim for emotional distress, finding the Krishnas had bought  plane and bus tickets, disguises and fake photographs, among other acts, to  help hide her daughter.  </P> <P> Those actions provide a "more than adequate basis" for concluding that the  Krishnas engaged in "outrageous conduct," Wiener said.  </P></p>

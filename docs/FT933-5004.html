			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Observer: Fireman's fight Guinness Mahon merchant banker Bruce Fireman's experiences with the broadcast media have hitherto tended to be bathed in tears rather than champagne. His first flop was at university, when he launched a weekly, New Cambridge, to take on the well-known Varsity. But it folded, with a Pounds 700 loss, as the 49-year-old Fireman now recalls. In 1980 he was involved in a bid for the Southern ITV franchise and lost - although he did make five grand by selling his consortium's registered name of TVS to the winner. During the 1991 ITV franchise round, he managed to push his next consortium, White Rose Television, over the programme quality threshold, only to be outbid by Yorkshire. In between, during a 12-year stint at Charterhouse, he helped raise the venture capital to launch The Independent newspaper, but broadcasting franchise came there none. Finally, Fireman has arrived. For it was he who masterminded the London News Radio bid that has ousted LBC from its 20-year lock-hold on London's commercial radio franchises. 'I've got it right at last,' purrs the future deputy chairman of LNR.</p>

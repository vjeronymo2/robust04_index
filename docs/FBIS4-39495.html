			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a press conference held by Mykola Horyn, chairman </F> of the Lvov Oblast Council, by Dzhemma Dobrovska: "They Say the  Chessmen on the Chessboard Have Already Been Arranged"]    [Text] On 26 May, thanks to the consolidated effort by  ultra right and left forces, the Ukrainian Supreme Council  adopted a resolution rescinding the 23 May decision by the Lvov  City Council "On Suspension of Commissions for the Elections to  the Oblast Council."    "What the Bolsheviks hoped for so much has actually  happened," was the comment of Mykola Horyn, chairman of the  oblast council, at a press conference held yesterday. How will  the the situation develop?    Given the present situation, the oblast council chairman  said, the 26 June elections will definitely take place  throughout Ukraine, and in Lvov Oblast in particular. Those  elections will legally eliminate the presidential structure all  across Ukraine -- something that the left forces fought for  since the very first day after the last presidential elections.  Another important fact produced by the elections, I believe,  will be the consolidation of the old-style system of soviets in  Ukraine which is becoming a communist reserve. In an  unprecedented event in history of democratic development, we  will have the elections to a government structure that is not  legally defined or acknowledged by the country's highest  legislative body.    This enables the left majority in the parliament, on the eve  of the elections, to forge a power system well suited for the  communist majority in Ukraine. If the present tendencies in  parliament continue, one can only imagine what is awaiting us  in the immediate future.    A number of questions arise here. Why did the communists  care so much about legality and virtually unanimously vote to  cancel our decision? I am also tormented by the question why  did our "national hero" Stepan Khmara, who shook his fist in  front of Moroz two days ago, ally himself with those people and,  on top of it, demand that the Supreme Council resolution include  a paragraph promising severe punishment for the oblast's  leadership if it moves to torpedo the 26 June elections? Is it  possible that none of our deputies wanted to take the rostrum to  examine this important problem and, as of two days ago, raise a  question of the communist coup and sovietization now under way  in our country?    The decision by the oblast's council regarding suspension of  electoral commissions was intended to attract massive puhlic  attention to the situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, it failed  to receive this attention, and the media in Kiev practically  blocked it for three days.    With tacit approval on the part of the group of democratic  deputies, the Supreme Council managed to adopt this decision.  This is another victory of the communist majority.    I do not understand the position of some political forces in  Lvov Oblast. I appreciate efforts by the Ukrainian Peasant  Democratic Party and Ukrainian Republican Party who supported  the oblast council's decision. I am especially grateful to the  Lvov Oblast Council which boldly kept its ground and saved its  moral and political face, living up to expectations of the  people that elected it four years ago. However, political  haggling has already started in other political organizations  staged by specific groups of people and interests. They also  helped prevent this decision from becoming a political act. I  am concerned about innuendoes spread by the media to attribute  specific names to the decision by the oblast's council. Over  time, everyone will realize what a big mistake we made by not  transforming this even into a political action.    Stepan Davymuk, the Ukrainian president's representative in  Lvov Oblast, noted: "Many of our politicians thought that  proimperial and communist forces will resign from politics and  power. It was naive to think that way. We see those forces  forming their political organizations and rapidly gaining  influence over certain levers in the economy and the hinterland.    ``We deal here with the restoration of the orthodox  communist  force in various options -- as the Socialist, Agrarian Party,  etc. As a matter of fact, the idea of resuscitating the old  Soviet Union is being restored. This is the most dangerous  thing. Ukraine is being driven into a blind alley.''    The journalists asked questions primarily about the recent  events in the Supreme Council.    Mr. Horyn, do you think that this decision, even if  canceled,  can still wake up the consciousness of the electorate and  politicians? [unattributed question]    I was expecting that at least the consciousness of our  Supreme Council deputies would be awakened. I hoped this would  be used as a serious chance of countering sovietization and  communization of Ukraine, now under way. Unfortunately, thanks  to the consolidation of the right and left forces, the decision  was adopted. This revealed the parochial interests of certain  political organizations. They say that chessmen have already  been arranged on the chessborad, and [communists] decided to go  all the way, no matter what the outcome of this game will be.</p>

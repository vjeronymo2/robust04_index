			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Observer: Airbus one Edzard Reuter's new job as chairman of the supervisory board of Airbus Industrie is good news for the other Airbus partners - British Aerospace, France's Aerospatiale and Spain's Casa. One of Europe's best known and most politically astute industrial managers is arriving at the helm at a time when the European consortium is facing increasing pressure from its big US rival, Boeing. It should also dispel rumours, once and for all, that Daimler was becoming increasingly disenchanted with its costly diversification into aerospace. Only last month Daimler said that the 66-year-old Reuter, who has been with the group for 30 years, would remain chairman of its management board until the end of next year and he has been tipped to replace Deutsche Bank's Hilmar Kopper as chairman of Daimler's supervisory board. He's a much more effective business figure than his two predecessors, Hans Friderichs, 62, a former federal economics minister, and Franz-Josef Strauss, the first supervisory board chairman who died in office. Meanwhile, the battle for Reuter's own succession at Daimler is now on. The favourites are Helmut Werner, boss of the Mercedes car company, and his younger colleague, Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler's aerospace arm. Observer's bet is on Schrempp getting the job.</p>

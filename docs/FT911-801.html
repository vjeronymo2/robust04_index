			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): Peking seeks more power - A showdown in relations with China THERE always had to be a bust-up. When Britain signed away its rights to Hong Kong in December 1984 and agreed that China would resume sovereignty 13 years later in 1997, it was inevitable that a struggle for power would one day disrupt Sinologist diplomats' dreams of a cosy handover and cast doubt over the colony's autonomy. It was generally assumed that the crisis would break in the early 1990s when the proximity of the handover, perhaps combined with some upsurge in China, would lead Peking to try progressively to supplant British rule ahead of time. What no-one could have guessed was that the showdown would come over something so basically harmless - and so economically important - as an airport. Nor could one have guessed how quickly Peking would win and that at the same time it would attempt to encroach on the most sensitive of all areas - the independence of the judiciary. Yet that is that has happened in the past 18 months. Peking has forced Sir David Wilson, the colony's governor, and Sir David Ford, the chief secretary, to delay plans for a HKDollars 100bn international airport until they win its agreement. It is worried about the airport draining fiscal reserves, but it basic demand - which Hong Kong has been opposing - is for extensive scrutiny and consultations leading to consensus on decisions such as financial borrowings and contracts. Hong Kong says that this would amount to control and would cause long delays in decision-making on the airport. It would also set a precedent for China to gain control far ahead of 1997 over economic and fiscal policy and other issues ranging from education policy to choice of top government officials. China has also demanded extensive rights over the choice of judges on a planned Court of Final Appeal before and after 1997, encroaching on the autonomy of the colony's judicial system. This is one of several items caught up in a Sino-British Joint Liaison Group which has made little progress with its basic work of making detailed preparations for 1997. These moves have been made so blatantly and effectively by China that they have confounded British sinologists, whose personal and professional creed rests on a belief that one can do business with Peking and that deals, once done, are honoured. The deal in this case is the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the 1997 handover which under-pins British rule, albeit with increased consultation as the handover approaches. It pledges that the new post-1997 Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong will have a 'high degree of autonomy' for the next 50 years in everything but defence and foreign affairs, and that it will be 'vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication'. No-where in the joint declaration, according to British experts, is there any justification for the sort of control that China is seeking so long before 1997 over airport decisions, nor for the influence it is demanding on the choice of final appeal judges. Behind China's move, it is assumed, is deep distrust of Britain as a colonial power, plus perhaps a wish to settle 150-year-old scores for China's perceived humiliation when Hong Kong was colonised. There is believed to be a fear that the British, behaving like other departing colonial powers elsewhere, will cream off the riches, leaving behind a run-down fragile economy. In this context, UK companies would win airport construction contracts and so drain Hong Kong's HKDollars 72bn accumulated fiscal reserves. Peking's 1989 Tiananmen Square crisis heightened the distrust and concern, firstly because of the way that hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people massed on the streets in support of China's pro-democracy students, and secondly because the UK and Hong Kong governments then stepped in with a morale-boosting package. That package included plans for the airport, as well as a Bill of Rights and British passports for Hong Kong people, which sharpened China's anger. Peking officials then realised that the airport was the one issue they could directly affect because franchise periods and debt repayments would not start till 1997 or later: international investment would therefore not be forthcoming unless China gave its backing. China probably always intended to interfere and keep Britain in check by demanding a measure of control in the second half of the 1984-97 transition period, which has just begun. The airport has enabled it to do this earlier than might otherwise have been the case. The intention to interfere has been evident in the detailed work of the Joint Liaison Group which has made scarcely any progress since June 1989. Its most well-known points of deadlock concern the appointment of judges to a new Court of Final Appeal (which is needed to replace London's Privy Council), and Hong Kong's right to re-develop defence establishment land before 1997. But there has also been extremely slow progress on more mundane but important issues such as the negotiation of new air service agreements to replace UK-based arrangements. Only about six have been completed out of 30 that will be needed. China has also blocked progress on other issues such as investment protection agreements, re-arrangement of hundreds of international treaties on detailed issues. Such stone-walling by Peking has made Hong Kong realise - not for the first time - that it is weak when it faces a determined Chinese government.</p>

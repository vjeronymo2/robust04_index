			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Dream team The behind-the-scenes politicking over Jacques Attali's future at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is degenerating into farce. Persuading the 59-year-old Ernie Stern, the respected number two at the World Bank, to take the less important number two job at the EBRD is almost as bad an idea as maintaining the status quo. Why on earth recruit a career bureaucrat whose speciality is managing a third world development bank to run a supposedly entrepreneurial type of institution whose prime aim is to work with the private sector? Sir William Ryrie, head of the World Bank's private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, would seem better qualified. Even worse, offering Stern a megabuck transfer fee is hardly the behaviour expected of an organisation already under censure for its profligacy. Nevertheless if the EBRD's owners really are intent on bagging Stern, it ought surely to be part of a move to replace Attali. One possibility would be to recall Citicorp vice-chairman Onno Rudding, the former Dutch finance minister who wanted the EBRD job just as badly as Frere Jacques. Then the EBRD might have the beginnings of a dream team.</p>

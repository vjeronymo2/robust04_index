			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION A CASE FOR CHOICE;  </P> <P> RESTRICTIONS MEAN SUFFERING, DEATH;  </P> <P> THERE ARE TIMES WHEN TERMINATION OF A PREGNANCY IS THE ONLY HUMANE ALTERNATIVE.  BIRTH CONTROL, COUNSELING AND ADOPTION ARE BENEFICIAL, BUT THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH.  </P> <P> The past year has been pivotal in the battle to protect the right to choose  abortion. The Supreme Court ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services  in July, and the nationwide political mobilization last fall, made abortion a  dominant issue in the United States. State legislatures, Congress, the courts  and the electorate will have to address abortion and the related issues of  birth control and sex education.  </P> <P> Abortion is a complex issue for everyone. It involves the most fundamental  questions about religion, ethics, morality and the role of government in  decisions involving family planning. It touches all Americans, from  policy-makers to individual voters. But most important, it affects women with  unwanted pregnancies and their families.  </P> <P> The central question is simple. Who decides? Who should resolve these difficult  issues that have arisen over abortion? Should it be politicians? Should it be  those who call themselves "pro-life"? Or should it be the women and families  directly involved?  </P> <P> Those of us who support abortion rights believe that women and families must  make these decisions for themselves, and that the choice in each case is an  individual one. We are pro-choice, not "pro-abortion."  </P> <P> Abortion is an issue about which there are deep and honest differences of  opinion. We respect those differences. As difficult as it is morally for some  people to accept abortion, we feel there is a greater wrong in forcing a woman  to undergo the demanding, intimate and at times life-threatening experiences of  pregnancy and childbirth. For some women, the pain and suffering of being  denied the choice to end a pregnancy is so extreme that they have risked and  lost their lives in order to avoid it. We defend the right of women to choose  whether or not to have an abortion. We also work to prevent any parent, spouse,  doctor or politician from ever forcing an abortion on any woman who does not  want one.  </P> <P> A small, extremist minority cannot be allowed to impose its views and take away  our most fundamental liberty: the right to choose. This right establishes that  an outsider cannot determine when or whether an individual may have a child.  </P> <P> The anti-choice minority claims that human life begins at conception. In fact,  there is no consensus about when human life begins. Certainly, women recognize  that a fetus has the potential for human life. But "when human life begins" is  a moral, religious, ethical and philosophical question.  </P> <P> For 17 years Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision legalizing abortion in all 50  states, has been the law of the land. It provided that abortion in the first  three months of pregnancy, defined as the first trimester, be free from  government interference, and it established some limits on abortion in the  second and third trimesters. Many politicians have placated anti-abortion  forces by stating their personal opposition to abortion, but they have not had  the power to act on it. In its 1989 decision in a Missouri case, Webster vs.  Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court ruled that states could enact  legislation that severely restricts abortion. The political aspect of the issue  has taken on a new complexity.  </P> <P> In some areas, anti-choice forces are asking politicians to translate their  personal ambivalence into public policy by enacting onerous restrictions on  abortion. On the other hand, the pro-choice majority will be scrutinizing the  actions of elected officials. Pro-choice voters are making it clear to  politicians who would restrict abortion that the consequence will be pregnant  women forced either to bear unwanted children or to suffer the pain and  degradation of illegal abortions. Many women will die.  </P> <P> Consider also what happens to children who are born unwanted. Adoption can be  an option for some women. But it is the worst kind of deceit to claim that  there is a loving family waiting to adopt the child of every woman, from  teen-age welfare mothers to drug addicts.  </P> <P> Part of our work is preventing pregnancies and reducing the need for abortion.  We support sex education and safe, accessible contraception. We work to ensure  that every child is fed, housed and educated.  </P> <P> The decision to have an abortion is not an easy one. We would all like to see  fewer women facing crisis pregnancies and the wrenching decisions they involve.  But, in reality, whether or not to have an abortion is a choice women often  face. The world is not perfect; there will always be a need for abortion  services. Women are entitled to make these decisions themselves, in  consultation with families, trusted friends, religious counselors and doctors  if they so wish. Politicians, extremists and clinic protesters have no right to  interfere.  </P> <P> As a nation we must trust women to use their personal judgment in making  thoughtful, conscientious decisions regarding procreation. Sometimes, those  decisions involve terminating a pregnancy. The National Abortion Rights Action  League is committed to defending the right of all women to make these personal  decisions, and to ensuring that abortion is accessible to all women who choose  it.  </P></p>

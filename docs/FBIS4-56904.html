			<p>BFN     [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq says Emile Jonassaint will  be sworn in as president of Haiti on 11 May. Sansaricq made this  statement before the press, and said that he [not further  identified] has the support of the Chamber of Deputies to do  this job, especially the support of President Monde. Monde,  however, has explained that he gave his opinion on the matter as  a citizen, and not as the president of the Chamber of Deputies.    Everyone is waiting to see: Will Article 149 be implemented?  Will there be a new president of Haiti? Everyone is waiting;  meanwhile, the international community is threatening to impose  a total embargo on Haiti, which will be lifted only when  Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to Haiti. The embargo will be  relaxed only when three officials of the military high command's  general staff resign. Only then will the international community  infer that the Army has decided to comply with the Governors  Island Agreement.    The situation within the Haitian legislature, where  Sansaricq  made this decision, remains very very confused. Emile  Jonassaint, whom Signal FM contacted, said he has not been  officially informed yet regarding the matter of his installation  on 11 May. Jonassaint says he heard about it only in the press  and that he will have to make a decision and take a public  position -- for he refused to make any statement to Signal FM --  once he is officially informed of the matter.</p>

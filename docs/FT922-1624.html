			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (15): Exports revival - Manufacturers sense a breakthrough THANKS TO A long period of wage restraint, cost reductions, low inflation and general economic stability, French companies are suddenly finding themselves internationally competitive. Manufacturing industry has led a steady rise in French exports to its European neighbours since the turn of the year, the main reason behind a sharp improvement in the country's trade position. France recorded a trade surplus in each month of the first quarter for the first time in 20 years, with a record positive balance of FFr7.79bn in May. 'French companies have made a strong increase in exports not thanks to the growth of the world economy . . . but because they are more competitive than their competitors. And that is very new. We are producing better and cheaper than elsewhere,' said a delighted Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister. This sudden improvement comes after what has been a hard year for the corporate sector. While the economic downturn hit France later and less hard than some other countries, including Britain and the US, it did depress company profits in many sectors in 1990 and 1991. Last year, only four out of the top 10 companies recorded or are expected to report a profits rise: Renault, Alcatel Alsthom, Total and Rhone Poulenc. Of the rest, two lost money and four made reduced profits. According to a study by Credit National, the state-owned bank, the top 50 groups cut their investments by 6.7 per cent last year. This is despite repeated urging from the government to gear up for a recovery, a plea which businesses say they would love to answer if only the government would reduce interest rates. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, would like to give them what they want, but his failure last autumn to sustain a rate cut independently of the Bundesbank for more than a month underlines just how much French monetary policy still follows Germany's. Like their international competitors, French businesses have in any case been been more interested in cutting costs than investing in new capacity during the downturn. Last year, France's top 50 companies made a 2.8 per cent average reduction in their workforces, the biggest cut for many years, with the heaviest losses coming from Usinor Sacilor in steel, the Air France airline, Renault and Peugeot in cars, Michelin in tyres, and Bull and Thomson in electronics. Credit National thinks investments by the top 50 will continue to fall this year, by around 3.8 per cent, but that cash flow will recover sharply, from a 1.8 per cent decline in 1991, to an 8 per cent rise in the current year. Credit National incidentally backs up Mr Sapin's optimism on the international competitiveness of French business with another survey, showing that the largest French companies' net profit margins have been higher than their German counterparts, their biggest competitors and trading partners, for the past five years. Staff costs could be part of the answer, 21 per cent of turnover in France as against 28 per cent in Germany. However, French companies are still undercapitalised by comparison with German ones in that they continue to pay heavy debt charges while their German equivalents are rolling in cash, on which they receive a steady income. On average, the top French companies' debt gearing stands at 70 per cent of shareholders' funds, while German gearing is only 25 per cent, says the Credit National study, carried out with its German partner, Industriekreditbank. One factor in the high gearing of some of the largest French companies is the heavy borrowing they took on to finance a series of overseas acquisitions in recent years, in a belated internationalisation strategy, which now leaves France's largest companies with on average nearly 60 per cent of their sales abroad. Some of these takeovers, however, took place right at the peak of the previous upturn, just before the recession hit. Michelin's acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre maker, and Saint Gobain's acquisition of Norton, the US abrasives group, are examples. It is no surprise that the pace of overseas acquisitions by the biggest companies has fallen off sharply since those big purchases in 1990, so that the value of foreign takeovers by the top 50 fell by 24 per cent to FFr80bn last year, putting an end to four straight years of growth. The big bidders were too busy digesting their acquisitions to think about expanding again for the moment. All the same, there were some spectacular deals last year. These include the FFr12.8bn purchase by Schneider, the electrical equipment group, of Square D, its US competitor, one of the few successful hostile French bids in the US. Last year also saw the Pounds 300m acquisition of US oil group Amoco's UK petrol station and refining interest by Elf Aquitaine; the FFr3.8bn acquisition of the transmission equipment division of Rockwell International by Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications and engineering group; and hotel operator Accor's FFr2.2bn bid for Wagons Lits, the Franco-Belgian travel group. Equally, France has been on the receiving end of some big acquisitions in the past 12 months, helped by the relaxation of most controls on foreign investment and a testament to the liberal mood of the Socialist regime. Revealingly, nobody in the the government lifted a finger to find a French solution to the FFr15.46bn takeover battle between two foreign companies for Perrier, the mineral water group, once seen as a sacrosanct part of corporate France. In the end, Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, fought Italy's Agnelli family through the courts to win with a FFr15.46bn offer. Such an open and highly publicised bid battle would have been unlikely only a few years ago. Daimler Benz, the German cars and aerospace group, was last year given a free hand to take a large minority stake in Sogeti, the holding company which controls Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computer services group and one of France's best known post war industrial successes, with an option to take full control. Similarly, the Japanese car group Nissan was given clearance to take control of its French distributor, after having met official resistance up for the past decade. In general, all this points to a good climate for the corporate sector. The arrival of the economically liberal Mr Beregovoy as prime minister in April has probably helped, though Mrs Edith Cresson, his interventionist predecessor, was not nearly as bad for business has her critics make out. It was, after all, Mrs Cresson who launched fresh incentives for small businesses and agreed to reduce corporation tax again to a flat 34 per cent last year. The cut continued a trend started by the Gaullists in 1986 and leaves France with one of the lowest corporation tax rates in Europe.</p>

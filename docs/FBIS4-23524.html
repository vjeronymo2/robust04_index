			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] One of the most contentious issues, which the Truth  Commission will have to face, is what to do about politically  motivated crimes committed after December the 5th last year.  More than 30 members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, the  AWB, which boycotted the April elections, were picked up in  connection with the wave of bombings in the last days of the  campaign. On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked AWB  spokesman Fred Rundle how he reacted to the setting up of the  Truth Commission:    [Begin recording] [Rundle] Well, that's what they perceive  to  be abuse. You mustn't forget that Mr. Dullah Omar is a  communist, a member of the Communist Party. You must also  remember my people will never bow down before any man. They  will only bow in front of God.    [Ecott] But Mr. Omar is the justice minister and it seems  like an attempt by the government to get to the bottom of who  may or may not be guilty of human rights abuse in the past and  in the present.    [Rundle] We offered them our hand in an attempt to bring  about peace. We said to them: give amnesty to all right  wingers awaiting trial, the same as the De Klerk did to their  people and those that have been convicted, and we will suspend  our struggle while we are negotiating for a volkstaat  [homeland]. He has rejected this by his cut off date in  December. We believe, as I say here, no government can blame  the flame of freedom burning in the hearts of our people. No  government can build enough jails to lock up an entire nation.  We will get our volkstaat no matter what the cost. We go on and  we also say: what they have now done by their proposed amnesty  legislation is to create a huge powder keg which begs to be  ignited by all and sundry opposing the authoritarian and  antiwhite method of government.

In the course of an hour the two politicians  discussed the changes in East Europe and Bulgaria after their  previous meeting four years ago. Dr. Zhelev arrived here  yesterday to attend the UNESCO commemoration of the 51st  anniversary of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews.    The analysis of the ways in which France and the Western  democracies could assist economic reform in Bulgaria and help it  overcome the negative consequences of the Yugo-embargo and the  Yugo-crisis revealed the decisive importance of foreign  investment, access to Western markets and modern infrastructure.    Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans and in respect to the  different ethnic and religious groups in this country was  assessed as worthy of respect and meeting European standards and  principles. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he believed France's  parliament would soon ratify Bulgaria's Europe agreement. Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing also believes that French private capital is  now experiencing an upsurge and may take leading positions in  East European markets and industry.    More than 300 representatives of France's political elite,  academic and business circles responded to the invitation of the  French Institute of International Relations and gathered at the  French Automobile Club to hear President Zhelev's lecture and to  ask him questions about Bulgaria's foreign investment  regulations and its economic and foreign policy.    In his lecture, titled "Bulgaria Today," Dr. Zhelev focused  on the present state of this country's economy, the prospects  for its future development and the possibilities it provides for  foreign investment.    For Bulgaria there is no alternative to intensive structural  adjustment of the economy, President Zhelev said. Foreign  investment, modern infrastructure and access to foreign markets  are of decisive importance for this country today. Dr. Zhelev  described foreign capital as the most important factor for this  country's economic progress against the background of  consumption and accumulation slump, export shrinkage and  production stagnation. Though foreign investment alone would not  solve these problems, without such investment all solutions  would be incomplete from the technological point of view, said  the President.    Dr. Zhelev recalled Bulgaria's liberal investment  regulations, guaranteed by this country's Constitution and laws.  The low price of labour in Bulgaria, its well-trained and  highly qualified work force and traditionally strong positions  on the markets of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East  and its geographical location at the crossroads between the East  and the West are among Bulgaria's other advantages, according to  Dr. Zhelev. But despite all this Bulgaria is still regarded by  foreign business as a relatively high risk country, he said.    President Zhelev listed the negative consequences of the war  in the former Yugoslavia for Bulgaria. One of them is fear to  invest which foreign investors mechanically transfer to  countries neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. [passage  omitted]    Without expecting streams of foreign capital, we are  convinced that investment in this country will mark a  considerable growth this and next year, the President said,  citing the recently signed standby agreement with the IMF and  the forthcoming agreement with the London Club, the stepping up  of privatization in this country and the expected change in the  business climate and economic recovery. Bulgaria is a good  place to invest today, President Zhelev concluded.    Information on Bulgaria's radical economic reforms and on  possible ways to encourage foreign trade and foreign investment  was met with great interest. Prospects for Bulgaria's  participation in European and regional economic structures were  also under discussion.    Asked to comment on the "comeback" of Russian diplomacy to  Europe through the crisis in Bosnia, Dr Zhelev said he was  pleased with the unity of action between Russia and NATO to end  fighting in Bosnia. He expressed hope that it is the prototype  of future cooperation in the interests of European security.  The NATO ultimatum had decisive impact; its success was largely  the result of France's firm principled stance and its active  commitment to international peacekeeping efforts, Dr. Zhelev  said. [passage omitted]    Participants in the discussion drew the conclusion that the  orientation of Bulgaria's foreign policy to integration into the  European and Euro-Atlantic structures is distinct and clear-cut  and receives broad support from Bulgarian institutions and  society.</p>

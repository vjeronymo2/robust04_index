			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rumours hit rates THE money markets kept up a fury of speculation about an imminent cut in UK interest rates yesterday, with short-term money softening during the day. However, many traders said the market had misinterpreted recent actions by the Bank of England to stem cash shortages. The decision to leave the market short today was taken as a sign that the Bank had no intention of easing policy this week, at least. Today was expected to be a tight day, and a repurchase offer from the Bank would depend on continuing interest rate speculation, said one senior dealer. The March short sterling contract jumped to 89.86 in the morning, although it closed at its opening level of 89.80. This implies an interest rate of 10.2 per cent by the time the contract falls due, just one week after the UK Budget on March 10. The Budget could provide the best opportunity for a rate cut, said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. If it boosted the Conservative party's chances in the forthcoming general election, then sterling could strengthen. This would give the 'window of opportunity' to cut base rates, Mr Cocker said. The market was also increasingly playing with the idea of a  1/4 point cut in rates to accompany the retail price figures due out on Friday, said Mr Mark Austin, an economist with Hongkong Bank. The Bank of England left the market guessing about a rate cut during the morning, ignoring the relatively small Pounds 250m shortage it had forecast for the day. By noon, however, it was apparent that the Bank would not act on rates. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 23m in band one bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 10m left the market Pounds 217m short, but overnight rates barely moved. Overnight money traded at about 10 1/2 per cent for most of the day and closed slightly firmer at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent. The key three months interbank rate, which is used as an indicator of interest rate sentiment, was easier yesterday at 10 3/8 - 1/4 per cent. In Germany, call rates held steady at 9.55/65 per cent. Liquidity is expected to come under pressure next week when tax payments for February fall due. In the US, the Federal Reserve signalled no change in the funds rate by draining reserves at 3 7/8 per cent. The presumed target is 4 per cent.</p>

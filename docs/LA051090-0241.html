			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI COURT ORDERS PROBE OF '83 STOCK CRASH BE REOPENED  </P> <P> Israel's Supreme Court today ordered the state attorney general to reopen an  investigation into whether criminal charges should be lodged against the  nation's leading banks and former directors for a stock market crash in 1983.  </P> <P> The ruling threatens to shake up Israel's banking system, which already is  burdened by 20% annual inflation and economic recession.  </P> <P> Up to 26 banks, directors and accountants could be put on trial for violating  state banking regulations, the national Itim news agency reported.  </P> <P> These include eight major institutions: Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, Israel  Discount Bank and its holding company IDB, Union Bank, Bank Mizrahi, Israel  General Bank and the Bank for Trade and Funding.  </P> <P> The market collapse of October, 1983, was one of Israel's worst economic  disasters, forcing the government to underwrite hundreds of millions of dollars  in public losses that are still being paid off.  </P> <P> Israel radio estimated the bailout cost $8 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees [UNHCR], comprising among it members Sadako Ogata's  special envoy (Nicholas Morris) and the UNHCR head for  Bosnia-Herzegovina (Karen Abu Said), today talked to our  government delegation headed by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.  Nedzad Leko reports.    [Begin recording] [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic said the  following in talks with the UNHCR delegation:    [Silajdzic] We mostly discussed repatriation -- that is, the  return of refugees. The government considers this to be a  priority and very difficult task, particularly in view of the  fact that we do not have defined borders because of the  situation with the aggressor. The borders of the (?Serbian)  cantons have not been defined because it is now impossible to  define them. [sentence as heard] We [words indistinct] on  territories that are under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  legitimate authorities and the areas now controlled by the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. We can attempt to do something  in these areas, beginning with the easier cases, meaning those  cases where people can return home -- that is, they have a place  to return to, but because of transportation or [words  indistinct] or owing to problems with possible conflicts they  actually cannot go home. Therefore, we need to facilitate their  return home to the extent that this is possible. However, we  need to have a general plan because all these issues are  mutually very intertwined, this is an entire network of  problems. If we do not come up with such a plan, we will be  unable to carry out this task. I repeat that this is a priority  task, a very complicated and difficult job.    [Leko] After the talks, (Nicholas Morris), Sadako Ogata's  special envoy, made the following statement for correspondents.    [(Morris), in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] The best solution to any problem of refugees  and displaced persons is voluntary repatriation, which means  making it possible for them to return to their homes in a safe  and dignified way. The UNHCR wishes to work closely with the  Bosnian Government in order to help carry this out. We value  that we were able to discuss this today with the prime minister.  As you know, several problems exist, but I believe they can be  solved so everyone who wishes to do so is given the chance of  returning [home] as soon as possible. The UNHCR will offer its  help to the Bosnian Government in returning people to their  homes.    [Leko] In response to a question pertaining to the  humanitarian situation in Gorazde, (Morris) said:    [(Morris)] At the moment, our convoys have no access to  Gorazde. The last convoy entered Gorazde on 22 March. In the  past three days we have distributed the last food reserves that  we had [words indistinct]. This food might last another four to  five days. We have the possibility of again delivering food  from the air. This is unsatisfactory, but it is the only  possible solution. However, owing to the configuration of the  terrain around Gorazde, the conflicts would have to stop. The  organization of medical evacuation of victims of the latest  fighting in Gorazde is an additional problem. At the same time,  the delivery of medicine to Gorazde is another problem.    [Leko] Reporters wanted to know when the air bridge and  humanitarian aid convoys would be restored.    [(Morris)] As far as the air bridge in concerned, we do not  know the answer to that, but we suppose that if no great  problems arise today, we hope that the air bridge will be  reintroduced. As far as the suspension of convoys that pass  through the territory under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, we  hope that they will be restored tomorrow or the day after.  Access to Gorazde is out of our hands. That will have to be  decided by a political solution of the problem. [end recording]</p>

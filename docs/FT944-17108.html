			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other markets External factors will continue to direct trading this week, although brokers reckon that after a 1,000-point correction in the Hang Seng index from the recent highs, the downside is now limited, writes Louise Lucas. Investors will start the week by digesting Friday's US unemployment figures with any signs of a rise in US interest rates proving negative, since such increases feed through to the colony. A second focus will be the health of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, whose rumoured death spooked both the domestic China markets and Hong Kong for much of last week. On Friday, Shanghai's A index, of shares available only to local investors, fell by almost 18 per cent at one stage, prompting the foreign ministry to issue a statement assuring investors that Deng was in fine health. This prompted a late rebound which left the index to close 12.4 per cent higher on the day. However, the statement will do little to allay fears if Deng remains hidden from public view.</p>

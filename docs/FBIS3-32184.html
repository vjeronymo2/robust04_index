			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Cox] </F>   [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 1 Feb, CANA -- Banana  producers among borrowing member countries (BMCs) of the  Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) may be in line for some  financial assistance to improve their competitiveness, according  to CDB vice-president in charge of operations, Marius St Rose.    St Rose, speaking Tuesday at a news conference at the  Barbados-based regional institution, said a programme is being  developed to improve the competitiveness of the banana industry  to ensure continued access to vital markets.    The vice-president said the CDB was considering a 160  million dollar (one EC dollar; 37 cents US) support programme,  to be pursued over a three to four-year period. The intention  is to improve the quality of bananas and reduce the cost of  production by about 20 to 25 per cent.    "As it now stands," St Rose said, "even though the Windward  Islands have ... preferential access (to the European market),  they are one of the highest cost producers and if something is  not done to reduce those costs, they are going to lose the  market."    As far as the CDB is concerned, the cost reduction should  occur at three levels: the level of the farmer, the level of  the growers' association, and the level of the distributor.    At present, for each dollar earned from bananas, the farmer  gets about 30 cents, the association gets about 30 to 35 cents,  and the distributor, Geest Industries, gets another 35 cents.    St Rose told reporters governments of the Windward Islands  met last Saturday to discuss the programme. The European Union  is expected to join CDB in financing the proposed programme.    This comes at a time when the Caribbean banana industry is  adversely affected by a number of factors, principal among which  is the depreciation of the pound sterling.    Moreover, as CDB President Sir Neville Nicholls pointed out,  "uncertainty about the future deepened as a result of  significant changes in the arrangements for marketing caribbean  bananas in the European Union."    Sir Neville said this uncertainty had induced strong  competition through increased access for lower-cost Latin  American or dollar area bananas. He added it would eventually  result in the phasing out of preferential access to Europe for  the banana-producing countries in the Caribbean, Africa and the  Pacific.</p>

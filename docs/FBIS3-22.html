			<p>Seeking     to project a conciliatory stance on North-South talks,  Pyongyang used the 9 March inter-Korean talks to create the image  that it is making constructive proposals to pave the way for the  exchange of special envoys, a step that is related to the  resumption of talks with Washington on the nuclear issue.  According to Pyongyang television on 9 March, the North Korean  side advanced a new proposal for the envoy exchange that it  claimed incorporated South Korean views on the issue.  (The  proposal, which prescribes the composition of the special envoy's  entourage, travel arrangements, and other procedural matters, was  characterized by the South Korean chief delegate as "a positive  sign," according to Seoul's government-run KBS-1 radio.)  Nevertheless, clinging to a position that could enable North  Korea to control the pace of progress at the talks, Pyongyang  television also depicted the North as still insisting on the four  basic demands it previously advanced as conditions for exchanging  envoys.     In a gesture that could facilitate an eventual compromise on its  demands, Pyongyang has slightly tempered its personal attacks on  ROK President Kim Yong-sam.  A 9 March KCNA report of a Nodong  Sinmun commentary criticizing Kim's recent remarks on North-South  relations referred to him as a "traitor" only once, while using  more neutral terms such as "South Korean rulers" and the "Kim  Yong-sam group" to refer to the ROK government.  Both sides are  set to meet again on 12 March.     (AUTHOR:  YIM.  QUESTIONS/COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, ASIA  DIVISION ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6534.)  EAG/BIETZ JEG 10/0005Z MAR</p>

The two parties pledged to work together to foil all  policies  and programs promoting capitulation, particularly since these  policies are hostile to the the Arab nation's and the Islamic  people's right to independence, to a decent life, and to  struggle to defeat the aggression that targets the nation's  existence and honor.    The two parties also asserted the need to unify all  national,  pan-Arab, and Islamic forces and mobilize all the resources of  the masses of our nation in the Arab and Islamic arenas to  oppose all forms of capitulation and normalization.    They decided to form a joint committee to devise a mechanism  of action, care for the affairs of citizens, and work to  safeguard national unity and enhance cohesion between the sons  of the homeland.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Government Bonds: German paper weakens after Bundesbank disappoints THE Bundesbank's decision to leave the key German interest rates unchanged after yesterday's council meeting proved a big disappointment for the German government bond market and bund prices ended the day weaker. Dealers said that even the release of poor industrial production figures yesterday did nothing to revive the bund market. 'A lot of people had been hoping for a cut in the Lombard and discount rates and there was a lot of disappointment,' said one trader. The DTB June long bund future fell to 95.07 by late afternoon from 95.47 in the morning and against its previous close of 95.38. Separately, the Bundesbank said it would increase the issue of 7 1/8 per cent bonds due 2002 by DM2bn bringing the total size of the issue up to DM16bn. UK government bonds continued their post-auction rally yesterday morning but fell back later in the day on profit-taking, ending up to a quarter of a point lower. The rally followed a better-than-expected auction of Pounds 3bn of 20-year stock on Wednesday, and enabled the Bank of England to sell a further Pounds 600m tranche of 10-year stock. The Bank supplied Pounds 600m of 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003, mostly at 52 7/32 only a few hours after the tranche was made available to the market. The June long gilt futures settled  5/16 down at 106.04. US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range yesterday despite a stronger-than-expected jobless claims report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/16 at 101 29/32 , yielding 6.969 per cent. At the short end of the market, however, the two-year note was steady at 99 13/16 , to yield 3.957 per cent. Prices opened mostly firmer, aided by the release of the weekly jobless claims data, which showed a rise of 33,000 in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance. The news initially buoyed sentiment, because it suggested that tomorrow's employment report for March would show a similar weakness in the labour market. Longer-dated Treasuries, however, were unable to hang on to their gains. Dealers said there were several factors behind the selling, including concern about the weak dollar, which could revive inflationary pressures; another rise in commodity prices; and an unwillingness among traders and investors to take on too much inventory ahead of today's March employment numbers. With most of the selling concentrated at the long end of the market as dealers unwound some yield curve-flattening trades, shorter-dated prices held their ground. ITALIAN government bonds closed lower, hit by the weak lira, political worries, and heavy supply. However, despite the poor background, dealers expressed relief that yesterday's auction of government bonds was fully covered. The net yield at the auction of 10-year Treasury fixed-rate bonds (BTPs) rose to 11.56 per cent from 11.36 per cent previously and a total of L2,500bn of bonds was sold. The BTP future fell from 94.37 to 93.90 yesterday, as dealers said the lira's weakness upset the market. The lira traded at 996.00 against the D-Mark, from around 990. DEALERS reported healthy demand at yesterday's auction of Spanish government bonds, and bond prices ended the day little changed despite the new supply. The Treasury sold a total of Pta1,100bn of three, five and 10-year bonds and dealers said the relatively high cover - the ratio of bids to the amount allocated - was seen as an encouraging sign for the market. DENMARK was the top-performing government bond market last month, with a return of 4.11 per cent in local currency terms, according to figures compiled by J. P. Morgan Securities. Danish bonds rallied in March as pressure on the kroner abated and the Danish central bank was able to lower its key interest rates. France and Spain ranked after Denmark with gains of 2.79 per cent and 2.12 per cent respectively in March. The French bond market took its cue from the strength of the franc against the D-Mark in the wake of the conservative coalition's sweeping election victory and hopes of an easing in monetary policy. The Bank of Spain's cut in overnight interest rates helped to boost the Spanish bond market. Australia was the best-performing market in the first quarter with a return of 7.29 per cent in local currency terms. For US-dollar based investors, UK government bonds made the strongest gains, with a return of 6.9 per cent in March.</p>

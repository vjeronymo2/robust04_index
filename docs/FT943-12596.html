			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Striking Chagall - Richard Fairman visits Schleswig-Holstein The most striking image at this year's Schleswig-Holstein festival comes courtesy of Chagall. A mural displays a colourful world populated by strangely dislocated figures, including dancers performing physically impossible hand-stands, a one-legged conductor and a violinist without a head. This is one of a group of wall paintings originally intended for the Jewish Theatre in Moscow, left behind when the artist emigrated in 1922 and only signed in the 1970s. They have not been seen before in the west and form part of a fascinating Chagall exhibition at the Schleswig-Holsteinisches Landesmuseum. The festival was fortunate to have caught the exhibition on its way round Europe, as it provides a visual counterpart to the year's musical theme. Musicians and actors, poets and dancers, all the figures in the wall paintings are Jewish. Two or three years ago, when funding and sponsorship was easier to come by, Schleswig-Holstein was able to draw up a wide-ranging programme for the 1994 festival. It was to look at Jewish music from a variety of standpoints, including works banned during the Third Reich, visiting Israeli musicians and music by contemporary Israeli composers. The subject remains a sensitive one. The synagogue in Lubeck, one of the main towns on the festival's roving itinerary, was recently the target of an arson attack, and concert venues where Jewish musicians were performing found themselves guarded by police with alsations. The first concert last Sunday brought together all the festival's Jewish sub-themes on one evening. It was given by the Israel Symphony Orchestra Rishon Lezion, founded in 1988, of which half the musicians are Russian emigres. While many professionals arriving from Russia discover that their qualifications are not accepted in Israel, the main problem for musicians is to find an orchestra that can provide work, so founding a new one (if the money can be raised) is the path to follow. The programme included one piece that qualified more or less as 'banned' music, a short elegy entitled Yizkor for viola and string orchestra, composed by Odon Partos in 1947, reminiscent of Bartok in its harmonic colouring. Another short item comprised the 'new' piece, Ben-Zion Orgad's A Vigil in Jerusalem from 1978, which made up in nocturnal atmosphere what it lacked in musical substance. In addition, we had Brigitte Fassbaender as the lead soloist in Die sieben Todsunden by Kurt Weill, who remains a central figure in the story of what happened to music in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s despite having emigrated to the US; and, to finish, Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony, the 'Reformation'. As yet, the orchestra's playing lacks finesse and bloom, though the dry acoustic at the Schloss in Kiel did not help. For the second concert they moved to the theatre at Itzehoe, two years old and a more flattering hall for musicians. Bartok's Suite from The Miraculous Mandarin certainly seemed more vital and Schubert's Ninth Symphony displayed some rich-toned string playing from time to time, although the orchestra is still some way behind its compatriots in the Israel Philharmonic, due to visit Schleswig-Holstein later in the festival. Noam Sheriff, the Israel Symphony's chief conductor, is primarily a composer and Tuesday's programme included the premiere of his Piano Concerto. It was played by Ludmila Berman, a Russian emigre. With both brevity (it lasts barely 15 minutes) and a cheerful tonal style to its name, this should not have alienated anybody who came for the Schubert after the interval. Various influences hovered in the background, but the finale seemed to settle on Bach in its two-part invention piano writing and - momentarily - Beethoven, when the opening bars of his Violin Concerto unexpectedly broke in just before the end. The Schleswig-Holstein festival runs until August 21; the Chagall exhibition at Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, is on until September 11.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: US dollar President Clinton's policy of 'benign neglect' towards the dollar had predictable results yesterday. The currency tumbled against the D-Mark and fell to a historic low against the yen. Mr Clinton may not want the pain of higher interest rates before this year's mid-term elections. But, given the high US trade deficit, he cannot afford to see the dollar slide turn into a rout. Some inducement is needed to persuade foreign investors to finance the trade gap. The best move would be a rise in short-term rates, which would be justified anyway because of the strength of the domestic recovery. But if the Fed is unwilling to act, the pain will come through higher bond yields.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Team working urged in clothes sector TEAM WORKING, rather than assembly lines, can offer substantial benefits to clothing manufacturers seeking to supply shorter runs and respond more quickly to requirements, according to a report from the National Economic Development Office. The report studies six companies using team working in the UK, US and Germany. It investigates issues such as ideal team sizes and whether part-time workers are suitable. Team working, sometimes called modular manufacturing, is when a group of workers carries out interchangeable work, for which there may be a general bonus. Three large British garment manufacturers - Coats Viyella, Courtaulds and Bairdwear - have team working in some operations. The report identifies several drawbacks with assembly line work on the new shorter runs. Take-home pay fluctuated because workers had to learn new styles. That could lead to workers' seeking alternative employment. Also evidence was growing that machinists who mainly performed a single operation were likely to be particularly susceptible to repetitive strain injuries.

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Immune system battles stress Feeling run down? Researchers at Utrecht University now think that prolonged acute stress could weaken the body's immune system, making it more prone to illness. In their study the researchers subjected secondary school teachers to stress by asking them to solve an impossible three-dimensional puzzle under a time constraint. The volunteers' white blood cell count was taken immediately before and after the stress test. In some teachers the number of natural killer cells had risen considerably by the end of the test, but returned to normal within 30 minutes. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions the researchers believe that the number and intensity of stressful events have a negative effect on the body's resistance. In the long term this could increase the chance of infections. Utrecht University Academic Hospital: The Netherlands: 31 30 507680.</p>

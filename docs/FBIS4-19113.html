			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 12 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  fisheries ministers agreed here Tuesday [12 April] to impose  tighter controls on cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland  coast of Canada, an EU spokesman said.    Under the accord, which follows a transatlantic agreement  reached in February, direct cod fishing will be suspended in the  region, known as 3 N-O, until the end of the year.    The accord confirms the ceiling set by the earlier agreement  of 6,000 tonnes for by-catches in the region.    Under the by-catches arrangement, vessels fishing for other  species are allowed a limit of 5 percent cod in their catch, up  to the 6,000-tonne ceiling.    Canada had been asking for a total ban on cod fishing in the  region, arguing that continued exploitation was threatening to  wipe out stocks of the species there completely.    Earlier in the day the EU fisheries ministers agreed to  apply  stricter controls on fish imports, mainly from Russian,  Ukrainian and Polish ships, in a bid to combat a glut of cheap  foreign fish.</p>

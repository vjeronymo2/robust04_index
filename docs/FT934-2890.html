			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / US plans to cut army reserve Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, yesterday announced plans to cut the army reserve and National Guard troop strength by 100,000 over the next five years, writes George Graham from Washington. The plan to cut the army reserves to 575,000 in 1999 drew reluctant support from reserve officers and influential members of Congress who have blocked previous attempts by the Pentagon to shrink the reserve in line with the reduction in the overall size of US armed forces. Some analysts estimate these cuts could save as much as Dollars 2bn a year when fully phased in, at a time when bad inflation forecasts and Congress's decision to raise military pay have left the Pentagon Dollars 40bn-Dollars 50bn short of what it believes it needs over the next five years to maintain its desired force structure.</p>

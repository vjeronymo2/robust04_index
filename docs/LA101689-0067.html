			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS;  </P> <P> SO FAR, LA RUSSA'S DECISIONS KO GIANTS  </P> <P> A graduate of the Florida State law school and a member of the Florida bar,  Tony La Russa understands the risk of circumstantial evidence and avoids  employing it in his role as the Oakland Athletics' manager.  </P> <P> La Russa operates from a bank of computers, scouting reports, statistics and  comparative percentages.  </P> <P> No manager, his players insist, is better prepared.  </P> <P> Yet in preparing his lineup for the 1989 World Series, La Russa made a pair of  decisions that seemed at odds with each other and were hunches at best.  </P> <P> The evidence? On the surface, even less than circumstantial.  </P> <P> "I do trust my gut a lot, but that's nothing more than feeling I know a lot  about my players. I wouldn't call that a hunch," La Russa said Sunday night  after his A's defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-1, for a 2-0 World Series  lead.  </P> <P> If the Giants are finding this hard to stomach, blame La Russa's gut.  </P> <P> First he benched the versatile Mike Gallego -- a guy he recently called his  team's most valuable player -- and employed Walt Weiss at shortstop.  </P> <P> Weiss was the American League's rookie of the year last season, but was  sidelined for more than two months of the 1989 season with a knee injury and  has had trouble regaining his batting eye.  </P> <P> Weiss, however, is a switch-hitter and La Russa announced that he wanted to  load his lineup with left-handed bats against right-hander Scott Garrelts, the  Game 1 starter.  </P> <P> Weiss responded with a home run in the 5-0 victory.  </P> <P> Along with that, however, La Russa decided to keep another left-handed hitter,  catcher Ron Hassey, on the bench and went with the right-handed hitting Terry  Steinbach against Garrelts and Game 2 starter Rick Reuschel, who is also a  right-hander.  </P> <P> "Different considerations," La Russa said Sunday of the decision to start Weiss  and not Hassey. "That's why I'm paid to manage."  </P> <P> So who's arguing?  </P> <P> Steinbach merely singled against Garrelts to help ignite a three-run rally,  then hammered a three-run, fourth inning homer against Reuschel.  </P> <P> His reward?  </P> <P> Hassey will start Game 3 against Don Robinson, who is just as right-handed as  Garrelts and Reuschel.  </P> <P> Who can figure?  </P> <P> Not Steinbach, who smiled, shook his head and said he hasn't come to grips yet  with all of La Russa's thinking and is not sure he ever will.  </P> <P> "Ron and I expect to play every day, but we respect each other and we respect  Tony's decisions," Steinbach said.  </P> <P> "I may not always agree with his reasoning but his door is open and he'll  always give us a reason -- stats, gut instinct, whatever.  </P> <P> "Our pitching staff has led the American League in ERA for two straight years,  and both Ron and myself feel we've contributed to that.  </P> <P> "I mean, it's a tribute to the type club management has built here that the  nine guys on the field aren't the only ones who contribute."  </P> <P> La Russa agreed, saying it was difficult to sit Gallego, difficult to sit  Hassey.  </P> <P> "It will be difficult to sit Steiny Tuesday night, but that's what happens when  you have a good club," the manager said.  </P> <P> And why Steinbach Sunday.  </P> <P> "He generally catches when Mike Moore pitches," La Russa said, "and I've been  watching him closely.  </P> <P> "He's swinging the bat well and working hard and that pays off."  </P> <P> In addition, La Russa said he was so confident that Steinbach would dig into a  Reuschel sinker that he predicted to TV reporters that his catcher would hit a  home run.  </P> <P> Steinbach laughed when he heard that.  </P> <P> "Heck, I didn't even know I was starting until the lineup was posted," he said.  </P> <P> And did he hit a sinker?  </P> <P> "That's about all Reuschel throws," Steinbach said. "I got ahead 2-and-0 and  was looking for him to get a sinker up in the strike zone, which is what he  did. It was a great feeling."  </P> <P> Previously, Steinbach's most notable home run came off Dwight Gooden in the  1988 All-Star game, when he emerged as the most valuable player after Oakland  fans stuffed the ballot box, making him something of an unjustified starter.  </P> <P> "The All-Star game is an individual thing," he said Sunday night. "This put us  closer to our team goal. It means a lot more to me."  </P> <P> The 27-year-old Steinbach hit only seven homers during a strange season in  which he batted .301 in April, .385 in May, .292 through June and the two weeks  before the July All-Star break, then only .216 over the second half.  </P> <P> "I can't explain that," he said, "except that I feel I used up all my luck in  the first half. Everything I hit seemed to fall in. I had good at bats and bad  at bats in the second half, but not that same luck.  </P> <P> "I definitely struggled some, but I feel my swing has been coming back lately  and maybe this will be the start of something good for me."  </P> <P> Said La Russa: "Steiny isn't afraid of anything. He isn't afraid of the  pressure of a World Series or starting an All-Star game after being ridiculed  nationally. That's another reason he was in there tonight."  </P> <P> Which doesn't explain why he won't be Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Different considerations," reiterated the man who's paid to manage the A's.  </P></p>

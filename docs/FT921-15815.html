			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Vasp axes jobs as losses reach close to Dollars 60m VASP, the Brazilian airline, is cutting its workforce by 5.5 per cent in the face of a nation-wide recession which threw the company into losses of up to Dollars 60m for 1991. Although Vasp won some market share from domestic competitors last year its ticket sales fell by 8 per cent as the recession in the Brazilian airline industry began to bite. Some 560 employees will be laid off out of a workforce of 11,000. Mr Wagner Canhedo, the president and leading shareholder, launched an aggressive expansion campaign for the airline after the group's privatisation in 1990. The company expanded into the international market and has routes to the west coast of the US, Argentina and Aruba. Mr Carlos Brighi, a company spokesman, said the Vasp's troubles would not alter its plans. He said it intended to invest about Dollars 2.5bn in the future and hoped to win routes to Miami, Brussels and Seoul.</p>

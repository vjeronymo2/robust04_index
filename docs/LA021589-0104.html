			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP WEDNESDAY;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> 3-A;  </P> <P> COMPETITION SHOULD BE FIERCE FROM THE START  </P> <P> With no byes, no at-large entries and no easy games, the 3-A division of the  Southern Section boys' basketball playoffs is, in a word, tough.  </P> <P> Compared with the other eight divisions, the 3-A has the best depth, basically  making this year's championship wide open.  </P> <P> "The 3-A? I like it," said Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien, whose Eagles are one of  11 Orange County schools in the competition.  </P> <P> "It's solid top to bottom -- there's no dominating teams. And because there  aren't any byes, whoever wins the championship is going to have to play five  tough games."  </P> <P> Starting with the first round. Most coaches agree that even the top-seeded  teams -- No. 1 Rolling Hills, No. 2 La Canada, No. 3 Savanna and No. 4  Morningside -- might not see the light of second-round action. Competition is  that fierce.  </P> <P> Consider this first-round matchup: Corona del Mar (15-9, third in the Sea View  League) at El Dorado (20-4, first in Empire League).  </P> <P> Though Corona del Mar's record isn't too impressive, the Sea Kings waged a  hearty nonleague campaign against larger schools -- many more than twice their  size. Corona del Mar defeated such playoff teams as Irvine, Los Alamitos, Dana  Hills and Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> And, El Dorado, which was 10-0 in league play, is riding a 14-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to be either one of those teams," Brea-Olinda Coach Rick Jones  said. "That (matchup) is scary."  </P> <P> Most coaches, while saying the division is wide open, sided with the top-seeded  teams as their favorites.  </P> <P> A look at the top four:  </P> <P>  -- Rolling Hills (22-4). Led by 6-foot-4, 230-pound senior John Hardy, who  averages 28 points a game, the Titans shoot well from inside and out, like to  run and press, and do both well.  </P> <P> They also have great playoff experience under Cliff Warren, who, in three years  as coach, led Rolling Hills to the 1986 quarterfinals, the 1987 final (which it  lost to Saugus) and the 1988 semifinals (which it lost to eventual champion  Kennedy).  </P> <P>  -- La Canada (23-2). The Spartans have a returning all-Southern Section player  in 6-7 center Chad Givens, and a starting lineup that averages 6-6. La Canada  plays a control-oriented offense, but is effective on the run as well.  </P> <P>  -- Savanna (23-2). The Rebels, ranked fourth in Orange County, feature  talented sophomore Mustapha Abdi and senior Tim Tillman.  </P> <P> "I have guarded optimism," Savanna Coach Tom Gregory said. "But since all  playoff games are sudden death, every game is a war."  </P> <P> If the Rebels get through their first-round game against Azusa, they could find  themselves in an interesting matchup with Trabuco Hills, one of many teams  considered to be a dark horse.  </P> <P>  -- Morningside (20-4). A team with maybe the best quickness and the best  athletes in the division, Morningside features well-balanced scoring, height  and depth. Jeff Crowe, a 6-7 junior center, 6-7 forward Chris Vance and 6-6  forward Eddie Scott (cousin of Laker guard Byron Scott) lead the Monarchs,  which swept the Ocean League at 14-0.  </P> <P> A closer look at the Orange County teams involved:  </P> <P>  -- Trabuco Hills (17-6) has one of the division's best players in 6-10,  225-pound center Rick Swanwick, who is averaging 20.3 points and 13.5 rebounds  and is shooting 62% from the field.  </P> <P>  -- Estancia (19-5), led by Mike Curtis, Augustin Heredia and Tim Kjar, is a  feisty team able to outduel stronger, taller teams by intensity alone. The  Eagles, who came within three points (58-55) of upsetting Saddleback, are  especially dangerous from three-point range. A three-game losing streak might  signal distress.  </P> <P>  -- La Quinta (18-5) has the county's scoring leader in senior Scott Campbell  (28.9 points a game). Campbell also leads the county in making 62.7% of his  three-point shots. Although Campbell was flat last Friday -- held to a  season-low five points by Pacifica -- La Quinta proved with a 25-point  performance from James Johnson it's more than a one-player team.  </P> <P>  -- Brea-Olinda (19-7) is led by Keith Walker (26 points per game). A bigger  plus? The Wildcats are, for the first time this season, completely healthy and  injury-free.  </P> <P>  -- Western (16-6), probably the best third-place team along with Corona del  Mar, is a dark horse choice by many. Joe Romero leads the team with 17.6 points  per game.  </P> <P>  -- Foothill (15-10), a team that had no returning letterman from last year,  has been a surprise. The Knights are led by 6-4 forward Mark Wilkinson (16.8  points) and guard Ward Van Pelt (7.7 assists).  </P> <P>  -- Rancho Alamitos (12-9) is led by Gary Lira (15.7 points) and Richard Pearce  (9.7 rebounds). Rancho Alamitos has won its past six games, including a 61-51  upset over Kennedy Friday night.  </P> <P>  -- Laguna Hills (15-9) has four-year starting guard Chris Sheff, who is  averaging 18.7 points a game. The Hawks' first-round game against La Quinta  will be a real test.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3-A IN A BOX  </P> <P> Teams to beat: Rolling Hills (22-4), La Canada (23-2), Savanna (23-2) and  Morningside (20-4).  </P> <P> Dark horses: Western (16-6), Trabuco Hills (17-6).  </P> <P> Players to watch: Scott Campbell (La Quinta), Chad Givens (La Canada), John  Hardy (Rolling Hills), Rick Swanwick (Trabuco Hills), Keith Walker  (Brea-Olinda).  </P> <P> Best first-round game: Corona del Mar (15-9) at El Dorado (20-4).  </P> <P> Final Four prediction: Rolling Hills vs. Morningside, Trabuco Hills vs. La  Canada.  </P></p>

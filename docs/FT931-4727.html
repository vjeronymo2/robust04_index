			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major triggers row on Scots water sale MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday stole the thunder of Scottish secretary Mr Ian Lang in the Commons yesterday when he appeared to indicate that the government had decided to press ahead with privatisation of the Scottish water industry. Questioned by a Scottish National party MP, Mr Major asserted that he had 'no reason to doubt that water privatisation in Scotland will be effective and efficient as elsewhere'. He added: 'Privatisation means a better, more efficient service for the consumer and no more subsidy from the taxpayer.' His comments came minutes before the Scottish secretary's much-flagged statement on the government's 'taking stock' exercise set out in a white paper on administrative changes in Scotland. Mr Lang's statement was completely overshadowed by the prime minister's comments. Mr Major's remarks were immediately jumped on by Labour, who accused him of indicating 'almost by sleight of hand' that privatisation would be introduced in Scotland contrary to the wishes of the Scottish people. Downing Street later played down the significance of the prime minister's remarks, saying he was not trying to pre-empt the consultation process on Scottish water. But it was clear from the tone of the comments that Mr Major's personal inclination was to push ahead. The Scottish Office is studying responses to a consultation paper on Scottish water, now administered by regional councils. The paper listed several alternatives, including the sale of water companies, the franchising of water services to the private sector by local authorities and the status quo. There are signs that ministers accept that outright privatisation would be difficult within this parliament, since water companies would have to be created from the councils and would then have to establish a track record before they could be sold. An ICM opinion poll in The Scotsman newspaper this week showed that 86 per cent of those asked, and 72 per cent of Tories, thought water should stay in the hands of councils. Mr Lang's statement received a predictably dismissive welcome from the opposition benches, with MPs cheering ironically every new measure that was announced. Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, described it as 'sheer tokenism, talking shops and timid and tired policies'. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National Party leader, said it amounted to 'a constitutional charade'. The package of measures unveiled by Mr Lang aims to improve parliament's handling of Scottish affairs, and intends to both enhance Scotland's status in the UK and stave off Scottish demands for constitutional change.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Soldiers Must Be Tolerant"] </F>   [Text] Although Thailand played a significant part along  with the international community in stopping the civil war and  bringing about the election in Cambodia, it appears that it has  not received due credit from certain leaders in the Cambodian  Government. Thailand has even been discredited on several  occasions.    The sole issue the Cambodians have repeatedly used to  discredit Thailand results from distrust of Thailand out of fear  that the Thai military might still aid the Khmer Rouge due to  interests arising from various activities along the border.  This issue has frustrated Thai military leaders for some time.    The issue came to a boiling point when certain Cambodian  Government leaders in order to discredit Thailand brought out  pictures taken long ago of Thai military officers with Khmer  Rouge leaders. The military leaders appealed to the government  to voice an objection and take immediate retaliatory measures.    This is the first time that Thai military leaders have  displayed their anger, and it is understandable. However, the  vehement display of their feelings could have international  ramifications, because it is tantamount to an unwritten  declaration of Thailand's readiness to take military action.    Political ruses are engaged in all the time. They should be  countered politically, not by pounding the table. Therefore,  although we sympathize with the Thai military over the unfair  accusations, we appeal for calm so that we can make a proper  analysis of the game the Cambodians are playing and its intended  objective.    We do not believe that certain Cambodian Government leaders  are unaware of the change in Thailand's border policy. Trading  activities with the Khmer Rouge by minor businessmen have  continued to some extent. But why use them to discredit  Thailand? By saying that the Thai military and government have  two separate identities, we think the Cambodian leaders are  giving themselves room for dialogue.    In international politics, an aggressive stance is taken up  by one side when it is confident that it can cause the other  side to retreat or when it is far superior in power. This stand  is taken only as a last resort. We wish every side concerned to  reconsider whether it is now time to display such a stance.</p>

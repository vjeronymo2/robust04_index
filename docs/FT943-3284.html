			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / OECD rivalry intensifies Ambassadors of the 25 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development met yesterday and again failed to resolve the Franco-Canadian rivalry for the secretary-generalship, increasing the prospect of no decision before the term of the French incumbent, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, ends on September 30. The only new development this week came with the withdrawal of Mr Lorenz Schomerus, the German candidate. This probably gives one further vote to Mr Paye, who is running for a third five-year term and who may now have a majority of OECD governments behind him. However, the OECD takes decisions by consensus, and the US has so far given no indication of withdrawing its strong support for the Canadian candidate, Mr Donald Johnston. Washington argues it is time for the organisation to be run by a non-European.</p>

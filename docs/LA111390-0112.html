			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW WATER PRESSURE AT FIRE BLAMED ON OVERTAXED SYSTEM  </P> <P> Fire investigators said Monday that one of nine hydrants in a luxury Thousand  Oaks apartment complex ravaged by fire over the weekend had been partially  turned off -- a violation of the county fire code.  </P> <P> Fire codes require hydrants to be working when structures are in the framing  stage, as were 18 of the 25 apartment buildings destroyed Saturday at The  Knolls complex on Avenida de los Arboles, officials said.  </P> <P> Fire investigator David Chovanec said it has not been determined who turned off  the hydrant.  </P> <P> However, Chovanec said that it is common for contractors or subcontractors to  shut off a hydrant briefly while plumbing work is being done.  </P> <P> The hydrant was reactivated by an official from the Thousand Oaks utilities  department about 5 p.m. Saturday, two hours after the fire started, said  Assistant Chief Jim Smith of the Fire Department.  </P> <P> However, Smith said that the hydrant was not close to the fire and was never  used to battle the blaze Saturday.  </P> <P> Fire officials originally complained that the water supply was inadequate,  believing several hydrants might have been turned off. Instead, they said  Monday, it had been determined that the low water pressure they experienced  Saturday was caused by their own firefighting efforts, which overwhelmed the  system, Smith said.  </P> <P> He added that because the fire struck unstuccoed, wood-frame structures it  spread more quickly and buildings were less flame-resistant than if they had  been completed. Consequently, firefighters needed more water more quickly.  </P></p>

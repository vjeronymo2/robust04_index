			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Vehicle makers to expand: Nissan is investing Pounds 26m in its Sunderland plant and Land Rover is recruiting 300 more workers to boost output TWO VEHICLE makers announced expansion plans yesterday, underlining the resurgent competitiveness of the industry in the face of slumping continental car demand and output. Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is proposing a Pounds 26m expansion of its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, even though it is temporarily halving output from the site because of the market downturn in continental Europe. Land Rover is recruiting a further 300 workers to increase production of its four-wheel-drive vehicles. This will bring to 600 the total recruited since September by Land Rover, which is based in Solihull, West Midlands. The company is part of British Aerospace's Rover vehicles group. Nissan's new investment at Sunderland has been prompted partly by the strength of the Japanese yen. The expansion includes a Pounds 16m rear axle sub-assembly plant, replacing imported axles made by Nissan in Japan. Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK yesterday declined, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, to say what reduction would result in the production costs of Sunderland-made cars. Nor would the company, which has cut Sunderland's 1993 output from 270,000 cars to 246,000, specify the planned capacity of the axle plant, due to begin operating in early 1996. At present Nissan is shedding jobs at Sunderland by non-replacement, so new axle plant posts may be filled from the existing workforce. The company plans to continue importing transmissions and engine blocks, the most expensive components, from Japan. More than 80 per cent of components by value come from European suppliers. Nissan is suspending night-shifts for its 2,400 production workers from November 8 until the end of December. Output next year may be below 246,000 cars, but the company says it is still investing for the future. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director and chief executive, said: 'The proposed new developments will broaden our manufacturing base and strengthen our ability to respond to the forecast long-term market growth in Europe following the current recession.' The Pounds 26m expansion includes a Pounds 10m extension to the existing plastic parts paint shop to cater for increasing demand for colour co-ordination. Nissan says it will introduce the latest environmentally friendly paint technologies. Its planning application will be considered by Sunderland City councillors next month. Approval looks assured as the expansion is within Nissan's existing site. The company said the proposals had no bearing on its row with Sunderland Football Club over the club's plan for a Pounds 70m sport and entertainment complex on land beside the car plant. At Land Rover, the latest recruitment campaign will lift the company's total employment to 8,700 and put it on course to achieve record production levels by a large margin - mainly reflecting soaring demand in the UK and overseas for its Discovery model. Combined output of the Discovery, the Defender military/utility vehicle and the up-market Range Rover will be running at an annualised rate of 83,000 units when the latest additions to the workforce are fully operative from November 8. As a result, the company expects this year to exceed substantially not only last year's production of 57,000 units but the record output of 66,000 achieved in 1990. Much of this expectation is fuelled by a 46.8 per cent increase in UK sales of Discoveries in the first three quarters of this year, lifting Land Rover's total UK sales by one-third - to 20,291 - compared with the same period last year. Honda is preparing to market the Discovery, badged as the Honda Crossroad, in Japan. The model is also to be launched early next year in North America, where Land Rover plans to quadruple total sales to 16,000 units annually over the next five years.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Toyota unveils range of family cars TOYOTA has unveiled in Tokyo the large family-car range to be produced near Derby from the end of the year as part of the company's Pounds 840m investment in UK car and engine plants. Production of the new-generation Carina - sold as the Corona in Japan - is scheduled to begin at Toyota's Pounds 700m car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, in December. Engine production at the company's Pounds 140m plant at Deeside, north Wales, is planned to begin in August. The car will be shown in Europe for the first time at the Geneva Motor Show next month. It will be launched in Europe in the spring with supplies coming initially from Japan and later from the UK plant. The Carina will be the first car built by Toyota in Europe and will be the main focus of its effort to increase its share of the western European market for new cars. It will also allow the Japanese carmaker for the first time to launch a concerted attack on the UK market for company and fleet cars. Sales in Japan are expected to reach 108,000 a year. In the UK, the Toyota Carina will pose significant competition for models such as the Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Sierra, Peugeot 405 and Nissan Primera, the car built by Toyota's biggest domestic Japanese rival in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. Toyota expects to produce 31,000 Carinas at Burnaston in 1993, the first full year of production, with output set to rise rapidly to 100,000 a year in 1995, of which 75 per cent will be for export. By 1997, output from Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) is planned to rise to 200,000 cars a year. To date the UK company has hired a workforce of about 400, but recruitment is set to accelerate during 1992. Employees are being trained in Japan, the US and Canada as well as in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The workforce is eventually due to increase to 3,000 at Burnaston and 300 on Deeside when full capacity is reached. Toyota is aiming to reach a 60 per cent local European content level by 1993 and 80 per cent by mid 1995. European components purchases are planned to reach about Pounds 700m a year at full production of 200,000 cars a year. Toyota has given final supply contracts to 68 components suppliers in Europe for the UK Carina production programme. Eventually Toyota is expected to export some cars and engines from the UK plants to Japan.</p>

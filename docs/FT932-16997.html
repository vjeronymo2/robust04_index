			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Nestle considers listing on NYSE NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, is considering applying to have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 'We are very interested,' Mr Francois Perroux, the group spokesman, confirmed yesterday, but he did not expect a decision within the next few weeks. Mr Perroux said Nestle overcame the main obstacle three years ago, when it began to publish accounts according to international accounting standards. Its 1992 accounts will take an important step further towards US-style full disclosure by publishing for the first time a breakdown of profits by business segment. Last week, when the group published its preliminary 1992 results, it revealed it would submit a plan for simplifying its three-tier share structure to the annual general meeting on May 27. Under this scheme, both the participation certificates and the bearer shares would be converted into registered shares. 'The board is convinced this measure will render Nestle shares even more attractive to institutional investors,' the group said. Mr Perroux said that the share structure simplification would also mean that the group's two US deposit receipt programmes could be merged into one. Many large European companies have become increasingly interested in foreign share listings in recent years, as they anticipate their needs for capital outstripping the capacity of local markets to provide it. Earlier this week, Daimler-Benz of Germany said that it had reached agreement with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that would lead to a listing of its shares in New York later this year. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has also expressed interest.</p>

Han Tok-su says in his message that the great leader, last  year, too, with his outstanding and tested guidance, smashed the  most blatant anti-DPRK racket of the imperialists at every step,  resolutely defended the socialism of chuche and built a powerful  military strength and laid a more solid foundation of the  independent economy and, furthermore, brought about a rich  harvest, thus displaying the grand appearance of the country of  chuche to the world.    It notes that the great leader personally initiated the  excavation of the Tomb of Tangun last year, had wisely led this  work and had a decision on properly inheriting and developing  the national cultural heritage adopted at the Sixth Session of  the 9th Supreme People's Assembly, thereby instilling national  pride into the heart of our people.    It recalls that the great leader worked out and published  last year "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the country", a great political  charter common to the nation, and led the entire fellow  countrymen to the accomplishment of the cause of reunification  through confederacy in the '90s.    Han Tok-su stresses the need to build up the Chongnyon  organisation into a powerful patriotic unit rooted among the  compatriots, defend to the end the socialist country of chuche  centred on the popular masses, resolutely repulsing any form of  suppression and persecution by the imperialists, in the New Year.    He sincerely wishes Generalissimo Kim Il-song a long life in  good health.</p>

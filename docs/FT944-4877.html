			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (5): Sharp price cuts demanded - The squeeze is on manufacturing sub-contractors Cost reductions by Japan's largest manufacturing companies during the rigours of recession have come partly at the expense of their armies of sub-contractors. Industrial heavyweights such as Toyota and Matsushita have been demanding sharp price cuts and encouraging suppliers to seek new customers as they scale back their own production and strive to reduce break-even points. They have kept up the pressure, even into the mild recovery. Nearly two-thirds of Japan's biggest industrial customers have increased in-house production of components in an attempt to reduce costs over the past year, while a third have reduced their number of suppliers, according to the latest white paper on small businesses from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Some sub-contractors have been left high and dry by the shift of industrial production overseas, to 6.6 per cent of manufacturing output last year, more than double the level in the mid-1980s, according to the Japan Research Institute. In many cases, the pressure on small suppliers' sales and margins has been intolerable. For the first time in post-war years, the number of business collapses exceeded start-ups just after the onset of the economic downturn in 1991. Bankruptcies, of which small manufacturing sub-contractors formed the majority, continued to rise until last July, when Japan's slow economic recovery began to ease the pressure. The survivors have prevailed by screwing down their own costs, as shown by the contrasting experience of three sub-contractors around Osaka, the heartland of Japan's electronics industry. They hold very different ranks in Japan's feudal-style industrial structure, but they share one thing; the realisation that near-total dependence on a single large client is not the guarantee of survival it used to be for most of Japan's post-1950s economic expansion. The largest and most successful of them, Showa Plastics, a 2,200-employee producer of plastic casings, with a head office in central Osaka, has been entrepreneurial enough to follow its customers to cheaper locations overseas. It has closed more than half its domestic production over the past five years and relocated next to its Japanese buyers' new overseas plants in Asia, the US and Europe. Showa is a member of the family of more than 6,000 local companies serving Osaka-based Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics group. The electronics giant has shifted about 60 per cent of what used to be its local component purchasing offshore, mainly into neighbouring Asian countries, since the early 1980s. All of Showa's main customers have followed the same pattern. 'Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony are more willing to buy from me in Singapore than in Tokyo. They won't even see me in Tokyo,' says Showa Plastics' president, Mr Kenzo Nakagawa. In the past five years, Showa has closed four of its eight Japanese plants and reduced its domestic workforce from 550 to 150. This is unusually aggressive restructuring by the standards of Showa's Japanese competitors, who pride themselves on not cutting jobs. Showa's rapid foreign expansion has helped it to broaden its client base, so that the top three customers now account for 40 per cent of sales, from 75 per cent in the mid-1980s. But the most important benefit of moving production out of Japan is to protect Showa from the yen's inexorable rise. Showa's prices have fallen by 30 per cent over the past four years. But unit costs have also fallen, helped by the decline in foreign currencies against the yen, far enough for Showa to increase its profits throughout the downturn. Takizawa Precision Gear, a 14-staff producer of machine tool gears, has taken a more traditional approach to the squeeze imposed by its clients by staying put and stepping up the search for internal self-improvement. 'Customers are less loyal than in old times,' mourns Mr Kiyoshi Takizawa, president of the Takizawa Precision Gear. Mr Takizawa devotes 40 per cent of annual sales to his top three customers. That is a big enough exposure to make it impossible to resist their demands for price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for the past four years, he says. Sales have shrunk from Y300m to Y200m over the same period, perilously close to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point. Instead of sacking his tiny workforce, Mr Takizawa has increased spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip with Swiss machine tools and carried out an engineering cost analysis. He justifies sticking to the old invest-or-die approach on the grounds that Takizawa has few foreign competitors, allowing him to market more on quality than on price. But Mr Takizawa admits that 'there is nothing we can do' if the Japanese market continues to shrink. Nearby, Meisei Metal Industries, a 140-staff maker of metal dies for the car industry, has joined forces with other sub-contractors, to seek economies of scale. Meisei's top three customers account for 85 per cent of sales and the group has had to accept price cuts as high as 30 per cent this year, as a result of which it has fallen into loss for the first time since the economic downturn began. It formed a joint company two years ago with three other sub-contractors to service a joint customer, a car group. The sub-contracting group, called Must, after the initial letters of its company members, saves costs by pooling design, marketing and finance. This also saves costs for the customer, by reducing the number of suppliers it has to handle. Several of Meisei's competitors have adopted the same strategy and Meisei itself may launch Must-type groups for other important customers. Mergers between car industry sub-contractors will inevitably increase, believes Mr Yozo Ueda, Meisei's vice-president. He estimates that up to 30 per cent of his competitors will go out of business 'sooner or later.' If he is right, Japan's manufacturing sub-contractors will come into the economic upturn late, as their big customers continue to squeeze prices, to ensure their own recovery. It supports the widespread assumption that the general economic recovery will be painfully slow.</p>

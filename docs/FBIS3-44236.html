An attempt to arrange such a meeting is being  made. The government's chief negotiator, Roelf Meyer, told the  media tonight that the constitutional differences between the  three parties involved are not unbridgeable. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording, Meyer in progress] ...the differences are  in fact very small, and I really hope that tomorrow -- if the  talks do take place -- we will eliminate those things that are  still in the way. It is all about formulation of the relevant  items which deal with powers and capabilities of provinces in  the new dispensation. As far as the government is concerned, we  have made a proposal on how the problem can be solved, but if we  get the ANC's cooperation and Freedom Alliance's on this, then  there should be no problem.    [Reporter] Mr. Meyer was more optimistic about the  negotiations with the Afrikaner National Front on a homeland for  whites and about talks with the kwaZulu kingship over the role  of the Zulu king in a future dispensation.    [Meyer] The talks during the last week with the National  Front and the Zulu king's representatives went off well. There  are positive signs, and I think that on both of those aspects we  could come to an agreement as early as tomorrow. The most  important assurance from our side to the supporters of a  homeland -- and that is what has surfaced in our previous  discussions -- is that the homeland idea has to be accepted as a  possible solution for self- determination for the Afrikaner.  And we are now trying to find a formula on how that fact can be  assured and be continued even after the election. [end recording]</p>

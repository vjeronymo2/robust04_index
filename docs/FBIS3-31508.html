			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Premier Vladimir Meciar  is unlikely to take seriously his own proclamation on launching  a petition campaign to support his proposal for a June early  election date, Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) told journalists today.    Procedures linked to the possible calling of a referendum,  along with the constitutional provision that an electoral  campaign cannot be launched earlier than 90 days after the  referendum, make it impossible for the June term to be saved,  Simko argued.    He expressed his disappointment over Wednesday's [16  February] parliamentary voting on the government bill to shorten  the electoral term by a half. The proposal was rejected not  because of failure of the opposition, but because of the  surprising abstention of Hungarian deputies, he said. This  fact, along with Wednesday's support for the "ill Slovak  Government" by those deputies from the Meciar-led Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) who internally disagree with Meciar's  policy, might affect today's voting on the deputies' bill  concerning the same issue, Simko stressed.    The bill on shortening the electoral term submitted by the  opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) differs from the  government bill only in the proposed date of early elections,  which the SDL wants in November.    Simko drew attention to the current "Slovak Government's  extraordinary privatization activity." In view of increasing  speculations on a possible no confidence vote on the cabinet,  "privatization has been underway even at night," he noted.    KDH Deputy Chairman Emil Komarik said that Slovakia was  facing the threat of dictatorship and loss of independence. If  a temporary broad coalition government is created, the KDH wants  to share part of the executive power, while supposing the new  premier to be again a HZDS member, Komarik said.</p>

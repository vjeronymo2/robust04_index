			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lusaka peace talks may continue to be  productive, but the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] leader has dampened everybody's optimism when he  again complicated matters by demanding that his organization  govern Huambo, Bie, and Benguela Provinces at any cost. He  alleges that the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola [MPLA] did not win elections in those provinces. MPLA  Information Secretary Joao Lourenco, who is also a deputy in the  National Assembly, has just told the People's Television of  Angola, TPA, that UNITA must accept that it lost the September  1992 elections. He added that those elections had been general  and not regional.    [Begin Lourenco recording] Jonas Savimbi is a real cheeky  fellow, but we do not believe he has the right to make the  demands that he just made. He must recognize that he lost the  September 1992 elections. He must behave as a loser and not as  a winner. The winning party formed the government. As a matter  of good will, it decided to open government to several figures  in opposition parties, including of course UNITA, which is led  by Mr. Jonas Savimbi. It should be understood, though, that  this was a government offer and not something the government was  obliged to do. [end recording]    Commenting on the ministerial portfolios demanded by UNITA,  MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco warned that the  government's patience has a limit. He added that UNITA's  demands are quite absurd.    [Begin Lourenco recording] This is a matter that must be  made  quite clear. UNITA did not win the September 1992 elections.  It cannot demand -- there is nothing that awards it that right  -- to be given this or that ministerial portfolio, particularly  when it comes to portfolios that the government believes should  not be in the hands of opposition parties. We believe that the  government has shown great generosity. If one looks at the  number of portfolios that the government has given the  opposition in general, and UNITA in particular, one surely will  find that they add up to a considerable number. Such portfolios  include posts such as ministers, deputy ministers, governors of  certain provinces, and administrators of districts and communes,  and they make up a considerable number. In view of that, the  government believes that UNITA must not continue to make demands  concerning central and provincial government posts. [end  recording]</p>

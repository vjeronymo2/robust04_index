			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  U.S. District Court Judge Earl B. Gilliam on Wednesday denied a request for a  temporary restraining order that would have prohibited San Diego-based Smith  Laboratories from implementing a shareholder protection plan. The order was  sought by Joel Rocha Garza, a Mexico City resident who, along with Clarendon  Group, an affiliated firm, owns 8.46% of Smith's common stock.  </P> <P> Garza has indicated that he is interested in acquiring more of Smith's stock.  "We are pleased with Judge Gilliam's ruling but recognize that Mr. Garza will  have additional avenues to pursue in the future," said Smith President Timothy  J. Wollaeger.  </P></p>

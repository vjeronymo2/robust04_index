			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / People: Greycoat Michael Beckett, 58, a former managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields, has added to his reputation as a bit of a trouble-shooter by taking on the chairmanship of Greycoat, the property developer which was rescued from the brink of collapse last November. The company, which completed its financial restructuring earlier this year, has been looking for a new chairman for several months. Geoffrey Wilson, who founded the company and turned it into one of London's most ambitious property developers, retired in April and was replaced on an interim basis by George Constantinidi who has been a director since 1982 and will remain on the board. Beckett has a history of joining boards of troubled companies, often at the behest of the institutional investors. However, sources close to Greycoat suggested that the institutions had not played any role in Beckett's latest appointment. He is already chairman of Watts Blake Bearne, Horace Clarkson and Monarch Resources and sits on the boards of several other companies including Queens Moat Houses, Amstrad and Ashanti Goldfields.</p>

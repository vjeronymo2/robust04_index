			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Italy's withholding tax reform will shift investment patterns THE changes to Italy's investment taxation regime, announced last week as part of the government's economic package, will not only shift patterns of investment in Italy, but will have a knock-on effect in several areas of the international capital markets. Eurobonds issued by some supranational agencies (the World Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Agency) and government and state agencies (the Republic of Italy, Enel, the electricity utility, Crediop, the financial institution, and Ferrovie, the national railway) have lost their tax exemption for Italian residents, and future deals will have withholding tax levied at 12 1/2 per cent. But existing issues remain exempt from withholding tax, even if they continue to be traded. Prices in existing tax-exempt issues rallied on the news on Friday. The World Bank's global bond issues benefitted most, with the yield spread on its Dollars 1.5bn five-year global narrowing from 3 basis points above the five-year treasury to 10 basis points below. The bank's 10-year yen global bonds tightened from 20 basis points to 12 basis points over the 10-year Japanese government bond yield. However, there was concern that the effect of aggressive buying of these issues would 'strip all our liquid benchmarks out of the market,' one trader said. Other Eurobonds did not appear to be following these deals to tighter spreads. The tightening of existing paper should help the World Bank achieve aggressive funding when it launches its next global bond, despite its loss of tax-exempt status. The bank said it may advance its funding programme to take advantage of the shortage of paper. The bank's next offering, a yen global offering totalling at least Y200bn is scheduled for mid-October. But the next dollar global offering, expected in 1993, may be brought forward. Although the effect will vary from one sector to another, bankers expect costs for the World Bank to rise, in the medium to long term, by around 20 basis points, to about 20 basis points under Libor. The EIB is likely to suffer a greater increase in funding costs, since it has targetted Italian investors with issues in smaller markets such as the matador bond market. It has frequently achieved funding costs of 75 to 80 basis points under Libor, now also set to rise to around 20 basis points under Libor. The EIB decided on Friday to pull its Pta10bn issue of floating-rate notes, launched on Wednesday, just hours ahead of the tax change announcement. Although the change did not take effect until Thursday, there was some uncertainty over whether it applied to the launch or the signing of the deal. Trades in the issue, which had been largely placed ahead of the announcement, were cancelled, according to lead manager Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The EIB is still considering whether to go ahead with a Y50bn deal scheduled for last Thursday. However, dealers said the planned terms of the issue would have to be changed to take account of the new tax regime. Meanwhile, spreads of Italy's Eurobonds barely tightened on the news. Dealers said concern about Italian credit and the excess supply of Italian paper stifled any rally in Italian paper. The sizeable repurchase agreement (repo) market is likely to suffer on several fronts. As well as the loss of tax-exempt status for supranational names, the new rules limit companies' ability to deduct the repo costs as a business expense. Also included in the package is a cut in withholding tax for Italian investors on foreign bonds from 30 per cent to 12.5 per cent, the same as for Italian government bonds. This is expected to encourage Italian institutions to diversify their investments in overseas markets. However, the new regulations also close a loophole used by some Italian institutions. They will no longer be able to avoid paying withholding tax by 'coupon-washing' - farming out bonds when the coupon is due to be paid. In future, taxation will be applied to accrued interest. Volume on Italy's new bond futures market, the Mercato Italiano Futures (MIF) reached 10,000 contracts on its first day of trading on Friday.</p>

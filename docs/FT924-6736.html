			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Heseltine heartens machine toolmakers MR Michael Heseltine brought some cheer to the hard-pressed machine tool industry last night with a rousing speech in support of government intervention to help manufacturing industry succeed. The trade and industry secretary told the Machine Tool Technologies Association dinner: 'I have no doubt about the determination of the government to create the climate in which the manufacturing sector can flourish.' He made only an oblique reference to the Matrix Churchill and exports to Iraq affair - he admitted he had attended the dinner with some trepidation. Mr Ron Bull, association president, received the biggest cheer of the night when he said: 'I welcome the fact that cases against our colleagues with regard to Iraq have been withdrawn.' Mr Keith Bailey, the head of BSA Tools and against whom charges were dropped last week, was sitting only three places away from Mr Heseltine on the top table. Mr Paul Henderson, former Matrix Churchill managing director and one of three men cleared when the Matrix Churchill trial collapsed, was also at the dinner. Mr Heseltine said the Autumn Statement had clearly indicated that the government had listened to industry. Mr Norman Lamont had set 'an agenda that was necessary for the depth of the recession'. His speech was broadly welcomed but he made few specific references to the industry's problems. The head of a leading machine tool manufacturer said: 'He must be living on a different planet to me.'

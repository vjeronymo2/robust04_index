			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (9): UK lags behind in take-up - Smart cards How many uses are there for a smart card? Almost as many as for the computer chips which sit inside these credit card-style devices. Potential uses range from keeping networks secure to helping inept cooks - just plug your smart card into the computer and it tells you what to do and even controls special kitchen scales. Despite the possibilities, smart cards have failed to live up to optimistic forecasts of suppliers and market analysts who said they would replace magnetic strip cards for bank customers and be in widespread use by the 1990s. One reason this has not happened is cost. Even when bought in bulk smart cards cost about Pounds 5 each instead of 40p for a magnetic card. The UK has lagged behind in the take-up of smart cards. In France, they are used for phone cards. In some Belgian banks, such as the state-owned ASLK, customers carry a personal smart card. This is swiped through the teller's terminal to check the customer's identity. Once this is established the customer can get the same service at any of the bank's 1,249 branches. However, worries about bank and charge-card security are generating new interest in smart cards around the world. The drawback of magnetic cards is that they can be forged using fairly low-cost equipment. There have been several well-publicised cases of counterfeit cards being used to steal money from cash machines. In Singapore, the government is considering basing the identity cards that all citizens must carry on smart cards. The technology could also be used for their banking transactions. Card forgery is a growing international problem and the advantage of smart cards is that they are harder to reproduce. They can also benefit the customer. For example, because smart cards contain a computer memory, they can store a list of transactions. A customer could keep a record of cash withdrawals without having a wallet bulging with ATM (Automated Teller Machine) receipts. This could be checked from time to time at the cash machine itself, or perhaps on a small card reader usable at home. It might even be possible to load information from the smart card into a home computer and use it to update a spreadsheet of domestic finances. However, there are other ways of making bank cards more secure. For example, some banks and building societies are embedding photographs into their charge cards. One of the newest plans for smart-card use also concerns security. They will be used in the forthcoming GSM digital mobile phone network to cut illegal use of mobile phones. Users will have to insert a card and tap in a personal identity number before they will be able to use their phones. Without the card, the phone will be useless and cards reported as stolen will be cancelled. This could make mobile phone theft a thing of the past. More than one card will work with a single GSM phone to enable separate business and social use. There is also talk of using smart cards to pay UK road tolls if the British government's idea of introducing selective road charging goes ahead. GEC Marconi is testing a system called Timezone in which an electronic unit is activated by a beacon as the motorist enters a toll area. The toll is then debited from a smart card. The system is to go on trial in Richmond upon Thames. GEC says it lets the traffic flow because cars do not have to stop as they pass the beacon. Another breed of smart cards which is particularly well-suited for transport use is the 'contactless' smart card. Demand for these is growing exponentially, according to Mr John Meikle, sales manager of GEC Card Technology. The cards work when they are brought within a few centimetres of a reader device, making them easy for drivers to use. Contactless cards are also useful for those who prefer to take public transport. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive is to issue contactless cards developed by GEC Card Technology of Walsall, England to its passengers. A similar, less ambitious scheme, using GEC cards, will begin testing with London Buses in Harrow in July. Another is planned for Oslo. To begin with, the Manchester scheme will involve 500,000 cards to be used on the city's 2,700 buses plus the 'Metrolink' and rail systems. The cards will act as prepaid tickets, usable many times. Each time the passenger makes a journey, the fare will be deducted from the card as he or she boards the bus. The cards will prevent delays caused by people fumbling for the right change because they can be read through wallets or purses. Customers will be able to get a print-out of their last 20 journeys and the transport executive will get better information about travel patterns. The transport executive is also talking to retail outlets about the possibility of renting out memory space on its smart cards. This would enable passengers to use the card for buying such items as petrol or their morning paper. The cards are rechargeable and can be topped up at selected post offices and newsagents. One of the biggest applications for smart cards is in network security. Northern Telecom's European research arm, BNR Europe, uses a metal-encased smart card from US company Security Dynamics to prevent computer hackers stealing valuable research information from its computers. Mr Andy Macpherson of BNR Europe says it has bought 40 of the company's SecureID cards and plans to order more. They provide a way of restricting access to the company's network without giving travelling executives a lot of extra gadgets (such as card readers) to carry. To access the computer from a hotel room, for example, an executive types in his ID and a password. If he or she gets this right, the computer will request a passcode number. This is a random number generated by the SecureID card and the numbers change every 60 seconds. Without the passcode number the user cannot log on. Mr Jim Geary, of Security Dynamics in the UK, says the cards are also used by several telecoms companies, such as American Telephone and Telegraph (itself a maker of smart cards) to prevent fraudulent access to their networks. For example, customers of BT's Global Network Services data network can opt to use SecureID to provide an extra level of security for their computer systems. Smart cards can also be used to improve the in-house security of computers. In its headquarters in Lisle, CTR Nord-Est - a regional clearing centre for the savings banks of northern France - has personal computers with built-in card readers. Without inserting the correct smart card, users cannot log on to its clearing system. The author is editor of the FT newsletter Business Computing Brief</p>

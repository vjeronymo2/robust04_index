Habibie here Monday.    "Taiwan has no experience in producing such type of  aeroplane, so that it would like to learn from Indonesia which  has 18 years of experience in non-military aircraft production,"  he told the press after meeting with Germany's junior minister,  Ursula Seiler Albring, of the German Foreign Ministry. [passage  omitted]    Habibie quoted Taiwan President Li Teng-hui as saying that  Taiwan would like to learn from Indonesia in manufacturing  non-military aeroplanes in line with the country's effort in  demilitarization. [passage omitted]    At the meeting, Habibie urged Taiwan to increase its  investment in Indonesia. Taiwan's direct investment in Indonesia  in 1993 was recorded only at U.S. $124.6 million or a sharp  decrease from U.S. $1.06 billion in 1991. "Taiwan pledged to  muster its enterpreneurs and business sector to invest in  Indonesia," he added. Habibie, who made clear that he met the  Taiwan president in his capacity as a scientist, said that he  learned much about issues on village development from President  Li Teng-hui who is an expert in agronomy and village development.    "Indonesia would also like to explore the possibility of  establishing cooperation with Taiwan in the development of  villages," he said, adding that Taiwan has suceeded in  industrializing 70 percent of all its villages. We can take, as  an example, Taiwan's experience that if the villages are  integrated into the industrialization process of the country,  the village community will also be able to transform themselves  into becoming industrial technocrats," he said.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vardan Petrosyan: "A Capricious Guarantor of </F> Legality"]    [Text] On 5 April, already for the third time in the last  year and a half, the people's court of Spandaryanskiy Rayon  attempted to start the trial of the ARF [Armenian Revolutionary  Federation] Dashnaktsutyun [Union] versus Levon Ter-Petrosyan;  however, the attempt failed in view of the failure of the  defendant--citizen of the Republic of Armenia Levon  Ter-Petrosyan--or his representatives to appear in court. Of  course, we are not at all inclined to assume that the president  of the republic was not informed by the appropriate authorities  that this was the third attempt to try the case. Such an  assumption would simply look naive. Something else causes  concern--L. Ter-Petrosyan, using his status as president, is  being guided by the psychology of a person who is free of any  kind of responsibility, and not by the logic of a leader who is  building a rule-of-law state. But the time of monarchs has  passed, and today's president may not be tomorrow's president.  What will defend him before the law then? The belated sympathy  of the people? Hardly... The citizens of some other country?  Possibly... However, there is still time before one of these  situations arises, and we should give some thought to realities.  And think out loud, inasmuch as what evokes our concern today  should without fail to arouse the concern of all our countrymen.  After all, under the slogans of building a rule-of-law state and  affirming the principles of democracy, violations of the law are  being committed before our very eyes, including also on the part  of the president of the republic, who, in accordance with the  presidential oath, should be the symbol and guarantor of  democracy and legality in our country. But perhaps our  conclusions are hasty?    "Perhaps, as a matter of fact, the president does not yet  want to 'squander his gifts on trifles,' perhaps it is still too  early to talk about the lack of arguments," citizens of the  republic and his former admirers and comrades in arms might  think, possibly desiring to preserve the last memory of their  trust in the president. Possibly, they have the right to cherish  their last hope, but for every more or less experienced person  this question was closed long ago, as if it had not existed at  all. Among these are people who are sufficiently informed of the  history of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun, and, consequently, also about  Dashnaktsutyun moral principles, and also those who in the last  five years have succeeded in sufficiently recognizing the value  of the words and deeds of the present authorities (headed by the  president). In particular, with the help of the latest mutual  exposures and self-exposures of the president's closest circle.    At the end of his television speech on 29 June 1992 the  president declared his readiness to present the pertinent facts  and justify the accusations raised in his speech against the  Dashnaktsutyun and its representatives, if... the "accused  party" calls for the legal answerability of the president. It  was already evident in those days that the real aim of the  president's speech was to influence the psychology of the  masses, to dispose them against Dashnaktsutyun and, by obtaining  the silent consent of a majority of the people, to make short  work of the party. The president, not having the legal grounds  to carry out his plan, intended to make use of the support of  the crowd.    The ARF Dashnaktsutyun accepted the president's challenge,  because not to accept it would mean, in fact, concurring with  the declared accusations, especially because it was already  apparent, as it is apparent now, that these accusations have no  factual basis and that what has happened is just an  anachronistic political "farce" undertaken for the purpose of  diverting the attention of the people and the opposition from  the main problems.    Any political party, or any political figure, especially the  president of the republic, should be well aware that their words  and deeds should be calculated not for one day and not even for  one year, if, of course, they do not intend to limit their  activity to such a short period. They must also not forget, of  course, that people can be deluded for a certain time, but no  one has been able to do this for a long time, and especially  continuously. And if anyone tries to be guided by a different  logic, this will sooner or later reveal itself, it will reveal  itself, and it will turn against them.    This very same logic in our country lies at the basis of  actions and resolutions on national questions; therefore it  should be no surprise that those guilty of political terrorism  are not being exposed, or that those who are exposed are not  punished. The behavior of the authorities on many questions has  boomeranged against them. For example, many are openly evading  service in the army. No matter how reprehensible this phenomenon  is; nevertheless, there are definite reasons for this, and we  will not be wrong if we say that first among them is the bad  example set for the population by the authorities, in particular  by the president himself. It is now obvious that the watershed  in the mutual relations of the people and the authorities  continues to deepen, which in these decisive days can lead only  to extremely dangerous consequences. These are questions which  every Armenian should ponder seriously, especially the president  of the republic.</p>

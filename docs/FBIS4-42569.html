			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali called on  special envoy Cyrus Vance to move as quickly as possible to a  new round of negotiations with Athens and Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. ATHENS NEWS AGENCY  reports from UN Headquarters in New York that Butrus-Ghali's  request to Vance is included in a two-page report the UN  secretary general submitted to the Security Council. In his  report, Butrus-Ghali underlines that Vance's mediating mission  is not affected by the European Court case of the Greek  countermeasures against Skopje. The UN secretary general notes  that he will submit a new report to the Security Council after  the 13 June meetings in New York between Vance and the  representatives of Greece and Skopje.    Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described  Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council on the issue of  Skopje as brief, typical, and descriptive. Venizelos said he  considers the secretary general's note that there is a need to  continue the Vance initiative for solution of the issue as  important.</p>

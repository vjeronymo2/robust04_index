			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [AP/YONHAP report from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Yesterday [7 June], Russian Government officials  said that sanctions against North Korea related to nuclear issue  should be used only as a final means when all possible  diplomatic efforts for the solution of the nuclear issue fail.    (Valenie Denikoskov), director of the Asia Affairs Bureau of  the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters that  Russia hopes to see the nuclear issue solved in a diplomatic and  political way. He stressed that Russia would agree to the  imposition of sanctions against North Korea only when all  efforts for the solution of the issue were exhausted.    Prior to this, in an interview with Russia's INTERFAX news  agency, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, also said that all  possible efforts, including holding international conferences,  should be made before the sanctions are imposed. He added that  after that, sanctions should be introduced in stages.    Such remarks by officials of the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs differ from those made by President Kim Yong-sam during  his visit to Moscow last week. President Kim once said that  Russian President Yeltsin had expressed support for the  imposition of sanctions against North Korea.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Poor second half at Graig Shipping A 'disappointing second half' for Graig Shipping, the Cardiff-based transport, mineral and investment company, meant that the Pounds 1.7m pre-tax profit of the first half was reduced to Pounds 1.22m for the year to March 31. Last time profits were Pounds 1.01m. The pre-tax result was struck on turnover of Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 37.8m) and while it included a Pounds 3.57m profit on sale of a ship there was also Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 641,000) written off investments. The directors said that the second half result reflected a considerable downturn in the dry cargo freight market, high costs of a survey and repairs to the Graiglas merchant vessel, and the strength of sterling against the dollar. All the group's subsidiaries and associates had produced disappointing results apart from North End Oil and restructurings and disposals would be considered, they said. Earnings per share worked through at 8.2p (7.2p) and the proposed final dividend is 2.5p (3p) for a 4.5p (4p) total.</p>

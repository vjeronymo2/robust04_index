			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late buying brings Paris little consolation THERE was a suggestion of US buying as the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index improved from its lows in the late afternoon, but this brought little consolation to the Paris bourse, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell another 2.1 per cent as hopes for an easing in interest rates diminished. Some analysts also pointed to the weakness in the dollar and arbitrage between the futures and cash markets. The CAC-40 index closed down 38.33 at 1,731.93 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Mr Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW in London, said the fact that there was no sign of an easing in monetary policy by the Bundesbank (its next meeting is scheduled for Friday), together with expectations of lower earnings this year was having a negative effect on sentiment. Financial stocks suffered, with Suez losing FFr11.90 to FFr239.50, and Paribas weakening FFr22.70 or 6.7 per cent to FFr313.30 ahead of first half results. Total saw selling following a presentation in London to close FFr7.10 weaker at FFr203.00. BRUSSELS hit trouble in steel shares. Clabecq, which announced heavy job cuts and salary reductions on Monday as part of a restructuring programme, crashed 19.3 per cent to BFr460 after trade was halted several times for limit-downs. The Bel-20 Index fell 1.90 to 1,107.20. Meanwhile the Luxembourg-based Arbed showed a severe drop in first half profits and fell 4.6 per cent to a 1992 low of BFr2,655, before plans to cooperate on long steel products with French steel giant Usinor-Sacilor allowed it to recover to BFr2,760, just BFr20, or 0.7 per cent down on the day. FRANKFURT saw some price volatility below international blue chips level as the DAX index rose 1.22 to 1,476.26. Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.2bn. Most carmakers recovered from early lows after being hit hard on Monday. BMW rose DM3 to DM470 after DM461.50, and Volkswagen DM3.50 to DM279.50 after DM275. However Porsche dropped DM20 to DM500 after saying that it will lay off 1,000 employees this year after 943 in 1991-92. Meanwhile, said Mr Deltlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt, dealers took the initiative in steels, which have been severely depressed recently. Mannesmann put on DM8.50 to DM215 and Klockner-Werke and Thyssen rose in sympathy, by DM4.50 to DM71 and DM4.50 to DM166.50 respectively. STOCKHOLM retreated for its third consecutive day, the Affarsvarlden index losing 18.3 to 654.1 in turnover of SKr446m. Svenska Handelsbanken, which reported a 80 per cent fall in interim earnings, saw its B shares lose SKr2 to SKr27. Skanska B rose SKr2.50 to SKr38.50 in spite of news that Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson, the chairman, had resigned following losses incurred in its currency trading department. MILAN was mixed, the Comit index closing 1.63 lower at 358.82. In banking, Ambroveneto rose 2.4 per cent, or L73 to L2,063 on media reports that Gemina was seeking to sell its 13.5 per cent stake. Gemina rose L19 to L799. AMSTERDAM improved slightly, encouraged by a cut in commercial bank interest rates. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 111.0. ZURICH recovered from intraday lows after late foreign buying, the SMI index closing 1.0 higher at 1,880.2, almost 20 points above the day's low. Dealers said that late trading became lively when US investors entered the market. ATHENS fell again on the scramble out of stocks and into high-yield government bills. The general share index dropped for the fifth consecutive trading day, this time by 27.93 or 4.1 per cent to 645.11, down 14.5 per cent since western Europe's currency crisis began to surface on September 7. OSLO rose on the takeover battle for the chocolate maker, Freia Marabou. The all-share index closed 3.99 higher at 327.61 in turnover of NKr156m. Freia B soared NKr130 to NKr430 after the board said that it was recommending a NKr450 bid from a Philip Morris unit although the rival bidder, Hershey Foods, said that it had not given up hope of buying Freia. COPENHAGEN saw Unidanmark A fall DKr4 to DKr123 as analysts said that the bank will lose around DKr2.5bn this year, writes Hilary Barnes. The all-share index closed 0.97 lower at 262.57.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     11.30am  12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close  1006.89  1007.09  1006.37  1006.90  1006.52  1005.73  1010.27  1009.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Day's High            Day's Low  1014.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Sep 28        Sep 25       Sep 24       Sep 23        Sep 22      1016.40       1035.63      1041.31      1043.77       1044.34  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

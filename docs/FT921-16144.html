			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / The Week Ahead: US employment data may lead Fed to cut rates again - Economics ATTENTION will focus this week on the extent to which the pound's position in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is affected by increased activity on foreign exchange markets following the holiday break. Analysts will also be looking for a run of employment data from the US and Germany. These will provide clues as to the degree to which both economies may be slowing down, possibly pushing the world economy as a whole nearer to recession. Sterling has been under pressure since just before Christmas, when all the other ERM countries raised interest rates, following Germany's lead. So far, the UK government has weathered the storm, as the pound has failed to slip close enough to its effective ERM floor to require either a politically damaging increase in borrowing rates, or official intervention to boost the currency. However, all this could change later today as trading in currencies picks up following the thin volumes of the past two weeks. Coming to the UK government's support might be signs of a weakening in the D-Mark, which would take the pressure off the pound and also other ERM currencies, including the French franc and the Italian lire, which have also showed signs of fragility. The employment data in the US in particular will be watched for any indications that the Federal Reserve might feel moved to cut US borrowing rates once more, after the 1 percentage point cut last month, in an effort to revive the flagging economy. The Bundesbank council meets in Frankfurt on Thursday. But in the absence of any shows of masochism by its members, the council is thought unlikely to opt for any further increase in German rates. Highlights of the week ahead, with forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: US, car sales in final week of December (6.2m); UK, final figures for money supply in November; Switzerland, December consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent on month, 5.6 per cent on year); Australia, current account deficit in November (ADollars 1.2bn, seasonally adjusted); Japan, foreign exchange reserves last month; Canada, building permits in October. Tomorrow: UK, 3rd quarter 1991 savings ratio and growth in real personal disposable incomes; Canada, leading economic indicators for October. Wednesday: US, November increase in consumer credit (Dollars 100m); Australia, November building permits. Thursday: US, December producer price index (flat month-on-month), index excluding food and energy (up 0.2 per cent), initial claims for week ending December 28 (447,500), money supply data for week ending December 30; Germany, regular Bundesbank council meeting, unemployment (up 2,500) and vacancies for west Germany in December, employment in west Germany in November (down 5,000), unemployment in east Germany in December, not seasonally adjusted (up 30,000); UK, November housing starts. Friday: US, December unemployment rate, non-farm payrolls (down 50,000), manufacturing payroll (down 32,500) hourly earnings, average workweek; Canada, December employment and jobless figures. During the week: Germany, November industrial and manufacturing production (down 0.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent on month) and manufacturing orders (flat), November visible trade surplus and current account deficit (DM2.5bn and DM1bn), October producer price index for east Germany.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Rooms with a budget price European business travellers who hope their employers will allow them to return to luxury hotels now the recession is over should prepare themselves for some depressing news. All over Europe, hotel companies are convinced they are about to see a rapid increase in demand for the sort of budget hotel that has a Happy Eater restaurant attached to it. Forte, which owns the Happy Eater chain, is rapidly expanding its budget hotel business. It is building 22 new Travelodge hotels in the UK this year, bringing the total to 114. In 1990, Forte had only 50 Travelodge hotels in the UK. A room in a Travelodge costs Pounds 33.50 a night. Forte is due to open two new Travelodges in Spain over the next three months. It already has two in Ireland and four in France. Holiday Inn is working with franchisees and joint-venture partners to build 60 Holiday Inn Express hotels in Europe over five years. The hotels will be in Germany, Poland and the UK and will charge Pounds 39 a night, including continental breakfast. France has the most advanced budget hotel industry in Europe, but Forte and Holiday Inn believe the rest of the continent is about to catch up. John Miller, sales and marketing director of Forte's roadside restaurants business, says about 15 per cent of hotel rooms in France are in the budget category. In the US, the figure is 25 per cent. In the UK, it is only 3 per cent. France's budget hotels cover a wide range. At the Formule 1 chain, run by Accor, guests share bathrooms and pay FFr130 (Pounds 15.50) a night. Miller does not think UK travellers would put up with shared bathrooms. Mr Jean-Claude Luttmann, co-chairman of Formule 1, thinks he might be right. Accor has opened three Formule 1 hotels in the UK, but they have not been a success. The company has done better in France, where it has nearly 300. Accor's 400 Ibis hotels, which have private bathrooms and charge FFr260 (Pounds 31) a night, are probably closer competitors to Travelodge and Holiday Inn Express. Forte's Travelodge rooms are built in a factory and then assembled on site. They have en-suite bathrooms, but no telephones, although the company is considering installing them. Holiday Inn Express hotels will have telephones. While the hotel chains are convinced demand for these products is rising, they concede that some business travellers will escape them and stay somewhere more expensive. Miller believes junior staff who were not allowed to travel during the recession will now stay in Travelodges. Tim Clarke, managing director of Holiday Inn in Europe, says the Express hotels will be for travellers arriving late.</p>

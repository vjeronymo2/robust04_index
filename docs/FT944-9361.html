			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Prosaic truth disappoints conspiracy theorists: The reasons for Sarah Hogg's impending departure from John Major's inner circle The impending departure of Mrs Sarah Hogg from 10 Downing Street leaves vacant one of the most important and gruelling jobs in Whitehall. Mr John Major's choice as her successor to head the prime minister's policy unit will do much to set the strategic direction for his government in the approach to the next general election. Conspiracy theorists were quick to see all kinds of dark motives in the announcement that Mrs Hogg plans to step down in the new year. Among the prime minister's enemies on the Tory right it will be claimed as a victory for their long-running campaign to force him to sack her. Mrs Hogg, a former economics journalist, was after all one of the strongest supporters of British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The truth is more prosaic. Mrs Hogg, brought in by Mr Major just after he entered Number 10, decided some months ago that she needed a change. She told Mr Major then that she did not want to stay for the next election. To allow her successor time to work into the job meant leaving at the turn of this year. Her decision was based on the simple judgment that four years is enough in a job which demands 16 hours a day and seven days a week. It is no accident that none of three predecessors since 1979 has stayed for more than one election. Once it was decided that Mr Jonathan Hill, the prime minister's political secretary, was to be replaced, Downing Street decided to announce Mrs Hogg's departure now rather than let the news seep out. Her tenure has coincided with the roughest period for any prime minister since the late 1960s. As one of his closest confidantes she has taken her share of the blame for the string of disasters. The policy unit, an odd mixture of political appointees and career civil servants, acts as the prime minister's principal alternative source of advice. It is also his agent in ensuring his policies are followed by the departmental baronies which hold the real levers of power across Whitehall. Britain's system of government is more fragmented than generally appreciated. Mr Major alone around the cabinet table does not have a large department to do his bidding. He can hire and fire ministers. Ensuring that his priorities are theirs is more difficult. Mrs Hogg saw her role as providing Mr Major with strategic thinking on the main policy issues and with ensuring that his views were well represented in Whitehall. She was particularly influential in the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax, in shaping the government's position on the Gatt world trade talks, in education policy and in the development of the Citizen's Charter. She has been a bridge from Number 10 to the Treasury in shaping post-ERM economic policy, particularly the private-finance initiative. The 48-year-old Mrs Hogg has not been without her critics beyond the Tory right. Some accused her of 'meddling' in the detail of policy rather than concentrating on strategic direction. Others blamed her for the debacle over the ill-fated 'back-to-basics' campaign. But those brickbats go with the job. In choosing her successor, however, the prime minister will be able to complete a radical shake-up of his inner circle designed to give a fresh political edge to policymaking. It is understood that he has a candidate in mind but no firm decision has yet been taken. Contrary to recent rumours Mr Major is working well with Mr David Hunt, the senior minister charged with knocking heads together on key cabinet committees. Mr Christopher Meyer, his press secretary, has proved adept in avoiding presentational banana-skins. Mr Howell James, who will replace Mr Hill as political secretary, has a reputation for shrewdness. Mrs Hogg, meanwhile, has yet to give much thought to her next job. But enemies as well as friends acknowledged yesterday that she will not find it difficult to secure a high-profile post in the private sector.</p>

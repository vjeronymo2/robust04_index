			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: THE MYRIAD COOKING OILS DIFFER IN FLAVOR AND QUALITY  </P> <P> Question: Please tell me about the many different types of cooking oils I see  in the markets. Are some more healthy? Can you buy one type of oil and use it  for everything? What about olive oil -- is it better and how is it best used?  </P> <P> Answer: There are indeed numerous cooking oils available, expressed from seeds,  legumes, plants, fruits and nuts. Each differs in both flavor and cooking  qualities, according to "Cooking A to Z" (Ortho Books: $32.95, 1988), edited by  Jane Horn.  </P> <P> The following information is excerpted from the book's listing of common edible  oils:  </P> <P> Almond Oil: toasty almond flavor; best used in salads and cold dishes; flavor  destroyed by heat  </P> <P> Avocado Oil: mild, buttery, delicate flavor; good for salad dressings and baked  goods; may be used for sauteing, stir-frying and deep-frying  </P> <P> Coconut Oil: coconut flavor; may be used for frying  </P> <P> Corn Oil: bland flavor; excellent for frying  </P> <P> Hazelnut Oil: strong toasted hazelnut flavor; use in combination with other oil  for cold dishes; flavor destroyed by heat  </P> <P> Olive Oil: available in several different grades; in increasing level of  acidity, olive oil is classified as extra-virgin, superfine, fine and virgin or  pure; excellent for salad dressings, marinades, sauces and sauteing; not suited  for deep-frying  </P> <P> Peanut Oil: subtle peanut flavor; use for salad dressings, sauteing and  stir-frying  </P> <P> Safflower Oil: flavorless; excellent for deep-frying; less suitable for salad  dressings  </P> <P> Sesame Oil: toasty, nutty flavor; Chinese is stronger in flavor than Japanese;  heat alters flavor  </P> <P> Soybean Oil: bland flavor; excellent for salad dressings; may be used for  frying  </P> <P> Walnut Oil: rich, nutty flavor; use sparingly; heat destroys flavor  </P> <P> Oils are composed of three types of fatty acids: saturated, monounsaturated and  polyunsaturated. Oils with more than one-third saturated fatty acids are termed  saturated; those with less are unsaturated. Unsaturated oils are further  classified into polyunsaturated and monounsaturated.  </P> <P> Oils low in saturated fat are considered more healthful. The American Heart  Assn. and the American Cancer Society recommend no more than 30% of the  calories Americans consume come from fat. Of that 30%, less than 10% should be  saturated fat, with the remaining divided equally between polyunsaturated fat  and monounsaturated fat.  </P> <P> Coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil are all saturated fats. Safflower,  sunflower, corn, soybean and cottonseed oils are polyunsaturated. Olive, peanut  and canola oils are monounsaturated.  </P> <P> Q: I tried your recipe for Rancho Bernardo Inn's walnut bread and it came out  very well except for a burnt top and really dark crust all around and on the  bottom. My loaf pans are glass, 8 1/2x4 1/2-inches. I baked the bread on the  middle rack in my electric oven, set at 350 degrees. Do you have any  suggestions?  </P> <P> A: When baking in glass reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees.  </P></p>

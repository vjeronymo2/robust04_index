			<p>BFN     [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Peace may arrive in Angola  soon. In exclusive statements to RDP1, Angolan Ambassador Rui  Mingas assures that an agreement in Lusaka is very very near.  This is a confirmation we had to try hard to extract from Rui  Mingas:    [Begin recording] [Mingas] I can confirm it. Yes, it is very  close, but what remains for...    [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] An understanding  between the two sides?    [Mingas] I am not sure whether it is an understanding  between  the sides, or whether it a question of us obtaining concrete  evidence that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] will really accept what is being proposed.    [Correspondent] It has been said in the past few days that  an  agreement in Lusaka is imminent. Can you confirm that  information? Have you received reports of that happening?    [Mingas] Yes. I am convinced that the problem will be  overcome by the end of June.    [Correspondent] Can you give us any details of the  agreement?    [Mingas] No, no, I cannot give you any details, but I can  tell you that as far as we are concerned we feel very  optimistic. [end recording]    [Announcer] He did not reveal any secrets but it has all  been  said in Rui Mingas' silence.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPIZZI TOPS $100,000 IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS  </P> <P> Political backers for newly appointed Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced  Tuesday that he has raised more than $100,000 in his campaign to retain his  post in the June 5 election.  </P> <P> But news of the district attorney's campaign fund brought a sharp rebuke from  one of his opponents, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, who said he hopes to  rely on volunteers instead of large money contributions.  </P> <P> "Because when you take a lot of money from individuals, you have got to expect  that they are going to ask for a favor somewhere along the line," Avdeef said.  </P> <P> Capizzi's campaign finance report, filed Tuesday, listed $68,760 in  contributions by Dec. 31, 1989. But a $1,000-a-couple Capizzi dinner at the  Irvine Hilton on Tuesday night, with former state Supreme Court Justice John  Arguelles scheduled as the main guest, easily put Capizzi over the $100,000  mark.  </P> <P> Avdeef said his own contributions by the end of 1989 amounted to about $8,000.  </P> <P> "I would like a volunteer on every street corner," Avdeef said. "If you've got  people who are out there working for you with their heart, you don't have that  expectation . . . of a pay back."  </P> <P> But despite such criticism, Capizzi's political backers said they believe it  shows Capizzi as the only candidate with broad-based support.  </P> <P> "The response we have had has been great," said Capizzi campaign chairman Bill  Wenke. In a news release, issued by Capizzi political consultant Eileen  Padberg, Capizzi said, "It's going to be a significant week for me," primarily  because of Arguelles' appearance on his behalf.  </P> <P> Capizzi's campaign report showed his largest contributor as the Lincoln Club,  the Republican high-finance group, which gave him $5,000. His next largest  donation was $2,000 from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. The bulk of his  contributions were $1,000 or less from members of the defense bar who have  known Capizzi for years. Only four prosecutors within the office were listed as  donors.  </P> <P> Avdeef countered that while his own campaign "may not have a lot of tangibles,  we have a lot of intangibles in this race, a lot of support from various  segments of the community."  </P> <P> Avdeef called a press conference Tuesday to stir up interest in his lawsuit  challenging the Board of Supervisors' authority to appoint Capizzi on Jan. 2 to  replace Cecil Hicks, who accepted a judgeship.  </P> <P> The suit will be heard on Friday morning by Superior Court Judge Eileen C.  Moore. But whatever Moore decides, the issue will likely be carried to the 4th  District Court of Appeal before it is decided.  </P> <P> Avdeef has been joined in the lawsuit by Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G.  Enright. Should the Avdeef lawsuit prevail, Enright would be in line to take  over duties as acting district attorney until the election.  </P> <P> However, few lawyers at the County Courthouse give Avdeef's lawsuit much chance  of winning, since county supervisors statewide have been making similar  appointments for years. The county counsel's office has informed the  supervisors that Avdeef and his lawyers have incorrectly interpreted the  applicable government code section. Avdeef himself admits that there is no  precedent for what he is asking the court to do.  </P> <P> The supervisors appointed Capizzi to fill out Hicks' term, which runs to the  end of 1990. The district attorney elected in June would take over Jan. 1,  1991.  </P> <P> Enright so far has not said whether he will run. The other candidate, Assistant  Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, announced this week that his campaign will be run  by well-known Santa Ana defense attorney Keith C. Monroe.  </P></p>

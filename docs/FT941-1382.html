			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Property: Developers risk dabbling - A look at reasons for the recent increase in speculative development activity The return of speculative developers to the property market is possibly the most remarkable factor in the turnaround in sentiment towards property over the past year. Their emergence, albeit in small numbers, is happening at a faster pace than seemed possible a year ago, when the market was preoccupied by falling rents, a glut of surplus properties and a dearth of development finance. But how robust are the prospects for this development cycle? Will it be enfeebled by weak tenant demand and the reluctance of the banks to lend to developers? Or is there a possibility that the upturn in development activity will be sufficiently marked to depress the recovery in rental values on which it is founded? The foundations for recovery are beginning to fall into place. Sites are readily available, often with planning permission. Construction costs are low, financing costs have fallen and funds are available from a small but growing number of property companies and investment institutions. And although tenant demand is still patchy, rents are in many cases stabilising. It is no wonder that developers are dusting off the planning permissions that they shelved during the downturn. There is a strong incentive to be the first into the market - limited competition on the completion of property. 'We are going to be there with the first wave of development and then let others fight it out,' says Mr Michael Slade of Helical Bar, a property company which has a Pounds 100m programme of speculative developments in Cardiff, Theale, Edinburgh, Leeds, Guildford and Cambridge. Helical Bar is not alone. Argent, a property company, is starting a speculative office scheme in June at Brindley Place in Birmingham, which is a 17-acre site with consent for more than 1m sq ft of office, retail and leisure space. In central London, Great Portland Estates has started work on a 100,000 sq ft office scheme in Great Portland Street. British Land has started work on 180,000 sq ft in the City, and AMP and Arcona are refurbishing in Pall Mall. In the City, Lord Palumbo has teamed up with Dieter Bock to develop Number One, Poultry, situated by the Bank of England. In the retail sector, the development of retail warehouses is proceeding at a cracking pace. Demand is strong for warehouses and because they are traditionally pre-let to tenants the supply of available space is restricted. About 4m sq ft of floorspace is currently under construction. In the shopping centre market, Prudential, the insurance company, and JT Baylis, a Bristol developer, are due to begin work later this year on the 650,000 sq ft regional shopping centre at Cribbs Causeway, near Bristol. Imry Group plans to begin work on the early phases of its Esplanade shopping centre in Southampton later this year. Admittedly, these are the exceptions, rather than the rule. And the increase in development activity is taking place from an extremely low base. In the office market, for example, completions in 1993 totalled 4.2m sq ft, less than half of the 9.1m sq ft completed in 1992. According to Hillier Parker, shopping centre development has dipped to its lowest level since 1965. The amount of floorspace which is at present under construction fell from 19.32m sq ft to 1.89m sq ft between March 1990 and December 1993. Caution about the strength of economic recovery is holding back many would-be developers unless they can secure a letting from a tenant before construction begins. Mr Stuart Robinson of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, says: 'There is still a question mark over tenant demand in many areas. Rents have not got to the point where people are confident about development.' The difficulty of raising bank finance also accounts for developers putting projects on hold. Almost all the banks involved in financing the large upturn in construction activities in the late 1980s are now absent from the market. 'It is still almost impossible to fund a speculative transaction with a bank,' says Mr Slade. That said, other sources of funds have increasingly become available. Large property companies are flush with funds after a spate of rights issues. The institutions, which have increased their allocations to the property sector, have found it difficult to secure sufficiently well built properties which meet their specific needs. Most institutions prefer to limit their risk by funding pre-let developments. But there are about 20 institutions prepared to discuss the funding of speculative developments. In such cases, however, the risk of construction cost overruns and guaranteeing the rent would be typically left to the developer. The question remains whether developers are right to risk embarking on development while tenant demand is so low, economic prospects are uncertain and there still exists a surplus of available buildings. The case for starting on development before tenant demand is evident is based on the length of the gestation period for building projects, that is planning and design to constructing, fitting out, completion and occupation, which typically takes three years. 'You have to be there in advance of tenant demand,' says Mr Slade. At present, development activity is sufficiently low to limit the degree of oversupply building up again. But if the market continues to heat up, there is some concern that too many buildings may come on stream. 'There is a danger that institutions which are anxious to get funds into the property market will create overcapacity and develop rather sooner than we would like,' says Mr David Hunter of Scottish Amicable. The institutions have reason to be cautious: they have made mistakes before. At the end of the 1970s, they financed a surge in construction which came on stream as the economy plunged into recession, setting back real rental growth for another five years.</p>

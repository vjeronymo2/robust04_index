			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc traders look on the black side - Week in the markets EUROPEAN ZINC producers' announcements this week of planned production cuts appeared to emphasise the present malaise of the oversupplied market, rather than encourage the view that a better balanced was on the way. As London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks of the metal rose another 10,350 tonnes to a record 688,025 tonnes the exchange's three months delivery price surrendered Dollars 4 of last week's tentative recovery to close yesterday at Dollars 945.50 a tonne, Dollars 12 above the recent six-year low. A hesitant rally was prompted on Monday by news that desperate European producers were preparing for submission to the European Commission a proposal for a co-ordinated industry scheme under which one or two producers would close smelting capacity permanently and be compensated for closure costs by the rest of the industry. But the price gains were wiped out the next day. There was a similarly muted reaction to Thursday's statement by Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive of Union Miniere of Belgium, that his company wanted to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc producer. At a meeting in London with mining analysts he said a planned expansion at the Balen refinery in Belgium had been cancelled and outlined plans to sell over the next five years the company's refineries and mines in the US and Sweden. Late last year UM permanently closed its 100,000-tonnes-a-year refinery at Overpelt in Belgium. Nickel traders were also inclined to take a jaundiced view of apparently bullish news. Until yesterday, a run of LME stocks falls was being dismissed as a temporary phenomenon resulting from bureaucratic delays to Russian shipments, and a fresh surge of arrivals was predicted. So prices remained under pressure and the LME's three months position sank early yesterday to a fresh seven-month low of Dollars 5,340 a tonne. The announcement yesterday, however, of a further 1,842-tonne stocks fall, taking to 9,792 tonnes the total drawdown since the June 8 record of 96,312 tonnes, seemed to bring a change of heart. As some of them became sceptical about the long-awaited flood of Russian material traders marked nickel prices higher and the three months position closed at Dollars 5,425 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on the day but still Dollars 200 down on the week. The tin market's technical rally from recent 20-year lows ran out of steam this week and in late trading yesterday the Dollars 5,000-a-tonne support level for the LME three months contract was coming under increasing pressure. It closed at Dollars 5,027.50 a tonne, down Dollars 212.50 on the week. The market is weighed down at present by expectations of increased deliveries to an already oversupplied market as producers' resolve on export restraint evaporates. The copper market remained trapped in its narrow dollar range, though the weakness of the pound created the illusion of firmness in the LME's sterling denominated market, where the three months position closed yesterday at Pounds 1,284.75 a tonne, up Pounds 38.50 on the week. The market failed in repeated attempts to break decisively through the Dollars 1,900 barrier, but concern about US labour contract expiries at the end of the month ensured that the Dollars 1,850-a-tonne price floor also remained intact. LME copper stocks ended a long run of rises yesterday, but the 750-tonne fall was less than many traders had been expecting and did little to encourage buying. The only genuinely firm LME contract was aluminium, which benefited from constructive chart patterns and persistent rumours that a large smelter closure was to be announced soon. An early attempt push the three months price through resistance at Dollars 1,215 a tonne was unsuccessful, but after a quick shake-out in mid-week that barrier fell and the price yesterday touched a 3 1/2 -month high before closing at Dollars 1,229.50 a tonne, up Dollars 24.75 on the week. At the London bullion market the gold price, depressed by the dollar's strength and producer selling in Canada, Australia and South Africa, where the present price level is relatively attractive in local currency terms, slid in the early part of the week towards the bottom of its recent trading range. But having failed to drive the price below Dollars 366 a troy ounce speculative sellers switched tactics on Thursday and became enthusiastic buyers. The price gained Dollars 5.80 on that day and another Dollars 2.65 yesterday to end Dollars 4.20 up on balance at Dollars 376.45 an ounce. One dealer had told the Reuter news agency earlier in the day that a close above Dollars 375 an ounce in New York could signal an assault on the Dollars 380 barrier next week. At the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox), which this week announced that it was to revert to its former name of the London Commodity Exchange, the cocoa market put in a much more active performance - Tuesday's volume was a record 46,458 lots of 10 tonnes. A continuation of last week's technical rally lifted the September futures price to a three-month high of Pounds 741 a tonne before a technical correction trimmed it to Pounds 727 at yesterday's close, up Pounds 12 on the week. Dealers thought the upsurge in activity might foreshadow a deliberate supply squeeze. 'September is the traditional month for squeezes and that is exactly what we have here. And if you want to go for September, then you have to go all out for July,' one trader told Reuter.  -------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------- tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium     +5,675 to 1,883,000 Copper          -750 to   455,375 Lead            -200 to   258,725 Nickel        -1,842 to    86,520 Zinc          +7,400 to   688,025 Tin             +385 to    20,490  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Bentsen warns China over its MFN status Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday China had not made sufficient progress on human rights to warrant US renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading status, but he indicated that Washington was nevertheless anxious to forge closer economic ties with Beijing. Mr Bentsen is the most senior representative of the Clinton administration to visit China. His presence in the Chinese capital is clearly designed to be part of a new US thrust to improve working relations dogged by bickering over human rights and arms disputes. 'It's really time to re-engage China on economic issues. We need to help China reform. We need a forum to address our bilateral concerns,' Mr Bentsen told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Li Peng. Describing the human rights issue as 'basic to our relationship,' the US official said 'there has been progress, but so far it hasn't gone far enough'. President Clinton is obliged by mid-year to rule on whether China has made sufficient improvements in its human rights behaviour to justify MFN renewal. Mr Clinton said last year that China would need to make 'significant progress'. Mr Bentsen's visit to China follows a review of US-China policy and comes after the meeting last November between Mr Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum summit. The Treasury secretary, who will co-chair a bilateral economic forum tomorrow, said that among his objectives in Beijing was to persuade China of the need to continue opening its markets, and also to demonstrate support for economic reforms. The two countries are reviving a joint economic committee which last met in 1987 to pursue issues of mutual concern. Washington has been pressing the Chinese on questions such as abuse of intellectual property rights, especially the pirating of compact discs. Mr Bentsen is also likely to express concern about a widening trade gap. Chinese exports to the US last year exceeded imports by Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.7bn), prompting protests from Congress leaders. China's trade surplus with the US is exceeded only by Japan's. Mr Bentsen's visit came just two days after the US and China signed a three-year textile agreement, averting a serious trade dispute. The US threatened to slash Chinese textile imports, but in the end agreed to an effective freeze at present levels.</p>

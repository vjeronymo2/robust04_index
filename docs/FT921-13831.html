			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Talks on Ulster hindered by poll fever THE BRITISH and Irish governments agreed yesterday that there is little hope of reviving the stalled all-party talks on Northern Ireland before the UK general election. They reached that conclusion about the talks, broken off in July, in spite of a recent flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at persuading the parties back to the negotiating table. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, met Mr Gerry Collins, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin yesterday. Mr Brooke said later that prospects of an election 'have highlighted the tensions and are creating their own momentum'. He added: 'We have faced difficulties in the past weeks, and we continue to confront them.' Unionist leaders in Northern Ireland have made it clear that they are not prepared to renew the talks unconditionally if the Labour party wins the election. They say they will first have to 'assess' Labour's position. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, argues that this is unacceptable and amounts to a 'precondition'. He said in a radio interview yesterday that constructive talks could not be carried out on such a basis. An additional concern of the SDLP, echoed in Dublin, is that a close election result may give the Unionists an opportunity to hold the balance of power, resulting in a hardening of positions on both sides of the sectarian divide. After meeting Mr Brooke, Mr Collins gave the strongest hint yet that hopes for an early renewal of talks were lost. He said: 'Once the general elections are out of the way, we must once again make a determined effort to move ahead.' Mr Brooke later told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce: 'The uncertainties of the outcome of the election . . . and the need for a process of this kind to have a reasonable chance of continuing to a conclusion provide understandable obstacles to progress now.' Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, was yesterday urged by Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Irish Labour Party, to reiterate Opposition policy on moves towards Irish unification.</p>

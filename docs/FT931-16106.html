			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report This week's slide in ALUMINIUM prices on the London Metal Exchange continued yesterday, with the three months delivery contract falling another Dollars 14.50 to Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne. Dealers said US selling had prompted a renewed test of support at Dollars 1,215 a tonne. NICKEL prices also added to Wednesday's decline as profit-taking following recent strength continued to undermine the market. The three months price closed at Dollars 6,247.50 a tonne, down Dollars 50 on the day, but steadied a little in after hours trading. COPPER prices reached three-month dollar highs early in the day but ended only marginally higher following hedge selling and profit-taking in the afternoon. The three months price reached Dollars 2,392 a tonne before ending at Dollars 2,355 a tonne, up Dollars 5. Dealers said expectations of further declines in LME warehouse stocks and continued Chinese buying helped to hold the market above Dollars 2,500. COFFEE prices rallied following their recent slump, aided by profit-taking on short positions. The London robusta March futures prices closed Dollars 14 higher at Dollars 945 a tonne.

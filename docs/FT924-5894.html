			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Currency worries dominate after ERM realignment CURRENCY worries dominated the European government bond markets yesterday in the wake of the weekend realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism. Investors flocked to the D-Mark block bond markets in the hope that the Bundesbank would allow an easing in German interest rates to relieve strains within the ERM. Meanwhile, some of the weaker European currencies - including the Irish punt, Danish krone and the French franc - came under pressure in the foreign exchange markets. Interest rates in Ireland, Spain and Norway were forced up and the high-yielding government bond markets fell sharply. GERMAN government bonds surged at the opening on hopes that the Bundesbank would lower interest rates to ease the tensions within the ERM. Economists predict that the weaker European currencies will continue to come under speculative pressure - despite the weekend 6 per cent devaluation of the peseta and escudo - unless the German central bank lowers domestic interest rates. Dealers said investors focused on the German market because the lira devaluation in September was accompanied by cuts in key German interest rates. 'The EMS realignment was seen as good news for bunds, but as it became apparent that a rate cut was not imminent, there was a sell-off in the bund market,' said one dealer, and the market closed slightly lower on the day. The Liffe bund contract traded around 91.50 by late afternoon, having been at a high of 91.70. Traders said the market would focus on the Bundesbank's repo operations this week, watching for an easing in interest rates. MOST of the high-yielding European government bond markets fell yesterday following the ERM realignment, reflecting concern that currency strains are likely to persist without a cut in German rates. Among the Scandinavian markets, Denmark showed a sharp drop in prices yesterday, losing over a point as investors switched into German bunds. Economists believe that Denmark will be able to resist a devaluation, having raised interest rates on Friday to defend the currency. Sweden, which severed the link between its currency and the Ecu last Thursday and allowed the krona to float freely, saw some profit-taking yesterday. The decision to float the krona prompted a rally in the Swedish government bond market at the end of last week and the yield curve switched from negative to positive. Dealers said investors took some profits yesterday, and the yield on the bond due 2003 rose to 10.41 per cent at the end of trading, against 10.29 per cent at Friday's close. Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, yesterday ruled out rapid cuts in interest rates because of the high inflation risk. SPAIN, which devalued by 6 per cent at the weekend and raised interest rates by 75 basis points yesterday, witnessed a one and a half percentage point drop in bond prices as the market digested the news. The Bank of Spain raised its key money rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per cent and the 10-year 10.30 per cent bond fell from Friday's close of 88.45 to 87.05. Dealers said the market would be focusing on this week's auction of Spanish government debt. The weekend decision to lift capital controls - which came into force during the September currency crisis - is seen as a means of attempting to encourage foreign buyers to return to the bond market. The government has a total financing need of Pta1,900bn for 1992, of which it has raised an estimated 23 per cent with the sale of treasury bills and bonds, according to one dealer. FRENCH government bonds tumbled on fears that the French franc could come under pressure again in the foreign exchange markets. Yields on short dated bonds showed a bigger increase than at the long end with the 8.5 per cent bond due 1994 closing at 8.27 per cent against 7.99 per cent at the opening. IRISH gilts closed lower, reflecting the sharp rise in interest rates and concern over whether the Irish punt may be devalued. The Central Bank of Ireland suspended its short-term facility rate of 13.75 per cent and replaced it with overnight advances initially at 30 per cent and one-week funds at 25 per cent. The 9 per cent gilt due 2001 fell from 95.25 at Friday's close to 93.50 late yesterday. UK government bonds closed firmer as the gilt market remained relatively immune to the turbulence within the European markets due to the fact that sterling is outside the ERM. Long-dated gilts ended firmer, but dealers warned that today's announcement of the details of the Bank of England's gilt auction is likely to put pressure on the market. The Bank will announce the amount and stock details today. US Treasury prices eased slightly at the long end but short-dated maturities rallied from weakness after demand for the afternoon two-year auction was stronger than expected. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government was  1/8 lower at 100 31/32 , yielding 7.438 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 9/32 , to carry a yield of 4.624 per cent. Prices opened lower, partly in the wake of weaker overseas bond markets and following newspaper reports suggesting that the Federal Reserve monetary policy is on hold for the immediate future. Although the market has been coming to terms with the idea that interest rates are unlikely to be cut again soon, yesterday's reports, emanating from senior sources close to the Fed, were regarded as final confirmation that the monetary authorities are happy to leave policy unchanged as the economic recovery gradually gathers pace.</p>

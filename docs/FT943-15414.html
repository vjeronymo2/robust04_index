			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Bitter sweets and soft smacks: Summiteers must use inducements and threats to solve the Bosnian conflict As the Bosnian army was battling defectors to a pro-Serb Moslem unit in the northwest of the state yesterday, the future of the territory was on the agenda for discussion in the balmy air of Naples. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, along with the western leaders at the G7 summit, will be shouldering a grave responsibility. It is possible that history will hold them guilty of fumbling a final chance to prevent conflict in the Balkans from escalating out of all control. Five of the eight countries - the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - are co-designers of a detailed plan for an effective partition of Bosnia. All subscribe to the idea that the warring parties should be pressed strongly, by threats and inducements, to accept the proposals to them in Geneva this week. The other participants in the summit - Canada, Italy and Japan - will scarcely demur. Yet the fact remains that the international consensus over what to do if the warring Serbs and Moslems reject the plan is only wafer thin; and it may prove too thin to convince the Bosnian parties. They have two weeks to consider their response. Even the plan's creators would agree that it is not a perfect arrangement. Perhaps the best that can be said is that it is less imperfect, and less doomed to failure, than any other proposal put forward so far. While preserving Bosnia's notional existence, the plan would allocate 51 per cent of its territory to the new Moslem-Croat federation, and the remainder to the Bosnian Serbs, who now control about 70 per cent. For Bosnia's mainly Moslem leadership, the worse thing about this is that it leaves in Serb hands a string of towns in central Bosnia, such as Prijedor, where Moslem communities have been destroyed by ethnic cleansing. For the Serbs, the plan's biggest drawback is that the corridor which now links Serb-controlled land in Bosnia with the Serbian republic to the east would be narrowed to a width of a few miles. The Serb side would have to surrender the main towns of the region on either side of the corridor, such as Brcko, making it easier for its enemies to sever the connection with the ethnic motherland. Even if Serb political leaders agree to this concession, it is hard to imagine Serb officers pulling out of towns they have conquered and cleansed. The US has stated loudly, and Russia much more reluctantly, that if Bosnia's Moslem leaders accept the map and the Serbs reject it, the more co-operative party will probably be rewarded with a lifting of the international arms embargo. If the Serbs accept the proposal, they can expect a lifting of economic sanctions. Both sides have been told that co-operation will earn them reconstruction aid - while continued recalcitrance will lead to tougher enforcement of punitive measures. Bosnia's President Alija Izbetgovic has already moved to seize the moral high ground by saying that his side will accept the plan, but he does not have any illusions that it will be implemented. 'I emphasise that we will be saying yes, since the Serbs will be rejecting it,' he has said. If the eight leaders conferring in Naples were dictators, with no fear of domestic opinion, they would probably stand a better chance of forcing their ideas down the throats of all the combatants. But, ironically, the fact that their countries are democracies makes it harder for them to apply a 'carrot and stick' approach in a sustained and convincing way. In the US legislature, there is massive pressure for an unconditional renunciation of the arms embargo against the Bosnian government, regardless of its attitude to the peace plan. In a recent Senate vote, supporters of a unilateral lifting of the embargo fell one vote short of victory. Meanwhile, in Russia, there is strong support for an unconditional lifting of sanctions against Serbia - which are widely breached and have failed to prevent economic revival. Many Russians feel that their country's initial adherence to punitive measures against their traditional Serb allies was at best a temporary expedient, reflecting a period of weakness in Russian diplomacy. If the US Congress forces the administration into unconditional support for the Bosnian government, then Russia's support for its Serb protege will become more open too, and the Bosnian war could become an old-fashioned US-Russian conflict by proxy. The UN's humanitarian effort, which depends on a minimum of consent from all sides, would become untenable. The UK and France have stressed that they would pull out their troops, which form the backbone of the peacekeeping force, if there was a full-scale conflict. Already, several nightmare scenarios look plausible. If Bosnian government forces manage to wrest from the Serbs the strategic corridor which links northern Bosnia with the Serbian republic, that would have the side-effect of severing communications between Belgrade and the Serb-controlled region of Croatia. At that point, the Croatian government could be tempted to seize back the one-third of its territory which is under Serb control. A full-scale Serb-Croat war could ensue. Equally real is the prospect of the conflict spreading south to involve the Albanian communities of adjacent territories: Kosovo, where an Albanian majority lives uneasily under Serb rule; the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia; and Albania itself. Relations between the Slav majority and Albanian minority in Macedonia have worsened in recent weeks, with Albanian deputies abandoning their seats in parliament and refusing to accept as fair a census designed to show the true ethnic balance. Any conflict involving the Albanians would run the risk of drawing in Greece, which has been at odds with Tirana over the treatment of its ethnic Greek minority. Finally, escalating conflict in Bosnia and points north and south could fatally poison relations between Greece and Turkey, nominal Nato allies whose bilateral relations are already under severe strain. All this makes a depressing prospect for the leaders as they sit down to spaghetti and seafood on the Mediterranean. Due to the fragility of the consensus they have reached over Bosnia, they may not linger on the subject  -though it is expected to feature in the bilateral meetings between Mr Yeltsin and his US and British counterparts. If the increasingly vivid possibility of a Balkan war comes true, however, then all the discussion of other topics - from interest rates to the dollar - could go down in history as a frivolous waste of time.</p>

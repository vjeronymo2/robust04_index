			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Procordia stages strong recovery PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, has doubled profits in 1991 after financial items to SKr4.2bn (Dollars 698.8m) and is increasing the dividend to SKr3.15 from SKr2.85. The recovery in profits reflects the completion of a SKr1.4bn restructuring programme which followed Procordia's merger with the Pharmarcia drug group and Provendor, the food company. The merger depressed earnings in 1990. Excluding restructuring costs, the 1991 operating result grew 24 per cent to SKr4bn from SKr3.2bn a year earlier. Procordia said yesterday talks were continuing between the Swedish government and Volvo about the possible merger of Procordia with the Swedish motor and energy group. Volvo and the government each owns 43 per cent of Procordia. The government blocked the merger in January, but is now discussing alternative solutions. Procordia's healthcare group, which consists of Kabi Pharmacia and Pharmacia Biosystems, last year achieved a 70 per cent jump in operating profits to SKr2.38bn. Kabi Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical unit, increased earnings by 41 per cent to SKr2.1bn due to higher sales of such products as Nicorette anti-smoking gum. Pharmacia Biosystems, which produces medical equipment, swung into a profit of SKr272m after a loss of SKr95m in 1990. The improvement followed the sale of unprofitable businesses and other rationalisation measures. The food group, however, suffered a 3 per cent fall in profits to SKr1.98bn despite an 11 per cent growth in earnings to SKr1.05bn for United Brands, the confectionery and tobacco unit which is Procordia's biggest division. The seafood business suffered a SKr14m loss due to restructuring costs, while the Weibulls nursery plant unit, which will be sold, posted a loss of SKr22m. The service group had a 96 per cent drop in earnings to SKr4m, reflecting a SKr110m loss for its Sara Hotel operations. Kymmene, the Finnish forestry company, yesterday reported a loss after financial items of FM1.3bn (Dollars 286.3m) for 1991 after posting a profit of FM394m in 1990. Group sales fell 1 per cent to FM13.4bn. The company is cutting its dividend to FM0.90 a share from FM1.74.</p>

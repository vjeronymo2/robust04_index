			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Big City prosecutions produce low conviction rate Guinness, Barlow Clowes and Blue Arrow - 26 individuals and three companies were charged and only six convictions have so far been achieved. Eighteen defendants have been acquitted or seen the cases against them dropped. Five remain to be tried - four of them being the remaining Blue Arrow defendants, whose prosecution must now be in doubt. Those three trials were, admittedly, at the high-profile end of the SFO's activities. In his annual report in May, Mr George Staple, SFO director, announced that in the previous year the SFO had prosecuted 58 defendants in 28 trials. Of those, 22 pleaded guilty and 16 others were convicted. The SFO is not the only prosecuting authority whose record in dealing with City crime is dismal. The Department of Trade and Industry, which spearheads the drive against insider dealing, has had only limited success. In 28 insider dealing trials in the past 11 years, almost half the defendants have been acquitted. Nearly two thirds of those convicted had pleaded guilty. In Guinness, eight people were charged. Four - Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chairman and chief executive; Mr Gerald Ronson, chairman of Heron group; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker; and Sir (now Mr) Jack Lyons, a millionaire financier - were convicted in the first trial. Mr Saunders' five-year sentenced was halved on appeal and he was paroled after 10 months. Mr Ronson served six months of a 12-month sentence and was fined Pounds 5m. Mr Parnes, whose 2 1/2 -year sentence was cut on appeal to 21 months, served 11 months. Mr Lyons was fined Pounds 3m. The second Guinness trial ended abruptly for reasons for which the SFO could not be blamed. The judge accepted the view of two psychiatrists that the mental and emotional strain on Mr Roger Seelig - a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell - of conducting his own defence was so severe that there was a risk that he would commit suicide if the trial went on. A nolle prosequi, which halted the proceedings but was not equivalent to an acquittal, was entered in respect of Mr Seelig, and proceedings were discontinued against his co-defendant Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank. Shortly before that trial collapsed, the SFO announced that it was dropping charges against Mr David Mayhew, a partner in Cazenove &amp; Co, the stockbroking firm, and Mr Seelig, who were to have stood trial in Guinness Three. There remains the trial of Mr Thomas Ward, a US attorney and former Guinness non-executive director, on theft and false-accounting charges, due to begin in October. In the Barlow Clowes affair, seven men were originally charged. The case against one of them was dropped. After a six-month trial, Mr Peter Clowes was sentenced to 10 years in jail and Mr Peter Naylor to 18 months. Mr Guy Cramer and Mr Christopher Newman were acquitted. The SFO decided to offer no evidence against Mr David Mitchell and Mr Ian Crabtree, who were to have figured in a second trial.</p>

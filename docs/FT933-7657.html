			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Oftel rejects cellphone complaint OFTEL, THE telecoms regulator, has rejected complaints that Mercury One-2-One, the cheap-rate cellular mobile telephone service to be launched soon, is acting unfairly to competitors which want to provide a service on the same network. One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury's parent Cable &amp; Wireless and telephone company US West, is required under its licence to provide airtime on the new service for rival service providers. Mr Don Cruickshank, the director-general of telecommunications, said yesterday that he would not be justified in concluding that One-2-One was showing undue preference to its own direct sales division by offering other service providers disadvantageous terms and connection arrangements. The decision follows complaints to Oftel from some potential competitors. Mr Cruickshank also rejected allegations that the network operator was in contravention of its licence by securing preferential supplies of handsets which it was refusing to make available to others. Oftel is still investigating complaints alleging unfair cross-subsidy of handsets.</p>

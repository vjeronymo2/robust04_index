			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Argentina 'backs' Brazil to lead WTO Brazilian diplomats said yesterday that the Argentine government had underlined its support for Brazil's candidate to head the World Trade Organisation. According to the diplomats, the support for the Brazilian finance minister, Mr Rubens Ricupero, came in a letter sent by the Argentine foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, to his Brazilian counterpart, Mr Celso Amorim, at the weekend. The letter follows the cancellation by Brasilia of a proposed visit later this month by the Argentine finance minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo. That came after reports that Argentina - along with other heads of government at the Ibero-American summit last week - had backed Mexican President Carlos Salinas to head the WTO. The diplomats said that Mr di Tella's letter said there had been a misunderstanding about the summit discussions in Cartagena, Colombia, over the new WTO head - which took place after Brazil's president, Mr Itamar Franco, had left to attend a funeral. Mr di Tella said the Argentines had not understood the talks to be seeking a consensus, and had believed the Brazilians had been consulted beforehand on the issue. Mr Salinas, who does not leave office until the end of the year, has not yet formally declared his interest in the job as head of the WTO, which is to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. Only one candidate from Latin America is expected to be considered by the new body. Brazil has insisted that Mr Ricupero, the only person to have officially put his name forward, remained a 'viable' candidate.</p>

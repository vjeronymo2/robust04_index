			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR says the leaders of  Yemen have become the Serbian leaders' primary competitors for  record cease-fire announcements that only end in more vicious  fighting.    But the Yemeni leaders stand out for using the daily  cease-fire violations to kill as many of their own innocent  civilians as possible and to destroy the facilities and  installations for which the Yemeni people have paid huge amounts  of money, the paper says in its editorial today.    It says the arrogant and intransigent positions of some  Yemeni leaders and their rejection of any Arab mediation will  not solve the problem. Indeed they will make things worse,  deepen the wounds, and make it more difficult--if not  impossible--for things to return to normal.    AL-AKHBAR notes extensive Arab diplomatic activity to end  the  conflict and asks why the Sanaa government is sending envoys at  the same time as it rejects Arab mediation as interference in  its internal affairs.    The paper expresses the fear that the Yemeni crisis may be  internationalized given that some non-Arab quarters are  exploiting it. This will only make things worse, it says.</p>

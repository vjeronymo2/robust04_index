The plea was made by Endel Lippmaa, an ex-minister for  relations with Russia, who argued that Estonia could no longer  guarantee the safety of citizens residing in the  Russian-controlled area.    In recent weeks, the 2,000-square kilometer Petseri region  has been the site of several skirmishes between local residents  and Russian authorities. In one notable incident last month,  Russian militiamen allegedly entered Estonian territory in  Varska, in the Petseri county, and accosted a group of local  villagers. The militiamen reportedly dragged the villagers  across Russia's "administrative border" and beat them.    Mr. Lippmaa proposed making the current administrative  border  with Russia an official state demarcation line, a move which, if  carried through, would effectively cede to Russia territory  which Estonia has claimed as its own under the terms of the 1920  Tartu Peace Treaty. The remarks were made in an interview with  Radio Free Europe on March 2 in which Mr. Lippmaa commented on  the progress of Estonian-Russian talks.    An estimated 6,000 residents out of a total population of  roughly 50,000 in the Petseri region are believed to be Estonian  citizens. Many Estonians have accused Russia of encouraging  ethnic Russians to settle there as a way of reinforcing its  claims to the area.</p>

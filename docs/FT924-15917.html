			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Canadian banks raise prime rates by two percentage points CANADIAN banks yesterday lifted their prime lending rates by a record two percentage points, in response to moves by the Bank of Canada to defend the Canadian dollar. The rise in prime rate, from 6.25 per cent to 8.25 per cent, reverses the steep downward trend in Canadian interest rates, which began in mid-1990 when prime was at 14.75 per cent. The sharp rise in rates over the past few days has stabilised the dollar, which was trading little changed yesterday at about 80 US cents. Bond prices staged a modest rally. Canadian financial markets were unsettled in early September by the upheaval in European currencies, but the turbulence has been exacerbated by fears of the economic consequences of a No vote in the referendum on a new Canadian constitution on October 26. Recent opinion polls show the No side comfortably ahead in Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Supporters of the constitutional deal are hoping that fear of further economic turmoil will help them make up ground as the referendum approaches.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: Sinner turned saint MARY MAGDALEN by Susan Haskins HarperCollins Pounds 25, 518 pages FOR OVER a thousand years, two images of women have dominated Christian iconography: the Madonna and Mary Magdalen, the sinner turned saint. The Virgin and the repentant whore, the inaccessibly pure and the fleshy, fallen woman: they are at once archetypal male fantasies and emblems of the Church's ideas about guilt, sin and desire, and its equation of sexuality with morality. For centuries, these images conditioned how women were taught to see themselves, and their importance in the collective female psyche can hardly be overestimated. But who was Mary Magdalen? Donatello sculpted her as a gaunt ascetic; Titian made her a sensual beauty; in Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ she is a sexy seductress. She is so rich a symbol that every society has adapted her to its own prejudices. Power politics, theological deceit, sexual repression and revolution have all played a part in her myth. It is this story, with its compelling lesson in the relativity of cultural perception, that is the subject of Susan Haskins' book. Mary Magdalen of the Gospels is a follower of Jesus and prime witness of the Resurrection. But early teaching confused her with the anonymous prostitute in Luke; by the Middle Ages she had become the sinner's saint and most favoured icon of a religion obsessed with guilt and death. Condemned prisoners prayed to her and the bell tolled after a hanging was called 'la maddalena' in Italy. In reference to her tearful regret, the word maudlin, a medieval French pronunciation of her name, entered English. Monks stole her bones as relics and prostitutes celebrated her name-day. Her biblical role was meanwhile minimised: one medieval scholar claimed a woman was the first to see the risen Christ because she would be sure to chatter and gossip, thus inadvertently spreading His Word. Susan Haskins suggests that a female sinner well suited the patriarchal Church; a bishop who questioned the Magdalen's role as repentant whore was promptly excommunicated. Renaissance humanists rescued her, depicting her as a sort of Christian Venus. Titian, asked why a fasting hermit should look as lovely as his image, replied that he painted her on the first day of her penance, when she was still plump and luscious. By the 19th century, the fallen woman was back in vogue. Zola, Massenet, Rossetti, created femmes fatales called Madeleine who were powerfully sexual but immoral and doomed. Men from Gladstone to Dickens were obsessed with repentant prostitutes, known as 'magdalens'. The Victorian line in pious pornography, with women posed as semi-naked penitents, went to the heart of the enduring attraction of Mary Magdalen: spiritual love locked in erotic longing, religious and sexual fantasy, the saint and the libertine, have always gone together in the unconscious mind. This book is full of delights, anecdotes, observations; it exhibits a wealth of scholarship, and I was glad to have read it. But it is also seriously flawed. The prose rambles unforgiveably ('Mary Magdalen's image also reached the foggy British damps of wild, ancient Northumbria'). Vast scope means lack of depth - thinkers from St Jerome to Foucault are parrotted in a few lines. Most damagingly for a scholarly work, Ms Haskins cannot decide whether she is writing cultural history or contributing to it, as she seems to do in her assumption that the Mary Magdalen of the Gospels is the 'true' character and in her recommendation of an updated, independent and active Magdalen to 'serve women better as a symbol for today'. This makes the book weak and inconsistent, and shuts the door on any attempt to analyse the psychological need or meaning of myths. Haskins never matches the critical judgment and perception of Marina Warner's model book in this area, the study of the Virgin Mary cult, Alone Of All Her Sex. And yet - because Haskins is, at heart, a partisan rather than a cultural commentator, her book has a passion and charm which are hard to resist.</p>

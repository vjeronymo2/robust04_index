			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The high council of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sent an open  letter to the Russian president in which it grieves over the  party's woes, calling for "urgent measures to restore justice."    The letter circulated today highlights the party's  achievements and in particular, the fact that the majority of  citizens had voted for the Constitution only thanks to active  support given to the Constitution by the LDP. The letter  contains complaints over the fact that "the LDP leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy had not been given the right to form a new  government and was not even received by the president after the  elections."    Among other things, the LDP high council complains that the  leader of the victorious party was not admitted to the mass  media, that there is not a single minister from the LDP in the  government and that "both the party and its leader are being  outrageously attacked and unscrupulously slandered."    The LDP leadership expressed "surprise" at an interview  given  by Boris Yeltsin to the FIGARO newspaper in which Yeltsin  "indirectly accused the party and its leaders of advocating  fascism."</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Money market reform is welcomed by banks THE long-awaited cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank delivered on Thursday was less important than the accompanying measures to cut reserve requirements and introduce new short-term money-market instruments, a leading member of the German central bank's policy-making council said yesterday. Playing down the significance of the 0.5 percentage-point cut in the Lombard rate and the 0.25 percentage cut in the discount rate to 9 and 8 per cent respectively, Mr Johann Gaddum said relaxation of minimum reserves and the restructuring of the money market would have profound consequences for the German financial industry. Mr Gaddum said the measures would help the competitive position of the German banking community. It has long complained about the reserve requirement which meant that for for every DM100 (Pounds 41.60) taken as a customer deposit, between DM4.15 and DM12 had to be lodged interest-free with the Bundesbank. Under the new measures the Bundesbank has cut reserve requirements on time deposits and savings deposits from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent. Luxembourg, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have no reserve requirements. They are just 1 per cent in France on most types of deposits and 0.35 per cent in the UK. Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, said the relaxation of reserve requirements was a 'tremendous' measure of support for the German financial services industry. He said that upwards of DM200bn (Pounds 83.3bn) in the European money markets could in future be deposited in the German banking system. Mr Hans-Georg Engel, vice-president of JP Morgan in Germany and president of the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany, said the move was 'an enormous step'. Shares in German banks rose strongly yesterday, helping to send the DAX index of 30 leading shares up 39.76 points to its year's high of 1,641.37, up 2.5 per cent. Deutsche Bank shares rose 5 per cent, Commerzbank's 4.5 per cent and Dresdner Bank's 5.7 per cent. This in part reflected the interest rate cut. But investors were also encouraged by the belief that the reserve relaxation could be a substantial tonic to banks' profits. Stock markets, Page 18</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Mexico to admit vote observers Mexico is preparing to break with its nationalist past and formally accept foreign observers of its presidential election in August, a senior government official said. The decision comes as peace talks aimed to end the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas seem to be making rapid progress. After four days of talks, the rebels reported about 50 per cent of their demands had been met. President Carlos Salinas was 'seriously considering foreign election observers. There cannot be any doubt about the process and transparency of elections. There could be resistance (to the observers) but we can do it,' said the official, speaking on presidential authority. He left little doubt that the decision to admit foreign observers had been taken in all but name. For historical reasons, Mexico would not accept US observers, he said. The exact role of the observers had yet to be worked out, but it is expected they would issue a formal report on the elections. The negotiations between the political parties over electoral reform, which have focused on the make-up of electoral tribunals but include the issue of foreign observers, seem to have picked up momentum. The official added that peace talks in Chiapas, aimed at formally ending the uprising there, were going much more rapidly than expected. His view echoes statements by Mr Manuel Camacho, the government's peace envoy in Chiapas, who said the round of talks might finish tomorrow, after which rebel leaders would consult their supporters. The rebels said the government has promised electricity, health and education services to indigenous people's villages, compensation for the relatives of victims killed in the 56-day-old rebellion, and a commission to ensure compliance with an eventual peace accord.</p>

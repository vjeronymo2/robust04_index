			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTEL OWNER CHARGED IN BID TO BRIBE BELL OFFICIAL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged a Bell motel owner  Thursday with attempted bribery after she allegedly tried to pay a city  councilman to approve plans for a second motel in the community.  </P> <P> Chow (Michelle) Chang, 43, a Taiwanese immigrant who owns the 15-unit NuBell  Motel on Florence Avenue with her husband, was being held at the Los Angeles  County Sybil Brand Institute on $1-million bail, police officials said.  Officials did not disclose the full name of Chang's husband.  </P> <P> District attorney's investigators arrested Chang in a parking lot at Florence  and Wilcox avenues at 10 a.m. after they watched her allegedly pass a $2,000  cash down payment to City Councilman George Cole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weeklong Inquiry  </P> <P> The arrest ended a weeklong investigation of Chang. She first approached Cole  last week and promised to pay him $15,000 if he voted to approve her motel plan  and persuade two other councilmen to do the same, Bell-Cudahy Police Chief  Manuel Ortega said.  </P> <P> "The message we want to get across is that the city of Bell is not a place that  will tolerate corruption," Cole said at an afternoon press conference. "We want  people to know that this is not the way we do business around here."  </P> <P> Chang's plan to tear down two small homes on Florence Avenue and build a  $2-million, 60-room motel was on the verge of being rejected. A month ago, the  Bell Planning Commission had unanimously recommended that the council deny her  application because there are more than a dozen motels within a mile of the  proposed site near Florence and Atlantic avenues.  </P> <P> Many of those motels are homes to prostitutes who walk Florence Avenue, Ortega  said. He declined to say if the NuBell has been identified by police in any  recent prostitution arrests.  </P> <P> But late last week, Cole said, Chang called him and asked if he would come to  her house to discuss the application. The council, which was scheduled to hold  a public hearing on her application last Monday, rarely approves a project that  the Planning Commission finds unacceptable.  </P> <P> It was at that meeting the next day that Chang allegedly proposed the bribe  scheme, Cole said. The scheme also included $10,000 payments to each councilman  voting for the application. The application required the support of three  councilmen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contacted Officials  </P> <P> Cole said that after his conversation with Chang he contacted Ortega and the  district attorney's officials, who arranged to tape other telephone  conversations and the sting operation Thursday morning.  </P> <P> The other council members were informed of the alleged bribery attempt before  the council meeting. The scheduled hearing was then postponed, while Chang and  her attorney sat in the audience, Cole said.  </P> <P> Lt. Bob Ewen, a district attorney's investigator who led the investigation,  said Cole was carrying a listening device taped to his chest Thursday morning  when he met Chang in the parking lot. Several officers sitting in a nearby car  witnessed the conversation between Chang and Cole, Ewen said.  </P> <P> Chang's brother, who identified himself only as Chow, was working at the front  desk of the small motel when he was told Thursday about his sister's arrest. "I  didn't hear anything about this," he said. "I don't know her business, but she  (would not) do this."  </P></p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK property Most UK property men must have started turning the lights out 10 days ago when they heard that interest rates had been raised to 15 per cent to defend the value of the pound. Now that monetary policy has been reversed - so quickly in fact that they were able to flick the switch again before going home - the quoted company sector has again shown signs of life. Property shares have outperformed the market by some 8 per cent with sharp percentage gains for leaders like MEPC and British Land, as well as for selected second liners like Frogmore and Peel. Sentiment, of course, has had a lot to do with it. Falling interest costs are positive for cash flow and tenant demand, but most of the majors (except British Land) have their debt at fixed rates. The letting of half of one of the City's biggest white elephants - the Alban Gate development at London Wall - is a relief to its landlord MEPC. But it hardly compensates for the deep-rooted structural problems in the City where 22 per cent of space is still unlet. Still, even a sniff of the good old days could raise hopes for an imminent deal or two in a notoriously gossipy industry. With shares so depressed after the last two years, the current rally may even have further to run. On a longer term view, however, it is hard to get excited. Banks are desperately trying to reduce their exposure to property, not increase it. Rents have gone firmly ex-growth. Weakness at the long end of the gilt market, moreover, will hardly help.</p>

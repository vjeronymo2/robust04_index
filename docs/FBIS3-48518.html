Critics say the rallies, which  have been held in the name of the junta's new political front,  the Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], are  being manipulated by the regime to legitimize its control on  politics. The report coincides with news that the second  biggest rebel army is due in the capital, Rangoon, next month to  sign a cease-fire agreement with the military government.    Evan Williams says the deal was to end 30 years of  insurgency  by Kachin fighters in Burma's far north.    [Begin Williams recording] Kachin mediators in the state  capital say the delegation is due in Rangoon to ratify a  cease-fire reached late last year. It is an important  psychological victory for the junta on the brink of similar  talks with all other major ethnic insurgent groups and it will  be held up to a critical world as progress toward peace in  Burma. Ethnic groups have been promised a role in drafting the  new constitution and some economic and legislative autonomy, but  both sides remain armed and critics warn the constitution is  already being dominated by the junta's aim to retain power.

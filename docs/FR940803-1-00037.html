This action would amend current standards for training personnel performing operating or maintenance activities on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines, and extend those standards to personnel performing similar functions on gas pipelines. This action is taken to ensure that pipeline personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently perform these regulated functions. The intended effect of this proposed rulemaking is to improve pipeline safety by requiring operators to assure the competency of pipeline personnel through training, testing, and periodic refresher training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons are invited to submit written comments in duplicate by October 3, 1994.

Therefore, requiring operators to ensure that such personnel are qualified to perform operating, maintenance, and emergency response functions is an essential step in making the pipeline safety regulations effective. Also, requiring operation, maintenance, and emergency-response personnel to be knowledgeable about safety-related elements, such as flammability, toxicity, potential ignition sources, and to be able to recognize and appropriately react to abnormal and emergency conditions should further minimize the causes and consequences of pipeline accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accidents clearly recognized as involving human error, circumstances often indicate that a deficiency in knowledge or skill, i.e. lack of qualification, has been a significant accident factor. However, the effects of personnel lacking qualifications are not always apparent. The effects may be too subtle to be recognized as an accident factor. For example, accidents that operators have attributed to equipment failure or corrosion may have actually been set in motion by poorly performed operation or maintenance procedures. In addition, the pipeline safety regulations require operators to report ``incidents'' (49 CFR 191.3) and ``accidents'' (49 CFR 195.50) only in instances meeting threshold requirements set out in those regulations. Thus, there may be many more accidents involving personnel lacking qualifications than commonly reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations by National Transportation Safety Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter to RSPA dated May 14, 1987, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that incorrect human performance has already caused, or contributed to the severity of, many pipeline accidents, and that most of the errors involved could be linked to inadequate training. NTSB identified 110 related Safety Recommendations it had issued from 1975 through 1986 based on pipeline accidents indicating that training of pipeline personnel needed improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following two accidents are among those cited by NTSB in its correspondence:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

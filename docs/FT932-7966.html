			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Socialist party in peril as Benvenuto resigns ITALY'S 100-year-old Socialist party was in danger of disintegration last night after Mr Giorgio Benvenuto announced his resignation as leader after only 97 days. His resignation, so close to municipal elections next month, is expected to accelerate the formation of new political alliances as the traditional parties struggle to find fresh identities untainted by the corruption scandals. Mr Benvenuto made it clear he was quitting because the old guard in the party, faithful to Mr Bettino Craxi, the former leader, had undermined every attempt to introduce reforms. But the state of the party's finances, with accumulated debts close to L300bn (Pounds 128m), played a part. On May 4, he had threatened to resign reforms were not adopted. Yesterday he commented bitterly: 'Today the chances of me remaining as leader have vanished. I have realised that every residual effort to save the party is immediately blocked by counter-proposals from a sizeable section of those who until recently were in the leadership.' Mr Benvenuto's decision is also linked to a special report prepared by a consulting firm on the state of the party's finances. This report revealed documented debts attributable directly to the party of L214bn. The figure is close to L300bn if the debts and losses of the party's daily newspaper, Avennire are included. Previously Mr Benvenuto had suspected debts were about L160bn, but even that was double what he had been led to believe three months ago. Bank debts and interest charges are likely to force the party to make some quick sales of its large property portfolio. Mr Benvenuto has never received any pay for his job and the 240 staff in the Rome headquarters have not been paid for three months. The parlous state of the party's finances, Mr Benvenuto claims, reflected very lax management. The Socialist party has been revealed by the corruption scandal as the party with the biggest appetite for money yet its debts are nearly triple those of any other political grouping. At least six members of the Socialist executive decided to resign along with Mr Benvenuto, including Mr Gino Giugni, the party chairman. Mr Benvenuto is the former leader of the UIL, the Socialist-controlled trade union confederation. He was brought in as a compromise candidate in February to replace Mr Craxi, disgraced in corruption scandals. Despite being forced to step down, Mr Craxi still sought to control the party through his allies on the executive such as Mr Gianni De Michaelis, the former foreign minister. Mr Craxi himself retained offices in the party headquarters in Rome.</p>

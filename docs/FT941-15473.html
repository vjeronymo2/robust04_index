			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels recovers with 22% increase Hilton Hotels, the US lodging and gaming group, bounced back from a third-quarter profits decline to report a 22 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 32.3m for its fourth quarter yesterday. The company attributed the increase to strength in its gaming operations and improvement in its main hotel markets. It also benefited from a tax credit that caused its tax charge to fall by Dollars 1.9m to Dollars 11.1m. Operating profits for the quarter rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 59m. Within the total, gaming profits rose from Dollars 35.2m to Dollars 36.6m while hotel profits were slightly down at Dollars 29.6m from Dollars 29.7m. But Hilton said the hotel division would have increased operating profits by 42 per cent had it not taken a Dollars 12.5m reserve for a loan to a managed property. In the gaming division, strong performances had come from properties in Reno and Laughlin, Nevada, and the Flamingo Hilton, Las Vegas. Net income per share rose from 55 cents to 67 cents. For the year as a whole, net income was slightly down at Dollars 102.7m from Dollars 103.9m before accounting changes, or Dollars 2.14 a share against Dollars 2.17. After accounting changes, net income was Dollars 106.1m, or Dollars 2.21.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAVAROTTI DIET TRIMS 80 POUNDS  </P> <P> Luciano Pavarotti says a diet to reduce his substantial girth has melted away  80 pounds.  </P> <P> When pressed at a news conference Wednesday, however, he refused to say how  much he weighs.  </P> <P> "I have lost 80 pounds and so I am 80 pounds less than I was," Pavarotti said  with a broad smile. Asked how he did it, Pavarotti replied: "Very simple. I  don't take alcohol, sugar or fat. Just 1,800 calories a day. It's brilliant."  </P> <P> To laughter, he said: "Tonight, I will have a beautiful piece of salmon with  vegetables, a piece of bread, strawberries, mineral water and lemon and coffee.  What do you want more?"  </P> <P> The 54-year-old Italian tenor was in London for his first appearance in nearly  six years at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Invergordon Potential conflicts of interest abound in the debate over Invergordon's future. Fleming Investment Management holds the deciding stake, and is negotiating with Whyte &amp; Mackay to sell Invergordon's birthright. Yet it has to call in S G Warburg as an adviser because its sister company is Invergordon's adviser. Meanwhile the apparently downbeat view of Warburg Securities' analysts is hardly helpful to Warburg's corporate finance efforts on behalf of the vendor. All that should not detract from the seriousness of the situation. If FIM agrees a price with Whyte, it will trigger a full bid, but the issue will effectively have been decided since, thanks to its existing stake, Whyte will have more than 50 per cent of the votes. In that case neither other shareholders nor the company's management will have had a full opportunity to express their views. FIM will have effectively negotiated on everyone else's behalf and two shareholders will have decided for everyone. It would be more satisfactory if Whyte, having noted FIM's interest, decided either that it did not want to bid at present, or put a formal offer into the market open to all shareholders. The difficulty, unsurprisingly, is over price. Whyte seems determined not to overpay while the market is talking the price higher than the previous failed bid. Yet any bid should be determined by what Whyte is prepared to pay set against the management's view of business prospects. Currently shareholders are being denied both pieces of information.</p>

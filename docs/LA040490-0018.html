			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: LAWMAKERS UPHOLD CUSTOM WITH LONG SPRING VACATION  </P> <P> It's a tradition that's easy to live with. Again this year, members of the  Legislature will take a longer Easter break than most working folks. The state  bill mill will grind to a halt at noon Thursday when the Assembly and Senate  recess until April 16.  </P> <P> Up to half of the legislative staffers also are expected to take some time off  while their bosses are absent from the Capitol, according to Assembly Chief  Clerk R. Brian Kidney and Senate Secretary Darryl R. White.  </P> <P> There are a sprinkling of special committee hearings scheduled to be held  throughout the state, however. These include a Senate Appropriations Committee  meeting on financial oversight of the South Coast Air Quality Management  District in Ontario on Monday.  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Prison Labor: Defeated on a 32-8 vote a motion to withdraw from committee a  constitutional amendment (ACA 11) by Assemblyman William Baker (R-Danville) and  backed by Gov. George Deukmejian to require some prisoners to work for private  business to help pay their keep. Forty-one yes votes were required for  approval. The governor already has received the green light to begin gathering  voter signatures for a November ballot initiative to allow implementation of  the plan, which is opposed by organized labor.  </P> <P> Committee Action  </P> <P> Disposable Diapers: The Natural Resources Committee sent to between-sessions  study a bill (AB 2582) by Assemblyman Norm Waters (D-Plymouth) to require  disposable diapers sold in California after 1994 to be biodegradable. The  author said the law is needed to prevent state landfills from bursting at the  seams. An estimated 4 million diapers are tossed away each year in California.  </P> <P> SENATE  </P> <P> Committee Action  </P> <P> Oil Spill Cleanups: The Governmental Organization Committee approved a bill (SB  2040) by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) to establish a state-administered oil  spill cleanup fund to be financed by a tax on oil unloaded at California ports.  An 8-0 vote sent the bill to the Judiciary Committee. Similar legislation is  pending in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> So far this year, there have been 4,364 bills introduced in the Assembly and  1,173 in the Senate.  </P></p>

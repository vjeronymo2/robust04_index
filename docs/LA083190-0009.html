			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR OVER NEW LITERATURE TEXTBOOKS  </P> <P> The debate in Yucaipa over the "Impressions" reading series brings to mind  another book that has long been banned in our public schools.  </P> <P> It is a compilation of stories containing numerous descriptions of murder,  torture, genocide, rape, bestiality, adultery, incest, homosexuality, group sex  and devil worship. Ironically, it is still found in most church-run schools. It  is, of course, the Bible.  </P> <P> STEVE MILLS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

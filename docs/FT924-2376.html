			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Equities beat the doom and gloom / A look at the shares which are the year's leaders and laggards BUY when the besieging army is at the city gates; sell when the trumpets sound the retreat. The old Rothschild adage once more proved its usefulness in 1992. Faced with daily headlines of economic gloom, the small investor might easily have been baffled by the stock market's cheerfulness. As the FT-SE 100 Index reached a new high (2,792 on December 1), one reader wrote: 'If the FT-SE was near its all-time low, I could understand the situation rather than the present one.' But stock markets are continually looking ahead and the problems of today are frequently seen as far less important than the hopes for tomorrow. In fact, there were three distinct market phases during the year; post-election euphoria as investors celebrated the Conservatives' unexpected victory at the polls; the summer of depression as the long-awaited UK economic recovery failed to arrive; and the aftermath of Black Wednesday as traders responded to the interest rate cuts which followed the UK's departure from the exchange rate mechanism. Overall, the FT-SE 100 Index rose 10.3 per cent over the year to December 9, while the FT-A All-Share Index climbed 10 per cent over the same period. Add in a yield of four to five per cent and, even allowing for costs, an equity investor should easily have beaten building society returns. But as usual, the leaders and laggards lists for 1992 show how carefully investors have to pick and choose their stocks. We have divided the lists into two groups (compiled from Datastream), showing the best and worst performers in the Footsie and among all stocks. We have eliminated one category; those companies which have gone bust. Obviously, investors in such companies have lost 100 per cent of their money; we have included only those shares where the company retains a quote. The top performing Footsie share of the year was the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which took the place of its new subsidiary, Midland Bank, in the index. Indeed, it was a good year for bank shares, with the FT-A Banks index rising by more than a third - news which is unlikely to make the banks any more popular with those who accuse them of profiting from the recession. Granada chief executive Gerry Robinson will be entitled to smile at his group's second place in the rankings. Dismissed as an 'upstart caterer' by John Cleese when he took over the TV and leisure group, Robinson recently announced more than doubled pre-tax profits. Among the Footsie losers, BET, a business services company, last month announced a 43 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits and made it clear that this year's dividend is unlikely to be covered by earnings. During the year, the company raised Pounds 200m via a rights issue to repay debt; those who took up the rights at 110p would have been disappointed to see the shares languishing at 83p at the close on Thursday. The FT-SE 100 Index is a harsh taskmaster and BET's decline means it will drop out of the index at the end of the year, along with Rolls-Royce. Royal Insurance and Standard Chartered will take their places. Rolls is one of three former privatisation stocks in the bottom ten, making it a distinctly mixed year for Sid, the government's favourite private investor. Sid did well if he stuck to the privatised utilities - there are two water companies and BAA in the top ten - but far less well with the industrial groups. BP cut its dividend for the first time since the first world war and announced plans for 11,500 job cuts in a turbulent year which also saw the departure of Robert Horton, its chairman and chief executive. The news was even worse at British Steel, which omitted its interim dividend altogether as it announced a pre-tax loss for the first half - a reminder of the bad old pre-privatisation days when its losses made the Guinness Book of Records. The shares were trading at 55p this week, compared with the fully-paid flotation price of 125p. Indeed, British Steel achieved, along with oil group Lasmo, the unenviable distinction of being in the Footsie laggards' list two years running. It was a pretty bad year for contrarian investment. If you had bought a portfolio of 1991's ten leading Footsie stocks, you would have made a gain of 8.8 per cent this year; buying 1991's losers would have earned you a loss of 6.7 per cent. There were some exceptions. Supermarket group Asda, the worst performing Footsie stock of 1991 (it was then relegated from the index) showed signs of recovery and its shares have risen by over 50 per cent in 1992. Guardian Royal Exchange, in the FT-SE loser list of 1991, rebounded this year on reduced losses, although the news for shareholders was not entirely good; the interim dividend was cut from 4.4p to 2.5p. The share which is top of the small stocks list - Tanjong - is an oddity. A former tin dredging company, it acquired Pan Malaysian Pools, a lottery operator, in 1991 and also manages the National Stud Farm. But whether any UK investors enjoyed the benefit of the rise recorded by Datastream seems doubtful. Tanjong fits the definition of a close company (controlled by five or fewer persons): some 90 per cent of its shareholders reside outside the UK and the shares have only been traded on a matched bargain basis since April. So, realistically, the share which performed best for UK investors in 1992 was TVS Entertainment. This does represent a triumph of contrarian thinking; the company lost its franchise last year and was sixth in 1991's losers' list, recording a fall of 90.1 per cent (it was one of the losers of 1989 as well). Investors' prayers were answered this year by the arrival of Reverend Pat Robertson, former US Presidential candidate and purveyor of wholesome TV though his company, International Family Entertainment. However, the cash element of the offer - 23p per share - means that many investors will be nursing heavy losses; TVS shares reached a peak of 454p in 1987. Family entertainment is also on offer from two more of this year's leaders; Bluebird Toys, maker of the Polly Pocket doll and the Big Red Fun Bus, which returned to profit; and it was an annus mirabilis for shareholders in Sleepy Kids, the cartoon group which has bought the intellectual property rights to Budgie the helicopter, the character created by the Duchess of York. A wave of nostalgia will doubtless greet the inclusion of Filofax in the leaders list; the personal organiser group, which was close to collapse in 1990, has been revived by one of the breeds which flourished in the 1980s, a management consultant. The losers among the small companies are a mixture of marketing groups, property companies and leisure stocks. The name that does stand out is Pepe group, the jeans design and marketing company. If the economy recovers in 1993, so might some of the stocks which have suffered most this year. But not necessarily. Past experience has shown that the early stages of recovery are very dangerous for weakened companies; creditors may take the opportunity to foreclose once they can find a buyer for the assets. Equity investment may well be profitable in 1993, but it will be far from easy.  ------------------------------------------------------ BEST PERFORMING FT-SE 100 COMPANIES  ------------------------------------------------------ Company                             % growth  ------------------------------------------------------ HSBC Holdings                           95.5 Granada Grp                             74.5 Guardian Royal                          55.9 BAT Inds                                54.6 Carlton Comms                           53.0 Bowater                                 51.4 Siebe                                   50.7 BAA                                     49.3 Thames Water                            47.7 Severn Trent                            44.7  ------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------ WORST PERFORMING FT-SE 100 STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------------ Company                               % loss  ------------------------------------------------------ BET                                    -59.5 Arjo Wiggins                           -37.9 Lasmo                                  -32.3 Fisons                                 -31.9 Forte                                  -27.9 BP                                     -24.1 Rolls-Royce                            -21.0 Blue Circle                            -19.4 Brit Steel                             -19.0 Ladbroke                               -18.1  ------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------ BEST PERFORMING SMALL STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------------ Company                             % growth  ------------------------------------------------------ Tanjong                                305.0 TVS Enter                              285.7 Bluebird Toys                          277.1 Sleepy Kids                            241.2 Acorn                                  236.4 Brown &amp; Jackson                        225.5 Gresham Tele                           222.2 Huntleigh Tech                         216.8 Chemex Int'l                           200.0 Filofax                                196.0  ------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------ WORST PERFORMING SMALL STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------------ Company                            % decline  ------------------------------------------------------ Clarke Hooper                          -95.6 Greycoat                               -93.4 Osprey                                 -92.7 Lightship                              -91.6 Birkby                                 -91.0 Merivale Moore                         -90.1 Pepe                                   -89.6 Expedier                               -89.5 Bimec                                  -88.4 Dana Exp                               -87.0  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

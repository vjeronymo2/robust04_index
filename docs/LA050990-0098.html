			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTRACT APPROVED FOR NEW CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors Tuesday approved a contract for Philip Hawkey,  who will become Pasadena's city manager June 18 despite vigorous opposition by  members of the city's black community. The contract includes a $119,500 annual  salary and generous severance pay if Hawkey, now city manager in Toledo, Ohio,  is dismissed without just cause.  </P> <P> The severance pay provisions -- 18 months' salary if fired during the first  year and 12 months' salary if fired in the second or third years -- will  insulate Hawkey, who is white, from politically motivated attempts to fire him,  Director William Thomson said. The vote was 4 to 2 to approve the contract,  with Mayor Jess Hughston abstaining.  </P> <P> Hawkey was chosen for the job over two black finalists. His four years in  Toledo were marked by racial tensions, including a discrimination complaint  filed against him and the city. Hawkey, 43, will receive a $500 monthly auto  allowance and financial help to buy a home here. He succeeds retiring City  Manager Donald McIntyre.  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Hectic flow dominated by Japanese borrowers A SPATE of financings by Japanese borrowers was the main feature of yesterday's hectic flow of deals. Tuesday's  3/4 -point rate cut in Japan helped improve rates for Japanese borrowers hoping to swap the proceeds of their deals back into yen. But yesterday's two Japanese government-guaranteed bond offerings were planned prior to the rate cut, dealers said. Japan Development Bank and Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises both tapped the international bond market. Japan Development Bank's Pounds 200m issue via S. G Warburg and J. P. Morgan provided much needed supply at the seven-year area of the yield curve, where there is little current coupon paper. The strong rally in recent months means that most sterling bonds are trading at a substantial premium to their par value, which makes them illiquid. The deal was priced to yield 17 basis points above the seven-year gilt, which appears relatively aggressive compared with outstanding seven-year paper, but proved attractive given the lack of paper trading around par value. In fact, some dealers said the issue could have been priced more aggressively, by several basis points. 'The deal went very smoothly: it could have been twice the size,' said one trader. According to S. G. Warburg, the bonds were placed mainly in Europe, rather than east Asia. Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises' smaller DM150m deal, which was also priced to yield 17 basis points over the comparable government benchmark, attracted mainly German domestic interest. In the French bond market, Alcatel launched a rare FFr2bn corporate bond issue in a sector which does not always favour names from outside the state sector. However, in this case, the second best-rated private sector French company provided a welcome change from government-backed names, and some extra margin, at a yield spread 40 basis points over the comparable French government bond. Volkswagen, the German car company, has been placed on Creditwatch with negative implications by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. VW has Dollars 577m of AA minus-rated long-term debt. Standard &amp; Poor's said that Volkswagen's financial performance has improved more slowly than anticipated as a result of difficult conditions in the European car market, an uncompetitive cost structure and problems at the Seat subsidiary.</p>

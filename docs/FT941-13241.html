			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Baring drops Japan warrants market role in London Baring Securities in London has ceased making a market in Japanese equity warrants, citing the increasing illiquidity of the sector. The firm will continue to trade in Japanese warrants, and to make a market in Japanese convertible bonds. Baring Securities in Tokyo will continue to provide a broker/broker dealing arrangement (the equivalent of marketmaking) in both equity warrants and convertibles. Baring Securities was a leading participant in the thriving London-based market for Japanese equity warrants in the late 1980s. However, the weakness of the Japanese stock market in recent years, which has left many Japanese equity warrants substantially out of the money, has caused volume in London to tail off. The rules for marketmakers set by the International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the Eurobond market's regulatory body in the UK, have become increasingly burdensome, a Baring official said. For example, under the so-called 'knock-for-knock' rule, if a marketmaker asks another marketmaker for a price, he then has to make one in return. He suggested that a system of screen-based quotes, similar to the Tokyo market, might be more suitable for the low level of trading in the sector. The departure of Baring leaves only 12 marketmakers in London. Baring is making four staff redundant as a result of the move.</p>

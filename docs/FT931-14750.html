			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Iraqi instability no surprise if its coastline confiscated Sir, Many of Iraq's troubles stem from map-drawing at the end of the first world war. Saddam, more than any other of Iraq's rulers, has failed to come to grips with them. Much of the cartography was unfair. Worst of all was the Shatt al Arab boundary, which penalised the country which has almost no access to the sea while rewarding Iran, blessed with a more than ample coastline. This short-sighted arrangement was one of the chief causes of the Iraqi war with Iran in the 1980s. It has been disheartening to learn that a similar mistake has been made  - apparently secretly - in recent days. You rightly hinted at it in your editorial ('Gulf war revisited', January 14) by speaking of the Umm Qasr port area as land which 'the United Nations now recognises as Kuwaiti territory'. It did not do so two days ago. Until then, it belonged to Iraq, as it had since the country made its first appearance as a state in modern times. Now the UN has given away a piece of Iraq. I visited Umm Qasr port in the 1960s, when no one doubted that it was a possession, indeed a proud new creation, of Iraq. To cut it off from its hinterland seems clumsy. To confiscate part of the minuscule coastline of a country which went to war two years ago partly for the lack of an adequate one is gratuitously to sow seeds of future instability where there are quite enough already. To leave the new border unprotected has been to invite (entrap?) the Iraqis into crossing it to retrieve their equipment. Is it any wonder that they have so lost control of themselves in recent days as to provoke the allies into again bombing their long-suffering country.

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Secret services unite against crime: The Cold War's end has forced agencies to find a new role Across Europe, secret services are coming in from the cold, as they search for new roles and greater public acceptability after the demise of superpower confrontation. Governments are searching for value for money, while electorates have grown increasingly wary of secret service power and lack of accountability. The response has been two-fold. On the functional side, Europe's secret services have pooled their efforts against cross-border terrorism, and are stepping up co-operation to combat a sharp rise in organised crime stemming from the former Soviet bloc. On the public relations side, countries such as Britain and Italy, whose intelligence services have traditionally been subject to little public scrutiny, are being forced to shift towards more open practices, similar to those of Germany and the Netherlands. Britain's MI5 and MI6 and Germany's BND have quickly emerged as the key players in the struggle against drugs trafficking, arms-running and weapons proliferation. But intelligence agencies from now-democratic eastern Europe are also being drawn into the fray. Links with the Russian intelligence service, the successor to the KGB, have been hampered by Moscow's admission that it is still spying on the west, particularly for scientific and industrial intelligence. But MI5 has held training courses for members of the Czech, Hungarian and Polish intelligence services, designed to remodel these organisations on western lines. A spokesman for Germany's BND confirmed last week that 'contacts' exist with eastern European intelligence agencies in areas such as drugs and money laundering as well as terrorism. The Czech republic is a particular focus for attention. Since the beginning of the year about 20 clandestine drugs laboratories have been uncovered there by the Czech police. Police estimate 70 per cent of drugs entering Germany pass through the Czech Republic on their way to western Europe from the Middle East, the former Soviet Union and Latin America. The Italian secret services, in the throes of radical reorganisation after widespread revelations of serious malpractice, are also believed to have intensified contacts with the Czech republic, Ukraine and Albania to combat the activities of gangs with possible Mafia links. 'The conquest of markets these days is more important than the defence of territory,' according to one top Italian secret service official. Italy, meanwhile, has provided a powerful example of the need to subject intelligence services to adequate political control. As part of the overall attempt to clean up corruption throughout public life, magistrates are conducting at least four investigations into Italy's intelligence services. They are looking into alleged abuse of office, embezzlement and association with the Mafia. To avoid such malpractice, the Rome government last month announced a radical reform of the intelligence services and their merger into a single co-ordinating agency. This will be controlled directly by the prime minister's office and answerable to parliament both for its activities and the use of budgeted funds. The Intelligence Services Bill announced in London on Friday contains provision for a parliamentary oversight committee to survey the activities of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, which appears likely to play a similar role to the parliamentary committee that scans the German secret services. A similar committee is in operation in the Netherlands. There are pockets of resistance to the relaxation in secrecy, with details of the budget and staff numbers of Spain's Cesid, and of the DGSE and DST - the foreign and domestic arms of the French intelligence services - remaining classified. But increased international co-operation among intelligence services is spurring moves towards greater accountability. Britain's MI5 has built up particularly strong links to Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV. Although the BfV is legally barred from participating in the battle against organised crime, German and British officials believe that co-operation between the two agencies has helped curb Irish terrorist attacks against British army bases in Germany in recent years. As part of its informal study of German methods, MI5 has even looked at whether to adopt some elements of the BfV's relatively open approach towards disseminating information to the press. Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, has lifted the veil on some aspects of the service by holding off-the-record conversations with journalists during the last year. Four months ago, MI5 took the unprecedented step of issuing a 36-page booklet on its activities. However, Ms Rimington is unlikely to raise her public profile to the extent of Mr Eckart Werthebach, the BfV chief, who makes frequent TV appearances. A European intelligence service chief with close contacts to Mrs Rimington says he has advised her against becoming a public figure in view of the threat from the IRA. A new public relations role for MI6 appears even more unlikely. MI6 has made clear its reluctance about subjecting its chief, Sir Colin McColl, to even the limited public exposure given to Mrs Rimington. MI6 argues it already faces considerable government checks and balances. In an example of the limitations on MI6 disclosure, Baroness Daphne Park, a former MI6 controller, has been given clearance to answer questions on British TV. An interview is being screened tonight in which she talks of the information MI6 provided to the UK government before the August 1991 coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president. Although Baroness Park (who retired from a key intelligence role in 1980) is the most senior MI6 figure ever to speak on British TV, she gives no significant insights into MI6 policy. By contrast, Mr Konrad Porzner, the head of the German BND, already related in a German press interview during the summer how his agency gave the Bonn government forewarning of the August 1991 coup.</p>

In an exclusive statement to MENA, he added that the  massacre  was carried out with the cooperation and oversight of the  Israeli Army. This constitutes a dangerous turning point in the  peace process. At a time when Israel has been trying through  the negotiations to get control of the crossings, under the  pretext of security, it leaves the occupied territories flooded  with arms, especially in the hands of the obsessed settlers.  This constitutes an abnormal danger for the march to peace.    He said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who does not  want to respect the dates [for implementing the agreements with  the Palestinians], does not consider them sacred, and is in no  hurry to implement the peace process either in letter or spirit,  is opening up opportunities to such murderers to commit such  ugly crimes.    He added that this heinous massacre affirms once again the  importance of moving the settlements, which were established  through aggression and against the legitimate international  resolutions and international law.    He insisted that the responsibility for this massacre falls  on the shoulders of the Israeli cabinet and its prime minister,  Yitzhaq Rabin. They are also responsible for preventing  repetitions of similar acts and for punishing the murderers and  stopping them from committing further such crimes.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / It's not on the menu: Mr Hurd's portrayal of an a la carte Europe is deceptive Mr Douglas Hurd has been trying to persuade the Tories that they ought to like the European Union. In principle this is a worthy enterprise, and not before its time, especially in the run-up to next month's elections to the European Parliament. Unfortunately, however, the UK foreign secretary's sales pitch for Europe is misleading, both about the facts as they are now, and about the future as it is likely to be. Mr Hurd has been telling the party that the argument in Europe is going Britain's way. The European Union is not a tyrannous and regimented organisation, he reassures the Tories, but a wonderfully flexible grouping, which is becoming more flexible all the time. Its flexibility is reflected in Britain's various opt-outs, from the single currency and the social chapter; and this so-called 'variable geometry', by which member states can pick and choose the policies that suit them, will be the wave of the future. 'This,' he told Scottish Conservatives last week, 'is a multi-track, multi-speed, even multi-layered approach, which will increasingly be the way of the future. It threatens no one.' His tactics are obvious. The Conservatives risk a drubbing in the European Parliament elections, some of which may come from the anti-European wing of his own party. If he can win over some of the party's waverers on Europe, he may hope to alleviate the danger of a threat to Prime Minister John Major's leadership. The problem is that it is simply not true to suggest either that national opt-outs are becoming a generalised pattern throughout the Union, or that Mr Hurd's image of a 'multi-track, multi-speed, multi-layered approach' is becoming generally accepted as an alternative model of how Europe should develop in future. On the contrary, most of the other governments are still committed to the model of an integrated Europe with strong common institutions, in which all the member states sign up to reach the same common objectives, sooner or later. This commitment to the traditional model tends to be strongest among the original founding members at the heart of the European Union; and there is no sign they are being won over by Mr Hurd's vision of Europe a la carte. British ministers have triumphantly endorsed recent proposals from the Bonn government for faster deregulation in Europe. But it would surely be a mistake to draw too large an inference from this initiative. The German government has its own problems of unpopularity with the voters in the run-up to the European elections; and Germany also has its share of Euro-sceptics. This episode does not constitute evidence of a strategic shift in Germany's European policy, away from the objective of an integrated Union, towards the loose Europe of opt-ins and opt-outs touted by Britain. Now it is possible that we shall see more 'variable geometry' in Europe in future. It may be desirable as a way of accommodating the countries of eastern Europe; and if the Union becomes more integrated, it may be an unavoidable concession to the reluctant members. But this does not mean that Europe a la carte will become the preferred paradigm for Spain, Portugal or Ireland, let alone for France, Germany or the Benelux. So when Mr Hurd says that there is no danger of Britain being left in a 'slow lane or outer circle' of the European Union, he is being merely disingenuous. There is certainly no danger that the other member states would prefer to relegate Britain to an outer circle. But unless variable geometry does become the generalised pattern for all the member states, the logic of the way Mr Hurd is talking is that Britain might manoeuvre itself into a slower lane. Mr Hurd's advocacy of a British vision of Europe may ease the pressure on the government in the European elections; or it may not, we shall see. But the longer he sticks to this kind of dialectical deception, the harder it will be to frame a reasonable strategy for the fundamental medium-term choices coming up. Those choices will have to be faced in the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996. This was originally conceived as a fairly modest event, to revise the Treaty of Maastricht in the light of experience; it now seems likely to be a much bigger affair, to plan for the opening of the Union to the countries of eastern Europe. No one yet knows how or when they can be brought in; but it is already obvious that they cannot be included soon without fundamental revisions of the Union's policies, or its institutions, and probably both. A larger Europe, moreover, must have a common foreign and security policy. This was a decorative optional extra in the Maastricht treaty, but will become an inevitable obligation, imposed by geography. The east European countries have just been offered associate partnership in the Western European Union defence grouping; when they join the European Union, their security from any instability in the east will unavoidably become our concern. In political terms variable geometry will become more difficult in this larger Europe, not easier. In 1996, therefore, most existing member states will want to strengthen the central institutions of the Union, including, no doubt, easier majority voting and more powers for the European Parliament; and some may want to go further, towards a European constitution. There must be a real danger of an ideological confrontation between Britain and its partners. But the negotiation will be unnecessarily gruelling the longer the government goes on painting a misleading picture of the way things are really going in Europe.</p>

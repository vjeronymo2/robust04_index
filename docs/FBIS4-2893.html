			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security  Council today condemned Bosnian Serbs for blocking the movement  of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.    The council said in a statement that the actions, which  affect the safe and free movement of UNPROFOR personnel, have  violated the Security Council's resolutions.    The statement said that "the council affirms its full  support  for UNPROFOR in its execution of the council's relevant  resolutions."    The council "demands that all parties, and in particular the  Bosnian Serb party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of  movement, and refrain from any further actions which could  threaten the safety of UNPROFOR personnel."    Reports of Serbs' blocking of UNPROFOR movement came after  NATO launched air strikes against Serb positions around the  eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde on April 10 and 11.</p>

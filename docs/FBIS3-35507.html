An unspecified  number of Arabs were reported to have been killed and there is a  report that a Jew was hit. There were reports of shots at the  scene, but details are still sketchy. The area has been  declared a closed military zone.    A resident of Har Hadar, north of Jerusalem, was seriously  injured last night when stones were thrown at her car near  Ramallah. She was taken by ambulance to Hadassah Hospital at 'En  Kerem. The incident occurred when the car in which she was  travelling encountered a stone roadblock near the village of  Biddu. In a stone throwing incident near Tulkarm, two Israelis  were lightly hurt when stones shattered the windshield of the  Egged bus in which they were travelling. They were taken to  hospital. Shots were fired at a vehicle bearing Israeli license  plates near 'Imanu'el. No one was hurt and no damage was caused.</p>

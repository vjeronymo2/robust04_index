			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET BALTIC REPUBLICS GAIN TWIN VICTORIES  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's restive Baltic republics won both practical and symbolic  victories Thursday in their campaign for greater independence from the Kremlin.  </P> <P> The practical victory came as the country's revitalized Parliament adopted two  resolutions paving the way for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to gain a degree  of economic autonomy that the Soviet leadership had decried as unacceptable as  recently as last spring.  </P> <P> The symbolic advance was the report by a member of a state commission assessing  the 1939 Soviet-German nonaggression pact, who told Radio Moscow that the panel  has determined secret protocols attached to the treaty to be illegal and that  they "should be proclaimed non-operative."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backdrop for Seizure  </P> <P> The protocols, long recognized in the West but denied here, designated the  then-independent Baltic nations as within the Kremlin's sphere of influence,  and they formed the backdrop against which the Soviet Union absorbed Lithuania,  Latvia and Estonia as constituent republics in 1940. The commission's  conclusion thus supports the argument that the Baltic states were illegally  stripped of their sovereignty.  </P> <P> Both developments occur at a time of increasing unrest in the three Baltic  republics, where next month's 50th anniversary of the so-called  Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is expected to trigger mass demonstrations.  </P> <P> During a heated debate in the Supreme Soviet on Baltic economic autonomy,  Estonian deputy Mikhail Bronstein had warned that should the lawmakers try to  postpone consideration of the issue, "the mandate of faith, given to deputies  by the peoples of Baltic republics, will pass on" to others.  </P> <P> Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are generally considered to be the wealthiest and  most Western of all 15 constituent Soviet republics, and their leaders have  been in the forefront of those pressing for more radical reforms under  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or restructuring.  </P> <P> By moving to give the Baltics greater autonomy, Parliament made a decision of  "historical significance," said deputy Fyodor Burlatsky, a political writer and  leading advocate of reform considered close to Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of a movement in the direction toward real radical  structure reform," Burlatsky added. "It is a turning point in the consciousness  of the deputies, which, I am convinced will be a precedent for a deeper, more  serious approach to future reform."  </P> <P> One of the Supreme Soviet resolutions endorses the right of the three Baltic  republics to install their own cost accounting systems as of January. The other  endorses, in principle, plans adopted by the Lithuanian and Estonian  parliaments for virtually full economic independence. Local and republican  authorities, rather than officials in Moscow, would decide what to produce and  how profits would be spent.  </P> <P> Lithuania, for example, which now controls only about 11% of its industrial  production, expects to be operating about 70% by the end of next year.  </P> <P> The Latvian Parliament is considering a similar economic independence bill.  </P> <P> Lithuania and Estonia had originally wanted the Supreme Soviet to pass a law  sanctioning their economic plans, but that action was deferred until after Oct.  1. The resolutions were a compromise, but one that Baltic officials said was  satisfactory.  </P> <P> "They have given us the green light for development of economic independence,"  Estonian Premier Indrek Toome told the news agency Reuters after Thursday's  vote. "The lack of a law will in no way hinder us. We will push on."  </P> <P> A Western diplomatic source who has been following the situation said in an  interview that the resolutions amount to approval for a "very substantial  decentralization of economic authority to the republics -- one which only three  or four months ago the center was saying was quite unacceptable."  </P> <P> Gorbachev and leading reform-minded economists here have lately been pushing  for more radical measures to break down bureaucratic resistance to reform.  </P> <P> Soviet Deputy Premier Minister Leonid I. Abalkin told the Supreme Soviet during  the debate dhat autonomy should be introduced in the Baltic republics as an  initial step toward putting the entire country on a system of decentralized  economic management.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foundation Before Roof  </P> <P> "You have to build the pyramid from below; the foundation must come before the  roof," he said. "We must not fall behind the deadline of the beginning of next  year for Lithuania and Estonia."  </P> <P> Greater local control over economic decision making was also a key demand of  striking coal miners who triggered what Gorbachev described as "perhaps the  gravest test" of his four years in power two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Opponents of the Baltic experiment argued that it "damaged the rights of other  republics." First Deputy Premier Yuri D. Maslyukov said he opposed "hasty  decisions dictated by considerations of political tactics rather than the real  economic situation."  </P> <P> Maslyukov's reference to "political tactics" was seen as a veiled reference to  Baltic sensitivities over the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, signed Aug. 23, 1939.  </P> <P> Gorbachev agreed under pressure from the Baltics to establish a high-level  commission to assess the pact. Earlier this week, Valentin M. Falin, head of  the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee,  said on a West German television interview that there is no longer any doubt  that the pact contained the controversial, secret protocols. The originals of  the protocols have never been found, but Soviet historians have inspected a  microfilm copy in the West German archives.  </P> <P> However, Thursday's report by Radio Moscow was believed to be the first in  which an official was quoted as suggesting that the protocols might be  renounced.  </P> <P> Saying that the group was concluding its work, the radio quoted commission  member Maryu Lauristin as commenting that "comprehensive studies of an  impressive volume of documents have shown the pact was a graphic incidence of  violation of the Leninist principles of Soviet foreign policy. Besides, the  commission has concluded that there are secret protocols to the pact which  should be proclaimed non-operative because they run counter to the law."  </P></p>

Authorities  have confirmed that Bolivian and Peruvian coca crops are being  moved to Colombia and that the number of coca plantations has  increased 100 percent in the past four years. This prompts a  new and distressing situation in our country.    [Begin Colombian Drug Director Gabriel De Vega recording] We  are becoming a country that produces coca and are very close to  supplanting Bolivia for second place, after Peru, as a coca  producing country. [end recording]    The situation is developing as a result of Peru's struggle  against the aircraft that transport coca base from that country  to Colombia to be processed into cocaine. The large number of  planes downed by the Peruvians has caused pilots involved in  drug trafficking to decide to leave the business or to charge  too much.    [Begin De Vega recording] Confronted with this situation,  for  example, they prefer to shift coca growing to Colombia, even if  it is not as productive as in Peru. They would rather increase  the number of crops to compensate for the loss in productivity.  [end recording]    This situation is making Colombia not only a cocaine  processing and marketing country, but also a coca grower as big  as Bolivia.</p>

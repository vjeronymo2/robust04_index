			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO HOLIDAY FROM PAIN ON SKID ROW;  </P> <P> THANKSGIVING: SOME ANTICIPATE A TIME OF EXTENDED GENEROSITY, BUT MOST TRY TO  AVOID THE MISERY OF BEING AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  </P> <P> Homeless Rick is very thankful today. He figures to be so busy helping others  enjoy their holiday that he won't have time to think about how miserable his  Thanksgiving truly is.  </P> <P> Rick, who declined to give his real name, is a clerk at the Midnight Mission in  downtown Skid Row. He knows today will be frantic with phone calls, visits from  more advantaged people bringing in meals and money for the homeless, and the  continual line of men, women and children filing into the mission for a  traditional turkey dinner.  </P> <P> Keeping busy, Rick reasons, is a way of forgetting about the pain he feels  because he is destined to spend the holidays on "the Row," away from his family  and his seven children.  </P> <P> "I used to say that the holidays were just another day, but deep down inside, I  know it's different," said the 43-year-old, his thin, freshly scrubbed face  etched with sadness as he sat in an office at the mission. "That's the way a  lot of people down here feel. They try to pretend it's just another day.  </P> <P> "Because . . . what is Thanksgiving or Christmas when you're living in a box?"  </P> <P> Rick's sentiments echoed the feelings of many denizens of Skid Row, of the  estimated 5,000 people who make their home on the cold, hard pavement and of  the social workers and store owners who cater to their needs. The holiday  season, they said, is a time for most Skid Row regulars to block out memories  of families left behind, prosperous jobs, good times with friends. Some may  visit relatives who live close by for dinner, but others will stay away out of  embarrassment or fear.  </P> <P> "Yeah, the holidays make you want to be home," said Benjamin Cook, 30, who has  been on Skid Row since January. His family lives just miles away in  South-Central Los Angeles, but he will not be paying them a visit today or on  Christmas.  </P> <P> "They're very close, but very far away, if you catch what I'm saying," he said,  running his hand through his uncombed hair and eating soggy oatmeal out of a  Styrofoam cup on Los Angeles Street.  </P> <P> Von Weems, 38, a longtime Skid Row resident, has a different outlook on the  question of family.  </P> <P> "My family's right here," he said determinedly, sitting on the steps of a  building next to the Union Rescue Mission. He motioned to three figures on the  ground who were covered with blankets. The blankets heaved deeply and regularly  in a rhythm of sleep.  </P> <P> "This is our family," Weems said with a slight slur. "We take care of each  other. We enjoy what we have."  </P> <P> It is possible to find along the bleak alleys and sidewalks that constitute the  downtown Skid Row district a sense of seasonal optimism. Not unlike the  retailers who anticipate hordes of holiday shoppers each year, Skid Row  occupants look forward to a month of free handouts and more productive  panhandling. Social workers anticipate an uptick in donations. Preachers expect  more payoff from their sermons to the down-and-outers.  </P> <P> "The mood is real high, and there's more togetherness among all the cliques,  y'understand," said one gravel-voiced, five-year Skid Row veteran, who just  referred to himself as Pete.  </P> <P> "All the alcoholics are more together, all the dopeheads are more together.  There's none of that down-and-out stuff." In addition, Pete added as he smiled  through gapped teeth, "you also see more bottles on the street at this time  than at any other time of year."  </P> <P> Willie Davis, 41, could hardly contain his excitement: "All these people will  come here, handing out $20 bills. I'll get all this new stuff, new clothing,  new blankets. I like this time of year. I even put two Christmas trees in the  street last year."  </P> <P> Others were more jaded.  </P> <P> "What the holidays really mean down here," said Mike Neely, head of the  Homeless Outreach Program, a grass-roots organization that helps transients  find shelter and clothing, "is that a large group of 'home' people get to come  down there and feel good about themselves. There's all sorts of media  attention, news cameras, radio-thons. Then after the holidays, it's all over.  But these people who live down here have the same problems Jan. 15 that they  had on Thanksgiving Day."  </P> <P> He did not attempt to hide the edge in his voice.  </P> <P> Still, some people said, the season can bring life-changing inspiration. "Some  feel they want to make amends with their families, start all over," said David  Bryant, a consultant with the city's Community Development Department Homeless  Services Coordination Unit.  </P> <P> But the blessings of the season must be weighed against the dreariness of  everyday existence. When pressed, most people on the Row seemed to agree that  Thanksgiving and Christmas are just as hard as any other day -- except that the  food is better and there's more of it.  </P> <P> As Clancy Imislund, managing director of the Midnight Mission, put it: "The  mood just does not change dramatically during this time of year. Skid Row is  not a place, but a state of mind."  </P> <P> A Tuesday walk along Skid Row revealed little sense of a pending holiday. It  was early morning and the soggy remains of a rainstorm the night before were  still in evidence. Dirty, ragged blankets that had been soaked were drying on  fences in front of parking lots and missions. Many people who had not found any  sort of covering sat idly against a wall near Crocker and 5th streets, heads  bowed toward their damp clothes. The nippy air was filled with cigarette smoke.  </P> <P> In front of the Union Rescue Mission, five men sat on boxes, playing a raucous  game of dominoes. One of them, James Campbell, 23, said this would be his first  holiday on Skid Row.  </P> <P> "I thank God I'm here to witness Thanksgiving, but it's going to be very hard  for me," said Campbell. He said that he's only been in town a month, and that  he has been trying to make connections in the music industry to sell some  lyrics he's written.  </P> <P> He said the companionship on the Row was no substitute for his real family.  </P> <P> "I don't even know these guys," he said, pointing to his playing partners.  </P></p>

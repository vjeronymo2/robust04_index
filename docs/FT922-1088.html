			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Jobs: The two-way value of personal loyalty - Why top managers' hankering to have faithful retainers could be a useful lever for candidates board director interviewing you for the key job in his domain looks at his watch. Although you feel you have put yourself across adequately, you clearly haven't scored a triumph. Moreover the big-company post is so attractive that, being a touch surprised to have got on the short-list, you are sure there'll be other contenders whose qualifications are stronger. Now, with the director about to close the proceedings, it is make-or-break. You have time to speak only one more sentence. What is it to be? Well, the strict truth is that if the Jobs column really knew the answer, it would be too rich to bother raising the question. But there is one formula which I suspect might well turn the trick in the circumstances outlined. It is to say matter-of-factly during the parting handshake: 'By the way, I'd like you to know that if I'm appointed, my first loyalty will always be to you personally.' The suggested ploy originates with Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer, of Stanford Business School in the US, whose book Managing with Power* was discussed in this *Harvard Business School Press, (ISBN 0-87584-314-X) Dollars 24.95. corner of the FT nine weeks ago. As I said then, it is the best guide to organisational politicking that luck has yet brought me. Among the many aspects of the craft the author covers is the politics of recruiting. And one of the things he says about same is: 'Although we often like to think of the hiring and promotion process as based primarily on merit, ambitious managers understand quite well the necessity of en-suring that the organization is liberally salted with people who are obliged to them.' Indeed, recognition of that necessity was apparently a key principle behind the post-war rise of the finance division of General Motors to rule over the whole organisation. Called the principle of promotion of the unobvious choice, it entailed 'promoting someone not yet regarded as a contender for the post. Doing so not only puts 'your man' in position, but it earns for you his undying loyalty because he owes his corporate life to you.' True, as the professor says, such blatantly political devices are rarely acknowledged openly. Nevertheless the advantage of being surrounded by personally loyal satellites is no doubt prized by many if not most high-ranked managers, in big outfits at least. So despite having not myself tested the interview-ending formula (I've stumbled across it too late in life to do so), my guess is that it might come in handy for job-seekers in the sort of make-or-break position described. If any of them cares to try it, I'll be eager to learn of the result. NOW, while we're discussing the ambitions of high-flying managers, to the table below which sheds light on which of the so-called functions of business carries most kudos in different countries. The figures are drawn from the latest cross-Europe survey by the Wyatt management consultancy's branch in Brussels. For each of the 10 countries covered, the table ranks the directors in charge of the various functional departments by the money value that companies evidently put on them. The basis of the ranking is the gross pay received in cash - salary plus bonuses and so on - of a typical chief executive, which is indicated at the top in italics. The gross cash pay of the different directors is then shown as a percentage of the relevant chief executive's figure. As may be seen, there seem to be considerable variances from land to land in the differential chiefs enjoy over the generality of the managers one notch below. Switzerland apparently puts the highest value on departmental directors as a whole, and France the lowest - in line with other evidence that, despite its famous revolution, the democratic spirit is less potent there than in most other western countries. Where the separate functions are concerned, the French are like the British and Irish in giving pride of place to the heads of finance. But the production director comes top in four cases - Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Italy prefers the director of research and development, Spain the data-processing chief, and Sweden the director of materials. FINALLY, to the job of spearheading an international spirits-distiller's business growth in the former Soviet Union. The post is offered through headhunter Alan Rundle (Rundle Brownsword, 17 London End, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire HP9 2HN; tel 0494 676264, fax 0494 670283) who may not name the employer. He therefore promises to abide by applicant's requests not to be named to his client at this stage. While already exporting brands to the Commonwealth of Independent States, the company wants a country manager to run its business there and greatly increase market share. Candidates need success in managing overseas consumer-brands marketing operations for well known companies. Russian speakers preferred. Base probably Moscow. Salary negotiable around the UK equivalent of Pounds 45,000, plus full expatriate-type perks.</p>

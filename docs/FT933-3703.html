			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Violence flares on eve of Mideast peace agreement: Eight die in clashes as Israel and PLO prepare to sign accord in Washington today BLOODY clashes erupted in the Gaza Strip and Israel yesterday as Palestinians opposing the historic peace agreement, due to be signed today in Washington, stepped up their violent protests. At least eight people died in one of the worst days of Arab-Israeli clashes in recent years as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, flew to the US to witness the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The violence has exposed the deep divisions among Palestinians inside the occupied territories and within the PLO itself over the agreement, which may threaten the stability of the rapidly unfolding peace process. Hours before Mr Rabin left Jerusalem, three Israeli soldiers were shot dead in Gaza by Islamic fundamentalists opposed to peace with Israel. The military wing of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, which has vowed to keep up the armed struggle against 'Zionists', claimed responsibility for the ambush on an army jeep, in which the attackers fled with two rifles. Scores of heavily armed border police and soldiers barricaded roads and sealed off areas of Gaza city yesterday during a fruitless hunt for the killers. In other incidents in Gaza, three rejectionist Arabs were killed, bringing the weekend Palestinian death toll to at least five after demonstrations across the territories in favour as well as against the peace deal. In Israel, an Arab stabbed to death an Israeli bus driver and was then shot dead by a soldier on a bus travelling between Ashdod and Ashkelon. Unrest in the territories has been ignited by angry denunciations from Palestinian factions abroad and by resignations from the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Ten Damascus-based Palestinian factions, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the leftist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, have vowed to sabotage the accord. The fundamentalist Islamic Holy War-Jerusalem said yesterday it was quitting the PLO's parliament-in-exile and the 100-member Central Council, the first faction to withdraw formally from the institutions. Iranian-backed fundamentalist groups in the territories and in Lebanon have joined secular political organisations in denouncing the agreement and trying to forge a broad front against it. The opposition has, however, pledged not to battle against Palestinians but to intensify the onslaught against Israelis. In Ramallah, on the west Bank, Israeli soldiers shot dead two PFLP supporters protesting against the agreement. Rejectionist Palestinians say the peace agreement falls far short of Palestinian demands for an independent state, control over occupied Arab east Jerusalem and the right of return of thousands of Palestinians exiled during the 46-year Arab-Israeli conflict. They have called for a general strike throughout the occupied territories today to protest against the signing ceremony. As Mr Arafat left north Africa, his moderate Fatah group was under severe criticism from hardline Arab groups, but he defended the accord as a step on the road to the establishment of a Palestinian state.

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British industrial fishing plan under fire The UK government came under fierce attack yesterday for inviting applications from fishing vessels to catch capelin, a small fish eaten by endangered stocks of cod, off Greenland. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations called the decision 'astonishing' when stocks of white fish had reached virtual collapse. 'This decision is a signal to all that the UK supports industrial fishing and is in direct contradiction of the government's public stance against it,' said Mr Richard Banks, the federation's chief executive. 'The wrong signals will now be sent to the European Commission and other industrial fishing nations, such as Denmark and Norway, that the minister (Mr Michael Jack) is the champion of industrial fishing.' The federation said that industrial fishing was widely condemned in the UK because it denied feedstock to fish and birds and caught young fish before they had a chance to breed. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds called the move 'a potential disaster for wildlife'. It said that Greenland cod stocks were at an all-time low. 'The government should not gamble with long-term fish stocks and important wildlife populations for short-term commercial gain,' said Dr Patricia Bradley, RSPB aquatic unit manager. Mr Jack, fisheries minister, announced the decision last week, saying it was in response to a request from the fleet. He said the quota for capelin was based on the best available scientific evidence. 'There is no question of over-exploitation as the EU's share of the fishery for 1993 was not taken,' he said.</p>

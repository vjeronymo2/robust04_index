			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Riding the business rollercoaster SUSAN JACOBS gathered her disbelieving workforce around her last Thursday as base rates hit 15 per cent and punched the new cost of money into her desktop computer. 'Their eyeballs were coming out of their heads,' she says. 'Their first concern was the impact on their mortgages, which was horrific. The effect on the business would have been terrible and immediate, but I knew interest rates like that just could not stick.' Miss Jacobs is the managing director and part-owner of Trident Tubes, a small, north-London-based company specialising in the repair and maintenance of scaffolding. Jokes about shoring up the economy have been only too easy in the past week - but she says a sense of humour has been essential. For the past seven days she has joined countless companies on the interest-rate 'big dipper', holding on tight and praying that the ride would end safely. With interest rates moving up from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and then down to 9 per cent, she says she is in no hurry to repeat the experience. She is naturally pleased that interest rates have ended lower than they started, but says it is too early to calculate the damage such turmoil may have inflicted on fragile business confidence. Miss Jacobs, previously a financial consultant, started her company in 1989 when she tried to get some aluminium welding work done on her Triumph Trident motorcycle. The prices quoted suggested the work was highly profitable and she decided to open an aluminium scaffolding repair business. She has no regrets, although the company has been suffering as scaffolding hire companies - which are her core customers - have suffered in the recession and cut costs. That has often meant them carrying out their own repair work. Some of Trident's customers have gone bust, although the company has managed to keep bad debts to an absolute minimum. But in recent weeks - before last week's traumatic events - turnover had started to rise as painters and decorators won more business. The beginnings of recovery, she says, were in the air. Then came Black Wednesday: 'Fifteen per cent interest rates were obviously not sustainable. Even so, we were preparing to work ungodly hours to muster what business we could in the hope of at least standing still.' Now Miss Jacobs hopes that the lowest interest rates for more than four years will further stimulate business recovery. But she wants the government to keep an eye on inflation and to rule out big cuts in interest rates. 'We tried that in the late 1980s and look where it got us,' says Miss Jacobs. 'We do not need another boom. Business needs sensible, well-paced reductions in the cost of money and, above all, continuing stability.' She thinks cheaper money will help to maintain the investment levels needed to keep the workshop efficient. There is also a chance that it will bring nearer the day when she takes on one or two additional employees. Miss Jacobs expects to end this week in a more optimistic mood than last. 'But business is still not sure what will happen next week, never mind next month,' she adds. 'I expect conditions to remain erratic for the next few months at least. We will have to watch and wait. Perhaps after Christmas things will be more clear.'</p>

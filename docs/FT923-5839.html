			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: End of the road or separate route to recovery? - As Cowie's bid for Henlys nears its close, Maggie Urry looks at how it progressed BY LUNCHTIME next Tuesday the fate of Henlys Group, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, will have been decided. It is facing a Pounds 32.1m hostile bid from T Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor dealer. Last night Cowie could claim support from holders of 28.4 per cent of Henlys shares, and it looked a closer run fight than it had a week ago. At 1.30pm yesterday Cowie owned or had acceptances in respect of 21.4 per cent of Henlys shares. Of these, 3 per cent were shares Cowie had bought in the market. Another 7 per cent were held by Mr David Matthews, the former chairman and chief executive of Henlys who left last November before the group announced a Pounds 6.8m loss. His associate, Mr Peter Cundill, with 4.9 per cent, is also thought to have accepted. Yesterday afternoon Cowie's brokers again went into the market and took its stake to 9.9 per cent. Following an increase in the terms two weeks ago, Cowie's bid of 7 shares for 10 Henlys, or 1 share plus 40p cash for two Henlys, is worth 84.7p or 80.5p with Cowie's shares closing yesterday at 121p, up 1p. Henlys closed at 66p, up 1p. Throughout the offer period, Cowie shares have been falling, reducing the value of the bid. Since the increase Henlys shares have stood below the implied value. Some Henlys holders have said that a larger cash element would have been more persuasive. The conduct of the bid has also worked against Cowie. It employed Noble Grossart, the Edinburgh merchant bank which is not often seen in the cut and thrust of hostile bids. Cowie has been forced to make a series of clarifications to remarks made and documents published. Further, in meetings with key institutional investors, Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, seems to have come across well. Many institutions have an inclination to side with existing management, so long as it seems competent. The bid came at a bad time for Henlys. On June 24 it had warned that problems in its coach building business would cause an interim loss, an announcement which sliced 22p off its share price that day, cutting it to 55p. Five days later Cowie launched its bid, then worth 73p a share. Henlys current configuration is the result of a takeover in 1989 by Plaxton, a bus and coach group, of the original Henlys, a motor trader. Although Plaxton was the buyer, the name was changed back to Henlys earlier this year. While the motor side has remained profitable, the bus and coach business plunged into losses. The group lost Pounds 6.8m pre-tax in 1991. Mr Matthews left in November, following two other directors, including the finance director, who left earlier in the year. Mr Robert Wood, now chief executive of Henlys, who had come from the original Henlys business, has claimed throughout the bid that the board is essentially new. Cowie has repeatedly called this a 'smokescreen' saying that most of the directors had been with the group, if not in their current positions, for longer. It is this management which is attempting to tackle the severe overcapacity in the coach and bus building business. Last year it cut its manufacturing units from four to one, but even so there was not enough business to fill the remaining plant in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. At the same time, Henlys had introduced a new range of coaches, and teething troubles made an impact on profits. This looked a weak position from which to mount a defence. Henlys has, however, put up a surprisingly spirited one. Having made a profits warning, Henlys announced within a few weeks orders and deals which would keep the Scarborough plant busy for the rest of this year and much of the next two. Further, Henlys said it had identified and started making cost cuts which would save Pounds 5m a year by early 1993. Suddenly, analysts could start pencilling in profits next year from the bus and coach business, which includes distribution. Cowie has attacked these orders, saying they must have been won at lower margins and criticising the use of expensive management consultants to achieve the cost savings. The discussions over the Scarborough plant have distracted the argument from the issue of the merger of the two companies' motor businesses. Cowie claims there would be significant benefits from putting the two motor businesses together. Mr Wood doubts that these would be achieved and also says that sales of dealerships would be forced on Cowie as the combined group would have 11 Ford dealerships and Ford limits any one company to eight. Cowie's response is that the industry is changing, following a Monopolies Commission investigation, and that the Ford limit could loosen. While Henlys is forecasting a loss of just under Pounds 1m for the current year, analysts are looking for a jump into profits in 1993. They are expecting Cowie to make Pounds 25m pre-tax in 1992, nearly regaining the 1988 level. If Henlys remains independent it will be because shareholders have marked it down as a recovery play. Indeed many bought shares earlier this year, at prices up to 90p, on that hope. As one said, 'why accept the bid and have that recovery diluted?'. If it does escape, Henlys will have to live up to the faith invested in it.</p>

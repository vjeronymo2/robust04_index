			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By the authority vested in me as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, under sections 1323 and 1326 of the Federal Housing Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543 and 4546, I have determined that certain information, identified in the attached Exhibit A, contained in the loan-level data files which were submitted by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as required under the Interim Housing Goals, should be deemed proprietary information. Accordingly, under the authority of section 1326 of the Act, I hereby order that this information be withheld from public disclosure at this time. The basis and terms of this Temporary Order are set forth fully below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Housing Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, enacted as Title XIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), codified generally at 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4561 (``the Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  requires the Secretary to establish and monitor the performance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in meeting annual goals for mortgage purchases on housing for low- and moderate-income families, housing located in central cities, and special affordable housing,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. On October 13, 1993, the Secretary published the housing goals and requirements for the GSEs' mortgage purchases for the 1993&hyph;94 transition period in Notices of Interim Housing Goals (``the Notices''). 58 FR 53047&hyph;53096. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Unless otherwise specified, all section cites herein are cites to the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. Sections 1331&hyph;1336 of that Act are codified at 12 U.S.C. 4561&hyph;66. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Notices, the Secretary required the GSEs to submit certain data on their mortgage purchases by March 1, 1994. This information is to assist the Secretary in monitoring the GSEs' performance under the goals and to satisfy the requirements of subsections 309(m)&hyph;(n) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12 U.S.C. 1723a(m)&hyph;(n), and subsections 307(e)&hyph;(f) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act, 12 U.S.C. 1456(e)&hyph;(f). Sections 309(m) and 307(e) under these Acts mandate that the GSEs collect, maintain and provide to the Secretary data relating to their mortgages on single family and multifamily housing and sections 309(n) and 307(f) require that the GSEs report aggregate information on their mortgages to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Notices, the Secretary required each GSE to provide information in two forms_loan-level data files that provide detailed information on each mortgage loan purchased by the GSE, and data reports that aggregate data on mortgage loans in various ways. In addition, the Secretary required each GSE to provide a written report discussing its performance under the housing goals. The information required in the loan-level data files includes detailed information on individual loans purchased by the GSEs including: The borrower(s') annual income, race, and gender; census tract; other geographic identifiers; loan-to-value ratio; number of units; owner-occupancy status; and other details on the mortgage, the property, and the borrower(s). The information required for the data reports includes aggregate data concerning: The amount of mortgage purchases that qualify towards each housing goal, classified by number of units and dollar volume; mortgagors' income; race; location of property; and various other categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Requirements Regarding Proprietary Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1323 of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543, provides that the Secretary shall make available to the public the data submitted by the GSEs in the reports required under section 309(m) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and section 307(e) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> except  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the data that the Secretary determines by regulation or order pursuant to section 1326, 12 U.S.C. 4546, is proprietary. Section 1323(b)(2) of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 4543(b)(2), specifically provides that the Secretary may not restrict access to data consisting of income, census tract location, race, and gender of mortgagors of single family properties. Section 1326 provides that the Secretary may by regulation or order provide that certain information shall be treated as proprietary and, pending the issuance of a final decision on the matter, the material may not be disclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under Exemption 4, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), allows confidential business information to be protected from disclosure, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, forbids Government officers and employees from releasing trade secret and other confidential business information. Executive Order No. 12,600, 3 CFR at 235 (1988), requires that agencies notify submitters of confidential business information of requests under FOIA for such information and that agencies afford submitters an opportunity to comment on release of the requested information. If an agency determines to release notwithstanding a submitted objection, the Executive Order requires that the agency notify the submitter reasonably prior to release. The President of the United States, by memorandum, dated October 4, 1993, to Heads of Departments and Agencies, emphasized the importance of public disclosures under FOIA and an implementing memorandum from the Attorney General, attached to the President's memorandum, instructed agencies to disclose information unless disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. The President's and the Attorney General's memoranda do not alter Executive Order No. 12,600. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

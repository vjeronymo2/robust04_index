			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Both banks have their roots in Birmingham - The Battle for Midland BOTH LLOYDS and Midland have their roots firmly embedded in the industrial heritage of Birmingham and both played important roles in the industrial development of the Midlands. Mr Carl Chinn, community historian at Birmingham University, argued that Lloyds rather than Midland had the strongest historical identity in the City: 'I doubt if most people would know that the Midland started here but children are taught about the Lloyd family at school and know about the beginnings of Lloyds bank.' In 1765, Mr Sampson Lloyd, the Welsh Quaker iron-master, together with Mr John Taylor, a button-maker, founded Taylors and Lloyds bank, the forerunner of Lloyds, in Birmingham, and started a Midlands tradition of banks working closely with the early industrialists. Mr Chinn said: 'People think of Birmingham as an industrial community which it is, but the industry could not have survived without the provision of capital. Birmingham was a great banking centre and local people put up the money to make it happen.' Only later, he said, did the image of northern industrialists divorced from City bankers develop as London became established as the centre of banking. 'In the early 1800s there was not the split between industry and capital that there is today,' he said. Midland was founded in 1836 by Mr Charles Geach, a former Bank of England employee who opened the first headquarters in Union Street, Birmingham. Mr Geach once rode through rioters to get help from the military when Birmingham's financial district was threatened by a mob. The big difference between Midland and Lloyds was that Lloyds was for many years a family partnership whereas Midland was a company owned by shareholders from the start. Joint stock banks, as they were then called, were allowed by Parliament in 1826. Midland still has strong ties with Birmingham where it found many of its most loyal industrial account holders. Mr Edwin Green, the Midland Bank archivist said: 'It is remarkable that two of the largest clearing banks originated in Birmingham. There was a close relationship and it continued in our case. Our customers were often our shareholders as well and it meant there was a long loyalty from the 1830s onwards.' Though Birmingham retains its importance to the Midland, Sheffield is now its most important administrative centre. Since moving many of its head office functions to Sheffield about 20 years ago the bank has been one of the city's biggest private employers. Some 2,000 staff work at Griffin House, Sheffield, which houses the bank's marketing operations, information technology, mortgage processing, financial services and a number of international operations. Many of the Sheffield staff are now uncertain about their futures after Lloyds' stated commitment to streamline administrative operations if it is successful in its takeover plans. A large proportion of staff have cheap mortgages which would be increased to normal interest rates if they were to be made redundant.</p>

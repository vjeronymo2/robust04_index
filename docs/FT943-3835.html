			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Bolivian utility prepares to erect a milestone - International offerings The Cochabamba Light and Power Company (ELFEC) could be a surprising addition to the London Stock Exchange in November if plans to list the Bolivian electricity company's shares go ahead as planned. The utility, valued at about Dollars 33m, is the first from Latin America to seek a London listing in 'living memory,' according to the stock exchange. More importantly it underlines a significant wider trend. After a lull earlier this year Latin American companies - in sectors as diverse as telecommunications, retailing and electricity - are again raising capital from international investors. And increasingly, the investment banks co-ordinating the issues are looking beyond Mexico, Chile and Argentina - their favourite economies in recent years - for potential candidates. As recently as 1990 it was virtually impossible for Latin American companies to raise international equity finance. Interest first took off with the privatisation of Mexico's telecommunication company, Telmex, in 1991 and last year Mexico and Argentina, another economy undergoing radical liberal reforms, dominated the continent's new international issues, accounting for over 80 per cent of the Dollars 6bn in international equity capital raised. This year successive rises in US interest rates stemmed the flow. The interest of US mutual funds, which fuelled growth in 1993, dropped off. A series of developments, including the assassination of presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, reminded investors of the political risks. Since July, however, interest has steadily returned. The governing party's success in last month's Mexican elections helped buoy sentiment. Governments in countries such as Peru have introduced liberal reforms with some success. Above all there are hopes that stabilisation can be achieved in Brazil following the fall in inflation after the introduction in July of the Real currency plan. The plan's architect and former finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is widely tipped to win next month's presidential election. Reflecting the new confidence, a string of new companies has come to the market in recent weeks. By the end of July, Latin American companies had raised a total of Dollars 3bn from international investors. At 47, the number of issues compared with 52 for the whole of last year. Brazilian issues such as Usiminas, the steel group, are among the country's first to come to the market for more than two years. Several Mexican issues are said to be in the pipeline. A number of Peruvian issues, of which Banco Wiese, the country's second largest bank, is one of the first, are also on the cards. Bankers say many more smaller companies are seeking international equity. The limit above which Chilean companies were allowed to seek international capital was this year reduced from Dollars 50m to Dollars 25m. 'You are adding markets and broadening them within certain countries,' says a New York investment banker, who has been involved in several issues. Cochabamba is described as a 'Latin American Manweb,' by Mr Peter Earl of Fieldstone of Private Capital Corporation, the investment bank helping co-ordinate the listing and offer for sale. He says the issue will be one of the first to be listed in La Paz. It follows the successful US capital-raising exercise last year for the Bolivian Electric Energy Company. A telling sign of the pace of activity is the competition among investment bankers for the mandates. Fees have fallen sharply, especially in Brazil.</p>

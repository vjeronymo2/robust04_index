			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YULETIME COOKIES EVOKE MEMORIES OF HOLIDAYS PAST  </P> <P> Does just the mention of baking Christmas cookies evoke fond memories -- going  all the way back to early childhood? It's almost possible to smell the  wonderful aromas, hear the laughter and taste the freshly baked pastries.  </P> <P> Typically this was a project involving the whole family. Small children began  by helping with the decorating, then progressed to forming the cookies and  finally preparing the dough. Such traditions remain as young adults leave to  establish homes and families.  </P> <P> So do some of the favorite recipes. But also add new ones coming from friends,  cookbooks, newspapers or magazines. It's part of the fun to add a new variety  or two of cookies each year.  </P> <P> The rich dough of Walnut Dessert Cookies bakes to a crispy shortbread. Enjoy  the cookies plain or in a sandwich with a filling of ground walnuts and  raspberry or apricot jam. Cocoa Glaze adds a delicious finishing touch.  </P> <P> Lime Wreath Cookies, with festive color and the tang of fresh lime juice, are  equally ideal for home entertaining or gift giving. The dough is rolled, then  formed into the Yuletide shape. Lime Sugar and red cinnamon candies garnish the  wreaths.  </P> <P> "Better Home and Gardens Cookies for Christmas" (Meredith Corp., 1985: $6.95)  is the source for Candy Window Sugar Cookies. This cookbook has a myriad of  other recipes, as well as suggestions for gift giving, mailing and baking tips.  </P> <P> Two additional recipes to enhance this year's collection of holiday cookies  include Almond-Fruit Slices and Crandy Canes. Almonds, candied fruits, raisins  and spices add up to a rich but not-too-sweet version of the ever-popular  icebox cookies. Cranberries, raisins, nuts and honey become the filling for the  cane-shaped confections.  </P> <P> WALNUT DESSERT COOKIES  </P> <P> Walnuts  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/3 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup sifted flour  </P> <P> Walnut Filling  </P> <P> Cocoa Glaze  </P> <P> Finely grind 1 cup walnuts in food processor or blender and set aside. Cream  butter with sugar and vanilla. Gradually blend in flour, then walnuts. Chill  dough for easier rolling.  </P> <P> Roll out onto floured board to about 1/4-inch thickness and cut with 2 1/2-inch  cutter. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes,  until edges brown very lightly.  </P> <P> Using broad spatula, remove to wire rack to cool. When cold, place cookies  together in pairs, using about 2 teaspoons Walnut Filling for each. Spread  cooled glaze over half of top cookie. Garnish with large piece of walnut. Makes  1 dozen filled cookies.  </P> <P> Variation: Serve cookies plain or dip halfway in Cocoa Glaze.  </P> <P> Walnut Filling  </P> <P> 1/2 cup walnuts  </P> <P> 1/4 cup raspberry or apricot jam  </P> <P> Finely grind walnuts in food processor or blender. Combine with jam.  </P> <P> Cocoa Glaze  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon boiling water  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar  </P> <P> Stir together butter, cocoa and water.

Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or freeze 1 hour.  </P> <P> Divide dough in quarters. Work with 1/4 at time, refrigerating remaining dough.  Cut each quarter into 16 equal pieces. Roll each on lightly floured surface  into 6-inch rope. Place on greased baking sheet forming wreath with ends  extending 1/2 inch from loop.  </P> <P> Brush with reserved egg white. Sprinkle with Lime Sugar and place red cinnamon  candy at intersection of each loop. Bake at 350 degrees 10 to 12 minutes. Makes  about 5 dozen.  </P> <P> Lime Sugar  </P> <P> 1/3 cup sugar  </P> <P> 2 to 3 teaspoons grated lime zest  </P> <P> Green food coloring, optional  </P> <P> Combine sugar, lime zest and few drops of green food coloring.  </P> <P> CANDY WINDOW SUGAR COOKIES  </P> <P> Rolled Sugar Cookies  </P> <P> 3 ounces clear hard candy of various colors  </P> <P> Prepare dough for Rolled Sugar Cookies. Roll out and cut into desired shapes.  Place on foil-lined baking sheet. Cut out one or more small shapes in middle of  each cookie using tiny hors d'oeuvre cutters, thimble or sharp knife.  </P> <P> Finely crush candy into pieces by placing in plastic bag and pounding with  rolling pin, flat edge of meat mallet or hammer. Spoon enough candy into each  cutout to fill to level of dough. If using more than one color per hole, mix  colors as little as possible.  </P> <P> Bake as directed for Rolled Sugar Cookies. Peel off foil and cool.  </P> <P> Note: To make cookies into tree ornaments, use drinking straw to make hole in  cookie before baking. If holes close during baking, repeat process while  cookies are still soft. After cooling, run ribbon, yarn or thread through holes  to form hanger.  </P> <P> Rolled Sugar Cookies  </P> <P> 2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/3 cup shortening  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Stir together flour, baking powder and salt.

Cream  butter well with powdered sugar. Add salt, nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon. Beat in  egg. Add flour and mix to stiff dough. Stir in chopped nuts, fruits and  raisins.  </P> <P> Divide dough in half and shape each portion into 9-inch roll, 2 inches in  diameter.

Heat milk and butter in saucepan until milk is warm (butter does not need  to melt). Add to flour mixture, along with eggs. Blend at low speed with  electric mixer until moist, then beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  </P> <P> Stir in remaining flour by hand to make stiff dough. Turn out on floured board  and knead until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl. Cover. Let rise in  warm place until doubled.  </P> <P> Turn out on board and knead again. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece  into 18x15-inch rectangle and spread each piece with half filling. Starting at  15 inch side, fold dough over filling 1/3 way up. Fold dough down 1/3 over  first fold, to yield 2 strips 15x6 inches.  </P> <P> Cut each strip into 15 (1-inch) strips. Twist each strip and pinch ends to  seal.

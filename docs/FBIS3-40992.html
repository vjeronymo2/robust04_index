The Russian Army Is Preparing To Evacuate  Missile Troop Officers"]    [Text] The joint Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement of 14  January on the terms for the abolition of the "Ukrainian"  nuclear weapons, signed in Moscow by the three presidents, has  apparently proved not more long-lasting than previous such  accords. A week after the ink had dried on the Moscow  declaration, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry began, without any  coordination with Moscow, an operation of actually seizing the  strategic nuclear weapons.    On 21 January Army General Lieutenant Vladimir Mikhtyuk,  commander of the 43d Missile Army, and also the commanders of  the 46th (Pervomayskaya) and 19th (Khmelnitskaya) missile  divisions were summoned to Kiev to a session of the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry Collegium "on matters of military discipline  and training." The army commander reported this to Moscow, to  the Main Command of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), because  under an order that has been in effect for 33 years, the SRF  army or division commander may not leave his unit without  permission from the SRF commander in chief. In Kiev, however,  the generals were suddenly ordered to swear the Ukrainian oath  of allegiance. Gen. Mikhtyuk and Nikolay Filatov, commander of  the 46th Division, under what one of the participants in the  conference described as tough pressure, swore the Ukrainian  oath. Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th division, refused.    After that the 43d Missile Army was actually placed outside  the SRF Main Command's operational control. General Karimov has  been removed from the post of division commander and is to fly  to Moscow within the next few days. Today or tomorrow a new,  "Ukrainian" commander will arrive at the 19th Missile Division  who will be appointed by the Ukrainian defense minister without  any coordination with Moscow. The SRF Command stated that they  do not even know the new commander's name. Prior to that,  during the last two years, all cadre reshuffles in the missile  troops in Ukraine were made only by a joint order after they  were coordinated in Moscow and Kiev.    On 22 January the Ukrainian defense minister signed Order  001  (classified as top secret) whereby the troops of the 43d Army  must be prepared as of 1 February to begin removing the nuclear  ammunition from the depots of the 19th and 46th divisions (all  in all, 490 units) to "S" installations, from where Russian  specialists were withdrawn last year and where the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry has deployed its own nuclear units, manned  partly by officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian  Defense Ministry who stayed in Ukraine and partly by reserve  officers. Colonel General Igor Smirnov, SRF commander in chief,  sent a coded telegram to the Ukrainian defense minister  expressing in a polite form his professional concern over the  situation, but has not received any answer yet.    The SRF Main Command is currently making preparations for an  urgent evacuation to Russia of all missile officers who refuse  to swear the Ukrainian oath. According to SRF Main Command  estimates, between 40 and 50 percent of the officers will leave.  The divisions will become combat-incapable, the combat duty  system will be disrupted, and political confrontation in missile  unit crews between "pro-Ukrainian" and "pro-Russian" officers is  possible.    Up until now Russia has been rendering the 43d Army  technical  assistance in maintaining its entire extremely complex strategic  missile systems while officers have been undergoing regular  retraining within the SRF framework. Now supplies and technical  assistance for the army have been stopped. The Russian military  is no longer in control of the situation. It believes that it  has done everything possible within its jurisdiction and that  now the problem of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons will again have  to be decided by politicians in Moscow, Kiev, and Washington.</p>

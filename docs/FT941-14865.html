			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rubbermaid in Asia Pacific venture Rubbermaid, the Ohio-based plastic and rubber consumer products group, yesterday signed a joint venture agreement with Richell, a privately-owned Toyama-based company and one of Japan's leading manufacturers of household products. Richell will put its home and leisure products division, with a Dollars 60m turover, into the venture, leaving the parent to run a garden business. Rubbermaid will initially hold 40 per cent, with the option of lifting its stake to 51 per cent by the year-end. Mr Lawrence Blackburn, vice-president of the international household products division, said such a move was highly likely. Rubbermaid's acquisition is part of a strategy to increase overseas sales from its present 15 per cent of turnover to 25 per cent by the end of the decade. As part of this strategy, the company formed a joint venture in 1990 with DSM of the Netherlands, and Mr Blackburn said it was looking to expand in the Pacific rim and Latin America.</p>

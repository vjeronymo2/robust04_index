			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade agenda With the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, Mr Clinton has finished the trade agenda he inherited. This is a great achievement. But now he must draw up his own. The signs so far are worrying. He seems to be dedicating his country to distorting trade, where it will not merely end up restricting it. One part of the Clinton agenda already in effect is its approach to the opening of Japanese markets. The objective is right. But the administration is proposing the wrong instrument and the wrong procedures. American policymakers protest that the quantitative indicators they propose are neither targets nor of benefit to US exporters alone. They protest too much. The semiconductor pact has shown that an indicator is a target by another name. Similarly, the Japanese are bound to satisfy US producers first, because they are the most powerful. Since cartelisation and administrative guidance are needed for Japanese industry to deliver the demanded results, the US administration is also, in effect, calling for reregulation and deregulation at the same time. What is wrong with the chosen procedures is that they are unilateral. If US policymakers are confident they can prove that the Japanese cheat, they should bring their complaint to a multilateral forum. As it is, they have agreed to the creation of a world trade organisation within the Uruguay Round settlement, but are managing their most important trade relationship bilaterally. Faced with yet another contradiction, the Japanese must wonder why occidentals are so inscrutable. Distorting trade If this approach to Japan threatens to distort trade, the emerging US agenda for post-Uruguay Round trade negotiations may end up by simply restricting it. Mr Clinton suggested this week that environmental protection, anti-trust regulation and labour standards should be at the top of the agenda. International agreement on competition policy is needed, particularly if the cancer of anti-dumping is to be brought under control. But the other suggestions could easily become excuses for outright protectionism. The question of desirable standards is far more complex than most western lobbyists and governments are prepared to admit. Consider the environment. It is untrue that trade necessarily harms the environment, that all countries ought to have the same environmental regulations, that differences in environmental regulation are bound to create unfair competititive advantages, or even that the chief global environmental threat is posed by the development of poorer countries. US policymakers and lobbyists would do well to remember, for example, that the profligate 15 per cent of humanity emit far more greenhouse gases than do the remaining 85 per cent. Labour quagmire Labour standards are an equally sticky quagmire. It is not true, for example, that wages are low in China because of exploitation, but because the country remains dreadfully poor. It is not true that wages in high productivity factories should be far higher than elsewhere, because it is their profits that fuel rapid development. It is also not true that sensible minimum labour standards would eliminate the competitive threat supposedly posed by cheap labour. Remember, above all, that high minimum wages are of no benefit to the hundreds of millions of unemployed, while laws against child labour are of no help to children who would otherwise starve. The danger is that this supposedly high-minded agenda would punish the poor for their poverty. The side agreements on labour and the environment in Nafta do little to assuage that fear. Consider, for example, the fact that participants may not lower any standards, however inappropriate and costly they may turn out to be. Yet it is these agreements which are the model that the administration seems to want to spread throughout the world. What the Clinton administration's agenda lacks is a commitment to liberalisation. It seems to see the emerging global market economy as a threat to be curbed, not an opportunity to be exploited. International standards will form part of the trade agenda. But they must be only a small part.</p>

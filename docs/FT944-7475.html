			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming makes 6.3% midway advance Robert Fleming Holdings, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday reported a 6.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30, thus defying an industry trend which has seen earnings hit hard by turbulent stock and bond markets, writes Norma Cohen. Jardine Fleming, the group's 50 per cent owned Hong Kong-based investment banking subsidiary, contributed roughly 40 per cent of total profits, up from about a third in the same period last year, according to Mr John Manser, group chief executive. Pre-tax profits for the privately owned investment banking group rose to Pounds 97.4m (Pounds 91.6m) with the investment banking sector contributing a marginally lower Pounds 48.8m (Pounds 49.7m). However, Mr Manser warned that the group was unlikely to match the Pounds 71.8m earned in its investment banking division in the second half of last year, so that annual profits would be lower overall. 'I'd like to think we could, but in all honesty, it is not likely.' In its investment management business, the group earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 48.6m, up 16 per cent from Pounds 41.9m. Assets under management increased from Pounds 49.5bn to Pounds 50.2bn. This represents a net cash inflow of about Pounds 2bn, mostly from retail accounts in the UK, US and Europe, which was offset by a 3 per cent drop in the value of the investment portfolio. Mr Manser said that in Fleming Investment Management's core UK business 'we have staunched the flow' of pension clients who had been leaving the firm due to lacklustre investment performance, although it would be some time before significant new business was attracted. Fleming recently recruited a new chief executive to its asset management division, Mr Ken Inglis, who has made several internal changes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Main Points of </F> Statements Made by Delors Following His Visit to Poland"]    [Text] European Commission President Jacques Delors ended  his visit last week to Poland with a press conference in Warsaw,  during which he expressed his view on future relations between  the European Union and Poland, with a view to accession. His  statements are summarized below.    1. Accession is certain and must be prepared. "During these  meetings, I tried to clarify the European Union's [EU] position  and its confirmed political will to open its doors to other  countries, beginning with Poland, and especially to see how  entry can be best prepared. This was the meaning of my visit.  The inevitable preliminary is an institutional reform of the  EU. We have the same institutions as those handed down to us by  the Fathers of Europe, institutions which have no equivalent  anywhere in the world. As Twelve, their working has become  cumbersome; as Sixteen, it will be even more difficult. These  institutions must therefore be adapted to a European Union of  greater dimensions. This is not a pretext for not welcoming  Poland. It is inevitable. How will powers be determined in a  Union of 25 or 30? How can we reconcile the interests of a  country with 55 to 80 million inhabitants and another with  200,000 to 500,000 inhabitants? These are tremendous problems.  How can a country that will join the family not have a say in a  debate of such importance, which could condition for the next  century the future of Europe and its influence in the world?  This is why I have proposed that the Poles make their  contribution in this area, not to leave today's architects alone  while tomorrow the Poles will have to live in the house.  Meanwhile, Poland must continue adjusting to new conditions.  There is no need for new institutions to do so. We have all  the procedures we need to work together." Mentioning the  Baldwin Report -- which estimates Poland's entry as some 20  years away -- Mr. Delors commented: "My general impression is  more optimistic than the conclusion reached in this report."    2. Preparatory work, the case of agriculture. Mr. Delors  commented: "Now that the Europe Agreement has been set in  place, it must be made the principal means by which Poland is  prepared economically, financially and socially for joining the  European Union. This of course implies efforts on the Polish  side, but also adaptation on the part of the EU, notably the  PHARE [Program for the Economic Reconstruction of Poland and  Hungary] programme. An economic strategy for accession must be  agreed together. The Europe Agreement offers every possibility  for development of a strategy to prepare the Polish economy for  entry into the EC and for close political consultation. We now  must simply continue our work, develop it seriously and help  facilitate Poland's task. Of course, in the meantime, events  can change. There are factors of agitation in Europe, there are  attempts to extend European security, the CSCE, the Partnership  for Peace, the Pact for Stability in Europe. I told my dialogue  partners that I was very concerned about giving priority to  security problems, given the dangers of destabilization existing  in Europe, the most tragic of which is Bosnia."    Asked about the particular case of agriculture, Mr. Delors  replied: "It is incumbent upon Polish authorities to determine,  as part of their general concept of economic and social  development, what they wish to make of their agriculture. For  our part, and with a view to Poland's joining the EU, we are  prepared to help them with our experience and know-how. We have  already worked discreetly with experts to examine how  agriculture as it exists in Poland or Hungary could be adapted  to the modern world and today's conditions for the practice of  agricultural activity." The President of the European  Commission noted that there can be no united Europe without the  presence of Poland, now that "we have returned to the  geographic, historic and spiritual origins of Europe." He added  that Poland also serves as a bridge between Europe and the Slav  world, which can help prevent a split between Europe on the one  hand and Ukraine, Belarus and Russia on the other. For his  part, Polish Prime Minister Mr. Pawlak declared that Mr. Delors'  visit had lent "dynamism" to work following on from his  country's request for admission and noted that the problems of  agriculture "will necessitate seeking joint prospects." Mr.  Pawlak also insisted on the importance he attaches to the  European Union's decision to develop major infrastructure  networks and an information society.</p>

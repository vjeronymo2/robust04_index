			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Spanish Foreign Ministry has repeats its  advice to Spaniards residing in Algeria asking them to leave the  country. It also asks those who are planning to travel to  Algeria to refrain from doing so because of the violence  unleashed against foreigners.    A spokesperson for the Diplomatic Information Office said  that after the last attacks on foreigners in Algeria, this  ministry recommends that Spaniards residing in Algeria leave the  country if their presence there is not essential.    The approximately 300 Spanish residents in Algeria, however,  should contact the Spanish Embassy in Algiers if they have not  done so yet.    The Diplomatic Information Office added that due to the  repeated acts of violence against foreigners the advice  recommending that people not travel to Algeria is still valid  specially if they have no pressing reason for going there.

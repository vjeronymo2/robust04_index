			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Horse Rider What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . For the last three years my horse has redecorated my toenails. Black. This year I been dropping heavy hints for Santa to come up with some very smart paddock boots with invisible steel-capped toes. Overider does just the job in black or tan waxy leather, sizes 3-8, from Pounds 34.50 to Pounds 40.50. Not only protective, these will rival my daughter's Doc Marten's in street cred. Call 0455-220375 for stockists, or available from Ride Away Mail Order (0347-810443). The warm, wet autumn has highlighted an age-old problem. Waterproof jackets, whatever claims are made about their breathability, are hot when you are schooling a recalcitrant beast: they get just as damp inside as out. The most versatile jacket I have seen, but not worn (Santa, please note) is the Royal Oak '94 made by Mountain Horse, available from good saddleries from Pounds 182.50 to Pounds 195, sizes small to extra-large. This is a four-in-one waterproof jacket with removable sleeves and waistcoat, but it also has 'air regulators' under the yoke and armpits - zips you can undo to get a through draught. Videos make great presents. Even the rest of the family enjoys Thrills and Spills (Pounds 9.99), 40 minutes of nail-biting stuff over show jumps and cross country, and The Spanish Riding School (Pounds 12.99), 60 minutes of breathtaking beauty and elegance as Lippizana stallions perform classical dressage. Badminton 94 (Pounds 19.99) will bring me right up to date, and I hope Santa can stretch to the video I have been waiting for, new this year: The Half Halt Demystified (2 cassettes, Pounds 29.99) in which Jane Savoie explains how to put your horse on the bit. All available from Ride Away (see above) or Robinsons Mail Order (0942-722555). Thus equipped, I hope this Christmas my horse will stop walking all over me and start to listen.</p>

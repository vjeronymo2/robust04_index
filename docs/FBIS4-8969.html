			<p>BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, had a phone conversation with  Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic today.    Granic and Silajdzic discussed the situation in Gorazde and  the coordination of the activities of the two states in the  international arena -- particularly in the United Nations and  the EU -- and in political and humanitarian fields. They  expressed pleasure with the results achieved so far in the  implementation of the Washington agreement and agreed that both  sides should persist with it so that the international community  might halt the Serb aggression against Gorazde and so that  conditions be created for the continuation of the initiated  peace process.    Minister Granic informed Prime Minister Silajdzic that  Slobodan Lang, Croatian ambassador at the Croatian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in charge of humanitarian affairs, is in  Sarajevo to coordinate humanitarian activities. They also  discussed preparations for the announced visit by Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman to Sarajevo and agreed that the visit  should go ahead as soon as security conditions allow.</p>

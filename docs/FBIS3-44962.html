Quoting sources in Beijing, it said  Cavaco Silva's trip would mark the seventh anniversary on April  13 of a treaty which he signed to return Macao to Chinese  administration in December 1999.    Macau Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira is expected to be part of  the prime minister's entourage, the news agency added. In stark  contrast to Sino-British conflicts over nearby Hong Kong, which  reverts to China in 1997, Lisbon's relations with Beijing over  Macao are officially described as "excellent."    Portugal has occupied Macau since 1557, but has recognized  Chinese sovereignty over the enclave on the south China coast  since 1974. Chinese Premier Li Peng invited Cavaco Silva to  visit China when he visited Lisbon in February last year, Lusa  said.</p>

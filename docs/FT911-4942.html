			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: British Telecom The recent strength of British Telecom's shares is mysterious until one remembers the government's intention to sell some or all of its remaining 48 per cent stake. An army of brokers has had every reason to push the price higher and no reason to annoy the authorities. Getting in on privatisations has been one of the few sure ways to make money in recent years and the appointment of Warburg as lead adviser leaves plenty of spoils on the table. Half of the shares' 8 per cent outperformance of the market since the start of the year occurred after the Budget announcement. The brokers' arguments, of course, are not so unsubtle. BT's notorious lack of productivity is due to give way to a leaner organisation, while the duopoly review was kinder than expected and will have little immediate effect on BT's profits. This is true as far as it goes. A more objective view might be that the government faltered when it realised that a harsh review would undermine the value of its own investment. Instead, it simply postponed detailed answers to the big questions like equal access and price re-balancing until 1992 after it has ceased to be a direct investor. The Treasury is thus free to maximise the sale proceeds, knowing the industry will only start to see the real implications of competition some months later. It is presumably not a coincidence that the regulator is meanwhile quietly keeping his powder dry. Investors should perhaps be sceptical about any continuing pre-privatisation rally. Other utilities are both safer and cheaper.</p>

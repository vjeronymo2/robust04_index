			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER HEARS GORBACHEV COMPLAINT: NO U.S. ACTION ON ARMS  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Britain's Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher here Thursday that he is worried that the favorable momentum in  East-West relations will be broken unless the Bush Administration responds more  positively to Moscow's disarmament initiatives.  </P> <P> The Kremlin leader apparently was reflecting growing Soviet impatience with  what it sees as foot-dragging in Washington.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, who confirmed  Gorbachev's statements, also accused U. S. officials of trying to sabotage the  Anglo-Soviet summit by planting exaggerated news reports about Moscow's sale of  advanced jet bombers to Libya. He said Moscow has supplied Libya with six  Sukhoi-24 bombers under a three-year-old agreement -- not the 12 to 15  warplanes claimed by Bush Administration officials on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Briefing reporters after the principal summit meeting between Thatcher and  Gorbachev, Gerasimov commented: "The timing of this so-called news is very  suspicious. I read about these sales months ago somewhere."  </P> <P> His interpretation, he said, is that someone in Washington "doesn't want the  Soviet-British summit to go as smoothly as it is going."  </P> <P> The Libyan jet sale and other arms control issues were said to have generated  the most disagreement during nearly six hours of intense discussions Thursday  between two political leaders who have developed an extraordinary affinity  despite standing on opposite sides of the ideological divide.  </P> <P> The world's top Communist and the British Conservative his predecessors once  dubbed "the Iron Lady" were sometimes "solemn," sometimes "passionate," as they  defended their respective views forcefully, but without rancor, said a Thatcher  spokesman who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The prime minister called the talks "very deep, very wide-ranging, and very  friendly," while Gorbachev said the discussions "reached a very high level."  </P> <P> While the British side played down Gorbachev's frustration with the Bush  Administration, Gerasimov returned to the theme repeatedly during his meeting  with correspondents.  </P> <P> "Generally, we are not happy with the West's response to our initiatives," he  said. And he made it clear that Moscow blames Washington, as the leader of the  Atlantic Alliance.  </P> <P> "We understand the new Administration needs time to study foreign policy,"  Gerasimov commented icily. "There are new faces there, and some of them don't  know what foreign policy is about."  </P> <P> The superpowers have made important strides in arms control in the last two or  three years, and the atmosphere for disarmament negotiations remains good, he  said. However, "continuity is the name of the game. . . . The main point is not  to lose this momentum with prolonged reviews of foreign policy or with other  obstacles," he said.  </P> <P> His own analysis, Gerasimov said, is that "the new Administration tries to  please everybody and it's not easy. Also, we can feel a certain influence of  some familiar names -- (former Secretary of State Henry A.) Kissinger and  (former National Security Adviser Zbigniew) Brzezinski -- who tend to interpret  Soviet-American relations in terms of confrontation."  </P> <P> "The new Administration is not yet decided which position to take -- how to  interpret the international scene," Gerasimov charged.  </P> <P> Asked if Gorbachev wanted the British prime minister to intercede in  Washington, Gerasimov said: "It's up to Mrs. Thatcher to follow up, to talk to  the Americans. . . . We just expressed our concerns."  </P> <P> Questioned about his Soviet counterpart's characterization, Thatcher's  spokesman commented: "I suppose what they are reflecting is this transitional  period" in Washington. As for anyone in the Bush Administration using the  Libyan bomber issue to harm the Anglo-Soviet summit, he added, "I'm notoriously  not in favor of conspiracy theories."  </P> <P> Thatcher, the spokesman said, made passing reference to the Libyan bomber sale  in her talks with Gorbachev, pointing out the danger of supplying weaponry to  nations that support terrorism. Gorbachev reportedly made no response.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the Israeli government expressed "deep concern" about  the bomber deal and urged the Soviets to reconsider it, wire services said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Sharp Exchange'  </P> <P> The issue also caused what British sources called a "sharp exchange" in  parallel talks Thursday between British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and his  Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who defended the deal as no  different than British arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast clients.  </P> <P> Given Thatcher's own views on arms control, meanwhile, it is debatable whether  she would prod Bush into bolder action despite Soviet warnings about the danger  of delay.  </P> <P> Countering Gorbachev's calls for a nuclear-free Europe, Thatcher argued in an  after-dinner toast that "both our countries know from bitter experience that  conventional weapons do not deter war in Europe, whereas nuclear weapons have  done so for over 40 years. As a deterrent, there is no substitute for them."  </P> <P> Gerasimov recounted that more than half the discussion in the two leaders'  principal meeting Thursday was devoted to the Soviet domestic reform program,  known as perestroika. He said Gorbachev "was extremely frank and talked not  only about achievements, but also about all kinds of difficulties which we  encounter."  </P> <P> Whatever their other differences, on this score, the prime minister was totally  supportive. "In barely more than four years since your first visit, we have  seen changes in the Soviet Union which can only be described as a peaceful  revolution," she said in her toast. "We admire -- very much admire -- the  vision and the boldness which have inspired those changes."  </P> <P> Human rights played little role in the day's discussions, although Thatcher did  say at dinner that while Britain is pleased to see the emigration of those who  want to leave the Soviet Union, "we also look forward to the changes in the law  which you have promised, which will make these the rights of every person, so  that they can be claimed and enforced and not given as privileges which can one  day be taken away."  </P> <P> Earlier, a few dozen supporters of Soviet Jews refused exit visas or Armenian  activists demonstrated across Whitehall street from the prime minister's  residence where the two leaders met.  </P> <P> Underlining the special relationship between them, Thatcher hosted the Soviet  leader in a study of her official residence at 10 Downing St., normally off  limits for such meetings. The rapport between them is such that Gorbachev  kidded her good-naturedly about the capacious handbag that some have dubbed  Thatcher's secret weapon. "Ah! That's the handbag!" the Soviet leader said with  a laugh when she reached into the bag for her index card at the start of  Thursday's main meeting.  </P> <P> To have more time with the Soviet leader, who heads back to Moscow today after  only 40 hours in Britain, Thatcher has been riding with him in his armor-plated  Zil limousine.  </P> <P> At one point Thursday, after he paid a visit to Westminster Abbey, Gorbachev  ordered his car to stop so he could get out and cross the street to shake hands  with British well-wishers. "I would like to thank you all for this reception,"  he told them.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to make a major speech here this morning before lunching with  Queen Elizabeth II and returning to Moscow.  </P></p>

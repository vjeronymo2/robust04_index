			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 10 (TANJUG) -- The sanctions  imposed by the international community against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia do not help restore peace in the former  Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and secure an equal  treatement for all the three confronted sides there, Prime  Minister of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Nikola Sainovic said  on Monday [10 January]. He said this during talks with three  British MPs who are currently visiting Yugoslavia and the  Bosnian Serb republic, the Republican Ministry of Information  said in a statement.    In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed  tough sanctions against the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and  Montenegro because of their alleged involvement in the civil war  among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  allegation that only Serbia is responsible for the war in Bosnia  is not correct, one of the British MPs, Nigel Evans, said in an  interview to Serbian Television after the meeting with Sainovic.  He also said he would present this view to the British  Government.    The talks focused on the effects of the sanctions and the  possibilities for unhindered and speedier delivery of British  humanitarian medical supplies to Yugoslavia, he said. We are  especially interested in working in that direction after our  visits to hospitals where we saw the effects of the sanctions,  Evans said.</p>

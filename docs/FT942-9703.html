			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / South Yemenis call for ceasefire Southern Yemeni leaders yesterday proposed an eight-point peace plan calling for the immediate end of the 10-day-old civil war and the formation of a national salvation government. The proposal came as northern forces appeared to be gaining ground in their southwards drive to capture the strategic port of Aden. The southern Yemen Socialist party said its peace plan called for the rival armies to return to the positions they held before the war. The south has said before it favours dialogue to solve the conflict. But its statement is the first since hostilities erupted that publicly offers detailed proposals for ending the war. Some of the ideas echo earlier demands made by the YSP in the months before the war started to resolve a long-running political crisis between northern and southern leaders. Yesterday's peace offer came after Northern Yemeni forces were reported to have captured the town of Dhalea just 60 miles north of Aden. A defence official from the north also claimed two brigades had reached little Aden, an industrial area 6 miles southwest of Aden proper. People in Aden said the city was quiet and there was no sign of fighting. Earlier, a southern Yemeni military statement said its forces had shot down three northern military aircraft and damaged a warship in a battle off Aden. The war broke out on May 4 after months of feuding between President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a conservative, and Vice President Ali Salem Baidh, a socialist, over the balance of power between north and south in a unified Yemen formed in 1990. Mr Saleh accuses Mr Baidh of ignoring his authority and trying to secede from the north, where most of the south Arabian peninsula state's 13m people live. Mr Baidh accuses Mr Saleh of an iron-fist campaign to erase southern influence in government.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-JUDGE WILL BE INTERIM HEAD OF TROUBLED CHILDREN'S AGENCY  </P> <P> Elwood G. Lui, a retired appellate judge who once presided over the county's  Dependency Court system, has been tapped by the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors to temporarily head the county Department for Children's Services  in the wake of the resignation of Robert L. Chaffee as director of the troubled  department.  </P> <P> Lui, whose appointment was announced by Supervisor Ed Edelman Tuesday afternoon  after the board met in closed session, will serve for three to four months  while a private recruiting firm conducts a nationwide search for a replacement  for Chaffee.  </P> <P> Chaffee, who spent his last day on the job Tuesday, could not be reached for  comment. He announced his resignation July 19 amid mounting criticism of his  agency from children's advocates and state officials, who have threatened to  take over the county's $457-million child welfare services system.  </P> <P> Although Chaffee said he would remain in his $106,200-a-year position through  Oct. 31, Edelman had been pressing for the immediate appointment of an interim  director.  </P> <P> "I'm here today to tell you that we have someone who will give us the help that  we need to get this department back on track," Edelman said Tuesday in  announcing Lui's appointment.  </P> <P> Lui said he intends to focus on satisfying the concerns of state officials,  helping to settle a long-running class-action lawsuit over visitation between  children and their social workers, and improving the department's tarnished  image.  </P> <P> "It is my hope," he said, "that we will be able to restore the confidence that  the community needs to have in this department."  </P> <P> Now a lawyer in private practice, Lui, 49, retired from the 2nd District Court  of Appeal in 1987. Those who know him say he had an especially rapid rise in  the judiciary, moving from the Municipal Court to the Superior Court, where he  served as a juvenile judge and, for six months, presiding judge of the  Dependency Court. He was named to the appellate bench in 1981. In addition, he  served as president of the California Judges Assn. from 1986 to 1987.  </P> <P> Said Judge Paul Boland, who succeeded Lui as presiding judge of the Dependency  Court: "He asked probing questions, he listened attentively and then acted  decisively."  </P> <P> Lui will be paid $12,000 a month in his new position, and will technically  serve as a management consultant while County Administrative Officer Richard B.  Dixon takes the title of interim director. However, Lui said he expects to be  fully in charge of the department. He said the split leadership arrangement is  necessary to permit him to continue to fulfill some of his obligations to his  law clients. They include the County of Los Angeles, which he represents in a  dispute over Malibu cityhood.  </P> <P> Lui said he intends to begin work at Children's Services by Aug. 8. He will  find a department that suffers from low morale and has been rocked by news  accounts of mismanagement, lawsuits and pressure from state officials.  </P> <P> The county is under orders to present the state with a detailed plan for  complying with state regulations by Oct. 1. In addition, he will have to work  with a court-appointed referee who has been named to help improve the county's  record of providing children with face-to-face visits from their social  workers.  </P> <P> Lui's appointment was praised by children's advocates, including members of the  the county Commission for Children's Services, an advisory panel that oversees  the department and has often been at odds with Chaffee.  </P> <P> "We've heard good things about him," said commission President Helen Kleinberg.  </P></p>

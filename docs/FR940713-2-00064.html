			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DEHNR and North Carolina are uniquely situated to conduct this project for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. In 1990, following an open competition, a contract for the pilot phase of Project DIRECT was awarded to a research institution in North Carolina. Developmental activities associated with Project DIRECT have been conducted in Wake County, North Carolina. Considerable community organization and development have occurred to ensure community support and involvement in Project DIRECT. A community advisory board of over 30 local representatives have been actively involved in the project since March 1992. Regular coverage through all media channels that serve this community has occurred and widespread name recognition of the project has been achieved in this community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. A survey of over 900 randomly sampled households in Wake County, North Carolina, is complete, and over 250 extensive medical examinations were performed on a subsample of the household respondents. Response rates exceeded 80%, indicating that expanded survey work is feasible in this community. There is no other community in the United States for which this type of data exists. Replication of work completed to date in another community could only be achieved at considerable cost to the government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The data gathered through the household and medical examinations, along with information from a community resource analysis for Wake County, provides the database from which a comprehensive, multilevel community intervention plan has been developed. The intervention strategies match closely with the health care and educational needs of this community and the resources available to support the interventions in Wake County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. CDC's traditional constituency is State health departments, and the intervention components of Project DIRECT are intended to serve as model programs for eventual implementation by other official State health departments. This cooperative agreement with DEHNR allows CDC to evaluate the effectiveness of Project DIRECT in a State health department, and to identify the additional liaisons that will be required to ensure the viability of diabetes control programs in State health departments in a reformed health system. DEHNR has expertise, administrative and technical capacity, and public health orientation represented in State health departments nationally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. DEHNR has collaborated successfully with universities and research institutions in the State. These are important liaisons for the successful implementation of Project DIRECT. DEHNR presently has established contractual relationships with these academic institutions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;East Carolina University to develop and teach an introductory course in the etiology and management of diabetes mellitus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Cancer Control Program at Duke University.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department of Nutrition at the University of North Carolina-School of Public Health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department of Ophthalmology at the University of North Carolina-School of Medicine to implement the eye care objectives for Diabetes 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. DEHNR has an Office of Minority Health that can provide policy and programmatic technical assistance to Project DIRECT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. DEHNR participated as a member of the DIRECT Community Advisory Board during the pilot phase of the project and they are familiar with the philosophy and design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this complex community intervention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

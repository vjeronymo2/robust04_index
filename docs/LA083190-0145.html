			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Civil lawsuit -- An article Aug. 12 incorrectly reported that The Wellington  Group had been barred from conducting business or occupying its Torrance  offices as a result of a civil lawsuit brought against the company by the state  Department of Corporations. In fact, Wellington has remained open, though it  was barred by the court from selling securities.  </P> <P> The Times also incorrectly reported that The Wellington Group is part of  Pentagon Investment Group, a real estate consortium.  </P> <P> Also, the story said the corporation was co-owner of Toluca Court apartments, a  48-unit building taken over by the state as part of the court action. Roger L.  Merwin, a Wellington Group vice president, said Wellington never owned a share  of the building. Mark Harman, an attorney for the state, said state  investigators believe that Wellington was a co-owner.  </P></p>

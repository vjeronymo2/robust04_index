			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith rallies party over Europe MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, succeeded yesterday in rallying most Labour MPs around a strategy of not backing 'wrecking' amendments to Maastricht. The move will help the government ratify the treaty. But Mr Smith reiterated to Labour MPs his determination to continue pushing for implementation of the social chapter. He said he was not convinced by the government's legal verdict that Labour's amendment 27 on the chapter could be ignored if passed. Meanwhile, the government has decided that either the attorney-general or solicitor-general will be 'on call' whenever the Maastricht bill is debated by MPs. The decision follows the embarrassing U-turn on Monday when Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told MPs that earlier Foreign Office legal advice had been wrong. Last night, Mr Hurd warned Tory backbenchers that if Britain did not ratify Maastricht, it risked losing influence at the United Nations and in the US, as well as in Europe. But he met some anxiety among Tories that the latest legal advice might not stand up to its likely probing. Mr Smith's test came when Euro-sceptic Labour MPs tried to get a pledge that a Labour amendment opposing the European Central Bank would be pushed to a Commons vote. If passed, the amendment would wreck the bill. Mr Smith said the issue was a 'straight political question' - whether Labour wanted to reject Maastricht or build on the treaty. He backed greater accountability of the proposed bank but said there would have to be compromises. He cited the conference decision last year that Maastricht was 'the best agreement that can currently be achieved.' A leadership amendment backing the official line was passed by 112 votes to 46. The central bank amendment will be withdrawn after debate. The leadership will not say how it will instruct its MPs to vote when the bill reaches its third reading - the final Commons stage. Several shadow cabinet members say Labour should abstain if the social chapter is not incorporated. Severe criticism of the government's handling of Maastricht was voiced on both sides of the Lords as peers debated Europe yesterday. The Tory attack was led by Lord Ridley, a former cabinet minister.

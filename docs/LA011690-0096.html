			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> PEEP SHOWS STILL NOT UP TO CODE, CITY SAYS  </P> <P> The continuing struggle between operators of peep shows and the city of Garden  Grove took another turn Monday as four video arcades complied with a court  order to remove the doors on interior booths -- but replaced them with  curtains.  </P> <P> "They've taken down the doors but put up curtains, and that's absolutely not in  compliance with the municipal code," said City Atty.  </P> <P> Stuart B. Scudder. Code enforcement officers Monday inspected five peep shows  on Garden Grove Boulevard for compliance with an order issued by Superior Court  Judge John C. Wooley on Dec. 28.  </P> <P> The businesses that replaced doors with curtains are the Bijou, the A-Z  Bookstore, the Garden of Eden Bookstore and Hip Pocket Bookstore. A fifth, the  Adult Bookstore, complied with the court order.  </P> <P> "We'll give them until the afternoon (today), and if the curtains are still  there, they'll be cited for violating the municipal code," Scudder said. Garden  Grove has a "peep show" ordinance regulating the video arcade businesses, which  typically charge 25 cents to view a snippet of an X-rated film.  </P> <P> The removal of the doors avoids the threat of a contempt citation from the  court and may lead to another round of legal battles.  </P> <P> "I think Mr. Scudder is wasting his time and the taxpayers' money," said Roger  Diamond, an attorney representing the arcades. "The judge's concern was with  safety, that somehow a person might get locked in a booth in the event of a  fire. These curtains are easily pushed aside."  </P> <P> Garden Grove's ordinance, passed in 1983 and revised in 1988, also requires  that exit signs be visible to all users of the booths, and sets other standards  such as minimum booth sizes and aisle widths.

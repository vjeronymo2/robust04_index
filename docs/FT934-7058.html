			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Further snowfalls forecast Motorists were warned last night to expect more snow after a day in which some roads in Scotland and northern England were blocked. The heaviest falls yesterday of more than 5cm, were in Lincolnshire, East Anglia and near Ashford in Kent. London had its first November snow since 1969. Today's falls are expected to be lighter and more isolated. Today the Met Office introduces its Weathercall Fax service.

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Strong rise in yen fuels demand for Japanese bonds THE SHARP rise in the yen against the US dollar following central bank intervention, pushed up Japanese government bond prices yesterday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 5.47 per cent to close at 5.39 per cent on above-average trading volume. Dealers noted strong demand for yen bonds as the Bank of Japan and US Federal Reserve intervened in the foreign exchange market, selling dollars for yen when the US currency reached Y128. Altogether, dealers estimated about Dollars 500m was sold yesterday. The yen strengthened from Friday's closing level in New York of Y127.80, to Y126.93 on Monday. A strong yen increases the attraction of yen assets for investors and gives the Bank of Japan more freedom to ease monetary policy and cut the official discount rate. A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official was quoted as being in favour of a stronger yen, indicating the level achieved at the time of the Group of Seven nations meeting in late January when the dollar traded at around Y124.5. UK government bonds gained up to half a percentage point yesterday, making up for Friday's correction in the market and fuelled by hopes of a cut in the UK base rate. Traders said the gilt-edged market was oversold on Friday, following the fall in the US Treasury bond market, but sterling's strength and hopes of lower interest rates helped the market to recover yesterday. The 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 101 1/16 to 101 1/8 while the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt 2003/07 climbed from 115 23/32 to 116 5/32 . Volume in the futures market was below average as participants waited for today's release of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures. GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day in dull trade as market participants waited for the reopening of the US market to provide some direction. In the futures market, the March Liffe bund futures contract traded at 87.87, up eight basis points from Friday's close after trading in a narrow range. US markets were closed for Presidents Day.</p>

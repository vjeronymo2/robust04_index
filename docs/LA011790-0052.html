			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC'S OPINION OF LEGISLATURE  </P> <P> The legislators indignant anger over a Times Poll which holds them in low  esteem, unethical and unproductive prompts me to write my first letter ever to  The Times (Part A, Jan. 3-4).  </P> <P> First of all, I was not part of the state poll. However, it would be difficult  not to come to the same conclusion as the poll when one reads, almost daily in  the newspapers, so much about the corruption and indecision of the various  legislators. It could be argued that a few bad apples do not make the whole  tree rotten, or a single rose does not make spring. But the extensive number of  legislators' names, which are continuously in the news in a detrimental manner,  impair this legislative body as a crack can destroy a dam, or a hole in a  tanker can ruin a coastline.  </P> <P> Perhaps I would not have written had not Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco) called the poll "an absolute, unadulterated lie." What does he mean  by such a statement? Does he mean that the people who put the poll together are  liars? Or is he trying to say that the public is misinformed and does not know  the true facts, which, incidently, is not what he said. Or that the press  publishes lies all the time so that the public is misinformed? Or does he not  know what he means? Or if he does know what he means, why is he unable to  articulate his meaning accurately? After all, what he stated does not make  sense since a poll does no more than reflect people's opinions. Brown's  response just further reflects negatively on his image.  </P> <P> If the Speaker of the Assembly does not make any sense then perhaps we have a  bigger problem than the poll indicated.  </P> <P> DERRICK A. ANDERSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Benetton takes 50% stake in TWR ITALY'S fast-diversifying Benetton family has shifted into a new area of activity with the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the TWR Group, the UK motor racing, research and consulting company run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw. No price for the deal has been disclosed. However, a spokesman for Edizione Holding, the Benetton's family holding company which is making the investment, said its involvement would 'alter TWR's debt-equity ratio,' thereby ensuring a Pounds 60m (Dollars 114.6m) bank loan destined for new projects. TWR, based in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, has around 700 employees and expects sales this year of around Pounds 170m. The company designs and develops prototype cars and is also active in motor sport and Formula One racing. Among the best known of its current projects is the new Jaguar XJ220 super-car, which is being produced in a limited edition of 350 vehicles costing Pounds 415,000 each. The group has grown dramatically, with turnover surging by 819 per cent in the past six years. Among new projects on its drawing board are contracts for Ford, Mazda, Rover and Holden, General Motors' Australian subsidiary, as well as a joint venture with Aston Martin, which has entrusted TWR to develop a new model for 1994. The company is also working on an advanced electric car. The Benetton family's stake is to be held by 21 Investimenti, a new subsidiary of Edizione Holding set up last year to spearhead investments in new activities. Apart from controlling the family's stake of around 80 per cent in the Benetton clothing concern, Edizione Holding has expanded into sports goods equipment, with a string of takeovers of famous brands and property. Mr Alessandro Benetton, the 28-year-old second son of Benetton's guiding light, Mr Luciano Benetton, will join TWR's board. The two men have already established contacts through Benetton's activities in Formula One motor racing, which are under Mr Alessandro Benetton's control. Earlier this month, he also joined the board of Edizione Holding,</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BEIJING FREES 97 PROTESTERS  </P> <P> China freed 97 pro-democracy protesters, including two student leaders, after  the anniversary of the June 4 army attack on last year's demonstrations passed  without major unrest, officials said today.  </P> <P> The releases bring to 881 the number freed in the last six months, out of  thousands arrested.  </P> <P> But new arrests have been reported as recently as last week, and the releases  did not signal a softening by the aging leadership.  </P> <P> Rather, the leaders appeared to be trying to put the protests behind them and  improve their image at home and abroad. China's most-favored-nation trade  status remains under review in the U.S. Congress, and foreign tourism and  investment remain far below their pre-June, 1989, level.  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (13): New scope for European brokers and bankers - Japanese financial deregulation JAPAN'S ongoing financial deregulation has provided opportunities for European brokers and bankers, but it has also created contradictions for these institutions, which have generally carved off small slices of markets now subject to further deregulation. Proposals to liberalise the heavily-regulated domestic corporate bond market could make life more difficult for foreign institutions specialising in Japanese business in the Euromarkets, while the planned entry of Japanese bank subsidiaries into investment trusts will intensify the competition in a crowded and, at the moment, shrinking market. The liberalisation of Japanese markets has created opportunities for European banks, brokers and insurance companies, but the pace of that liberalisation could slow, as some senior officials at the Bank of Japan and ministry of finance consider that these changes are partly responsible for the mess in Japan's financial system. These officials have been made cautious by the collapse of the stock market, the enduring weakness of property prices and the crisis in the banking industry. But other officials within the finance ministry argue that these crises would not have arisen if there had been more competition and better risk management. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has pointed the finger at foreign brokers, US and European, for allegedly dragging down stock prices through their playing of recently liberalised futures and options markets, and Japanese brokers were envious of the collective profits made by foreigners during the first half to the end of September. During that six months, the 99 Japanese members of the TSE made a collective pre-tax loss of around Y210bn, while 25 foreign members made a profit of Y30bn, down from Y50bn in the previous period, but still large enough to draw attention to their activities in the derivatives markets. The TSE argues that individual investors are intimidated by sudden price movements inspired by the foreigners' trading habits. These concerns prompted the Osaka Stock Exchange, under presure from the TSE, to lift margin requirements three times last year - the bulk of Japan's stock futures trading is done on the Osaka exchange, although the index is based on Tokyo cash prices. In response, the council of the European Business Community in Japan has suggested that there be more consultation before rule changes are made. The TSE is presently conducting a study into the derivatives markets, and while European brokers are confident that the exchange will find the markets are not at fault, there is a fear that the exchange may need to be seen to justify its concern by making further changes to trading regulations. The manager of a British house in Tokyo says that 'arbitrary' changes in rules are against the spirit of internationalisation that the Tokyo exchange is wanting to cultivate. Some European brokers are booking a profit, but the industry is under pressure to restructure because of the continuing weakness of the Tokyo market. A sign of the contradictory pressures created by financial reforms is the debate over the deregulation of stock brokerage commissions. In principle, fees should be deregulated to bring Tokyo in line with other international financial centres, but foreign brokers warn that their market share could be squeezed in the competitive crush. Officials from the London exchange have cautioned their Japanese counterparts about a sudden change in the commission structure and said attention must be paid to the extreme pressure on brokers in the Japanese market. The difficulties faced by Japanese banks, badly bruised by their exposure to the domestic property market, have provided opportunities for European banks, though the traditionally close relationships between Japanese banks and domestic corporate clients, often extending to cross-shareholdings, are still strong. At the third meeting of the Import Board of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) in July, the EBC complained that foreign banks' share of lending was only 1.5 per cent of the Japanese market. To increase that share, the EBC suggested that local banking rules should meet international standards and that deregulation should be quickened. The most significant change in the banking market is the non-performing loan exposure of leading Japanese banks, which rose 54 per cent to Y12,300bn in the six months to the end of September. Meanwhile, banks' trimming of assets to meet capital adequacy standards established by the Bank for International Settlements have created opportunities for European banks. As part of that trimming, Japanese commercial banks have been willing to sell loans to regional and foreign banks. Reforms are pending in the insurance market, though the fate is unclear of recommendations by a insurance industry advisory council, which recently recommended to the finance ministry that study groups be established to consider a relaxation of the tight controls over product lines and pricing. Ten European non-life companies have licences in Japan, and Mr Mike Gourlay, manager of Royal Insurance in Japan, said that the timing and extent of the reforms are yet to be decided, but there is a recognition that the 'consumer deserves more choice'. However, the regulation of prices ensures the survival of smaller companies, and a sudden deregulation of prices could make life more difficult for some foreign companies in Japan. Mr Gourlay says Royal Insurance, which opened its Tokyo branch in 1975, has the advantage that many Japanese recognise London as the international centre for insurance - 'in our direct marketing we are emphasising that we are a British company.'  ---------------------------------- Call loans of foreign banks in Japan in billions of yen at end of period:  ---------------------------------- 1986    1,902 1987    2,164 1988    2,499 1989    2,653 1990    2,725 1991    3,254  ---------------------------------- Source; Bank of Japan.  ----------------------------------</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Serving up chips on a plate It is relatively easy to promote consumer brand loyalty if the product is soap powder or a car. But if it is a small, albeit vital, component buried deep in the guts of a machine, it is much harder. Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, faced exactly this problem when it decided to promote its microprocessor 'chips' which provide the 'brain power' for most personal computers. Last November, Intel launched a campaign aimed at the ordinary customer  - not the hardware manufacturer - but which advertised a vacant slot deep inside a computer, rather than the machine itself. The message Intel was trying to deliver was make sure the computer you buy has an Intel chip - and a spare Intel socket - inside it. The television advertisement features a science-fiction 'flight' through the innards of a computer - filmed using a fish-eye lens inside a real computer  -ending up at the empty chip slot with a bright neon arrow sign flashing over it marked 'vacancy.' The Intel marketing campaign is part of a solution to an unusual problem faced by Intel - its design engineers roll out new products faster than the market can absorb them. Companies, which are the main purchasers of personal computers, usually write-off their equipment over five years. But the electronics engineers working for the California-based chip maker, which controls 85 per cent of the world market for microprocessors, produce a hot new product in about half that time. The solution Intel came up with was to offer the user a way to improve the performance of an existing machine. Intel told manufacturers who use Intel chips in their computers to build in a spare chip socket next to the main processor. The company then launched the Dollars 100m European advertising campaign. Intel is still analysing the results of the first phase of the campaign but says the initial response was 'encouraging'. Last month the company unveiled the 'overdrive' chip which is designed to fill the vacant slot at the start of March.</p>

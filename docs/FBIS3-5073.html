			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A senior government official on the morning of 28  February commented on a remark made by Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii during his recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury  Lloyd Bensten, saying: "He made the remark under the premise  that the ruling parties' Tax Reform Council will come to a  conclusion (on the question of whether to continue with the tax  reduction) within one year. It was not an international  commitment." Fujii in the meeting with Bentsen told the latter  the tax reductions -- before increasing other taxes-- would  continue into 1995 and thereafter as part of the taxation system  reform.</p>

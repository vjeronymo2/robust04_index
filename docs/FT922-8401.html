			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Water companies told to improve metering WATER COMPANIES have been warned by the industry's economic regulator they must make metering cheaper, fairer and simpler for customers, who are too often deterred by unreasonable installation charges and unfavourable tariffs. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has written to the companies emphasising that they must bring metered charges into line with other charges. Metered customers have been found in some cases to be paying more than those without meters for the same amount of water. Metering is likely to become much more widespread as the present charging system, based on domestic rates, is phased out by the end of the decade. All customers have the right to a meter, and Ofwat believes that many should benefit by controlling their consumption. Mr Byatt said: 'The choice of a meter must be made easier for customers, particularly those on low incomes and living alone, for whom current charges are disproportionately high by comparison with their actual use of water.' Mr David Gadbury, the industry's spokesman on metering, rejected the Ofwat criticism. He said customers who chose metering were likely to make savings, and the industry was making 'every effort' to extend metering.</p>

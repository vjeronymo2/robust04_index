			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK profits With the spring reporting season just starting, the market's fit of caution is timely. Current theories about profit recovery now face their first test  -not how strong the recovery will be, but how deep a hole it will be filling. The CBI profit expectations survey is routinely over-optimistic, but its timing is pretty reliable, forecasting upturns about a year before the event. The last CBI survey projected a decisive turning point, which can therefore be expected in the first or second quarter of 1992. How big? Goldman Sachs can hardly be called pessimistic - it looks for a 15-20 per cent bounce back next year, with output up and employment down; but it stresses that the coming quarter may be worse than expected, just as the first quarter was. The better the inflation news, the worse the message about margins. Treasury officials, who designed current policy to squeeze inflation via margins, think that any hope of profit recovery this year is moonshine, and even a standstill stretching it. Since this would come after a 10 per cent drop in 1990, Goldman's three-year forecast for an average nominal rise of 3 per cent real looks far from gloomy. But at that, it would take a further strong recovery in 1993 to get real profits back to their 1989 starting point. The market may find this prospect a little unexciting, unless it is banking on dollar miracles.</p>

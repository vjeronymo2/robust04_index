			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: NRMA sees ADollars 215m profits NRMA, Australia's largest motorists' organisation and one of its biggest general insurers, yesterday forecast that it would make after-tax profits of ADollars 215m (USDollars 158m) in the year to end-June 1995. This would represent a sharp turnround from the ADollars 129m scored in the year just ended, although realised losses of ADollars 128m in 1993-94 were abnormally high and depressed the result. In 1992-93 and 1991-92, NRMA's net profits were ADollars 248m and ADollars 261m respectively. The NRMA made the forecast in its flotation prospectus. The group's board approved a plan to 'demutualise' the company earlier this month.</p>

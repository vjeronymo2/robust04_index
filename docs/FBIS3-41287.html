			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Akchurin: "What Is the Cost of Opium for the </F> People Today?"]    [Text] Osh Oblast--A group of police officials from the CIS  republics, Central Asian republics primarily, recently traveled  across the ocean to visit their American colleagues. They were  not simply guests, however, and were attending an international  seminar organized by the United States Department of Justice on  the war against drugs.    The hosts had gone to considerable expense here. And "our  people" were curious to find out from them: Why? What is this to  you? The answer was completely pragmatic: "It is more beneficial  to us," the Americans explained, "to teach you how to properly  fight this plague in your own territory, before it comes  crashing down on us."    The organizers of the seminar were not exaggerating the  scope  of the danger. Experts have already seized narcotics prepared  from "our" drug raw material in Washington and Los Angeles. As  far as hemp alone is concerned--known to Americans as  "marijuana"--there is enough in the sadly renowned Chu Valley to  get millions of people hooked!    It is not for naught that the ancient healers of the East  believed that a single herb could be both medicine and poison.  And there is a great deal of it growing on the slopes of Pamir  and Tian-Chan. The opium poppy is widely known, for example. Or  the less well-known, inconspicuous grass from which drug  specialists have recently become good at quickly and simply  extracting narcotics with an almost instantaneous habit-forming  effect...    For Tajikistan, which has suffered so much, the drug  business  today constitutes a "second front." And it is still not known  which enemy is more terrible. At the very least doctors assert  that drugs may be taking more human lives than bullets in the  warring republic.    Perhaps the saddest thing is the fact that many Tajiks,  people from Gornyy Badakhshan in particular, are entirely  unaware that they are involved in a deadly trade. After all,  they say, they used to smoke opium. But whereas they used to  smoke "for pleasure," today they are engaged in the extraction  and resale of drugs for one reason only--to make their  livelihood. Incidentally, the highest people in the drug  business almost never smoke themselves--a clear head is required  to achieve their aims. Mafia groups obtain weapons, gold, and  foodstuffs in short supply in exchange for drugs. In Khorog they  ferry girls and sell children to mujahidin for opium from  Afghanistan. In their pursuit of big money, the narcomafia will  resort to anything, even including armed conflict. What was a  small drug flow stream, alas, is gathering the force of a mud  torrent, a very alarming phenomenon, and is pouring through a  single mountain corridor--the Khorog-Osh road. Simple mountain  dwellers are being dragged into the criminal trade, people who  today do not have anything to live on.    "The absence of sociopolitical regulation and inability of  the central authorities to control the situation in the  localities are creating ideal conditions for a prosperous drug  trade," states Colonel A. Orozov, head of the National Security  Directorate for Osh Oblast. "Afghan peasants are refusing to  grow anything except the opium poppy, which affords a fantastic  profit. Understanding the danger that is emanating from its  neighbors, Iran is prepared to build a virtual `Great Wall of  China' along its border, and has allocated millions in  appropriations to fight this evil. Military operations have  impeded drug passage in the direction of Dushanbe. So there  remains only the road to Osh for the marketing of narcotics.  Available current-operations data indicate that along the border  with Gornyy Badakhshan, eight tonnes of raw opium are awaiting  transfer across the Pamirs to Osh."    "We must not lose sight of the premises that created the  conditions for trade development," Colonel Orozov continues.  "Many people in Gornyy Badakhshan have no opportunity to find  work."    At the June session of the Gornyy Badakhshan Oblast Soviet,  one woman--a people's deputy--stated from the floor of the  chamber that she had been forced to engage in the resale of  narcotics since she was entirely unable to feed her large  family. Local residents buy opium at R100 per gram and sell it  for R500. In Osh they are "driving up" the price of the  dangerous plant to R1,500. This figure is doubled or tripled in  the near and far abroad. Osh is being transformed into a  powerful drug center. But the men from Khorog openly admit that  they have lost the battle with the drug mafia and are now  placing all their hopes in collective counteraction on the part  of near and far neighbors.    Is such counteraction possible? The judgments of our recent  past are becoming ever more unflattering. But even our former  ideological enemies, now our partners, admit: The Soviet state  kept its borders so tightly sealed that passage of the "white  product" was virtually reduced to naught. Drugs used to  circumvent one-sixth of the Earth's surface.    Today the situation has changed. According to Interpol data,  Colombian drugs have already blazed a trail to Europe across the  vital border of the CIS. And indeed, they have enough problems  even as far as their own "home-grown" sources are concerned. At  a regional seasonal conference of specialists in the war against  the drug mafia and drug trade out of the Central Asian republics  held in Dzhambul (Kazakhstan), representatives from Tajikistan  asserted that the flow of drugs has increased through their  sector of the border. There you get a truck load of food for 10  kilograms of opium. And just try to interfere when  transportation of the product across the border is carried out  under cover of fire from arms on the other side. The bygone days  of protection of Soviet borders was only bad in that all of us  together and each of us individually now find ourselves  unprepared to defend ourselves against a well organized and  experienced enemy--the drug trade. Special subdivisions in  Kazakhstan, for example, engaged in patrolling the  above-mentioned Chu Valley, are suffering from elementary  problems: insufficient supply of binoculars, night-vision  devices, handcuffs (!), means of transportation, and fuel.    Worst of all is the fact that it is sometimes the law itself  that stands in the way of safeguarding the law. Throughout the  civilized world there exists the concept of "shipments under  surveillance." When they obtain drug-related information,  experts in the war against drugs do not rush to catch criminals  red-handed. It is important to follow the entire chain of  movement of the "white death"--to where it is headed, for whom  it is intended. But the procuracy in Kazakhstan prohibits such  action, considering it provocative.    "As a result we content ourselves with catching the little  fish, while the sharks of the drug trade remain lurking in the  shadows," admits A. Vyborov, chief of the department for  fighting the illegal drug trade of the Kazakhstan Ministry of  Internal Affairs.    In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, although a national program has  been adopted to fight the drug mafia, the lack of qualified  cadre and shortages of technical assets and financing remain a  serious problem.    Perhaps only in the Republic of Uzbekistan have they been  able to mobilize force against this phenomenon, where President  I. Karimov has long and persistently been addressing from every  forum--including the United Nations--the formidable danger of a  wave of narcotics across Central Asia.    Those who make superficial judgments from afar as to the  causes and consequences of the Tajik conflict should now ponder  a response to the question: What is the cost of opium for the  people today? After all, the Pamirs are far closer to Moscow and  the outskirts of the CIS than they are to Los Angeles.</p>

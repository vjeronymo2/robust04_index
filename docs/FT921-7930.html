			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Japan It says much about the nervous disposition of the Japanese equity market that it should have fallen by 1.2 per cent on reports, later confirmed, that Sony Corporation is heading for its first annual operating loss since its listing in 1958. Sony's difficulties were evident at its interim results, so the news should have long been in the price. By the same token, there is widespread talk in Tokyo of nasty profit falls at the corporate year-end in March. When a market is this apprehensive, it takes a brave investor to decide that all the bad news is discounted. Indeed, the slide in the Nikkei index over the last week has been sufficiently alarming to have reopened the prospect of emergency measures should it threaten or fall through the 20,000 level. Those who remember the rigorous defence of the equivalent technical level in 1965 think a repeat performance is coming: the favoured intervention by the authorities is a sharp cut in interest rates, perhaps of  3/4 point. Such a knee-jerk response should at least stabilise the market by making equities cheaper. It might also be justified on domestic economic grounds. But the yen, weak already, would surely suffer on the foreign exchange markets. That might cause capital adequacy problems of a different sort for the banks because of their still large overseas assets. It would also leave any investors left in the market looking for stocks most heavily geared to the US economy including, ironically, Sony.</p>

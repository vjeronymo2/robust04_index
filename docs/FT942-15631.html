			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ill-judged, but not arrogant Sir, Ian Rodger, in an otherwise fair and balanced survey of Switzerland, describes the referendum decision against joining the European Economic Area ('Increasingly awkward position ', April 8) , and presumably also the decision to ban all transit lorry traffic from the Alps from 2004, as 'arrogant'. How can such an exercise of democracy be 'arrogant'? Surely at worst it could be described as ill-judged or short-sighted? Trevor Surgenor, 37 Queen's Park, Coleraine BT51 3JS, Northern Ireland</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / France confirms sell-off timetable THE French government yesterday confirmed that it planned to start its privatisation programme in early September and announced that it might sell minority stakes in a number of state-controlled companies before the full-scale sales got under way. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said after a parliamentary meeting that he planned to float between three and six companies in the first round of privatisations. These sales, he said, would start in the final months of 1993 but would continue in 1994. France's new centre-right government, which needs capital to reduce the budget deficit, recently unveiled plans for a radical privatisation drive involving up to 21 companies. The candidates for sale include Banque Nationale de Paris, the Renault motor group, the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals concern and Air France. The value of the privatisations has been estimated by analysts at between FFr280bn and FFr360bn (Pounds 33.2bn-Pounds 42.6bn). The partial privatisation programme before September would involve selling minority holdings in other public sector concerns along the lines of this month's flotation of a 35 per cent stake in the Credit Local de France banking group. Mr Alphandery said he planned to raise around FFr40bn from privatisations before the end of this year.</p>

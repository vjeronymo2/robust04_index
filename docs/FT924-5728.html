			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BoS to recapitalise NZ bank THE BANK of Scotland said yesterday that it will recapitalise Countrywide Bank next month by taking up a 3-for-2 cash rights issue at a cost of NZDollars 180m (Pounds 61m). The Scottish bank gained control of Countrywide late last month after a four-month battle in which opponents said its offer was far too low. Countrywide is New Zealand's fifth biggest bank. The Bank of Scotland formerly controlled Countrywide but was instrumental in seeing it merge with the United Bank earlier this year. The United Bank was formerly owned by the financially troubled State Bank of South Australia. The Bank of Scotland said it would complete the compulsory acquisition of the outstanding shares, which would see Countrywide delisted from the stock exchange, by the end of the year. In addition, a NZDollars 120m subordinated loan extended by the Scottish bank will provide bridging finance to allow Countrywide to pay for the purchase of United Bank in May. The merger of both United and Countrywide was completed last weekend.</p>

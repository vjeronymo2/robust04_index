			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from John Carvel in Brussels: "EU Prepares To </F> Counter Espionage"]    [Text] Senior Eurocrats are preparing defences against  espionage in European Union [EU] institutions now that their  activities have been expanded into sensitive areas of foreign  policy and counterterrorism.    Positive vetting of key personnel is being set up for the  first time in the secretariat of the Council of Ministers in  Brussels. The Commission is extending arrangements originally  designed to protect Euratom nuclear secrets.    The moves were disclosed in a letter from Niels Ersboll,  secretary-general of the Council of Ministers, to Alex Falconer,  Labour MEP [Member of European Parliament] for Mid Scotland and  Fife, who led the European Parliament's successful campaign to  fight previous attempts to instigate official secrecy in the  Community.    "Given its responsibility under the new treaty (of  Maastricht), the Council secretariat will have to deal with  certain classified information (e.g. information relating to the  security policy of member states or information on terrorist  threat) which, as you will understand, necessitates special  precautions to ensure confidentiality and avoid unauthorised  disclosure of material which would seriously damage the security  and interests of member states and their citizens," Mr Ersboll  said.    A small number of staff would be "required to undergo the  security screening which will form part of the proposed security  regime."    A senior Council official said that positive vetting would  only apply to staff who were given access to sensitive  documents, including security analyses and comments by member  states' diplomatic services on foreign governments.    The vetting will be carried out by the security services of  the individual's own member state or, in the case of foreigners  living in Belgium, by Belgian authorities.    "The European Union does not itself have the services which  could handle these matters. We are very much in the hands of  the national capitals. They will have to take care of their own  nationals," he said.    The Commission is understood to be preparing to increase the  number of offlcials who must be positively vetted before they  can work on the more sensitive parts of common foreign and  security policy, justice and home affairs -- the second and  third pillars of the EU agreed at Maastricht. Hitherto, only a  handful of Commission officials have required positive vetting  by MI5 or other national security services. Routine checks are  carried out at recruitment to ensure that staff have no police  record. But security clearance was only needed for staff with  access to Euratom secrets and a few other sensitive documents.    The Commission's Security Office can handle threats to the  personal safety of commissioners and visiting dignitaries. It  also co-operates with national security services when espionage  charges are made against staff -- such as the current inquiry  into the alleged Stasi connections of a German official in the  Overseas Development Directorate. To add to German  embarrassment, it was revealed yesterday that its ambassador to  Gabon, Rainer Muller, has been arrested as a suspected Stasi spy.    Mr Falconer said he was concerned that a special cadre of  vetted officials was being set up without reference to the  European Parliament, which threw out the Commission's previous  proposals for security vetting of staff.    In 1992 the Commission called for an official secrecy regime  which would have classified its documents "top secret," "secret"  and "classified," according to their sensitivity. It was forced  to drop the idea by criticism from the MEPs.    Mr Ersboll's letter said the new scheme was much more  limited  in scope. Mr Falconer warned that he could find himself in  conflict with parliament if he did not come clean about what was  being done.</p>

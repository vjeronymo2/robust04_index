			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Canada seeks end to car content dispute CANADA has asked for a dispute settlement panel to be set up under the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA) to adjudicate a disagreement over the local content of Japanese cars assembled in North America, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto. The row follows a US Customs inquiry into the North American content of Honda Civic cars assembled at a factory near Toronto, then exported to the US. The US is concerned that Honda may be violating FTA provisions requiring 50 per cent North American content to qualify for duty-free cross-border shipment. Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said the dispute centred on what interest charges qualified as local content. 'Despite efforts to win a settlement, the US contends that only interest paid with respect to a mortgage can be included as 'territorial content' under FTA rules of origin. Our position is that 'territorial content' includes any interest paid in relation to land, equipment and buildings used in making goods.' Ottawa has tended to favour more generous local content rules than the US, in an effort to woo investment by Japanese and other foreign car makers in Canada. The binational panels are likely to be a model for other regional trade arrangements. About two dozen panels have been formed since the FTA took effect three years ago.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller:  Strikes - Travel Update Athens: Bus drivers on Friday called a halt to a two-day-old strike as a Christmas goodwill gesture, but pledged to resume their protests at government plans to renationalise the city's services. The drivers, most of whom bought their buses in August 1992 when the conservative government privatised Athens's bus service, called a strike over the new Socialist government's plan to reverse the privatisation. Sweden: Almost all Swedish air traffic control could be paralysed by a threatened stike of 5,000 controllers and a possible lock out by employers on December 13 and December 20 in a wage dispute.</p>

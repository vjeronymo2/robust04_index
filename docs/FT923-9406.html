			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / View that became a valuer's nightmare: Fears for the future of a derelict London landmark have resurrected a controversy THE long-running controversy over Battersea Power Station on the south bank of the River Thames in London - semi-derelict since redevelopment work to turn it into a leisure complex was halted two years ago due to lack of funds  -looks set to be refuelled. English Heritage, the government-funded conservation body, has written to Mr John Broome, the property developer who owns the listed building, recommending that urgent repair work be carried out to prevent its deterioration. It has also asked Mr Broome what his plans are for putting the future of the power station, one of London's most famous architectural landmarks, on a firmer financial footing. The move by English Heritage follows the publication last month of a report by the National Audit Office, the watchdog on government spending, warning that many listed buildings are at risk because of lack of reliable information and slack financial monitoring. Mr Broome has shunned personal contacts with the media since his plans to develop a leisure complex on the Battersea site - which was to have been opened by the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher in May 1990 - came to nothing. Mr David Cooper, of solicitors Gouldens, said on behalf of Mr Broome that the foundations of the power station 'are stronger than ever' and that he was confident about negotiations to revive plans for the leisure complex. He said that Battersea Leisure, which owns the site, had talked with Abela Holdings, a Lebanese-owned in-flight catering group. Abela has denied that it has been involved in talks about the power station. A growing list of potential partners has shunned Mr Broome's approaches. Mr Cooper said last March that Mr Broome was negotiating a Pounds 60m deal with a Japanese consortium but nothing came of the talks, and bankers connected with the Battersea project are sceptical that it had any serious chance of success. Earlier approaches to property developer Mr John Bloomfield and to Parc Securities, part of Mr Werner Rey's Swiss-based Omni Holding Empire, also failed to meet the expectation of success generated by the Broome camp. The approaches were made after Mr Broome had been ordered by his creditors to halt work on the project because by 1989 costs had soared by an unbudgeted Pounds 60m to Pounds 230m. Bank of America, Mr Broome's main lender since it took over Security Pacific National Bank last August, has refused to comment on the Battersea project, insisting that its finances were protected by 'client confidentiality'. It is understood that the Battersea portfolio is being overseen in a special department of the London offices of the bank which deals with loans which are on a critical list, in default, or in a 'special care' category. Although Mr Broome realised Pounds 60m from the sale of the Alton Towers leisure complex to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, his finances are still stretched. Mr Broome's company, Battersea Group, formerly Alton Towers, spent Pounds 18m on the acquisition of 85 per cent of the Battersea site in 1987. This figure includes the cost of foundation work and clearing the site of asbestos. At the peak of the property boom in 1988, when it bought the remaining 15 per cent, Battersea Leisure, the subsidiary which owns the site, was valued at no less than Pounds 110m. Yet Battersea Leisure had a deficiency of net tangible assets at the time of more than Pounds 300,000. The difference between minus Pounds 300,000 and plus Pounds 110m represented hope value - the amount the project might be worth on the assumption that it would succeed. When Battersea Leisure last filed accounts - for the year to November 30, 1990 - its tangible assets, chiefly of land and buildings on the old power station site, had risen to Pounds 90.4m in the balance sheet. But Pounds 28.6m of this figure consisted of capitalised interest owed to the banks. A further Pounds 7.1m represented project management fees and other expenditure charged to the company by fellow subsidiaries in Mr Broome's property and leisure group. The assets were financed by a bank loan of Pounds 47.1m secured by charges in favour of Security Pacific National Bank, now owned by Bank of America; trade credit of Pounds 15.2m, thought to come largely from Sir Robert McAlpine, much of which is secured on a second charge; and Pounds 20.3m of borrowings from other companies owned by Mr Broome. The auditor's report, signed by Touche Ross on April 24, 1991, emphasised that the figures in the accounts were struck on a going-concern basis. This assumed that the company was able to find finance to repay bank borrowings and to complete the Battersea project. Outside estimates have put the ultimate cost of the scheme at anything up to Pounds 300m. In the absence of more finance or potential buyers, the site is a valuer's nightmare. In the depressed London market, where development property has been particularly badly hit, most of its value could have been wiped out, leaving the banks and other creditors with very little to cover their outstanding advances of loans and credit. There are also potentially onerous liabilities relating to the upkeep of the land and buildings. An unusual feature of the saga is that Mr Broome originally bought 15 per cent of Battersea personally for his own account in 1987, at the same time that his Alton Towers company bought its 85 per cent. He then sold this minority stake at a vastly increased price of Pounds 16.5m in 1988 to Alton Towers. Some Pounds 11m of the proceeds were paid to Mr Broome in the form of shares in Alton Towers, while he was paid the remaining Pounds 5.5m in cash. Today the shares are almost certainly worthless. But unless the banks extracted personal guarantees for their loans to his business empire, Mr Broome will have extracted an impressive Pounds 5.5m of cash proceeds from a development that continues to scar the London landscape and which may never be completed. Mr Cooper said that any cash left over from the sale went on tax liabilities. He said: 'John Broome did the 'right thing' by putting the proceeds of his Alton Towers sale into the Battersea project. For that he ought to be patted on the back or else called a complete idiot, because he could have run off with the money. I think probably the reason he did was because he wanted a knighthood at the end of the day.' The knighthood has eluded Mr Broome, in spite of his being declared a man of 'enterprise and vision' in June 1988 by Mrs Thatcher as she fired a laser gun at the official launch of work on the leisure complex project. Instead, there appears to be growing embarrassment in the Conservative party about the way the issue has been handled and the extent to which it could damage Tory-controlled Wandsworth Council's image as a prudent local authority. The council had budgeted on making Pounds 1m in building fees from the leisure scheme development project in the period 1988-91. Instead it was forced last month to threaten Mr Broome with legal action to recover just over Pounds 170,000 owed for building control and inspection work at the site. As one Tory councillor put it: 'The most important change for Mr Broome is the willingness of the council to indulge him has gone.' The official position of the council is that its role in the whole issue has simply been that of a planning authority, granting Mr Broome building permission and charging him fees for it. In spite of the damaging impact on the landscape of the development, Mr Guy Senior, chairman of the authority's planning committee, said: 'It has not been our responsibility to know what the state of Mr Broome's finances are or were.' Bankers say they know the state of Mr Broome's finances only too well. Their problem, however, is twofold: the Battersea site is probably now worth less than the money they are owed, and even if they became owners of the power station site it would be difficult to know what to do with it.</p>

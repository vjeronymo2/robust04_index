Militant  Chinese pro-democracy activists said they do not expect "sharp  repression" by the authorities as their movement gains more  members and the government shows "restraint" in its reaction.  Christopher, whose visit here was aimed at obtaining a  guarantee for "substantial progress" in China's human rights  record, left Monday without securing any change in Beijing's  position that categorically opposes interference in what it  considers a "private" matter.    Dissident Yang Zhou, 50, who is spokesman for the Chinese  Human Rights Association based in the eastern city of Shanghai,  has said that "no country on its own could put pressure on  China" to change. "China continues to resist external pressures  while within the communist party there is a conservative current  that wants to reassert its power," Yang said in a telephone  interview. "If (U.S. President Bill) Clinton increases  pressure, the democracy movement could suffer further."    University professor Xu Liangying, 73, who was one of seven  intellectuals to sign an "open letter" to Chinese authorities  demanding greater democracy, is resolutely opposed to foreign  pressure on China. "I am Chinese and I don't like foreigners  putting pressure on my country," he said. However, Xu rejects  the official Chinese view that economic development must precede  any improvement in individual freedoms. "A little more than 200  years ago, France and the United States adopted measures in  favor of human rights when their economic state was well below  that of China today."    Ding Zilin, a 57-year-old academic who has also added her  signature to the letter, welcomed "all the support that  foreigners could bring to the democracy movement." She added  however that "improvements in China's human rights cannot be  achieved overnight."    Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 democracy movement  that was crushed at Beijing's Tiananmen Square when troops  opened fire on demonstrators, said: "human rights in China  cannot be accomplished by the Americans or Europeans, only by  Chinese themselves." The leading dissident returned to the  capital Wednesday after several days of "forced vacation" in the  countryside. Before and during Christopher's visit, some 15  well-known dissidents were detained by police with three of them  still behind bars. Yang has been questioned four times since  the beginning of the month, but says he believes that "the  police have changed their attitude towards dissidents in  Shanghai and carry out their work without brutality," showing  "that the government is now more careful in treating the  democracy movement." "The movement comprises many more persons  than before and from all walks of life," Yang said. "We can  speak out publicly to demand the freedom of arrested dissidents.  I myself was able to express my criticisms to the police who  questioned me, which would have been unthinkable a few years  ago."    Three open letters on democracy have been sent to the  Chinese  leadership in the space of a week, and some observers say it is  the biggest act of defiance launched since the 1989  demonstrations. "At the time, the concept of democracy was a  little too abstract. Now the movement is closer to reality,  with more concrete objectives," Yang said. "We have passed from  a clandestine stage to a public stage while trying to proceed in  a legal way." Wang Dan agrees with the description of the  movement's evolution, but adds that "with the progress of  economic reforms, calls in favor of political reform will  multiply." Ding says that "what is happening today is the  continuation of 1989." Her 17-year-old son was killed when  troops opened fire on students at Tiananmen Square. "Before I  wasn't involved in politics. It was the death of my son that  woke me up. I don't want the same thing to happen to other young  Chinese and that is why I wrote that open letter with the other  intellectuals."</p>

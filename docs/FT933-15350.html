			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Scots council reform confirmed THE government yesterday confirmed that it is to sweep away Scotland's two-tier local government structure and replace it with a system of single-tier authorities. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said that 25 unitary authorities were to be created in place of the nine regions and 53 districts of mainland Scotland. The three unitary island councils would be unchanged. Mr Lang was given a noisy reception when he announced his white paper in the House of Commons and several opposition Scottish MPs walked out. By the end of the question and answer session following his statement, Mr Lang was left addressing a virtually deserted chamber. The greatest impact was achieved by Labour which left en masse in a carefully stage-managed publicity stunt. On the controversial question of the possible privatisation of Scotland's water and sewerage services Mr Lang said he planned to create three 'public water authorities' to own and operate 'the current water and sewerage assets'. The new authorities would 'arrange for new investment in ways which will maximise the involvement of the private sector'. Mr Lang said he would consult with interested bodies before producing detailed proposals for legislation. The new map of local authorities - to be known simply as councils - is exactly the same as that leaked to The Scotsman newspaper late last week which provoked fury among the opposition. Strathclyde region, which includes nearly half the Scottish population, will disappear and be broken up into 10 councils. The four Scottish cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will become unitary authorities. Lothian, Tayside, Grampian and Central regions will be broken up. The whole of the Highlands, consisting of a region and eight districts, will become a single council. Stirlingshire is among former counties which will reappear. The new councils will not be of uniform size. The number of police forces and fire brigades is to remain at eight, but joint committees of councils will be set up where they cover more than one area. There will be no joint committees in fields such as education or social work. Legislation to create the councils will be introduced in the next session of parliament. Elections will be held in May 1995 and the new councils will come into existence in May 1996. There will be elections every three years. Mr Lang said that savings of about Pounds 200m over five years could be expected from the new structure. Transitional costs depended on the new authorities but were estimated at between Pounds 120m and Pounds 196m. Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, called the proposals 'the Tory revenge on the Scottish people and on Scottish local government'. Sir David Steel, for the Liberal Democrats, called them 'the most corrupt proposals that have been presented to the House by any government in my time in the House'. Mr Robert Gould and Mrs Jean McFadden, the Labour leaders of Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow District Council respectively, called the proposals 'an act of political vandalism'.</p>

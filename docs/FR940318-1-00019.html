[If such activities have been accomplished prior to conducting the periodic leak check, that leak check shall be recorded as a ``failure'' for purposes of the data required for this request submission. The exception to this is the normally scheduled seal change in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. Performing this scheduled seal change prior to a leak check will not cause that leak check to be recorded as a failure.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for approval of revised leak check intervals may be submitted in any format, provided the data give the same level of assurance specified in this paragraph. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of expediting resolution of requests for revisions to the leak check intervals, the FAA suggests that the requestor summarize the raw data; group the data gathered from different airplanes (of the same model) and drain systems with the same kind of valve; and provide a recommendation from pertinent industry group(s) and/or the manufacturer specifying an appropriate revised leak check interval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (d) For all airplanes: Within 5,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, install a cap on the flush/fill lines for forward, aft, and executive lavatories in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) For any affected airplane acquired after the effective date of this AD: Before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the requirements of this AD, a schedule for the accomplishment of the leak checks required by this AD shall be established in accordance with either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this AD, as applicable. After each leak check has been performed once, each subsequent leak check must be performed in accordance with the new operator's schedule, in accordance with either paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For airplanes previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first leak check to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished in accordance with the previous operator's schedule or with the new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that leak check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For airplanes that have not been previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first leak check to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished prior to further flight, or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA PMI, but within a period not to exceed 200 flight hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.

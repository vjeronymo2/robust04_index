He stayed here at the invitation of Maj-Gen Aleksandr Einseln,  commander of the Estonian defense forces. He had meetings with  President Lennart Meri, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, and Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik. Before leaving, the general gave a brief  news conference at the airport. Marit Pukk reports:    [Pukk] The general assessed his Estonian visit as useful,  first and foremost, from the standpoint of an exchange of  information. What was discussed at the meetings with the  Estonian leaders?    [Begin Johnson recording, in English fading into Estonian  translation] What we've been talking about is developing the  cooperation that already exists between the Estonian defense  forces and NATO... [end recording]    [Pukk] At the meetings there was talk about the  opportunities of strengthening the cooperation between NATO and  Estonian defense forces that already exists. Such is the NATO  Partnership for Peace Program that Estonia has already joined.  Also Estonian defense officers are welcome guests at the  headquarters of the NATO northern group in Norway, and units of  the Estonian defense forces are welcome to participate with the  status as observers at the exercises of NATO forces that take  place in Norway and also in Denmark.

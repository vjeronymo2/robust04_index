			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market edges up from lows despite fears of Iraqi return OIL PRICES edged upwards yesterday after hitting 18-month lows over the weekend, although the market remained nervous about talks between Iraq and the United Nations which are due to begin today . The talks will cover the sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of Iraqi oil to the export market to pay for humanitarian aid. 'We're all biting our nails,' said one oil company trader. Oil prices rose by about 20 cents to Dollars 17.35 a barrel as some market traders suggested that there had been an overreaction to last week's fears of an Iraqi return when prices plunged to Dollars 16.80 a barrel. 'I think the chances of Iraqi oil coming back have improved from zero to say, 12 per cent, it's still not a done deal,' said Mr Vahan Zanoyan, director at Petroleum Finance Company, the management consultants in Washington. Baghdad has signalled that it is softening its hostility to certain conditions attached to the oil sale, such as the monitoring of sales by the UN. The UN has also insisted that it keep the proceeds of the sale for buying food and medicines which it will then distribute. The New York talks are expected to last at least two weeks as they will focus on wide-ranging issues such as Iraq's compliance with UN weapons inspections and Baghdad's treatment of the Kurds. The talks are likely to examine many technical aspects of the UN's conditions. If agreement is reached it could then take more than a month for Iraqi oil to appear on the market. That would give the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries time to hold an emergency meeting to decide how to accommodate 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day in the market. Mr Jean Ping, of Gabon, the present Opec president, has signalled that he sees no immediate need for an emergency meeting and has kept in touch with other ministers by telephone. If the Iraqi oil does not reach the market before the final quarter it will be accommodated more easily as demand for Opec oil is forecast to rise by about 1m b/d by then. The immediate problem for the market is the high level of stocks held in the US and Europe. The International Energy Agency - the west's energy monitoring body - said in its latest oil report that stocks had increased at a rate of 1.4m barrels a day during May. Refineries had been buying forward because of cheap crude prices, it added.</p>

The week-long tour will take him to Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. Talking to newsmen before his  departure, he said Pakistan would offer Central Asian republics  to open up their embassies in Islamabad to help boost bilateral  cooperation. Pakistan has already concluded about 38 agreements  with these states for strengthening cooperation in a number of  fields. He said no progress could be made on the agreements due  to lack of follow up, and during his current visit he would try  to remove blockages and revitalize them. Special attention  would be paid to matters relating to trade, transport, and  communications. He said Pakistan and China have agreed to sign  an agreement to make Karakoram Highway a viable road and there  is a plan to open it up for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in future.</p>

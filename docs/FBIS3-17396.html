In addition, according to the head of the presidential  administration, recognizing the bilateral accord between the  federal authorities and Tatarstan as a general basis was yet  another condition for starting talks between Russia and  Chechnya. Instead, the Chechen side put forward its own version  of the treaty, Filatov stated. At that point the meeting was  suspended. The talks can be resumed only if the above  conditions are accepted, the head of presidential administration  stressed.    Also, Filatov noted that the Chechen side had proposed to  hold a meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev. The meeting would be premature  until fundamental issues are solved, he believes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, June 13 (TANJUG) -- German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Monday that Germany would try, as  president of the European Union in the second half of this year,  to have the Yugoslav crisis brought as close as possible to a  resolution.    Presenting the objectives of Germany's mandate to the press,  Kinkel was asked by the TANJUG correspondent if there were real  possibilities for the crisis to be resolved during Germany's  term in office, Kinkel said that it would be wonderful if this  happened. Kinkel observed, however, that because of the  complications of the Yugoslav crisis, it would be too much to  pledge to do this. In any case Germany will, together with its  international partners, wholeheartedly act for the Yugoslav  crisis to be fully resolved as soon as possible, he said.    To confirm his thesis that much has already been done in  that  respect, Kinkel listed the ceasefire (between Croats and Serbs)  in Krajina and the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina --  the agreement on a one-month cessation of hostilities, the  establishment of safe areas, including Sarajevo, the placing of  Mostar under European Union [EU] administration, the founding of  the Moslem-Croat federation and the joint actions by  international negotiators within the contact group for  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    There is the intention in the international community,  Kinkel  said, for the one-month ceasefire in Bosnia, which became  effective on Friday, to be used as an incentive for seeking a  lasting peace solution.    Interpreting the E.U. policy, Minister at Britain's Foreign  Office Heathcoat Amory said that the E.U. plan for resolving the  Yugoslav and Bosnian crises remains the pillar around which all  peace talks are based. Asked by TANJUG to comment statements  that the plan had been somewhat altered, the British minister  said that the changes were in the sense of negotiations on maps  of the territorial delimitation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but did  not explain if this meant that the E.U. plan could be  interpreted differently by each side and accepted only up to a  certain, suitable, point.    Asked if the international contact group for Bosnia could  still be considered as a united body following a United States  House of Representatives decision to exempt Moslems from the  international arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, since the  group's unity was underscored as its main asset in the talks,  Amory answered with a general statement that the international  community was using all available means which could, in his  assessment, contribute to a peace solution.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTO REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FOCUS EAST' IS SOMETIMES POSED, OFTEN EXTRAORDINARY  </P> <P> Ah, the romance of the Middle East.  </P> <P> Four exotic-looking female "orange merchants" pose sensuously for the camera  behind shallow wicker baskets laden with fruit. One woman, most of her face  veiled, balances four plump oranges in a pyramid on her palm.  </P> <P> The image is redolent of a region that, despite violent strife, still resonates  on many levels as a home of fabulous sheiks, Arabs on camels, seductive women,  the biblical Holy Land and the seat of Western civilization.  </P> <P> This romantic image was even more pronounced in the Western world during the  mid-19th Century, when a vogue in Middle Eastern culture erupted, especially in  Europe. Fueled in part by countries such as France and Great Britain, which  sought to expand their empires in the region, and by the engineering of the  Suez Canal, attention focused on this portion of the world.  </P> <P> Scores of professional and amateur photographers descended to practice their  new craft as governments commissioned surveys of the region, the people and its  historic landmarks.  </P> <P> English, French, Italian, Spanish and German commercial photographers found a  ready market in Europe for their images of the Middle East. Tourists also tried  their hands at the bulky early cameras.  </P> <P> The Mideast afforded a proving ground for photography, which dates from 1839,  as thousands of images were made to feed a ravenous hunger for information  about this fabled land.  </P> <P> "Focus East: Early Photography in the Middle East, 1839-1885," is a huge --  even daunting -- exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Photographic Arts that  offers more than 200 images from this period.  </P> <P> The exhibit, organized by Nissan Perez, curator of photography for the Israel  Museum in Jerusalem, opened at that museum in 1988. The extensive show offers  many 19th-Century views of much of the Middle East.  </P> <P> We see boatloads of European visitors being rowed ashore, arriving in fancy  carriages at a hotel, or "roughing it" in tents in the Holy Land.  </P> <P> Subjects range from religious sites such as the Jordan River, the Via Dolorosa  and the Garden of Gethsemane, to Egyptian landmarks such as the Pyramid of  Cheops and the myriad Mideast people.  </P> <P> One of the most beautiful of the pictures is titled "First Cataract of the  Nile," by Ottoman photographer J. Pascal Sebah. Sebah positioned his camera  right at the river's edge. Because the shutter speed was too slow to stop the  action of the river, the image is of a blurred, foamy torrent flying over the  rocky bed.  </P> <P> In researching the exhibition, Perez concluded that most of the European  photographers romanticized the Middle East and that different nationalities  portrayed the region differently. The images on view bear him out.  </P> <P> The English photographers had a more restrained view, maintaining a cool  distance from Middle Easterners. The French concentrated on the romance of the  region, and tended to set up photographs that fit with fictional literary  accounts of the region. Those photographers who are near to or from the region,  such as Sebah, gave a more accurate picture of the common people.  </P> <P> However, some key information about the images that Perez ferreted out during  the six years he spent organizing the show is not on the walls but in a $50  book. For instance, he notes in the book that a man identified in an 1875  picture as the chief rabbi of Jerusalem is the same figure recorded by  Frenchman Felix Bonfils as a common laborer. Bonfils and others, he said,  resorted to models to give waiting Europeans the pictures they wanted.  </P> <P> Although a number of images by Italian and French photographers were supposedly  captured "live," such as the orange merchants by Italian Carlo Naya, they are  actually posed tableaux vivants.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the exhibit has many exquisite images. Armenian photographer G.  Likegian captured the still beauty of a group of minarets. Louis de Clercq's  "View of the New Bridge" in Tripoli is a soothing inner-city landscape showing  the comfortable arches of the bridge, the soft curve of the winding river and  buildings stacked up a distant hill.  </P> <P> Considering the exhibit's subject matter, its awesome size and Americans'  reportedly limited knowledge of geography, a couple of additions could aid the  weary museum visitor. A large map of the Mideast, marking the names of the  places photographed, would be helpful.  </P> <P> Benches to allow viewers to rest during their trek through the scores of  photographs would be appreciated also. In the absence of places to sit in the  museum, a suggestion: Viewers may wish to take a quick spin through the show to  acclimate themselves, get a cup of coffee, think about what they have seen,  then dive back in again.  </P> <P> "Focus East" continues through Sept. 10 at the Museum of Photographic Arts in  Balboa Park.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Orestes Quercia disclosed the tone of his campaign  for the presidency of Republic.    During a meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] regional leadership in Sao Paulo, Quercia said he will  not play nice during the campaign, and on 21 February he already  started attacking his possible adversaries in the presidential  succession.    The main targets of Quercia's attacks were Deputy Antonio  Britto, Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes, and Mayor Paulo Maluf.    Quercia's candidacy enjoys the support of most of the  members  of the regional PMDB leadership; however, he does not have the  support of the federal bloc nor of the deputies who back  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ TAP ENSEMBLE STEPS BACK INTO TOWN  </P> <P> As dancers from Jazz Tap Ensemble rehearse for its first hometown season in two  years (tonight through Sunday and April 21-23 at the Morgan-Wixson Theater in  Santa Monica), they convey a subtle sense of musicians improvising after hours  in an empty nightclub. While the pianist lays down a blues track, their tapping  offers moody counterpoint, the two art forms weaving in an acoustic entity.  </P> <P> That mutuality of dancers and musicians -- what founder/artistic director Lynn  Dally calls the "jazz combo concept" -- has characterized Jazz Tap's work for  the last 10 years. This has been a decade of extensive national and  international touring, several changes of personnel, the occasional use of such  guest artists as Honi Coles and Gregory Hines, evolution of choreography and  financial ups and downs.  </P> <P> But the rhythm tap group is now launched on what promises to be a busy and  productive anniversary year, following several months of economic woes.  </P> <P> Dally looks back at those problems and says, "They weren't unusual in this  field and in these times. It's about money, and you can never escape it.  Running any dance company is a constant fight about where to find the next loan  or foundation source. Touring costs are horrendous, arts funding has been cut  and a lot of sponsors are less able to take a risk and present challenging  programs.  </P> <P> "We're coming off a deficit situation caused by an accumulation of many things.  When you're just hanging on, all you have to do is make two or three not-wise  business decisions and suddenly you're in trouble. For example, we spent $5,000  we really couldn't afford on a promotional video that didn't turn out well."  </P> <P> Another compounding factor, Dally notes, was that bookings were off during this  period. "Sometimes we get booked as a novelty and in that sense shifted aside  from the mainstream. As a novelty you have to wait several years before someone  brings you back. And what's really ironic is that sometimes we're called  'non-traditional,' when we're very much in the middle, using two American art  forms: jazz and tap."  </P> <P> Another irony is that Jazz Tap is better known in its tour cities than in Los  Angeles, an economic fact of life Dally would like to change by establishing a  home base here. Through stringent cost-cutting measures, she and her board of  directors have reversed the deficit and are striving toward greater local  visibility.  </P> <P> With a new booking agent, choreography commissions and some helpful grants from  the National Endowment for the Arts and California Arts Council, Dally said she  feels Jazz Tap is back on track. She has, in fact, expanded the group by adding  trumpeter Stacy Rowles and dancer Mark Mendonca, 19, from Berkeley.  </P> <P> Why change the configuration of three dancers and three musicians? "I've been  doing this work long enough to begin to feel some urgency about passing it on  and providing a setting for someone else," Dally says. "Now that we've made a  connection with older dancers like Harold Nicholas and Jimmy Slyde, who have  guested with us (Eddie Brown will guest in the upcoming season), I want to  expand with younger people.  </P> <P> "Aesthetically, I like having more ages in the group because it's interesting  to choreograph that way. Mark is raw and young but he has a combination of  skill, information and musical intuition that makes him right for this group.  He can relate to what we're doing."  </P> <P> Mendonca, who began with Jazz Tap in February, says he is excited about joining  the group he has admired since he was 12. A tap dancer for 13 years, with some  ballet and jazz training, he has concentrated on a cappella tap improvisation  for the past few years and said he brings a different style to the group.  </P> <P> "My movement is less perfect than their jazz, ballet and modern dance," he  says. "My eye sees different shapes in movement than the others do -- it's from  my background, all those hours of improvising.  </P> <P> "As for my rhythm, I play fewer notes with my feet and I give them stronger  accents. It fits in with what the group does because it works musically.  Rhythms don't go wrong." After 10 years, Dally said that Jazz Tap has deepened.  "We're better rhythm dancers now," she says. "What we do is more refined, it  has a greater dynamic and a deeper musicality. It's not that our style is  changing, it's that the possibilities are greater for me as a choreographer.  Our evolution depends on the different qualities and styles of the people in  front of me."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q&amp;A: HOW TO USE THE 'OVER-55' TAX BREAK WHEN MOVING TO LESS  COSTLY HOME  </P> <P> QUESTION: We own our house, which should sell for about $275,000. As it only  cost us about $40,000 many years ago, we want to shelter as much of our  $235,000 profit from tax as possible. Although our plans are indefinite, we  might buy a retirement home in Arizona or Florida. Is there any way we can  shelter more than $125,000 of our profit from taxes?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Yes. I'll presume you or your spouse are 55 or older, have owned and  lived in the principal residence at least three of the five years before its  sale and have never used the $125,000 home-sale tax exemption before.  </P> <P> When you claim this tax break on IRS Form 2119, you can subtract the $125,000  exemption from your $275,000 adjusted (net after selling expenses) sales price  to arrive at a $150,000 "revised adjusted sales price." Then you can use the  "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034.  </P> <P> This tax break, available to principal residence sellers of any age, says you  can defer the tax on the remaining $110,000 of your sale profit if you buy a  replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost ($150,000) within 24  months before or after the sale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Builders Often Negotiate on Extras  </P> <P> Q: My wife insists that we buy a brand-new home rather than a resale house. We  have looked at about a dozen new houses so far and the salespeople absolutely  refuse to negotiate on price. But I have heard the sales of new homes are very  slow. How can we negotiate on the price of new homes?  </P> <P> A: Home builders are extremely reluctant to cut the prices of their new homes.  The reason is the lower sales prices will cut the appraised values of future  home sales in that builder's development.  </P> <P> However, builders will negotiate on what is to be included in the sales price.  Rather than reduce the price, home builders will include extras such as  landscaping, appliances and upgrades such as carpets, mirrors and decorating.  It won't hurt to ask.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borrower Can Set Up Biweekly Schedule  </P> <P> Q: I work in a large office. One of my co-workers has a part-time job where she  sets up biweekly mortgage plans for homeowners. She showed me how I can cut my  30-year mortgage down to about 20 years and save thousands of dollars of  interest.  </P> <P> The catch is her company will convert my mortgage into a biweekly loan and a  national bank will automatically withdraw a loan payment from my checking  account every two weeks. But it will cost me $475 to set up this program. Do  you think it is worth it?  </P> <P> A: Why pay someone else to do something that you can do for yourself? There are  many biweekly mortgage conversion programs being marketed by various  organizations. It is true you can save thousands of dollars by paying off your  30-year mortgage as if it were a 20-year mortgage. Better yet, if you can  afford the increased payment you could pay off your mortgage in 15 years and  save thousands of dollars more.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose you have a $100,000 home loan for 30 years at 10%  interest with a $877.58 monthly payment. If you want to pay off that loan in 20  years, increase your monthly payment to $965.03. However, if you prefer to pay  off the mortgage in 15 years, the monthly payment will be $1,074.61, or almost  $200 per month more than you are now paying. The savings will be thousands of  dollars.  </P> <P> But you don't need your co-worker's help to do this. Just ask your lender how  much you need to increase your monthly payment to pay off your mortgage in the  number of years you desire.  </P> <P> The idea behind the biweekly mortgage plans is you make 13 monthly payments  each year instead of 12, thus paying off the loan in just over 20 years. But  why pay someone $475 to set up the plan and let a bank earn huge profits on  your money while it is being accumulated for the 13th payment?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like Kind' Exchange for Sale of Apartment  </P> <P> Q: I live in one apartment of a four-apartment building I want to sell. As I  have a profit of over $100,000 and am not yet age 55 and eligible for that  "over 55 rule" you often discuss, what is the best way to avoid profit tax, so  I can buy a single-family house?  </P> <P> A: For income tax purposes you will be making a sale of one building with two  tax consequences. You can defer the profit from the sale of the apartment where  you live (by buying a replacement residence of equal or greater cost within 24  months before or after the sale), but the profit on the sale of the three  rental apartments will be taxable.  </P> <P> However, to avoid tax on your entire profit, you can move out of your  apartment, rent it to tenants, and then make a "like kind" IRC 1031  tax-deferred exchange for a rental house. Later, you can convert the rental  house into your personal residence without paying profit tax since no sale  occurred.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the tax law does not specify how long you must rent your  apartment before exchanging or how long the house must be rented before you can  convert it into your residence. But most tax advisers suggest renting at least  six to 12 months and through the end of the tax year. Your tax adviser can give  you further information.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Property Owner Keeps Lease-Option Benefits  </P> <P> Q: The market for home sales in our town is soft now, and I have seen several  houses offered for sale on lease-options. Upon inquiry, it appears the  lease-option is a great way for a home buyer to try out a home by renting it  and to build up a down payment in the form of a rent credit. But are there any  income tax deductions for the renter before the purchase option is exercised?  </P> <P> A: No. During the lease-option term, the property owner retains the income tax  deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, operating expenses and  depreciation. However, the lease-option tenant is compensated for the lack of  income tax deductions by receiving a rent credit for part or all of the rent  paid. In addition, the non-refundable consideration for the option also is  usually credited toward the buyer's down payment. Ask your tax adviser to  explain further.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fixed-Rate Mortgage Offers Fewer Risks  </P> <P> Q: We are in the process of buying a new home and have talked to mortgage  lenders about fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. The best fixed-rate  mortgage we found is slightly below 11% interest. But the best adjustable-rate  mortgage we can find starts at 8% for six months and then jumps to 2.5% above  the 11th District Cost of Funds Index, which is currently 8.26%.  </P> <P> If the index stays the same, in six months, we will be paying just about the  same cost as the fixed-rate mortgage. I don't see any advantage in the  adjustable-rate mortgage, or am I blind?  </P> <P> A: You understand the picture very well. If you can qualify for a fixed-rate  mortgage, take it. Adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers take the risk rates might  go up. Of course, they might come down. But fixed-rate borrowers also have a  risk that rates might decline substantially. If that happens, they can  refinance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Advantage of Small Down Payment  </P> <P> Q: When you recently answered a question about why home buyers should make a  small down payment when buying a home, in addition to the income tax and  leverage advantages, why didn't you mention the advantage of the homeowner  having cash in the bank instead of having it tied up in home equity?  </P> <P> A: Shame on me for forgetting that major benefit. Frankly, I think leverage is  the major advantage of making a small down payment on a home.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose you bought a $100,000 home five years ago with a $10,000  down payment and a $90,000 mortgage. If that home appreciated just 3% in each  of the last five years, today it would be worth $115,926. That $15,926 profit  is more than 150% of the $10,000 investment or 30% each year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Title Insurance Limited in Boundary Disputes  </P> <P> Q: My neighbor claims my garage encroaches on her property five inches and she  wants me to move my garage. I contacted the title insurance company, and they  refuse to help me because I did not have a survey made at the time I purchased  my house about six years ago. What should I do?  </P> <P> A: Consult a real estate attorney. The title insurance company is correct that  title insurance does not insure boundary locations unless a survey was made and  the survey is insured, often at an extra cost.  </P> <P> However, in most states there is a relatively short statute of limitations for  encroachments. If the garage encroaches and it has done so for many years, it  may be too late for the neighbor to assert her claim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lease-Option May Help Tough-to-Sell Unit  </P> <P> Q: For the last three months, my condo has been listed for sale. It is priced  reasonably according to comparable condo sales prices. The agent seems to be  doing a good job. She advertises the house several times a week and holds an  open house every other weekend. But no offers so far. I've got to move out of  town next month. Do you think I should rent the condo instead of selling it?  </P> <P> A: No. If you will be moving away, managing a rental from a long distance is  not easy. A better alternative would be a one-year lease with option to  purchase. For example, try running a classified want ad such as "$3,000 MOVES  YOU IN. Spacious condo (describe it). All your rent applies to down payment on  purchase. Call for details (phone number)."  </P> <P> Be prepared for your phone to ring. However, be sure to check out the  tenant-buyer's references very carefully because you don't want any  long-distance problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Save Equity by Selling Before Foreclosure  </P> <P> Q: Our townhouse will go to foreclosure sale next month. My wife and I are  getting a divorce and neither of us wants to make up the almost $3,500 of  defaulted payments. But we have about $15,000 equity in the townhouse that we  hate to lose. Any ideas?  </P> <P> A: First, let's face the facts. You don't have $15,000 equity. You have a  $15,000 equity minus the $3,500 it will take to cure the mortgage default.  Another problem is you need to get the lender's cooperation to let a buyer take  over the existing mortgage.  </P> <P> After you have gotten the lender's cooperation for a loan assumption to a  qualified buyer, run a newspaper classified ad such as "Foreclosure Loss. Pay  just $10,000 to take over mortgage on a delightful townhouse. . . ."  </P> <P> From the $10,000 the $3,500 arrearage must be paid before the buyer can obtain  marketable title, so you and your ex-wife will only net about $6,500. But  that's better than the nothing you will receive after the foreclosure sale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use Big Earnest Deposit in Making Low Offer  </P> <P> Q: The house next door to mine is for sale. I want to buy it as an investment  and to control who lives near me. But the owner's asking price is outrageous.  What is the best technique for getting an offer accepted even though it is far  below the asking price?  </P> <P> A: A big earnest money deposit can be very influential to get a seller to  accept a low offer. When the seller sees your large deposit check on the  kitchen table, he knows you are a serious buyer. But a small deposit check with  a low offer probably would be a waste of time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Can Be Deferred on Sale of 2 Homes  </P> <P> Q: I recently married a woman who owns a condo that she plans to sell. I own a  small house where we now live, but I want to sell so we can buy a nicer home  together. Although we will be selling two residences, is there any way we can  defer tax on both sales?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code  1034 is available to you. If you buy a replacement principal residence within  24 months before or after the sales, costing at least as much as the total  adjusted (net) sales prices of your two former principal residences, then both  of you qualify for tax deferral on your sale profits.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose your wife's condo sells for $100,000 and your house  sells for $125,000. If you together buy a new principal residence costing at  least $225,000 in this example, then you must defer tax on the sale of both  former principal residences. Please consult your tax adviser for further  details.  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Coal pension fund may be split THE GOVERNMENT is proposing to split British Coal's Pounds 13.5bn pension assets into two separate funds for past and present employees as part of the planned privatisation of the company. Under proposals put forward for comment yesterday the Department of Trade and Industry said that the needs of existing employees differed from those of pensioners, and that the new funds should be structured accordingly. A choice of arrangements was proposed for pensioners. They could have a closed scheme in which the government would guarantee inflation-linked pensions and ensure the scheme's solvency. The government would share in any surpluses, however, and would be involved in investment decisions. Alternatively the government would provide no guarantees, but members would not have to share future valuation surpluses with it. Two new pension schemes would be set up for existing employees, following from present arrangements which have separate schemes for supervisory grades and industrial employees. Each scheme would be required by statute to provide the same package of benefits as before. The new schemes would operate on an industry-wide basis. Employees would be free to choose whether to join a scheme, take out a personal pension or join another scheme operated by their new employer. Only British Coal employees who were contributing members of the main schemes up to privatisation would be able to join an industry-wide scheme. Employers would be responsible for making good any deficits in these schemes. It would be up to employers to decide on the pension arrangements for people joining the coal industry after privatisation. Yesterday's proposals do not say how the present funds should be divided between the new schemes. The DTI said it would have to be satisfied that the interests of beneficiaries, employers and the taxpayer were satisfied. The proposals were welcomed by the trustees of the British Coal staff superannuation scheme. They described it as 'a first step, representing very substantial progress in meeting the concerns of our members'. much work would be needed to reach agreement on the details, however. The pension funds have 577,000 members, more than 95 per cent of them current or deferred pensioners. In June there were only 29,000 contributing employees.</p>

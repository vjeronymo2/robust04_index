			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lionel Barber: "Brussels Recommends Trade </F> Benefits Overhaul"]    [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission yesterday  recommended an overhaul of trade benefits for around 60  developing countries, with new incentives for improving  environmental and labour standards.    The guidelines are part of a review of the generalised  system  of preferences [GSP] which grants tariff advantages to  developing countries to help them export to the EU [European  Union] market.    The GSP review, which takes place every 10 years, is part of  a wide-ranging Brussels effort to update trade policy toward the  developing world.    The Commission is waiting to hear views from EU ministers  and  the European Parliament before it decides on how to apply the  new GSP scheme to specific countries and sectors. But the broad  outlines of reform are already clear ahead of the Commission's  ambitious deadline of January 1 1995 for starting the new scheme.    First, the Commission wants to offer extra trade benefits to  encourage countries to pursue sound environmental policies and  follow international labour agreements on the lines of the ILO  [International Labour Organisation] convention. Brussels  officials argue that this amounts to "positive" discrimination  which should not therefore arouse opposition from GATT.    Mr Pierre Defraigne, senior Commission official in charge of  North-South relations, added that Brussels had deliberately  underlined the link between social and environmental policies  and trade.    Second, the new guidelines are supposed to be simpler to  manage. Starting with GATT's Most Favoured Nation [MFN] status  as a baseline, Brussels wants to offer new flexible rates which  will decline progressively from 50 per cent, 75 per cent and 100  per cent of MFN.    Third, the goal is to reduce the number of countries  eligible  for GSP, with "super-competitors" such as fast-growing East  Asian economies dropping out of the running. The criteria for  GSP eligibility will be per capital GDP and the proportion of  manufacturing for exports which directly competes with European  products in the EU market.    Fourth, the Commission wants to introduce a safeguard clause  which will be "very close to the GATT safety clause," said Mr  Defraigne. This would operate against as yet unidentified  "sensitive" products.</p>

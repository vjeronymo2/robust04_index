			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Betterware's 21% rise fails to impress City SHARES IN Betterware yesterday fell 23p to 192p, despite the home shopping company reporting a 21 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, put down his glass and wailed: 'I don't understand the stock market and I don't suppose I ever will.' The board, which brought forward publication of the results in a bid to halt a share price drop from its high for the year of 280p, declared an interim dividend of 0.65p (0.5p), payable from earnings of 5p (4.29p) per share. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.3m) in the 28 weeks to September 11 on turnover of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 29.4m), including door-to-door sales of household products up at Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 23m). The company's sales force, which now reaches 45 per cent of the population once every eight weeks, increased by 1,000 to an average of 10,000 with revenue steady at roughly Pounds 8 per order. Mr Cohen said he had failed to reassure some in the City about the company's ambitious plans to expand in continental Europe, although half year sales in the French operations - launched in 1991 - had exceeded Pounds 1m, giving trading profits of Pounds 100,000. Betterware has recently started selling in Spain and is set to move into Germany in its next financial year. 'We don't seem to be able to reassure them. I am so bloody frustrated,' Mr Cohen said, crumpling up his napkin. He was unrepentant about the sale of 13 per cent of his family's then 63 per cent stake in June which precipitated the fall in the share price. Yesterday he said firmly: 'I am in the business of owning Betterware shares in the long term. If the shares continue to drop I will buy them back.' Operating profits from the main direct selling division expanded 20 per cent to Pounds 6.99m (Pounds 5.86m), a slower rate than the 23 per cent rise in sales. Its other division, a miscellany of consumer products manufacture and coffee shops held for sale, returned operating profits of Pounds 151,000 (Pounds 140,000) on sales down at Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 6.37m). COMMENT Betterware's expansion into Europe comes too late to compensate for a slowdown in UK sales growth, dropping from 25 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter to July to 19 per cent for the first half. The Cohen family's unhappily handled share sale, which opened the way for a bear raid, and results just below best expectations left the City expecting more than yesterday's business-as-usual presentation. Analysts shaved pre-tax profit forecasts to about Pounds 16m from a maximum of Pounds 18m which puts the company on a multiple of 18.8, roughly in line with the stores sector.</p>

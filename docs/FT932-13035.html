			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Emu star unruffled by market strains: Duisenberg says currency union plans are on track WITH an easy manner, rugged looks and a shock of white hair, Mr Wim Duisenberg has the appearance of an ageing film star. As a leading light in the European soap opera of moves to economic and monetary union (Emu), he will have plenty of opportunity to be centre stage in the months ahead. Chairman of the European Community's committee of central bank governors and head of the Dutch central bank, Mr Duisenberg appears unruffled by recent currency market strains. He welcomes last week's cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank as giving Europe a 'psychological boost'. Mr Duisenberg, who is today giving his views about the European economy at the launch in Amsterdam of the Dutch bank's annual report, reckons plans for European monetary union are on track, even though he believes only a relatively small group of 'core' EC nations may join the first phase of full currency union with one central bank. The 57-year-old economist stands out in the somewhat staid central-banking community for his colourful and direct comments. He is probably one of the leading candidates for the future presidency of a pan-European central bank, assuming it is set up according to the Maastricht schedule towards the end of this decade. Mr Duisenberg once described the Bundesbank as being 'like whipped cream: the more you beat it the harder it gets'. Last week he ruffled feathers in London by criticising the UK government for not playing by the rules during its short-lived tenure in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. An apostle of open government, who was called in by a Labour-led Dutch government in the 1970s for a five-year spell as finance minister, Mr Duisenberg has for some time invited 10,000 school or university students a year into the Dutch central bank to introduce them to high finance. He took over as bank governor 12 years ago and is looking forward to a third seven-year term. As for Emu, he is playing his part by presiding over a mass of technical work by the EC's central banks, including the design for a pan-European banknote, in preparation for this event. Next month in Denmark he will present to EC finance ministers an account drawn by the governors' committee of what went wrong during the currency crisis between last September and early this year. He looks only slightly perturbed when asked to recall these events, which pushed the UK and Italy out of the ERM. The central bank chief says the pound is welcome back into the ERM, even though if Britain wants to succeed in a future re-entry it would do well to follow the lead of Germany and Holland by making the Bank of England rather than government ministers responsible for monetary policy. Mr Duisenberg gives the impression of being an Anglophile - he once wrote a thesis on the UK's balance of payments - and says he sympathises with Britain's predicament. Because of the large mortgage debts among householders and the preponderance of variable-rate rather than fixed-rate borrowing, decisions about short-term interest rates have much bigger political implications in Britain than in most other European nations. Even so, an independent Bank would be a vital step in increasing financial markets' confidence. He believes that as a trading nation Britain stands to gain by being part of a single-currency area, even with the inevitable loss of sovereignty and historical wrench. 'The Netherlands once had an empire too,' he quips.</p>

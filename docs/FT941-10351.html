			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Tokyo lays groundwork for US talks Japan's draft budget for 1994, published today, is expected to rein in current spending but increase allocations for public works projects. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will discuss the budget with US president Bill Clinton tomorrow in Washington along with Japan's Y15,250bn (Pounds 91bn) economic pump-priming package. Japanese businesses have given the stimulus package, announced on Tuesday, a good reception. But the fact that Mr Hosokawa was obliged to tone down plans for a permanent income tax cut, to reconcile a government split on tax reform, disappointed the financial markets, contributing to a 2 per cent decline in Tokyo share prices yesterday. The government's official economic forecaster yesterday predicted that Mr Hosokawa's pump priming measures will deliver a sharp recovery this year. However, this scenario drew widespread scepticism. The Economic Planning Agency believes gross national product would grow by 2.6 per cent in the fiscal year to March 1995, a figure it admits is more of a target than than an exact prediction. Yesterday, the agency belatedly slashed its GNP growth forecast for the current year to the end of March, from 3.3 per cent to 0.2 per cent. Even Mr Hosokawa appeared sceptical at the scale of the upturn predicted by the EPA, pointing out that there is a gap between the government and private economic forecasts. The consensus among private sector economists in Tokyo is for a fraction of a percentage point slight decline in GNP this fiscal year, turning to a rise of around 1 per cent next year. The EPA's target is based on a 2.4 per cent rise in domestic consumption and a 5.2 per cent rise in private sector investment on homes in the year to March 1995. Private sector forecasts had taken into account the Y5,850bn tax cut in the package, but not the remaining Y9,400bn in public works spending, cheap home and business loans and grants, explained an EPA official. However, the EPA forecasts slow growth in industrial investment in plant and equipment, up 0.1 per cent next year, from an estimated 7.2 per cent decline in the current 12 months. Gloom on the industrial outlook was reinforced yesterday by a 25.1 per cent decline in machine tool orders to a 10-year low in 1993, reported by the Japan machine tool builders' association. By contrast, evidence of a continued improvement in one consumer sector emerged with a 57.5 per cent increase in sales of condominiums in Tokyo last month, according to the real estate economy institute. That represents the 13th monthly rise running, helped by low home loan interest rates and a continued fall in property prices. See Editorial Comment</p>

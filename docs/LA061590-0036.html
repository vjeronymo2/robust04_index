			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HORTON PLAZA TO PUT CURBS ON FREE PARKING  </P> <P> Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego is changing its parking policy to discourage  non-shoppers from using the parking structure, said Craig Pettitt, general  manager of the plaza.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, those parking in the 2,400-car structure will still get  three free hours of parking, but will have to get their parking tickets  validated by any of the merchants in the mall.  </P> <P> Shoppers have to make a purchase to get validation, but there is no minimum  amount.  </P> <P> Customers now are often turned away because people who work in the area are  taking advantage of the three free hours of parking, Pettitt said Thursday in a  press conference at the mall.  </P> <P> "If we are turning away customers, obviously we are turning away dollars," he  said.  </P> <P> Of the 3 million cars that used the parking structure last year, 20% to 30%  were not shoppers, Pettitt said.  </P> <P> As a result, the structure had to be closed 110 times, for varying lengths of  time, last year.  </P> <P> "Our ultimate goal is to never close the parking structure," Pettitt said.  </P> <P> The new policy goes into effect July 2, he said.  </P> <P> Validated parking will cost $1 per half hour after the three free hours.  Nonvalidated parking will cost $1 per half hour and will no longer be free  after 5 p.m. Pettitt criticized nearby merchants not located in Horton Plaza  who encourage their customers -- often in advertisements -- to use Horton  garage.  </P></p>

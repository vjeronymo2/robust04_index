			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>   [Text] The Senate of the Republic -- bunting on the podium,  silver eagle laid on the presidium -- yesterday observed  solemnly a minute of silence in memory of Luis Donaldo Colosio,  senator on sabbatical and murdered PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate.    And it approved by 50 votes from the largest political  forces  of the country -- including PAN [National Action Party] Senator  Hector Teran Teran, who did not attend the session in order to  be part of the honor guard of politicians at Colosio's funeral  -- reforms to Article 41 of the Constitution of the United  Mexican States. Upon expanding the autonomy of the electoral  mechanisms of the country, this reform makes electoral  mechanisms citizen-oriented.    The reforms to Paragraphs 8, 9, 17, and 18 of the  aforementioned article were approved with the participation of  49 [number as published] senators -- all dressed completely  black except Nuevo Leon Senator Maria Elena Chiapas, who wore a  black and white silk dress. Henceforth, Article 41 shall read  as follows:    "The organization of federal elections is a state function  that is carried out by an autonomous public agency, furnished  with legal status and its own resources. It is formed by the  Executive and Legislative Branches of the union, with the  participation of national political parties and citizens, as  established by the law. In exercising such state functions,  certitude, legality, independence, impartiality, and objectivity  will be guiding principles."    Additionally, "the public agency will handle electoral  matters, will be professional in its performance, and will make  its decisions independently; its structure will consist of  direction, executive, technical, and surveillance mechanisms.  The higher direction body will be made up of counselors and  citizen counselors appointed by the Legislative and Executive  Branches, as well as representatives appointed by the political  parties. The executive and technical mechanisms will have  qualified personnel necessary to provide professional electoral  service. The surveillance mechanisms will consist mostly of  representatives of the national political parties. The direction  board of polling stations will be formed by citizens."  <H5>  Independent Judges and Magistrates </H5>   The reforms consider that "the Federal Electoral Tribunal  will organize itself under the terms established by law. For  carrying out its duties, it will have bodies of magistrates and  judges, who will be independent and will only respond to the  mandate of the law. The magistrates of the tribunal must satisfy  the requirements established by law, which will be no less than  those established by this Constitution to be a justice of the  Supreme Court. They will be elected by two-thirds vote of the  members of the Chamber of Deputies present, after being  nominated by the president of the Republic.    "The citizens counselors of the higher direction organ must  satisfy the requirements established by law and will be elected  by receiving two-thirds of the vote of the members of the  Chamber of Deputies present. The counselors will be elected  from the lists of nominees proposed by legislative groups in the  very Chamber. The law will establish the corresponding  regulation and procedure."    The reforms, which presidential candidate Cuahutemoc  Cardenas  Solorzano termed insufficient, brought about differences between  him and Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the PRD [Party of the  Democratic Revolution], it was learned last 18 March at a  crowded PRD rally in the Central Plaza.    Commenting on those differences, Munoz Ledo said yesterday  "some feel the direct representation of the public powers should  be entirely out of the electoral organism."    He added "that is where the country is likely to head, but  for now the parties agreed to let the Executive Branch official  in charge of the country's internal affairs remain the chairman  of that organism although "now without casting the tie-breaking  votes, and proposal to formalize a tradition that has been in  practice until now, namely, to use his right to vote in the  deliberations of this corps."    "Majority and minority representatives from the two  congressional chambers, where the parties can state their views  through their representatives," also remain. "I must emphasize  this because a very important step has been taken, meaning the  political parties will no longer have the right to vote, only to  state their views, in the organization. Thus, they will no  longer be judge and jury in their own favor."    Munoz Ledo added: "In our opinion, we abide by the principle  we adopted by consensus. Unfortunately, this could not be done  in the 1989 legislative period. According to the principle, no  formal or informal party or government-party coalition will have  a predetermined majority in the electoral organization."    He said: "Six highly respected and honorable citizens will  be  confirmed by two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies.  These citizens will be elected by consensus among the parties  and they will be a result of the two chambers' actual  configuration."    Munoz Ledo said he is "certain the reform, which firmly  points toward the citizens' participation in electoral  organizations, will allow the operation of subordinate agencies;  abolish bureaucracy and unfair attitudes; and, if its  implementation is correct, help increase the citizens'  confidence in the elections."    Carlos Jimenez Macias, directorate board chairman for this  period of sessions, said that -- with these reforms -- "our  legislation acquires a modern dimension which places it among  the most advanced in the world, and among the ones which offer a  higher degree of certainty."    He said: "Within this important debate, legislators  protected ideological pluralism -- which is characteristic of a  democracy -- and the lofty dignity which corresponds to their  investiture."    The ceremony ended once the reform was approved, thus ending  the second special period of congress sessions.</p>

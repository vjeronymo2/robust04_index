			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Long View: New life for unit trusts Unit trust companies are having a wonderful year. While rival savings media such as life assurance or even building societies are finding it hard to repeat last year's savings inflows the unit trusts are pulling in record amounts of new money. For instance, the June figures just published showed net unit trust sales of a record Pounds 1.1bn and the second quarter pulled in an unprecedented Pounds 2.8bn even though the stock market was having a slightly rough patch at the time. At this rate net sales for the year could easily reach Pounds 11bn. Unit trusts, the British variety of open-ended investment funds - the Americans know them as mutual funds and the French as Sicavs - have two big positive factors going for them. First, rival life assurance products are under a cloud because of regulatory attacks on the sales conduct of many big companies. And anyway, much tougher disclosure rules for life assurance come into force next January, when high commissions for intermediaries and crippling penalties for early lapsing will have to be made more obvious to investors. Secondly, tax-free personal equity plans, which have primarily turned into unit trust vehicles rather than the direct equity investment plans intended by Nigel Lawson, have become very popular. Peps pulled in Pounds 1.1bn during the second quarter, nearly 30 per cent of total sales, and peps now hold unit trusts worth Pounds 10.4bn, about 11 per cent of all unit trusts in issue. The big advantage for the unit trust companies is that peps are very stable long-term investments. The money is rarely moved, whereas ordinary unit trusts are churned quite heavily. A few weeks ago I attended a private, unit trust conference in Scotland, sponsored by Chase Manhattan Bank, which many of the leading unit trust bosses attended. There was a clear sense of a great opportunity to break out of a straitjacket: in more than 60 years unit trusts have only climbed to about 3 per cent of personal financial assets. The enticing precedent is that of the US where mutual fund penetration was also only about 2 or 3 per cent in the 1970s but is now about 17 per cent. Mutual funds have just overtaken life insurance companies in the US - but in the UK life companies are four times bigger than unit trusts. Furthermore this includes some double counting because many of the units are held in life and pension funds. Indeed, 4 per cent of the unit trust industry is being wiped out after this week's decision by Standard Life to wind up, for tax reasons, its Pounds 4bn UK Larger Companies Trust, which has effectively been an in-house fund. Only about half the current Pounds 95bn worth of unit trusts are owned directly by private investors. The opportunity for growth is indeed there, but some big changes of approach will be necessary if the British unit trusts are to achieve anything like the success of mutual funds. For example, unit trusts are excessively high in risk, being almost entirely focused on equities, and they need to expand into lower risk income products invested in bonds and money market instruments. They must also keep their costs under better control. The performance of the average unit trust is far from satisfactory, largely because of high expenses. Although the high costs of life assurance products have become notorious the fact is that over 10 years a typical unit trust's costs to the consumer are only fractionally lower than on the average endowment policy, at 2.7 against 2.9 per cent. However, unit trusts retain the advantage of greater liquidity: being lump sum investments they are not subject to early surrender penalties when the investor wants to sell. Also, they are transparent, whereas life policies are murky in terms of charges and subject to the erratic whims of actuaries when it comes to calculating the benefits. But the likelihood is that unit trusts' costs will go up still further. This is because of their dependence upon various kinds of intermediaries. In the US 30 per cent of mutual funds are marketed directly to the public, so that a lively sector consisting of low commission funds (no load and low load) has developed. In the UK the direct business is tiny - accounting for only 4 per cent of net sales in June, for instance. Many of the UK intermediaries generate most of their income selling life products, which pay higher commissions than most unit trusts. If, because of so-called 'hard' disclosure, life business is to shrink and unit trust volumes are to grow the brokers and salesmen will face a net loss of income. There is therefore an increasing demand from the intermediaries that unit trust companies should pay an annual 'renewal commission', at  1/2 per cent of a client's unit holdings. One or two companies already pay this. But the typical profit margin is not large enough to absorb this cost, so there would have to be another round of increases in annual management charges. In fact the unit trust industry's marketing weakness leaves it vulnerable to an effective takeover by the life industry. Until now the crucial continuing advantage of the life assurance industry, after the loss of many of its tax privileges, has been its ability, because of regulatory concessions, to hide its charges through 'soft' disclosure and its use of aggressive sales techniques (including cold-calling). Next year's 'hard' disclosure regime will remove these advantages. So life companies will increasingly drop endowment contracts and other traditional life assurance plans and promote alternatives such as peps. The regular savings pep is already one of the Prudential's biggest-selling products. From the investor's viewpoint the unfortunate result of all this could be less value for money. In principle unit trusts are excellent vehicles for medium to long term investment, but investors need to avoid some of the highest cost funds. At least, with unit trusts, they can see clearly what they are buying.</p>

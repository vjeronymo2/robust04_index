			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (3): Wind over the Pyrenees - Spain adjusts to the reforms from Brussels DEVELOPMENTS ARE in motion that could alter the face of Spain's electricity sector. The government has outlined a new legislative framework and, at the same time, the main utility companies are locked in negotiations that could lead to a far reaching reordering of their assets. The moves are, on one level, a response to Community directives on the internal energy market and to recent legislative initiatives in the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK. At another level they seek to replace the existing quota and price structure system, known as the stable framework, which parcelled out the markets and which expires next year. The government's policy is twofold. The draft bill seeks to liberalise the sector and usher in competivity which is essentially what the Community's directives are about and what comparative legislation in other EC nations aims to establish. The government also seeks to put a new framework in place that will ensure a domestic energy supply that is both secure and diversified. The domestic electricity generators have a different mission. Up to now they existed, more or less cosily, within a domestic market where the regulatory guidelines of the stable framework allowed sufficient room for each to make money. Now, with the onset of more competitive times, it is a question of hanging together so as to avoid hanging separately. It is in this spirit that Iberdrola, the main private sector utility, appears to have buried a series of past quarrels with its rival generator Endesa, which is state-owned. These are the twin giants of Spain's electricity sector and they have grown a lot more powerful in the 1990s. Iberdrola is the result of a merger between Hidrola and Iberduero, the two leading private utilities, while Endesa, which is primarily a generating company, has, to Iberdrola's annoyance, built up its retail muscle by becoming a strong shareholder in smaller private utilities such as Sevillana, the distributor in the south of Spain. Together Iberdrola and Endesa now represent around 80 per cent of domestic consumption and they split this market share evenly down the middle. Quite understandably both the domestic giants are loath to allow any weakening in their respective empires under the new government framework. Already the two utilities have secured foreign alliances in what is a sure pointer towards the future cross-border shape of the European energy sector. Belgium's Tractebel has a 3 per cent stake in Iberdrola and Endesa has recently acquired a 2 per cent shareholding in RWE of Germany. The alliances are still in their relative infancy but, as they mature, they will involve shared research programmes - RWE and Endesa, for example, are weighted towards coal-fired plants - and joint ventures to seek new business opportunities, particularly in Latin America. In the near future Iberdrola is likely to take up an option to buy into Tractebel while RWE may acquire up to 5 per cent of Endesa. In the meantime the two Spanish utilities are consolidating their domestic base. The talks between the two reportedly involve the friendly sale of Iberdrola assets to Endesa in an arrangements that benefits both. At the centre of the negotiations is Endesa's acquisition of Hidruna, the Iberdrola-owned subsidiary in Catalonia. Such a disposal will gain Iberdrola a very sound balance sheet by sharply reducing debts that currently represent some Dollars 1.5bn a year in financial charges. Endesa for its part stands to gain a firm grip on distribution in north east Spain through the purchase and it will also be improving its energy mix by lowering its coal weighting. In a second tier agreement, at a later stage, Endesa could be poised to acquire a portion of Iberdrola's nuclear plant shareholdings. Ironically the present amicable relationship between Spain's leading utilities is exactly what the legislation drafted by the Industry Ministry is seeking to avoid. The administration, under EC guidelines, wants to break up the sort of cartels that Endesa, Iberdrola and others always lived by and which they now seek to reinforce. The salient characteristic of Spain's utilities is that they are integrated businesses which combine the production, distribution and marketing of electricity; the chief feature of the ministry's planned legislation is that these integrated groups are going to have to separate, both for legal and for accounting reasons, their production activities from their distribution and marketing. The proposed new framework has all the electricity generated by the domestic companies entering a publicly-controlled energy 'pool'. This centralised public company will in turn supply electricity to the marketing affiliates of the former intergrated groups and it will also sell electricity, by means of public bids, directly to major clients.</p>

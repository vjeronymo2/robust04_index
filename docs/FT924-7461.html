			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / KGF buys Nabisco cold cereal business KRAFT General Foods, the core US food division of Philip Morris, has stepped in as the purchaser of RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business, which takes in the Shredded Wheat and Shreddies brand names. Like the previous potential acquirer of the cereal operations, General Mills, the huge tobacco and food group has agreed to pay Dollars 450m in cash for the business, with some international trademarks. The manufacturing facilities to be acquired will include plants in Naperville, Illinois, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, although Nabisco will keep a plant in Niagara Falls, New York, to manufacture snack biscuits. Commenting on the purchase, which is still subject to regulatory review in the US and Canada, Philip Morris said that it intended to incorporate the Nabisco cereal lines into its existing Post line of breakfast cereals, and would market both through the Kraft sales and distribution networks. Mr Richard Mayers, head of Kraft General Foods, claimed that the 'ready-to-eat' cereal category offered 'great potential for expanded growth and operating income'. Philip Morris's existing cereal lines include Honey Bunches, Grape-Nuts, Pebbles and Marshmallow Alpha-Bits. According to the tobacco and food group, its Post cereal lines have around 11.5 per cent of the US cold cereals market at present, while the Nabisco products are estimated to have around 3 per cent - a figure which has declined from more than 5 per cent four years ago. Nabisco had originally planned to sell the cold cereals business to General Mills. This deal was announced in early September. However, it was aborted in November when it become clear that a 'lengthy and prolonged review' by federal anti-trust authorities was likely. Speculation that another buyer would be sought immediately surfaced - with Philip Morris touted as one of the favourite replacement buyers. Although yesterday's deal between Philip Morris and Nabisco is subject to regulatory review, it seems less likely to provoke problems. The combined shares of the US market would be under 15 per cent, on Philip Morris's figures. There are two bigger groups in the sector - Kellogg and General Mills.</p>

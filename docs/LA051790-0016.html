			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET HILLS PROPONENTS UNFAZED BY PREDICTIONS CITY WOULD FACE DEFICIT  </P> <P> A state report predicts that the proposed city of Sunset Hills would face  budget deficits immediately after incorporation, but a key cityhood supporter  said the study is still encouraging news to residents hoping to create another  new city in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The report, released Tuesday, said Sunset Hills, located west of the city of  Santa Clarita, would accrue yearly budget deficits ranging from $275,000 to  nearly $500,000 during the first four years of cityhood. But those deficits  would be relatively minor compared to projected deficits for other new cities  such as Santa Clarita, Ernest Dynda, a cityhood proponent, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The report was prepared by the Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO,  which oversees annexations and incorporations.  </P> <P> Dynda had not read the complete report but said the small size of projected  deficits could bode well for Sunset Hills. "It sounds good," he said. But he  added that the report raises more questions than it answers.  </P> <P> The only certainty Wednesday was that the city of Santa Clarita will oppose  incorporation because it hopes to annex the area. Mayor Jo Anne Darcy pledged  to fight the Sunset Hills cityhood effort.  </P> <P> Sunset Hills would cover 27.8 square miles west of the Golden State Freeway and  south of California 126, including Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Stevenson  Ranch development under construction by the Dale Poe Development Co.  </P> <P> The area has an estimated 1,701 residents and could have 2,264 by 1993, the  report said.  </P> <P> Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, and Dynda, a former Poe consultant  and Agoura Hills city councilman, are leading the cityhood drive. Some critics  have derisively dubbed the area "Poe-dunk."  </P> <P> Darcy said projected deficits for Sunset Hills seemed unusually low. "I thought  it would be in the millions," Darcy said.  </P> <P> When Santa Clarita incorporated two years ago, for example, LAFCO projected  that the first-year deficit would be $3.5 million, Darcy said. LAFCO approved  letting residents vote on Santa Clarita incorporation despite the projected  deficit. As it turned out, the city had a $2.5-million surplus in its first  year.  </P> <P> The fiscal report released Tuesday does not endorse or oppose cityhood for  Sunset Hills. Instead, it outlines the potential revenues and expenses of the  proposed city. The commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on the cityhood  proposal June 27.  </P> <P> LAFCO officials were out of town at a conference Wednesday and could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita asked LAFCO last year to include the Sunset Hills area in its  "sphere of influence," thus making the area eligible for annexation to the  city. LAFCO turned down the request, citing the incorporation effort launched  by Dynda and Stevenson.  </P> <P> The proposed city would include Six Flags Magic Mountain and property owned by  Newhall Land and Farming Co. but both companies have said they do not want to  be included in Sunset Hills.  </P></p>

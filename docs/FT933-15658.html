			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Protest in Central Belgrade Opposition supporters mount a protest in central Belgrade over the continued detention of Mr Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian opposition leader, who is on a hunger strike. Russia yesterday joined several western governments in a call for his release. Serbian opposition deputies announced they would go ahead with street demonstrations across the country if the Belgrade regime failed to release Mr Draskovic who, with his wife Danica, was jailed and severely beaten on June 1 during an anti-government protest. A team of government-appointed doctors yesterday said Mr Draskovic's condition had 'worsened' and could face 'critical complications' over the next 24 hours.</p>

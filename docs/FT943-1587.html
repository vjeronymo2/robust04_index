			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Mahler and Henze - Music in London On Wednesday the London Symphony not only began its cycle of Mahler symphonies with Michael Tilson Thomas - half this autumn, the rest in the new year - but showed off the newly improved acoustics of the Barbican Hall. Mahler's First made a very good test. On all counts, the performance was resoundingly impressive. After the hall opened in 1982, there was some anxious tinkering with things that affected the acoustic, and since then it has been pretty good: forward and full, though in orchestral tuttis there was sometimes a hard glare of upper partials. Last month new absorbent surfaces were attached at strategic places along the walls of the circle and stalls, and the balconies got handsome wooden fronts. The result is an inconspicuous but decisive improvement in the sound: no glare, but no muffling either, and - with the LSO, at least] - lovely clarity and balance. The most striking virtue of Tilson Thomas's Mahler 1, which is a work studded with hazardous turns and abrupt switches, was that it sounded seamless. One was lost in admiration; that effect is not to be achieved by mere suavity or steadiness, but only by thinking the music all the way through. That was manifestly what Tilson Thomas was doing, and transmitting his intentions completely to the orchestra. There were dozens of gorgeously realised passages (without indulgence, though the Knaben Wunderhorn tunes were illuminated with the utmost tenderness), and an overriding arc of clean purpose, with a grandly built triumph at the end. Perhaps a little of the First's sheer wildness was tamed away. For Mahler, this was a defiantly fractured symphony; to Tilson Thomas it seems a finished monument, and its irruptions of village-band dances were tamped smoothly into place - there was no snarl from the elegant woodwinds. But it was a hugely musicianly reading, and superbly played; it promised great things in the symphonies to come. It was prefaced by James MacMillan's new ten-minute fantasy Britannia, characteristically ingenious and funny (it caught the audience slightly off guard, I thought), and Tilson Thomas's own From the Diary of Anne Frank - honest, effective film-music, with narration gently delivered by Debra Winger. On the previous night, the Nash Ensemble honoured the composer Hans Werner Henze with a Wigmore programme of his recent chamber music. It is always nice to know what he has been up to, but there were no substantial surprises. A tiny 'Adagio adagio' for piano trio was exquisite salon pastiche; five Nocturnes for violin were fragile, pretty and suggestive; three short songs about snow boasted a delectable accompanying ensemble. Much of the new Piano Quintet is interestingly angry, and the rest of it haunted and inward. I fancy it wants a bolder performance than the Nash players gave it this time, though they were scrupulous. The songs and dances from Henze's operetta La Cubana, newly arranged, still sound too close to Weill to bear the comparison, despite an appealing, Zerbinetta-ish final number.</p>

Hosokawa made the remarks when he met the heads of Japan's  four major business lobbies, including Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman  of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).    During the 90-minute meeting, Hosokawa said, "The United  States is threatening to use Section 301 (of the 1974 U.S. Trade  Act) in the bilateral `framework' trade negotiations.    "Japan will have to act to contain the move through the  world  trade organization, agreed to be established at the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks" completed in December, he  said.    The premier also reassured business leaders that he will  reject U.S. demands on Japan to set numerical targets on  bilateral trade when he meets President Bill Clinton in February  in Washington.    "When we met in Seattle last year, I told the President that  the Japanese Government cannot make pledges on matters  concerning the private sector. I will repeat these words in the  summit meeting," he said.</p>

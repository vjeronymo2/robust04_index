			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses face 'corrosion of confidence' Including Monday's trading on Seaq International as part of the sequence, bourses registered a fifth consecutive decline yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, called this a 'corrosion of confidence', and attributed it to several factors, including: optimism over recovery prospects approaching a crest; interest rate cuts likely to be on hold in Europe, in the face of inflated German M3 money supply figures; uncertainty over US inflation prospects, which could delay any robust recovery in bonds and the US dollar; European cyclicals looking tired after their recent strength, and an unwillingness to buy financials because of interest rate uncertainties; and the unabated boom in new equity issues. FRANKFURT, once again, was hit hard. The Dax index fell 39.95, or 1.8 per cent to 2,158.77 during the session, and lost another percentage point in the afternoon, ending at an Ibis-indicated 2,137.56 after weakness on Wall Street and late pressure on the dollar against the D-Mark. Turnover rose from DM7bn to DM8.2bn. In financials, Allianz took the biggest beating, dropping DM70, or 2.8 per cent, to DM2,439 on the session and DM24 to DM2,415 after hours. Carmakers and chemicals were savaged among the cyclicals but, as expected, the worst fall of the day was reserved for Metallgesellschaft after its revelations of newly identified risks which it would have to cover in the US. The shares dropped DM29 to DM231 on the session, and DM11 more to DM220 in the afternoon for an overall fall of 15.4 per cent. PARIS was infected by German rate cut worries after the Bundesbank cut its repo rate by only 3 basis points. The CAC-40 index fell 48.91, or 2.3 per cent to 2,084.41 in turnover of FFr4.4bn. Thomson-CSF, which delayed further the publication of its 1993 results, fell FFr5.80 to FFr175.10. MILAN turned back after an early rally prompted further selling. The Comit index finished 4.55 higher at 759.79, although the real-time Mibtel index registered a 2.6 per cent fall over the day. Insurers were marked down as investors lightened their holdings in preparation for the Ina privatisation, scheduled for the end of June. Generali fell L1,308 or 2.8 per cent to L45,039, RAS L1,039 or 3.4 per cent to L29,224 and Toro L2,070 or 6.6 per cent to L29,525. Montedison fell L82 or 5.7 per cent to L1,350 amid speculation that its chemical joint venture with Shell would fail to win European Union approval: the company said that the commission competition authorities were still considering the deal. Mediobanca gave up another L567 or 3.5 per cent to L15,644 on continuing fears that it could be dragged into police investigations of the background to the Ferruzzi group's debt problems. ZURICH was lower in line with other markets and with the domestic outlook clouded by worries about interest rates. The SMI index fell 18.9 to 2,673.1. Holderbank dipped SFr5 to SFr940 after the group said it expected better results this year if economic circumstances remained favourable. Sandoz finished SFr5 ahead at SFr725, after a day's high of SFr737, after Tuesday's sharp fall which followed news of its agreed bid for Gerber Products in the US. MADRID dropped 1.8 per cent, the general index losing 6.07 to 330.45 as turnover climbed to Pta34.43bn. In New York, Natwest Securities announced an upgrading of Telefonica after the stock dropped Pta50 to Pta1,865 in its domestic market. AMSTERDAM fell in response to the weakness on Wall Street and in domestic and German bond markets. The AEX index dipped 4.79 to 403.50, although price movements tended to be exaggerated by thin trading. The recently firm Hoogovens led the way down with a Fl 1.90 decline to Fl 70.50 on profit-taking. Unilever lost Fl 2.90 to a 12 month low of Fl 189 in response to the slower than expected economic recovery and continuing brand battles. ATHENS tumbled another 5.6 per cent, hitting a year's low for the third consecutive session, with soaring interest rates continuing to drive investors away from equities and into bank to customer repurchase agreements. The general index fell 47.58 to 854.25 in active volume of 2m shares. James Capel said that with all capital controls now lifted, a drachma devaluation seemed inevitable. 'The market would view a devaluation positively and, in the event, we would expect a rebound from these very low levels.'

The first meeting to discuss this issue occurred on  the afternoon of 6 February at Bandeirantes Palace. Since then  the two have been regularly discussing the issue. On 20  February, they ratified what had been agreed upon over the phone.    This was reported by a Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  [PMDB] deputy close to Fleury. The deputy allegedly was told all  that by the governor himself. He also heard Fleury clearly say  that he did not plan to confront Quercia. Deputy Alberto Goldman  heard exactly the same sentence during the governor's meeting  with the federal deputies' bloc in Sao Paulo on 21 February.    After creating much confusion in the PMDB and threatening to  confront the former governor, Fleury allegedly reversed his  decision to try obtaining PMDB support for his presidential  candidacy. In the party it is believed that Quercia cornered --  a term used by the PMDB leaders -- the governor and left him no  option but to support his candidacy because he controls the PMDB  in Sao Paulo.    Fleury probably will not admit the agreement publicly. His  strategy is to postpone, as much as possible, an official  announcement of his decision to support Quercia because he fears  attacks by the PMDB national leaders who oppose the former  governor. Reportedly, Fleury plans to continue circulating among  those who oppose Quercia -- such as the government leader in the  Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]); Deputy  Antonio Britto (PMDB- RS); and Brazilian Social Democracy Party  politicians -- for as long as he manages to save face. In the  next few weeks, Fleury will continue to support the talk that it  is still not time to think about candidacies and the most  important thing now is to maintain the party's unity and ensure  the economic plan's approval.    Quercia's tranquillity also reinforces the agreement thesis.  The former governor continues to assert that Fleury will support  his candidacy. Both the Quercia-led faction and Fleury, however,  deny reaching an agreement. The Quercia faction fears Fleury  will break the agreement if he sees any possibility of becoming  a presidential candidate himself. Particularly, if Quercia's  candidacy is rejected by the party.    Fleury promised on 21 February to officially announce his  decision on the presidential candidacy "within 20 days."  According to PMDB State Chairman Roberto Rollemberg, it is  expected that this issue will have been settled by 7 March, when  the PMDB Regional Executive Board is scheduled to hold a meeting  -- which Quercia and Fleury will attend -- to decide on  Quercia's candidacy.    Rollemberg asserted that "one thing is certain -- we will  never go to the convention with two candidates from Sao Paulo.  It is either Quercia or Fleury." According to Rollemberg,  Quercia is the only candidate the party has so far. He said:  "If Fleury decides to launch his candidacy for the presidency,  we will convene a party meeting in Sao Paulo to settle the  question."</p>

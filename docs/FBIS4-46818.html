			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Neringa Jonusaite: "Lithuanian and Polish </F> Television Cooperation Treaty Signed"]    [Text] A Lithuanian-Polish television cooperation treaty  was signed yesterday at the Lithuanian state radio and  television center. On the Polish side, it was signed by the  chairman of the board of Poland's joint-stock TV company, W.  Walendziak, and for Lithuania -- by the general director of  radio and television, L. Tapinas.    The treaty was signed for three years. It provides for a  broad cooperation between the televisions of the two countries,  including an exchange of programs and technical equipment. The  earlier treaty had expired in October of last year, but, as the  director of the Lithuanian television, S. Sondeckis, told  LIETUVOS RYTAS, the televisions of both countries continued  their cooperation even in the absence of a treaty and the Polish  TV provided Lithuanian TV with invaluable informational  assistance.    Upon the signing of the treaty, the general director of  Lithuanian radio and television, L. Tapinas, reminded that the  Lithuanian RTV has signed cooperation treaties with the  televisions of many European countries: "The treaty includes an  item providing for a preparation of a special program in the  Polish language by the Lithuanian television, and a similar  program for Lithuanians in Poland by the Polish television.    W. Walendziak emphasized that this paragraph on the programs  for the Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants was very important.  The programs for Lithuanians in Poland are to be broadcast from  a regional station in Warsaw; there are also plans to establish  a regional station in Bialystok.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS THIS POLITICAL ACT TOO TOUGH TO FOLLOW?  </P> <P> For the election of 1990, Democrats can take heart in the fact that the public  is considerably smarter than the politicians and strategists who try to  game-plan each election campaign. Voters have put their faith in our  Constitution's separation of powers and take pride in electing Democratic  senators and representatives who will check and balance their chosen Republican  President.  </P> <P> But Democrats may find much less to cheer about after that. For the  presidential election of 1992 may be when the true political impact of the  current Mideast crisis is seen.  </P> <P> The super summit events that dominated our screens this weekend are certainly  causing some second thoughts within the most private councils of the Mario  Cuomos and Sam Nunns and Albert Gores and Richard Gephardts and Charles Robbs  and all other Democrats who may have entertained the notion of running for  President.  </P> <P> These are Democrats who can all say with confidence that they could lead where  President Bush has faltered in shaping new policies on issues from the federal  budget and economy to global warming. But running for President is a very  personal thing. And so now all prospective Democratic candidates must be  looking at their TV screens and asking themselves this personal, soul-searching  question:  </P> <P> Am I confident that I could have responded as swiftly and skillfully --  militarily and diplomatically -- as did Bush if the Iraqi crisis happened on my  presidential watch?  </P> <P> Unless their private answer is a resounding yes, it will be hard for any of  them to mount a campaign against Bush in 1992, let alone beat him.  </P></p>

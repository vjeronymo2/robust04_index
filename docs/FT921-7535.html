			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hattersley seeks to end secrecy - Freedom of information CAMPAIGNERS against government secrecy were last night expressing delight at a newly published Right to Information Bill unveiled by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader. The bill, which has no chance of being passed before an election, would replace the Official Secrets Act with a general right of access to official records. It is almost identical to a 'model' bill drawn up by the Campaign for Freedom of Information lobby group. Under its provisions the public would be able to request any government information, and civil servants would be obliged by law to supply it. Although the bill includes 11 categories of information exempt from its provisions, including threats to national security and breaches of personal privacy, it also has a catch-all clause that can force disclosure in cases of overwhelming public interest. Announcing the bill at yesterday's What The Papers Say press awards lunch in London, Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would enact it in its first parliamentary session. He added that it enshrined in law the principle that public information must be freely available unless deemed detrimental to state security or individual rights. But in a speech dotted with side-swipes at the tabloid press, he went on to warn his audience of senior journalists: 'The new act will only bring light into dark places if newspapers take serious advantage of its provisions.' Mr Hattersley added that a Labour government might well use further legislation if the privacy of individuals continued to be abused. That question will be examined in July when an 18-month trial period of newspaper self-regulation, set up by the Calcutt committee on privacy, is to be reviewed. Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said the group was 'very pleased' with the shape of the newly tabled bill, which included provisions over and above the draft legislation published by CFI last November. 'It goes about as far as it is possible for an opposition party to go,' he said, He added that once in power Labour could expect to come under pressure from Whitehall to dilute its measures. Ironically, Mr Hattersley's largely symbolic bill itself escaped all press attention when notice of its imminent publication was discreetly tabled in the Commons last month.</p>

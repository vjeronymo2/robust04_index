			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (D) Provide that the prior lienholder will not declare the lien in default for any nonmonetary reason if FmHA commences liquidation proceedings against the property and thereafter acquires the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy, which under state law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or a FmHA mortgage already held), the prior lienholder shall agree not to make advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other prior liens without written consent of the State Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to FmHA making (or transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related mortgage if the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) without the prior lienholder's consent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to FmHA transferring the property subject to the prior lien after FmHA has obtained title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if the prior lien instrument prohibits such transfer without the prior lienholder's consent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of foreclosure agreements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These agreements will be obtained only when required by a state supplement. As a precautionary measure, the state supplement will require notice agreements when OGC determines that state law permits junior liens of private parties to be extinguished by foreclosure of a prior lien without the junior lienholder being made parties or being given actual notice. The state supplement will specify the number of days within which notice of foreclosure is required by the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leaseholds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the FmHA security interest is on a leasehold, the approval official must review the lease to make sure that it meets the security and duration requirements of the program instructions. If not, it will be necessary for the landlord and tenant to amend the lease to meet these requirements at closing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agreement by holder of vendor's interest under land contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the buyer's interest in the security property is that of a buyer under a land contract, it will be necessary for the seller (vendor) to execute, in recordable form, an agreement containing all of the following provisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The vendor shall agree not to sell or voluntarily transfer the vendor's interest under the land contract without the prior written consent of the FmHA State Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The vendor shall agree not to encumber or cause any liens to be levied against the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The vendor shall agree not to commence or take any action to accelerate, forfeit or foreclose the buyer's interest in the security property until a specified period of time after notifying the State Director of intent to do so. This period of time will be ninety (90) days unless a state supplement otherwise provides. The agreement shall give FmHA the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the buyer's delinquent payments to the vendor, or paying the vendor in full and having the contract assigned to FmHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The vendor shall consent to FmHA making the loan and taking a security interest in the borrower's interest under the land contract as security for the FmHA loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The vendor shall agree not to take any actions to foreclose or forfeit the interest of the buyer under the land contract because FmHA has acquired the buyer's interest under the land contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or because FmHA has subsequently sold or assigned the buyer's interest to a third party who will assume the buyer's obligations under the land contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) When FmHA acquires a buyer's interest under a land contract by voluntary conveyance or foreclosure, FmHA will not be deemed to have assumed any of the buyer's obligations under the contract, provided that the failure of FmHA to perform any such obligations while it holds the buyer's interest is a ground to commence an action to terminate the land contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Form of agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The form of prior lienholder's agreement, forbearance agreement, notice of foreclosure or assignment, and agreement by holder of vendor's interest under land contract will be prescribed in a state supplement with the concurrence of OGC. When only forbearance agreements are needed, they will be obtained on Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8, ``Agreement with Prior Lienholder,'' or, if that form is not legally satisfactory, on a state form having the same title. When only notice of foreclosure or assignment are required, a separate form for this purpose will be used. When both forbearance agreements and notices of foreclosure or assignment are required, Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8 may be amended in order to serve both purposes, a substitute state form may be used for both purposes, or Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8 may be used and the notice agreement obtained on a separate state form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Executing, acknowledging, and recording.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When an agreement is required by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), or (d)(4) of this section, the closing agent will determine at the time of closing that the agreement is properly completed, executed, sealed, witnessed, acknowledged, and recorded as required by state law or state supplement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Correction of errors in recorded security instruments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A state supplement, subject to OGC's review and approval, will be issued to provide guidance in correcting error(s) in recorded security instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

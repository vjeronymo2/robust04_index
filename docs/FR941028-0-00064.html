			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that any applicant or person shown in AVS to have been linked by ownership or control to a person cited in a State violation notice could challenge the status of such violation before the State that issued the violation notice. Such challenge would have to have been made in accordance with that State's program equivalents to paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and proposed &sect;773.26. Again, the provisions of proposed section 773.26 would have been incorporated under proposed &sect;773.24 to prevent challenges as to the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, in language similar to that contained in paragraph (a)(2) of the proposed regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation before a State program would not be available to any person who was bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The proposed regulation would have required that such information be submitted to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that OSM make a written determination with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. The proposal required that, if an ownership or control link had been challenged, OSM would then determine whether the link had been shown to be erroneous or had been rebutted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the ownership or control link had been shown to be erroneous or had been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice had been corrected, appropriately appealed, or otherwise resolved within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) (i)&hyph;(ii), OSM would be required to have provided notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would also have to notify the regulatory authority before which the application was pending. Further, OSM would have been required to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which had been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the challenged ownership or control link had not been shown to be erroneous and had not been rebutted, and that the violation remained outstanding, OSM would have been required to provide notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would have also been required to notify the regulatory authority before whom the application was pending. Further, OSM would have been required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that OSM be required to serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other challenger by U.S. certified mail or by any other means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that the applicant or other challenger could have appealed OSM's decision to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days of such decision in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) would have further provided that OSM's decision remained in effect unless temporary relief was granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have further provided for temporary relief from OSM's decision, if OHA granted such relief in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. Under the proposed regulation, OSM's decision would have remained in effect during the pendency of appeal, unless temporary relief was granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters representing the coal industry took exception to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of the proposed section which would preclude an applicant or other person from challenging the status of a violation if he or she was ``bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning'' the status of the violation. The commenters asserted that determining whether a person was ``bound'' by a prior determination was vague and susceptible to conflicting interpretations. They further asserted that if, by this proposed language, OSM intended to apply the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel, there was no need to include such language in the proposed regulation, since these doctrines would be available as legal defenses to OSM in any event. The commenters indicated that their objection to this language also applied to the other portions of the proposed regulations where similar language imposing such a limit on challenges was incorporated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Awash with cash Worries about weak institutional cash flow this year look, in retrospect, to have been thoroughly misplaced. Overseas investors have proved enthusiastic buyers of UK bonds and equities, while domestic institutions have been surprisingly flush with cash. Yesterday's figures show cash flowing into institutional coffers at a rate of Pounds 14bn a quarter. The total net inflow for the year looks likely to exceed Pounds 50bn, against consensus forecasts of around Pounds 30bn. The difference is accounted for by stronger than expected sales of single-premium savings products by life insurance companies and a stampede into unit trusts. Savers escaping the dwindling returns on cash are the cause. If interest rates fall again in 1994, sales of equity savings products might gather further momentum at the expense of bank and building society deposits. With pension funds also enjoying stronger inflows, as company contribution holidays come to an end, institutional liquidity could be on an upward trend. Third quarter figures suggest institutions themselves may have been taken aback by the appetite of retail investors. Around Pounds 4bn short-term assets were accumulated over the summer, around half of that amount by life insurance companies, while purchases of gilts and equities actually declined. Some institutions may have been deliberately building cash reserves to move into property. The more likely explanation is that strong inflows and rising markets caught them flat-footed. The build-up of cash in the summer may then have fuelled the bull market of the fourth quarter.</p>

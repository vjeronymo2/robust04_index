			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / OFT chief attacks music charts Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that the way in which the Top 40 music chart was compiled was 'significantly anti-competitive'. Sir Bryan confirmed statements by the Office of Fair Trading last month that the matter would be referred to the Restrictive Practices Court. He said he was concerned about agreements under which the British Association of Record Dealers undertakes not to supply sales information for the compilation of the charts to anyone other than the Chart Information Network and its research contractor. The network earlier this year awarded the contract to compile the charts to Millward Brown, a research company. The contract had previously been held by Gallup, the polling organisation. Sir Bryan is asking the court to examine both contracts. The network is jointly owned by the British Phonographic Industry, the music companies' trade body, and Spotlight Publications, publishers of Music Week. Spotlight is owned by United Newspapers. After Millward Brown won the contract, Gallup complained to the OFT that it should continue to have access to sales data so that it could compile an alternative to the official charts. Gallup yesterday welcomed Sir Bryan's announcement. Ms Catharine Pusey, the network's charts director, said: 'We will be vigorously defending our agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court. The only complaint to date about the arrangements has been from Gallup, which was content to participate in and benefit from them for a number of years.' Mr John Pinder, Gallup's charts director, said that his company had never asked for the exclusive right to record dealer information that it had under the previous agreement.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING NICOTINE  </P> <P> Question: I see where one of the leading cigarette companies is coming out with  a cigarette that has practically no nicotine, just the way decaffeinated coffee  has no caffeine.  </P> <P> Do you see anything wrong from a health standpoint with these cigarettes?  </P> <P> Answer: I think it's very revealing that the cigarette company emphasizes the  low level of nicotine in its product, but says nothing about the level of tar.  Tar is a major cause of lung cancer and heart disease. Presenting  "de-nicotined" cigarettes as a safe alternative to regular cigarettes may be a  good advertising ploy, but it's not honest.  </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Neil Solomon MD, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21286-6184.  </P></p>

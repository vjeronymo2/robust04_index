			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Portuguese airline lowers sights Financially troubled national airline TAP-Air Portugal will reduce US-based staff by 40 per cent and close its New York sales office, an airline official said yesterday. TAP will offer retirement packages to 39 employees in the first phase of a wider cost-cutting programme. The company will also study the possibility of ending service to Boston, Montreal and Toronto and flying only to Newark. The staff reductions and possible route changes would not go into effect before the end of the 1994 summer season, the official said. In January the airline accepted a government bailout plan that would inject some Dollars 1bn over the next three years. The plan is being examined by the European Union.</p>

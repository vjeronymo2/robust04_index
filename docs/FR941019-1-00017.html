			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The add-on for potential future exposure is calculated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all contracts, regardless of whether the market value is zero,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive, or negative, or whether the current exposure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated on a gross or net basis. The add-on will always be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either a positive number or zero. The recent revision to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accord to recognize netting for the calculation of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure does not affect the calculation of potential future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure, which generally continues to be calculated on a gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. This means that an add-on for potential future exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is calculated separately for each individual contract subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the netting arrangement and then these individual future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures are added together to arrive at a gross add-on for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future exposure. For contracts subject to a qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral netting arrangement in accordance with the newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted Accord changes, the gross add-on for potential future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure would be added to the net current exposure to arrive at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one credit equivalent amount for the contracts subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> netting arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original Basle Accord noted that the credit conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors in the add-on matrix were provisional and would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to revision if volatility levels or market conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> II. Basle Proposals for the Treatment of Potential Future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Since the original Accord was adopted, the derivatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market has grown and broadened. The use of certain types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivative instruments not specifically addressed in the Accord_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notably commodity, precious metal, and equity-linked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE> _has become much more widespread. As a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued review of the method for calculating the add-on for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future exposure, in July 1994 the BSC issued two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals for public consultation. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The first proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the matrix of add-on factors used to calculate potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future exposure to take into account innovations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivatives market. The second proposal would recognize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the potential future exposure of derivative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts that result from entering into bilateral netting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements. The second proposal is an extension of the recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision to the Accord recognizing bilateral netting arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of calculating current exposure and would formally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the recognition of netting arrangements to equity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precious metals and other commodity derivative contracts. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation period for these BSC proposals is scheduled to end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on October 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> In general terms, these are off-balance sheet transactions that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular commodity, precious metal, or equity or to an index of commodity, precious metal or equity prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> The proposals are contained in a paper from the BSC entitled ``The Capital Adequancy Treatment of the Credit Risk Associated with Certain Off-Balance Sheet Items'' that is available upon request from FDIC's Reading Room by calling (202) 898_8785. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Expansion of Add-On Matrix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A recently concluded BSC review of the add-on for potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future exposure indicated that the current add-on factors used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculate the potential future exposure amount may produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient capital for certain types of derivative instruments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in particular, long-dated interest rate contracts, commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts, and equity-index contracts. The BSC review indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the current add-on factors do not adequately address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full range of contract structures and the timing of cash flows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review also showed that the conversion factors many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are using to calculate potential future exposure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts could result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient capital coverage in view of the volatility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indices or prices on the underlying assets from which these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts derive their value. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> While commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts were not explicity covered by the original Accord, as the use of such contracts became more prevalent, many G&hyph;10 bank supervisors, including U.S. banking supervisors, have informally permitted institutions to apply the conversion factors for exchange rate contracts to these types of transactions pending development of a more appropriate treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

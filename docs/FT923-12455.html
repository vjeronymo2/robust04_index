			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions IN ANOTHER dismal week for the market, the level of boardroom buying remained very subdued. In December last year we recorded purchases in Leigh Interests by three directors at around 240p. Since then the shares have performed well, reaching 328p before slipping back to the current level of 250p. Robert Merrick, a non-executive director, has now sold 150,000 shares at 261p. He still retains more than 2.9m. Leigh's final results in June revealed virtually static profits. Directors of Securiguard, the business services group, were buying stock in November 1990 at prices as low as 52p. One of those directors was Terence Pritchard, who sold 500,000 shares in 1989 at around 287p per share. Having shown deft timing before, he is now selling 340,000 shares at 150p, together with his chairman, who sold 60,000 at the same price. John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, has picked up a further 100,000 shares at 179p. Readers will recall how he paid 183p for 250,000 shares just prior to the company's close period. Final results announced in June revealed another year of earnings growth in a difficult property market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company                 Sector         Shares    Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Airsprung Furniture     Misc           5,000      17          1 Caird Group             Chem          20,000      15          1 FII Group               Misc           5,000      23          1 Greenalls Group         Brew           7,500      30          1 Leigh Interests         Chem         150,000     392          1 Macdonald Martin A      Brew           6,600      40          1 Mercury Asset Man       OthF          40,000     126          1 Property P'tnership     Prop          50,000     100          1 Scottish TV             Mdia          49,540     191          1 Securiguard Group       BusS         400,000     600          2 Severn Trent            Watr           2,500      10          1 Warner Estates          Prop         250,000     420          1 Warner Howard           BusS           5,962      17          1 Watmoughs               Mdia           3,900      18          1 Westbury                Cont          60,000      53          1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Albert Fisher           Food         101,740      39          6 British Bio             Tech           5,458      27          4 British Land            Prop         100,000     179          1 Carclo Engineering      EngG          20,000      29          1 EW Fact                 Mdia          27,000      28          3 Helical Bar             Prop          50,000      51          1 Merivale Moore          Prop          50,000      13          2 Morland &amp; Co            Brew          45,380      26          6 Reliance Security       BusS           5,000      15          1 Rothmans Intl           Misc           1,000      11          1 Scantronic (CCP)        BusS          35,000      30          1 Siebe                   EngG           3,700      24          1 Smiths Industries       EngA           7,000      20          1 The Telegraph           Mdia          25,400      83          6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

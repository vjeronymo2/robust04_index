			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Production, Use and Release of Acetone <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For 1992, the United States (U.S.) production of acetone was 2.4 billion pounds. In addition, 96 million pounds of acetone were imported. Domestic consumption was 2.2 billion pounds. The majority of the domestic use of acetone was as an intermediate. Acetone is also used in the production of drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and specialty chemicals. Acetone also has numerous uses as a process solvent and in direct applications (Ref. 5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports that during 1992 a total of 138,728,984 pounds of acetone were released into the environment, the 7th highest amount of releases for EPCRA section 313 chemicals. Of that total, 133,989,435 pounds were released to air (4th highest on TRI); 999,584 pounds were released to surface waters (11th highest on TRI); 559,265 pounds were released to land; and 3,180,700 pounds were injected underground (15th highest on TRI). In addition, 88,666,077 pounds of acetone were transferred to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and other off-site locations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Technical Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's toxicological evaluation of acetone indicates that it exhibits acute toxicity only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures. Based on EPA's hazard assessment, the Agency has determined that acetone: (1) Cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer or neurotoxicity and is not mutagenic, and (2) cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse developmental effects or other chronic effects except at relatively high dose levels. Acetone causes adverse environmental effects only at relatively high dose levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rationale for Granting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is granting the petition by proposing to delete acetone from the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) because acetone exhibits acute toxicity only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures. Specifically acetone cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause ``*&blank;*&blank;* significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on EPA's hazard assessment of acetone, the Agency has determined that acetone exhibits low toxicity in chronic studies. Therefore, EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) because acetone causes adverse environmental effects only at relatively high dose levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA is proposing to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of a VOC since it has been preliminarily determined to have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation. In addition to the findings discussed above, based on this proposal, EPA believes that acetone does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) because acetone's contribution to the formation of tropospheric ozone and other air pollutants is negligible. VOCs contribute to the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and ozone is known to cause significant adverse effects on human health and the environment. EPA has previously determined that VOCs meet the criteria for listing under EPCRA section 313. Therefore, finalization of this proposed rule is contingent upon the issuance of a final rule to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of a VOC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred to affect the status of acetone under any statute or program other than the Toxic Release Inventory reporting under EPCRA section 313 and the PPA section 6607. Specifically, the removal of acetone from the EPCRA section 313 list will not in any way alter its continued status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The petitioners, Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst Celanese, do not request the removal of acetone from any other statute; moreover, the Agency feels such action at this time would be inappropriate. In support, the Agency notes that the three lists, and the three statutes under which they are maintained, serve relevantly different purposes. Furthermore, each statute prescribes different standards for adding or deleting chemicals or pollutants from its respective list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Request for Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requests public comment on this proposal to delete acetone from the list of chemicals subject to EPCRA section 313. Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> unit. All comments should be received on or before November 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

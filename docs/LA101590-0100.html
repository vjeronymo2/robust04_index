			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LEAST 20 DIE IN COUNTY IN A WEEKEND OF VIOLENCE;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE VICTIMS INCLUDE A 4-YEAR-OLD BOY AND A GIRL, 16, IN SEPARATE  INCIDENTS.  </P> <P> A weekend of violence left at least 20 people dead and more than a dozen others  wounded countywide, authorities said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's homicide detectives were investigating the apparent murder of an  elderly woman in La Canada Flintridge.  </P> <P> Neighbors heard gunshots and called deputies, who found the unidentified woman  dead inside her home in the 600 block of Durwood Drive shortly before 7 p.m.  Sunday, Lt. Robert Flores said. Deputies held a man and woman found hiding in a  side yard for questioning, Flores said.  </P> <P> Long Beach police were investigating two unrelated stabbing deaths Sunday  evening.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies were investigating the death of woman whose body was found  about 6 p.m. Sunday in a pickup truck on Las Virgenes Road in Malibu.  </P> <P> Compton detectives were investigating the death of an unidentified young man in  the 2600 block of North Parmelee Avenue about 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Police did not  immediately know how the person died, "but there appears to be some trauma to  his head," a spokesman said.  </P> <P> In Inglewood, Jesus Zubia, 24, was booked for investigation of murder after his  son was shot at their home, although investigators believe the shooting was an  accident, Police Sgt. Percy Roberts said.  </P> <P> Zubia told officers he thought his .38-caliber revolver was unloaded Friday  night when he showed it to his two sons, ages 4 and 7, and repeatedly pulled  the trigger. The gun fired once, and the 4-year-old was shot in the head.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police hunted for the killers of a cab driver whose body was dumped  on a street near downtown Los Angeles. Stanley Kolski, 53, was found shot in  the head Friday evening, police said.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, a man who refused to share some cocaine was stabbed to death Sunday  morning in Venice, and in the east county community of Walnut a man was found  shot to death outside his apartment building, authorities said.  </P> <P> Seven people were wounded in an apparently gang-related drive-by shooting near  Los Angeles City College.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old girl was fatally wounded shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday as she rode  in a car with friends in the Willowbrook area, sheriff's deputies said. People  in the car had exchanged "gang words" with pedestrians, who opened fire,  officers said.  </P> <P> Shirley Sandoval, of Los Angeles, died at a nearby hospital. A male suspect,  whose name was not released, was in custody for investigation of murder,  officers said.  </P> <P> A drive-by shooting claimed the life of a 19-year-old Los Angeles man early  Sunday after he was struck by gunfire from a passing car on West 22nd Street.  </P> <P> In Hollywood, one man was killed and another injured in an apartment window  after exchanging taunts with some people on the street, one of whom pulled a  gun, police said. There were also shooting deaths at a Highland Park  intersection and near a Los Angeles hamburger stand.  </P> <P> Six other people died in weekend violence previously reported by The Times.  </P></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: City poll expects hung parliament THE number of City economists forecasting a hung parliament with Labour as the biggest party has more than doubled in the past week, according to a Reuter poll last night. The survey, covering 47 economists at London financial institutions, indicated 72 per cent believed this, compared with 35 per cent last week. None predicted an outright Tory win, while per cent thought Labour would form a majority government. A further 8.5 per cent predicted the Tories would be the biggest party in a hung Parliament.</p>

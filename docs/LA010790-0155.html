			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS HIT A LOW POINT IN TORONTO, 7-4;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES BATTLES BACK TO GET EVEN IN THIRD PERIOD, BUT THE MAPLE  LEAFS PULL AWAY FOR VICTORY.  </P> <P> Goalie Kelly Hrudey of the Kings sat in the locker room with a blank look after  a 7-4 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs Saturday night.  </P> <P> The game had been over for 15 minutes, but Hrudey, alone in his thoughts,  replayed the evening.  </P> <P> With the score tied in the third period, 4-4, the Kings allowed three  consecutive goals, including an empty-netter, en route to their third  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> What went wrong?  </P> <P> "Listen, we got to stick together," Hrudey said. "I'm not going to go out there  and start criticizing my teammates. That's been one of our problems all season  long. If we stick together we'll play through it."  </P> <P> The Kings have lost four of five games, their worst slump since a four-game  losing streak in November.  </P> <P> Are the Kings playing as poorly during this losing streak as they were earlier  this season?  </P> <P> "No," Hrudey said. "The two losses previous to tonight weren't that bad because  we had a lot of chances. Tonight we were bad.  </P> <P> "If you start to read into things and make more out of things rather than  trying to gain some positives out of the last three losses, you tend to group  all three losses into the bad category. And it just festers from there.  </P> <P> "It's like wildfire, it spreads so quickly. And that negative attitude is an  evil that's hard to get rid of. Believe me."  </P> <P> After beating the Washington Capitals to open the four-game trip, the Kings  lost the next three.  </P> <P> Is this a good time to be going home, where the Kings open a five-game home  stand Tuesday against St. Louis?  </P> <P> "That's an understatement," Hrudey said.  </P> <P> Did the King collapse start in the third period?  </P> <P> "It started before that," King Coach Tom Webster said. "It started way before  that. In the first period we were just awful, just awful. We were lucky to come  away tied, 2-2. The last two games I felt we worked hard. Even though we lost I  wasn't that upset.  </P> <P> "Tonight we did not work. Let's put it this way, some of us didn't work, and  when you're an offensive hockey team you'd better score because that means you  have to work at the other part of the game."  </P> <P> Does Webster think the Kings need to trade for better defensemen?  </P> <P> "I'm not that concerned about our defense," Webster said. "I'm concerned with  our work without the puck. There's a price that has to be paid. . . . You can  make excuses all you want, but defensive hockey is hard work. I don't want to  say much more because I'll get myself in trouble."  </P> <P> Although the marquee outside aging Maple Leaf Gardens read: Kings vs. Leafs, 8  p.m., it should have read: Wayne Gretzky vs. Leafs.  </P> <P> When Gretzky plays in Toronto it's an event. Scalpers were getting $300 for  choice seats. The worst seats in the Gardens were going for $40. And business  was so brisk that one scalper told fans to line up.  </P> <P> Born in nearby Brantford, Ontario, Gretzky is a local legend. And the Great One  didn't disappoint the sellout crowd of 16,328, scoring one goal and assisting  on another as the Kings rebounded from a 4-2 second-period deficit to tie it,  4-4.  </P> <P> Gretzky set up right wing Mikko Makela for the tying goal at 1:31 of the third  period.  </P> <P> But Toronto right wing Daniel Marois, who had a first-period goal, scored  back-to-back goals for his first hat trick of the season. Left wing Vincent  Damphousse assisted on all three of Marois' goals.  </P> <P> "When you win against a team like L. A. and Wayne Gretzky, it's always a big  lift for us," Damphousse said. "A lot of people thought we weren't going to win  this game. But I think we felt we could beat anyone in the league."  </P> <P> Marois got his second goal on a power play at 7:47 of the third period.  Damphousse set up the play when he centered the puck to Marois, who was alone  in the crease. Hrudey didn't have a chance. Marois added his third goal after a  scramble in front of the net at 12:39.  </P> <P> Toronto right wing Lou Franceschetti added an empty-net goal with 1:45  remaining.  </P> <P> "Tonight we didn't do our jobs," King defenseman Tom Laidlaw said. "It was a  real team effort tonight. It's real easy to point fingers at people, but it  isn't going to do us any good. I know it sounds corny, but it takes everybody  to win. And when we lose it's the same way. Tonight was the perfect example of  that.  </P> <P> "It's not like we're in last place in our division. We're still a good hockey  team."  </P> <P> But they didn't look like a very good team against Toronto.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Toronto center Ed Olczyk extended his scoring streak to 17 games when he scored  an unassisted goal in the second period. . . . Center Gilles Thibaudeau, who  was called up by the Maple Leafs Friday, scored on his first shot of the game.  It was his first goal as a Maple Leaf since he was acquired from the New York  Islanders last month. Actor John Candy sat next to King owner Bruce McNall next  to the Los Angeles bench. Mr. T. also took in the game.  </P></p>

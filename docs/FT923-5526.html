			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity The 12 regional electricity companies will have to get accustomed to being judged individually rather than as a group. Next week's unbundling of the package made available at privatisation means that, with the exception of indexed funds, most institutional investors will retain favoured stocks and discard the rest. The impact on the relative performance of the shares has already been notable: at the start of the summer some 25 per cent of Rec shares were held in the package. Heightened competition for the hearts and minds of investors is only the start. The regulator has made plain he has little faith in complex return on capital calculations as a means of exerting control. Offer's preferred tactic is to introduce competition into as many areas as possible. As a foretaste, the Recs may be denied the automatic right to pass through higher pool prices to customers, in the interests of a more competitive wholesale market. Metering and the erosion of regional monopolies are firmly on the agenda. And whatever the details of the 1994 review, the Recs will have to live with a less generous pricing regime in the second half of the decade. One implication is that real dividend growth will depend on companies' ability to deliver efficiency gains and grow non-core businesses. Judging the relative efficiency and management quality of the Recs on the basis of two years' figures is not easy. Return on capital ranges from perhaps 6 per cent at Seeboard to 10 per cent at East Midlands, but this is a result of geography and the pricing formulae set at privatisation. A better benchmark may be the companies' ability to meet customer service standards, which will be central to the regulatory regime going forward. Whatever method of assessment is chosen, the risk of backing a loser is likely to increase.</p>

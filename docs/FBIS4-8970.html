			<p>BFN     [Text] Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the United  Nations, has sent a letter on the latest developments in Gorazde  to the Security Council chairman, New Zealand Ambassador Colin  Keating.    The Republic of Croatia is seriously concerned over the  situation in Gorazde, where nobody is trying to prevent yet  another slaughter by the Serbs, Nobilo says. He warns that  direct violation of the UN resolution on safe zones is a  dangerous precedent, which could affect the peace process not  only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia.    The situation in Gorazde is already having a negative effect  on the negotiations between the Croatian side and the Serb  rebels. The rebel Serb authorities have refused to take part in  the second round of talks, scheduled for last week. There is an  increasing number of reports on provocations by Serb  paramilitary formations, particularly in sectors west and south.  The Serb rebels in Baranja have again taken up arms, thus  violating the cease-fire agreement of 29 March, Nobilo says.    The Croatian ambassador also warns that, due to the  situation  in Gorazde, another wave of refugees could arrive in central  Bosnia, which could damage the prospects for gradual  implementation of the agreement on the Croat-Bosniak federation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed in Washington.    Nobilo notes that a refugee wave could spread into the  Republic of Croatia, which is already providing accommodation  for 280,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The situation in Gorazde is a repetition of the tragedy of  Vukovar, where the world merely watched as innocent people were  victimized by a regime held in contempt.    The Serb aggression must finally be halted, Nobilo's letter  says. The UN Security Council must be ready to impose peace.  Lack of decisive action within the possibilities open to the  Security Council would at the moment threaten not only the  prospects for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the  territorial integrity and safety of the Republic of Croatia. My  government, while continuing to support the peace process,  retains the right to re-examine its position regarding the  situation in the occupied territories in these dangerous,  deteriorating circumstances, in accordance with Article 51 of  the UN Charter, the letter says in conclusion.</p>

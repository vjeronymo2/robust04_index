			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed J.M.: "SRPI Ready for 0.3-mm-Pitch </F> Surface-Mounted Component Devices"]    [Text] The French subcontractor SRPI is the first company  in Europe to acquire a Fuji FIPIII surface mounting machine  which can produce surface mounted components [SMC's] at a 0.3-mm  pitch.    To keep pace with the growing integration of electronic  components (larger packages with increasingly numerous  connections at an increasingly fine pitch), SRPI, a  subcontracting company based at Redon [northeast France], has  recently invested "several millions of French francs [Fr]" in a  surface mounting line for fine-pitch SMC's. The main element in  this line is the Fuji FIPIII machine, which is capable of  assembling everything from chips using the 1005-format (1 x 0.5  mm) to QFP's [quad flat packs] at 0.3-mm pitches with 0.025-mm  precision and TAB [tape automated bonded] and SMC connectors.  SRPI is the first company in Europe to acquire this machine,  and the second in the world (after an American GSM [Global  System for Mobile Communications] terminal manufacturer).    With this investment, the French subcontractor is betting on  the future. Few companies outsourcing work are currently  looking for subcontractors capable of assembling SMC's at 0.3-mm  pitch (SRPI has some requests for component assembly at 0.4 mm  and 0.5 mm), but the natural trend toward increased  miniaturization and complexity of electronic products means that  this ability is a strategic advantage.    SRPI should generate revenues of over Fr120 million this  year  (including its non-electronics activities) and is predicting  growth in the region of 15 percent in 1994.    Between November 1992 and February 1994, the company will  have invested some Fr10 million in its industrial production  facilities.</p>

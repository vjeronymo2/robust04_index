			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the ANC members who sought refuge in the  police station at Ulundi yesterday says he was rescued by white  policemen from almost certain death.    Provincial election candidate Welcome Mthimkulu has alleged  that the KwaZulu policemen were ready to hand the ANC canvassers  over to the mob outside. He said that a number of white  policemen, however, had taken them to a safe place until they  could be removed to Eshowe. Two people were killed in the  clash, eight are still missing, and the ANC has called on the  Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] to launch a search for them. Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi was forced to interrupt his [Orange] Free  State election campaign yesterday to intervene in the conflict  in Ulundi. Dr. Buthelezi persuaded the crowd to disperse after  it had gathered outside the police station.    The ANC supporters and IEC monitors were subsequently taken  in armored vehicles to Eshowe.</p>

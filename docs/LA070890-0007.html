			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: AT LEAST GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TRYING  </P> <P> There is nothing like standing by a cash register with your prospective  purchases and learning that your credit is not good -- unless it is spending  two hours unsnarling the skein of mishaps.  </P> <P> I went to a department store in the Santa Anita Fashion Mall to find something  crisp and cool to wear in La Quinta. This is the time of year when everything  in the closet looks scratchy and feels like something a monk into  self-mortification might slip on.  </P> <P> I found a place to park after just three circuits of the parking area and went  in the store. The petite section is on the second floor. Petite is a size  classification for people who are short. Clothing manufacturers have finally  almost adjusted to the existence of women over 21 years of age being short.  (Petites are often full of bows and ruffles and sparklies. They look as if they  were designed for women who squeal and say "Oooh!" a lot.)  </P> <P> I wandered through the racks of clothes looking for the perfect garment to make  me look tall and willowy.  </P> <P> After a few minutes, a smiling young woman came up and asked if she could help  me. I told her I was looking for tops and pants to wear on a trip where it  would be warm in the daytime and cool in the evening.  </P> <P> My friends all seem to have handsome sweaters in beautiful colors made of  cloud-puff yarn. I have a couple that look as if they should be given to the  dog to use as a blanket; those two and an Aran Islands sweater I bought in  Ireland that is too warm unless a Texas norther is coming through.  </P> <P> Pleasant and helpful salesperson Kathleen Brooker helped me gather some things,  which she folded and placed on the counter in one of the cash register islands.  </P> <P> First, we had to call the assistant manager of the section because I had  selected a sweater that seemed to be an orphan and had a code that made the  computer cross. The assistant manager punched in some numbers that placated the  machine and we pushed forward.  </P> <P> When it was all punched in, Kathleen looked at me, sadly.  </P> <P> "What's the matter?" I quavered.  </P> <P> "It says, 'Customer to credit.' You have to go upstairs," she told me.  </P> <P> I did and stood in line where a number of women were trying to have their bills  explained.  </P> <P> When it was my turn, the young woman in charge of the cash counter brought my  name up from the same computer somewhere and said to me pleasantly, "You  haven't paid your Christmas bill."  </P> <P> I was wrathfully righteous and the woman in charge of the credit desk said I  could speak to someone in the credit office at the downtown store. His name was  Don, and when I told him I lived in La Quinta he told me about his wife's  parents' place next door in Indian Wells.  </P> <P> Don read me the charges on my account from last December. I had bought every  item. The gifts of December sound dreary in the heat of July. But I did  remember each thing and to whom it went.  </P> <P> I explained that I had never been billed for any of these things, and although  I am the soul of rectitude, I am unlikely to send a department store a check in  an undetermined amount at any time, and especially if I have never been asked.  </P> <P> The money desk woman said that my bills had been sent to a man named Thompson  in a city in Arizona where I have never set foot. I told Phyllis Chaucoin at  the money desk that my name was Mrs. Douglas K. Thompson and the account had  been active for some years. The computer had been billing the man in Arizona,  whose name differed somewhat, for seven months.  </P> <P> Don in downtown credit said he would fix everything in the computer and all  would be well after I wrote a check in the amount I owed. I did, and gave the  check to Phyllis and went back to find Kathleen after one hour and 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Several people worked on ringing up my purchases for the second time and you  know what happened. The thing said, "Customer to credit."  </P> <P> I went back upstairs and saw Phyllis, who was sympathetic. By that time, I had  a dull disinterest in everything I had bought.  </P> <P> I went back to Kathleen who was pleasant and apologetic. Later, I tried to tell  the head of personnel how nice Kathleen had been but that department answers,  "Human Resources." I was so demoralized I hung up before I could commend  Kathleen, Phyllis and Don. I thought that by some electronic mishap, I had  reached Washington and the Department of Human Resources.  </P> <P> Yes, I wrote a change of address notice to all of my charge accounts when I  moved and that was the first time I had tried to use that account since I  bought the Christmas stuff.  </P> <P> I phoned and tried once more to tell someone, anyone, that some nice people had  tried to help me but when I asked for Petites, they gave me Better Dresses and  turned on the aural molasses, causing me to hang up, a demoralized broken  blossom.  </P> <P> I think it would have been in the spirit of the season for the fellow in  Arizona to pay that little old bill.  </P></p>

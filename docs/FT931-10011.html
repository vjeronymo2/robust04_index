			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: How the FT will use FRS 3 accounting rule THE CHANGES to company accounts triggered by the new FRS 3 accounting standard will have an impact on companies' results and the way the Financial Times reports them. For many companies, pre-tax profits and earnings per share will be more volatile. However, FRS 3's requirement on them to give more financial data will bring more detail and depth to our reporting and analysis. Not all companies will switch to FRS 3 before the June 22 deadline. For those that do, we will report their results in the following way: The main measure will remain pre-tax profits for the latest period compared with the previous year's figure. For a transitional period, we will show a second comparative figure based on the previous standard. Any factors distorting pre-tax profits, such as the cost of rationalising or disposing of businesses, will be fully reported. Our reports will carry all the figures needed to give a full review of a company's performance. The FRS 3 data will allow for example, a clearer picture to be given of the impact of acquisitions and the cost of disposals. Thus, a more accurate assessment will be possible, for example, of the profitability of a company's on-going businesses. Greater use will also be made ofcashflow statements introduced under FRS 1. The FT will report the earnings per share derived under FRS 3, contrasted to the year earlier figure. We may also report any alternative earnings quoted by the company. For analytical pieces, such as Company Comments and corporate profiles, we will draw on p/e ratios based on eps figures adjusted to remove anomalies and to give a guide to companies' on-going performance. Brokers' analysts have begun work on such adjusted figures; we will be following their efforts closely. FT Statistics, the department which provides the London Share Service prices, is discussing the appropriate treatment of earnings for the p/e ratios shown on these pages. The policy to be adopted will be announced in due course.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           GRAND METROPOLITAN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            CONSOLIDATED PROFIT &amp; LOSS ACCOUNT -

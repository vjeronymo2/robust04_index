			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> BARREL OF BEER ADS ADD UP TO BIG BUCKS  </P> <P> Dick Schultz, the executive director of the NCAA, politely calls it "mixed  messages." Not so charitably, I would call it "hypocrisy" when drug-education  spots during NCAA telecasts are followed by beer commercials.  </P> <P> Schultz has emerged as a central figure in raising consciousness about college  sports' identification with beer huckstering and its effects on youth.  </P> <P> He said: "High school federations and others say that there are three million  to four million alcoholics under drinking age in this country, that the No. 1  problem on campuses and in high schools is alcohol abuse. We have to be  concerned."  </P> <P> When Schultz first broached this issue of "mixed messages," he seemed to  suggest completely eliminating beer commercials from NCAA telecasts. This was  met with opposition not only by the networks and beer companies, but also by  school officials.  </P> <P> "The beer companies got upset that beer was called an illegal drug," Schultz  said. "But beer is illegal for those under drinking age, which takes in most  college students."  </P> <P> The networks are concerned about any threat to sponsorship dollars. But they  have been shrewd enough not to raise a big public stink about Schultz' threat.  They merely pointed out a number of facts of life. If Schultz' desire to drop  beer commercials from NCAA tournament programming meant less revenue for  telecasters, it would also mean a smaller rights fee for the NCAA, which will  negotiate its next TV contract in the fall.  </P> <P> The realistic fact is, though, that the NCAA basketball tournament is such a  hot property on television that other well-heeled companies would no doubt rush  in to fill commercial gaps created by the absence of the beer barons.  </P> <P> The significant objection has been raised by NCAA member schools. Arizona  Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey, chairman of the Division I men's basketball  committee, has said a number of athletic directors are opposed to a beer-ad ban  by the NCAA because it would pressure individual schools to follow suit, wiping  out beer commercials on regular-season telecasts. It would also raise the  question of schools taking beer-signage money, beer ads in publications and  beer sponsorships from coach's TV shows.  </P> <P> Schultz sees the beer issue as a question of the hypocritical factor vs. the  schools' fear that the ban would trickle down revenue they believe they can't  afford to lose. He appears to recognize the trickle-down factor as a formidable  obstacle to a beer ban, because he is talking about something less drastic than  an outright beer ban.  </P> <P> The current NCAA Tournament deal with CBS limits beer advertising to 90 seconds  per hour. If beer ads are to continue, Schultz said, "I would hope that at a  minimum, we could limit those announcements to moderation or education-type  messages about responsible drinking. The industry tells me they spend millions  on such moderate-drinking messages, and I think that would be more apt on our  telecasts."  </P> <P> The beer industry has suggested that the proposal may be an infringement of  free speech. Isn't that a joke? With the Niagara of beer advertising all over  the tube, just how much of a gag on beer huckstering would an NCAA ban  represent?  </P> <P> Schultz heads an executive negotiating committee that includes two people from  Divison I basketball. They will set the guidelines about beer commercials in  negotiating the next NCAA Tournament rights, not only with CBS, but with NBC  and ABC, which are also lusting for the NCAA jamboree.  </P> <P> The issue now comes down to the pressure put on the NCAA by citizens concerned  about drugs -- which includes alcohol, which includes beer -- against the  inside pressure by big schools that don't want to lose beer-ad revenue.  </P> <P> Schools will lobby quietly and with force inside the NCAA. Citizen groups  concerned with the alcohol problem on and off campuses and with impressionable  pre-high schoolers assaulted by beer commercials will have to lay siege to the  NCAA publicly.  </P></p>

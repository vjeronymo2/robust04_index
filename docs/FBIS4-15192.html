			<p>BFN     [Text] ITAR-TASS reported Wednesday that "President Boris  Yeltsin endorsed the proposal made by the Defense Ministry and  cleared with the Foreign Ministry on the setting up of Russian  military bases in CIS member states and in Latvia for the  purpose of maintaining the security of the Russian Federation  and the countries in question and testing for new military  hardware." The agency said its source was the president's order  to which it had obtained access.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told Interfax  that  to the best of his knowledge his ministry had had nothing to do  with the preparation of that document.    Still, he said, the ministry would not be able to respond  properly before the document mentioned in the ITAR-TASS report  was thoroughly studied.    He placed special emphasis on the fact that "all military  issues in the relations with Latvia were settled in the  Russian-Latvian agreements that were initialed recently."    Under the agreements on the withdrawal of Russian troops  that  were initialed in Moscow in mid-March the Russian strategically  important radar station in Skrunda will effectively remain "a  Russian military establishment under civilian control" for a  term of five and a half years and cannot be regarded as a  military base.    Officials in the Defense Ministry's Press and Information  Department told Interfax that Chief of General Staff Mikhail  Kolesnikov had given no interview to ITAR-TASS and "could not  talk about the setting up of a Russian military base in Latvia,  as reported by that agency."</p>

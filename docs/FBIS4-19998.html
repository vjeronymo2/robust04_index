			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has emphatically  refused to mention a date for the abolition of the solidarity  surcharge. "I will never again be accused of a tax lie," Kohl  stressed today on the television program "Let's Get Down to  Business, Chancellor" of the private television station SAT-1.  At the congress of the Free Democratic Party of Germany in  North Rhine-Westphalia during the weekend [23-24 April], party  leader Klaus Kinkel suggested reconsidering the solidarity  surcharge, which will be levied as of 1 January 1995 and which  will be 7.5 percent of the gross salary, after three years.    However, Kohl promised to lower taxes "as soon as we will  have overcome the worst." In any event, he refused to mention a  date for the abolition of the solidarity surcharge.    On the eve of the discussions among the coalition and the  cabinet on a reduction of the Bundeswehr, Kohl stated that, as  far as the concept is concerned, there is no difference between  Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic  Union). The tasks of the Bundeswehr have changed after the end  of the Cold War and require a great deal more money. "We must  manage with the money that we have and set priorities," Kohl  pointed out. The soldiers will still get what they need. A  reduction of the German Armed Force from 370,000 to 340,000 men  is by no means a security problem, the chancellor stressed.    Answering questions by citizens at the main square in  Wernigerode (Saxony-Anhalt) who participated live in the  program, Kohl was confident concerning the economic development.  An upswing is in full swing in the east. This year alone,  about 100,000 new apartments will be built and approximately  one-third of the roads will be repaired. The number of the  unemployed is also stagnating. "We are slowly but surely  overcoming the lowest point," Kohl stated.</p>

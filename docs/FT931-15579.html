			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Savings help AG Barr advance 80% COST SAVINGS derived from the 1991 restructuring of its production and distribution helped AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company whose brands include Irn-Bru and Tizer, to lift pre-tax profits 80 per cent to Pounds 5.97m in the 53 weeks to October 31. The result, up from a restated Pounds 3.31m for the previous 52 weeks - where the extraordinary restructuring costs were brought above the line - was struck on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 94.7m (Pounds 90m), though this translated into a 3 per cent rise when adjusted for the extra week. The pre-tax line was also helped by the reduction of interest charges from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 1.07m - borrowings fell by Pounds 3.75m over the year, according to Mr Robin Barr, chairman. There was also a Pounds 409,000 gain from the sale of the stake in Taveners, the sugar confectionery maker. With operating profits up 17 per cent at Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 5.66m), Mr Barr said it had been 'a strong year' for the company, adding that in a static soft drinks market Barr brands had outperformed competitors, and this in a year of recession when the weather had been unseasonal in the traditionally strong-selling months of August and September. In Scotland, Irn-Bru commands 18 per cent of the branded market, against Coca Cola which has 25 per cent and Pepsi 8 per cent. In the other flavours segment of the UK carbonates market, it has an 8 per cent share, behind Tango with 12 per cent. Tizer, which Mr Barr said was returning to TV advertising after a three-year absence, has 2.5 per cent. Mr Barr warned that the first two months of the current year had been affected by price cutting on commodity flavours and that sugar prices had risen 16 per cent between September 1992 and January 1993 because of the fall in the value of the green pound. He reckoned this would result in price increases on brands of about 6 per cent, rather than the 2 per cent planned two months before Black Wednesday. Earnings grew to 21.67p (12.2p) per share and the final dividend is lifted to 4.75p (4.3767p) to make 6.5p (5.46p) for the year, a rise of 19 per cent.</p>

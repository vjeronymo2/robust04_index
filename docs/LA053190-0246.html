			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALIENATED 'ALIEN NATION' SEEKS VIEWER SUPPORT  </P> <P> Fox Broadcasting has zapped "Alien Nation" and the Newcomers are not pleased.  </P> <P> They want viewers who enjoyed the show to write to Fox demanding its return --  a ploy that revived "Cagney &amp; Lacy" on CBS but has not worked for other  shows. It did not even beam "Star Trek" back aboard NBC years ago.  </P> <P> "Alien Nation," for those who don't know a Newcomer from an Overseer, uses the  premise of alien refugees from outer space settling in Los Angeles to focus on  a wide range of human institutions and peculiarities.  </P> <P> It also is a cop show, teaming a human and an alien as police partners. Michele  Scarabelli plays Susan Francisco, the wife of alien cop George Francisco.  </P> <P> "We're in shock," Scarabelli said in an interview after learning the bad news  when Fox announced its new fall schedule Tuesday and "Alien Nation" was absent.  </P> <P> "Up until the Friday before the announcement they were telling us how much they  liked the show and how excited they were about the upcoming season," she said.  "Then on Friday they told (producer) Ken Johnson that they were trying to find  a place for us on the new fall schedule. Then late Monday they told him they  couldn't find a place on the schedule. How's that for the lame excuse of the  week award?  </P> <P> "We're all kind of reeling. We believed we had a hit and now we're realizing  there are no guarantees," Scarabelli said. "Most of us feel we had stories  still to tell."  </P> <P> Scarabelli talked about the encouraging critical reaction to the series -- she  liked the television critic who said he felt closer to the Newcomers than to  his family in Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> "I think people should let the network know that there is a following for the  show; that they shouldn't rely completely on the Nielsen ratings, which is a  false barometer anyway, especially for Fox."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  2. Conduct of Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department reserves the right to select the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons to be heard at the hearing, to schedule the respective presentations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of each presentation is limited to 15 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A DOE official will be designated to preside at the hearing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing will not be a judicial or an evidentiary-type hearing, but will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 533 and section 336 of the Act. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion of all initial oral statements at each day of the hearing, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuttal statement, subject to time limitations. The rebuttal statement will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given in the order in which the initial statements were made. The official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting the hearing will accept additional comments or questions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those attending, as time permits. Any interested person may submit, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presiding official, written questions to be asked of any person making a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement at the hearing. The presiding official will determine whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question is relevant, and whether time limitations permit it to be presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for answer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Further questioning of speakers will be permitted by DOE. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presiding official will afford any interested person an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question other interested persons who made oral presentations, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees of the United States who have made written or oral presentations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to disputed issues of material fact relating to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. This opportunity will be afforded after any rebuttal statements, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that the presiding official determines that such questioning is likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to result in a more timely and effective resolution of such issues. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time provided is insufficient, DOE will consider affording an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for questioning at a mutually convenient time. Persons interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in making use of this opportunity must submit their request to the presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official no later than shortly after the completion of any rebuttal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements and be prepared to state specific justification, including why the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue is one of disputed fact and how the proposed questions would expedite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Any further procedural rules regarding proper conduct of the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be announced by the presiding official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A transcript of the hearing will be made, and the entire record of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, including the transcript, will be retained by DOE and made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for inspection at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided at the beginning of this notice. Any person may purchase a copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transcript from the transcribing reporter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d.

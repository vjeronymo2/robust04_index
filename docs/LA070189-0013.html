			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF I.F. STONE, 'CONSCIENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM'  </P> <P> The Times deserves special commendation for the excellent news story (Part I,  June 19) and editorial ("Journalist of Integrity," June 20) in regard to the  passing of Stone.  </P> <P> One additional item in his illustrious career that deserves notice: Izzy  deserves credit for launching the successful campaign to abolish the old House  Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).  </P> <P> In mid-May, 1957, when most civil libertarians were devoting their energies on  this issue by just defending the "victims" of HUAC (those subpoenaed to appear  before this ongoing national witch hunt), it was Stone who correctly sensed  that the time was ripe for its abolition. Based on a little noticed U.S.  Supreme Court decision (Watkins vs. U.S.) at that time, where Chief Justice  Earl Warren pointedly asked, "Who can define the meaning of Un-American  activities?", the Weekly devoted an issue on the HUAC question and Izzy was on  the phone to friends all over the nation, including the writer, insisting that  not another day be lost.  </P> <P> He was most persuasive. Response was immediate: Alexander Meiklejohn, Corliss  Lamont, Carey McWilliams, Aubrey Williams, Clarence Pickett, Harvey O'Connor  and many more took up the call -- through petitions, editorials, and  grass-roots organizing, the campaign to end congressional inquisitions started.  Hollywood 10's Dalton Trumbo joined Princeton's Prof. H.H. Wilson to pack  Carnegie Hall for a kick-off rally sponsored by the then-Emergency Civil  Liberties Committee; to be followed thereafter by the creation of the National  Committee to Abolish HUAC.  </P> <P> While it took 18 more years to do the monster in, in 1975, the ultimate victory  over the committee and for the First Amendment, properly goes to I.F. Stone.  </P> <P> FRANK WILKINSON  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> National Committee to Abolish HUAC  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

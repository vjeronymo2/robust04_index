			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA FOES DIDN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF DEMOCRACY;  </P> <P> PANAMA: THE ABORTIVE COUP WAS ENTIRELY A MILITARY MATTER. NEXT TIME, THE  CITIZENRY WILL HAVE A WINNING ROLE.  </P> <P> As we were informed very early on the morning of Oct. 3 that shooting had  erupted at command headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, a group of  Panamanian exiles met and started making calls to our country. Reports were  very confused, but it was clear that a major coup attempt against Gen. Manuel  Antonio Noriega was in progress. The action seemed to be concentrated at  headquarters, which led one to assume Noriega was inside, for the headquarters  building is not necessarily the most important military garrison. Since troops  on the outside were shooting inward, it was clear that this was a battle  between loyalists and rebel troops. It was also clear that there was  cooperation by U.S. troops, which secured Ft. Amador (a joint base), locking in  Noriega troops, as well as Ft. Clayton, the Bridge of the Americas and the  Avenue of the Martyrs.  </P> <P> Then the rebels' first and only communique was read on Radio Exitosa. As we  listened, our concern deepened. Normally, plotters in Latin American military  institutions make all sorts of promises to draw support from as many  constituencies as possible. Typically, they say that the coup is to "restore  democracy," "clean up corruption," "respect human rights," "restore justice,"  "respect the will of the people through clean elections," "protect against  foreign ideological penetration," "produce change," and so on.  </P> <P> In this case, the communique, signed by Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega and Capt.  Javier Licona, was totally different from the norm. It began by proclaiming a  "return to Torrijismo," which in essence meant "no change," just more of the  same with different faces. It then said that it would respect the present  government -- the puppet government installed by Noriega. Democracy was not  mentioned once, nor was justice. The communique stated that this was purely a  military operation with absolutely no political ties -- in other words, a clear  disconnection from the people's movement for democracy. It then listed those  officers who would be retired, starting with Noriega; it did not include any of  his gang.  </P> <P> In essence, this coup would have condemned the people of Panama to  "Norieguismo" without Noriega -- to a change so that nothing changes.  </P> <P> Of course, the relief of getting rid of Noriega -- in Panama, internationally  and in the United States -- would have been so great that voices of concerned  democrats would have been drowned out. The Administration in Washington would  probably have gone back to business as usual with the Panama narco-military  machine, as it would have a fresh face. After all, President Bush said "we have  no quarrel with the PDF . . . it is Noriega we want out." God help us! we  thought; the PDF has proven to any and all objective observers that it is a  gang of thugs dressed in U.S. military uniforms with a different shoulder  patch. This uniformed gang is incompatible with democracy in Panama. The people  of Panama are not struggling for "stability" a la Noriega or a la Giroldi. They  are struggling for democracy, which is their traditional form of government and  the only true possibility for institutional stability.  </P> <P> When we got final word that the coup had failed, there was -- incredibly -- a  sense of relief. After this "victory," Noriega will have to face harsh  realities. He is in a political vacuum, as last spring's election showed in its  3-1 defeat of his candidates. His regime is completely isolated by the  international community. His own military is fatally fractured. The coup  leaders included the commanders of the units most loyal to Noriega -- the crack  Special Forces (the unit in charge of headquarters security), the cavalry and  the G-2 intelligence unit, which Noriega headed and nurtured for 14 years. As  for age group, there were junior officers, mid-level officers and very senior  officers -- a cross section of the total force.  </P> <P> For those of us who have battled for democracy in Panama for 20 years, this  coup attempt was an unexpected bonus with a silver lining. The internal and  external pressures will now multiply geometrically, pressing for legitimate  democratic changes.  </P> <P> The brief drama of Oct. 3 held many lessons for military and civilians alike,  such as: A successful military coup requires the participants' decision to kill  or be killed; they cannot depend on U.S. assistance; they must connect with the  people's militant nonviolent movement, and the objective must be legitimate  democracy.  </P> <P> We, the people of Panama, will persist in our democratic struggle, and we will  soon prevail over narco-militarism, in spite of our friends.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: France set to back down on capital gains tax plan THE FRENCH Treasury is understood to be ready to back down over proposals designed to tighten rules governing the taxation of capital gains earned by French residents. The proposals, as originally conceived, could have driven debt issuance by French borrowers offshore and reduced the liquidity of the French bond market. Yesterday, Credit Foncier changed plans to launch a domestic issue with an international tranche because of fears of the tax changes. Instead, the financial institution launched a FFr3bn Eurobond and a FFr1.2bn domestic bond issues. In fact, the proposals were intended to facilitate taxation of capital gains earned on 'stripped' bonds - bonds which have been reduced to their component parts of individual coupons. But the proposals, in their initial form, would also have affected the issuance of fungible debt held by French investors. French borrowers, in an effort to increase the liquidity of their debt, frequently add new tranches to existing issues, a practice which would have been penalised under the proposed changes. The proposal would have scuppered the chances of France's burgeoning public debt market, set up last month by four leading state-owned entities including Credit Foncier. The market, designed to combine international and domestic distribution, imitates the structure of the French Treasury market, with a group of committed market-makers called Specialistes en Valeurs du Secteur Public (SVP). The change would also have gone against the French government's strong tradition of promoting market reform and encouraging liquidity. The Treasury is expected to back down following representations by the French banks.</p>

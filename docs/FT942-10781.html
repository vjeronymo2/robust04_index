			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Growth and the Tories The economy must provide some of the few rays of hope left for Britain's prime minister. But will it be enough to save him and the Tories? Two questions arise: first, what sort of growth will be delivered in the near future and, second, will this satisfy the voters? Unfortunately for the government, growth is unlikely to be impressive enough to win back its supporters. Recent evidence does show a steady recovery, with low inflation. Gross domestic product grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year to regain its pre-recession peak of four years ago. Unemployment is falling, while underlying inflation is at its lowest for 25 years. This is good news, but it is less encouraging on closer inspection. Much of the growth in GDP was due to a surge in North sea oil and gas production, while output of manufactures is still 4.2 per cent below its peak in 1990. The fall in unemployment still leaves 2.72m people out of work; the jobs that have been created in the recovery have tended to be part-time or self-employed; and the number of employees in employment has fallen. The greatest uncertainty concerns the effects of last month's tax increases. If consumers were to take fright, the UK's largely consumer-led recovery could be checked. Early evidence is inconclusive. Consumer confidence was near to a record low in April, according to a Gallup poll, but this report is at odds with official data on consumer spending. Retail sales grew rapidly in March and were up by 3.8 per cent on a year earlier, while narrow money, normally regarded as a good coincident indicator of consumer spending, increased by 6.2 per cent in the year to April. Lending by banks and building societies expanded rapidly in March. But much of this was due to lending to the financial sector, while borrowing for personal consumption remained weak. Satisfy public All in all, the recovery is likely to weather the tax rises and the government forecast of 2 1/2 per cent growth in the economy this year is also likely to be met. The problem for Mr Major is that this may not be enough to satisfy the public. After enjoying growth rates of 4 per cent or more for successive years between 1985 and 1988, only to be pummelled by a long recession, voters feel cheated. What is more, although output has reclaimed its pre-recessionary peak, it is still well below levels people expected before the recession. Worse still, despite the recovery, real personal disposable fell in the third quarter of last year and grew by a paltry 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Taken fright Even though the public at large has barely registered the recovery so far, financial markets have already taken fright. The continued rise in bond rates - now two percentage points higher than during the trough at the turn of the year - shows that investors at least believe recovery is well-established. They also expect inflation to start rising. The gap between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, which is a good indicator of inflationary expectations, is up by more than one point since January, to 4.7 percentage points. These fears are probably exaggerated. Underlying inflation is quite low. Import prices, producer prices, pay settlements and unit wage costs all remain subdued. There is also spare capacity in the economy: the International Monetary Fund estimates an output gap of 4-5 per cent. If correct, this should allow the UK several years of non-inflationary growth. The only significant indication of a pick-up in inflation is the rise in the rate of growth of average earnings. This increase, from 3.0 per cent in November to 3.25 per cent in both December and January, indicates that the trough in earnings has passed. Financial markets may turn out to be in an unjustifiable tizzy, but lack of credibility is itself a constraint on policy makers. They may be forced to raise short-term interest rates far earlier than they would like. Yet even if economic growth can be sustained at present rates, the necessary increase in taxes will still prove unpopular. The rise in pre-tax real wages must also remain modest, if increases in employment are to be sustained. In short, dissatisfaction is bound to remain rife, which is not good news for Mr Major and the Tories.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Ye.N. Podkolzin, commander </F> of Russian Federation Airborne Troops, by Colonel Aleksandr  Oliynik; place and date not given: "Colonel General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin: Our Peacemakers in Bosnia Were Welcomed With Bread  and Salt. Airborne Troops' Commander Answers Questions From  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent"]    [Text] [Oliynik] Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, Russia's  initiative, thanks to which the threat of a new escalation of  the war in the Balkans because of the NATO ultimatum has been  averted, is today being called none other than a "diplomatic  triumph for the Russians." But when did you yourself learn of  it? For literally until recently the opposite viewpoint  prevailed, did it not, in our political leadership and in the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense -- not to send our "blue  helmets" into the Bosnian meat grinder on any pretext?    [Podkolzin] Yes, indeed, until very recently both the  president of Russia and the minister of defense were doing all  they could to oppose -- I will not fight shy of this word -- the  use of our "blue helmets" within the framework of the UN  peacemaking forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although, as we know,  there had been quite a few calls for this both from the United  Nations and from Washington and other Western countries. In my  view the decisive factor which influenced our policy on the  Bosnian crisis was not only the tough NATO ultimatum, which,  incidentally, was announced without consultation with Russia --  a permanent member of the UN Security Council -- but the fact  that the proposed airstrike not only would not have brought  nearer the peaceful settlement of the crisis but, on the  contrary, would have led to a new escalation of the war in the  Balkans and to numerous human casualties.    [Oliynik] It is appropriate here to recall also the history  of World War II in the Balkans. A total of 20 divisions -- 8  German and 12 Italian -- got stuck in the Bosnian mountains in  an attempt to crush the Yugoslav partisans' resistance. Tito's  army not only held out but also triumphed....    [Podkolzin] Exactly. The Balkans are not Iraq, and  strong-arm methods, as the facts show, do not work here. Before  playing at war we should think about the consequences of  military operations for the Balkans and for Europe as a whole.  As for my own participation in carrying out our initiative, I  learned of it from a personal conversation with Army General  Pavel Grachev which I had at 1300 hours 18 February. The  minister of defense reported that the Russian president had  decided, in line with an accord with Radovan Karadzic, the  Bosnian Serb leader, to transfer to Sarajevo part (400 men) of  our UN battalion stationed in Serb Krajina. In order to  coordinate operations, on the morning of 19 February I flew out  to Belgrade and then to Sarajevo together with Vitaliy Churkin,  the president's special representative, and with officers of the  Airborne Troops. Incidentally, owing to bad weather Belgrade  was not receiving flights (visibility was down to zero), and yet  our pilots managed to land the aircraft after circling five  times.    [Oliynik] We know from television broadcasts and the press  how enthusiastically the population of Bosnia welcomed the  column of Russian paratroopers. But I guess this march of  almost 500 km through the mountains was not easy, was it?    [Podkolzin] Of course, this rapid relocation cost the  soldiers and officers a great effort. For we had not only to  prepare hardware for the march but also to select the men: The  contracts of the majority of the paratroopers end in April, and  they were to have returned home. Then the order came to set out  for Sarajevo. They must be given their due -- no one was  frightened by the dangers. At exactly the designated time --  1800 hours 20 February -- our armored group headed by Colonel  Viktor Vorobyev arrived in the Sarajevo region. Moreover, it  was a mixed column -- in the space of 18 hours 21 armored  personnel carriers and 40 Ural trucks negotiated six passes on  the 500-km route and went through a snowstorm, across unfamiliar  terrain. You can understand our paratroopers' feelings when,  contrary to expectations, they were greeted with songs, bread  and salt.... Incidentally, our column was given an enthusiastic  welcome not only by Serbs but also by Muslims, but this did not  embarrass the Muslim leaders, who voiced their displeasure at  this.    [Oliynik] Won't our "blue helmets" find themselves in the  role of a live target at Sarajevo? For, in the event of new  clashes between the warring sides, they will hardly be stopped  by the blue UN color of the Russian paratroopers' uniform. In  addition, direct provocations cannot be ruled out either....    [Podkolzin] This is the most complex and difficult question  today. Our paratroopers have taken up positions near Trebevic  and Vraca, from where the Serbs have withdrawn their heavy arms,  and also around Sarajevo Airport. They find themselves at a  bullet's distance, as it were, from both warring sides --  Muslims and Serbs. Let us be frank -- in the event of a  large-scale conflict it will not, of course, be possible to  avoid casualties. At the same time Britain's General Rose,  commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with whom I  met twice, assured me that he is taking all measures for the  safety of the contingent of "blue helmets," including the  Russians. To this end a reinforcement has now arrived in the  Sarajevo region from the Scandinavian, Jordanian, and Slovak  battalions stationed in Croatia, as well as two British  battalions from Central Bosnia. To this it should be added that  the leaders of the Bosnians and the Serbs assured me and the  command of the UN forces in Bosnia that they would no longer  permit large-scale combat operations in the Sarajevo region....    [Oliynik] What can you say about the duration of our  paratroopers' stay in the Sarajevo region?    [Podkolzin] It would be better to ask the politicians about  this, and not just our politicians. Too much hatred has built  up in the Balkans during the two-year period of bloodshed, and  there have been too many casualties to be able to speak of the  sides' rapid reconciliation. But I am certain of one thing:  The Bosnian crisis must be resolved by political means alone.  If we are speaking of the immediate future of our paratroopers  in this region, it is known that, in accordance with the Russian  president's decision and with the agreement of the Federation  Council, an additional troop contingent of 300 men is setting  out for Bosnia-Herzegovina to participate in the peacemaking  mission as part of the UN forces. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has  already reported, incidentally, our second battalion of "blue  helmets" will be stationed there. We have also put a proposal  to the UN Secretariat to increase the number of our officers on  the staff of the commander of the UN forces in Yugoslavia, which  is in Zagreb, and on the Sarajevo-based staff of the UN forces.    [Oliynik] Having recovered from its shock at the  galvanization of Russian policy in the Balkans, the West has now  started saying that, since the NATO ultimatum has taken effect,  it would not be a bad thing to apply it in other parts of Bosnia  too. What is your view?    [Podkolzin] I am afraid our paratroopers would not suffice  for all the "hot spots" in Bosnia. I am joking, of course, but  seriously, the "policy of ultimatums" can hardly be applied --  on 21 February the Balkans and maybe also the whole of Europe  were on the brink of war. We know too well that many wars need  only a spark to ignite them but are far harder to end.    [Oliynik] Incidentally, where were you at 0100 hours 21  February?    [Podkolzin] Despite the fact that our delegation had been  informed that there would be no bombing strikes, I well knew as  a military man that the NATO war machine had been set in motion  and that the most irremediable eventuality might occur. At the  moment the ultimatum expired (this was 0300 hours, local time,  21 February) I was on the territory of the hospitable Ukrainian  UN battalion. Everyone was anxious, and -- I will not hide the  fact -- when the ultimatum ran out, together with the Ukrainian  officers (for the majority were serving in our troops only  yesterday) we raised our glasses to the Russian paratroopers who  had won a victory in Bosnia without a war. Who knows, it was,  maybe, thanks to our mobility that all of Europe woke up that  February morning without a war....</p>

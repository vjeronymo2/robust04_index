			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Lebanon Beirut's defunct stock exchange will reopen within two months, the president of the newly-appointed stock exchange committee said in a newspaper interview. The exchange, which operated last in 1984 at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, would trade in shares of those companies listed on the exchange before it closed, he said. These are currently being dealt in the unofficial grey market.</p>

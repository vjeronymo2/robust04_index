			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> World Bank to Provide Mexico With $2 Billion: World Bank President Barber B.  Conable Jr., said in a speech delivered in Mexico City on Latin American  economic growth and reforms that the international agency will provide $2  billion to support the reduction of Mexico's public foreign debt with  commercial banks. The Mexican government and a 15-member Bank Advisory  Committee, which represents about 500 commercial banks and has been negotiating  a reduction of the Latin American nation's commercial debt, are expected to  sign a landmark debt reduction accord Feb. 4 in Mexico City. The debt reduction  agreement, assembled under the so-called Brady Plan drawn up by U.S. Treasury  Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, is expected to cut Mexico's annual debt payments  by nearly $4 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Espy to quit Clinton cabinet at year-end Mr Mike Espy yesterday said that he would resign as US agriculture secretary, after charges of misusing government funds and improperly accepting gifts from farm businesses under his authority. The cabinet member, who was one of President Bill Clinton's closest allies in the south during the 1992 presidential election campaign, has been under investigation by the Office of Government Ethics, which was expected to complete its report this week, and by a special counsel. At a news conference yesterday, Mr Espy said he was resigning with effect from December 31, 'to overcome the challenge to my good name'. Mr Clinton said in a statement that he regretted the resignation but said it was 'appropriate.' He added: 'Although Secretary Espy has said he has done nothing wrong, I am troubled by the appearance of some of these incidents'. The president praised Mr Espy's service at the agriculture department, but said that, for the rest of his tenure, the secretary would make no decisions on meat and poultry inspection. Mr Espy is only the second person to quit Mr Clinton's cabinet. Mr Les Aspin resigned last year as defence secretary amid doubts over his decisiveness and his handling of the US involvement in Somalia. But Mr Clinton has been dogged, like other recent presidents, by allegations of conflicts of interest. Most of these have touched questions about his own involvement, through his investment in the Whitewater property venture, in the failure of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan. Mr Espy used to be a high-flying member of the Democratic Leadership council, a centrist grouping which provided much of the early intellectual underpinning of Mr Clinton's campaign. When elected to Congress in 1986, aged 32, Mr Espy was the first black congressman from Mississippi since the Reconstruction period immediately after the Civil War. He has been accused of accepting air trips and sports tickets from businesses with interests in his department's work, such as Tyson Foods, the Arkansas poultry group, or California's Sun Diamond Growers.</p>

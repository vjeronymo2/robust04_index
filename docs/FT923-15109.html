			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Hopes fade for reactor aid deal HOPES are fading of reaching agreement at next week's G7 world economic summit on a special Dollars 700m emergency aid fund to make safe 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Instead the seven industrialised nations are expected to decide on pressing ahead with bilateral programmes co-ordinated through the Group of 24 in the OECD, with a commitment to set up a joint programme only if all aspects of nuclear safety cannot be covered by bilateral contracts. The bilateral action will be co-ordinated on the basis of the single action programme drawn up by a G7 working group. This should go some way to meeting Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire for 'concrete action' to tackle what is seen in Germany as the single greatest threat to humanity from the collapse of the Soviet empire. A G7 working group had recommended Dollars 700m to close, overhaul or re-equip a total of 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in operation, and a further 23 under construction. The most urgent action is required at 15 Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors, and 10 VVER 440/230 reactors, all of which 'should be shut down as soon as possible,' according to the recommendation to the G7 leaders. Upgrading should be feasible at 32 more modern pressurised water reactors. The fund foundered on strong US and Japanese resistance to a joint exercise, and doubts in Washington about allowing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to co-ordinate it. A senior US official said Washington 'wants to get this going bilaterally, because it will get money flowing. It would take a year if it were done in a bureaucratic way.' Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary at the German finance ministry, yesterday outlined the 'phased programme' of support for Russian economic reform to be offered to President Boris Yeltsin at the G7 summit. In the first phase, the club of western creditors would agree on debt rescheduling, and the IMF would advance a first Dollars 1bn credit tranche, in exchange for 'an agreement or a declaration of intent' from the Russian government on precisely how it intended to reduce its budget deficit and bring inflation under control. The second phase would involve the full IMF standby programme, which would inevitably take longer to negotiate. Only once that was in place would the west make available the promised Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund as a third phase. Soviet nuclear plants, page 16 The Russian authorities have finally decided to stick to their initial plan of letting market forces determine a unified exchange rate for the rouble, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow. The change of heart - which follows last-minute arguments within the government and with the International Monetary Fund - strengthens the government's campaign to reaffirm its commitment to market reforms ahead of President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with G7 leaders next week. It also clears the way for an agreement with an IMF team, currently in Moscow, for a Dollars 1bn loan, for which a unified exchange rate was a condition.</p>

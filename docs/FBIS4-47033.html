			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raisa Yeldashova: "Chinese Love Has Passed...."] </F>   [Text] Which, in general was precisely what should  have been expected. So strong was our fascination with the  neighboring country during the past three years that in the heat  of "passion" both inadequate measures and abnormal contracts  piled up. People closed their eyes to quality and to strangeness  in the conduct of the economic partners, and so on, and so  forth. In this spirit, A. Levintal, chairman of the Committee  for Economic Policy of the administration of the kray, opened  the session of the regular Council on Foreign Economic Relations.    The mutual cooling-off manifests itself extremely clearly.  As  the chief of the Amur River Steamship Line, A. Sukhov, informed  the assembled, no one at the present time concludes contracts  for the transportation of cargo to the Chinese or to our side  with the steamship line; all the same, there are no cargoes in  the port. And the point is not that it is still early--last year  at this time there was no getting rid of businessmen.    Automobile crossings in Pokrovka, near Bikin, and in  Kazakevichev also have not produced the expected effect.    Another symptom is the reduction in the rate of registration  of joint enterprises with China. As the chief of the Department  for Foreign Economic Relations of the administration, N.  Pisarenko, reported to the assembled, there is a trend on the  part of our neighbors to create their own enterprises 100  percent in the territory of the kray. According to information  of the Khabarovsk City Service for Foreign Economic Relations,  this is done for the purpose of the further creation of joint  enterprises on the part of the Third World--Southeast Asia.    Among the objective manifestations of the "fall of  temperature" one can also include the toughening of the passport  and visa procedure, the entry from one country to the other, and  the prohibition by our governor of the registration of joint  ventures in apartment houses.    There are, of course, many reasons for the mutual  disappointment. We have stuffed ourselves with Chinese consumer  goods not of the best quality and we prefer the goods of other  countries, even if more expensive, but better. The same with  food projects, with the exception perhaps of noodles, apples,  and sugar.    The businessmen wore themselves out "beating" each other  over  the fulfillment of contracts, both in hard currency and in  barter.    Out of 193 Russian-Chinese joint ventures registered as of 1  April of this year (this is 43 percent of their total number in  the kray), only a handful are engaged in production.  Correspondingly, the volume of investments in our economy in  this sector is insignificantly small. The Chinese partners  contribute to the charter fund the funds they have gained in the  kray from the sale of their products. Not to speak of the fact  that statistics and the tax organs not cannot even find the mass  of the joint ventures: People change their address and do not  notify anyone.    Many reproaches were expressed that were aimed at the  practice of barter contracts, which are used to lower the cost  of the deal and the foreign exchange enrichment of the leaders  of the firms.    Great uneasiness is also called forth by the massive export  of foreign exchange from Russia by Chinese businessmen and  speculators. As a countermeasure, it was proposed to establish  foreign exchange taxation at the border (something like the tax  on profits), a foreign currency duty for trading in markets, and  so on.    But these are already details. What awaits us on the plane  of  principles?    At the session it was noted that the government of the PRC  has instructed Chinese entrepreneurs to increase the quality of  their products to make them competitive in the Russian market.  There is a decision to reform the structures of the companies  involved in foreign economic relations and to decrease their  number.    Still another interesting step: Beginning in 1994, it turns  out, China is introducing the licensing of import into the  country of ferrous metallurgy products, and this is the basic  item of our export there, at least during the past year. The  companies that will purchase metal for rubles gained from the  sale of consumer goods in the Russian market are exempted from  the licensing. This is not simply a fight for the market--these  are consequences of the reduction in the quota for the import of  Chinese textiles into the United States. Here we are already  talking about the survival of an industry.    On the other hand, by decision of the PRC Government,  capital  construction has been partly frozen as of November 1993. This  has already struck painfully at firms that had concluded  contracts for the delivery of building materials and metal to  China. The shipped commodity got stuck in warehouses, Chinese  foreign trade companies were proclaimed bankrupt, and ours did  not receive the barter goods. And, obviously, no enlivening is  foreseen in this sphere.    The new Chinese consul in Khabarovsk has already turned to  the Chamber of Commerce and Industry with the request to  organize an exhibition of their consumer goods in order to  demonstrate what their producers are capable of doing, and to  break our allergy to everything Chinese.    There are also many vaguenesses in regard to border  crossings. According to some data, the Chinese authorities are  inclined to think that large capital investments on their side  of the Bikin and Kazakevichev crossings are inexpedient. And, on  the contrary, they are actively building ships of the  "river-sea" type.    Incidentally, having spoken at the Council on Foreign  Economic Relations, Ye. Shchukin, the chief of the Khabarovsk  Customs Service, remarked that his service from the very  beginning expressed doubt about the effectiveness of the  construction of crossings in places where the Chinese side does  not have large settlements and large expenditures are necessary  for the construction of normal roads. And spoke in favor of the  expansion of the existing crossings.    But these are all positions of our neighbors. But is there  an  objective necessity for cooperation with Khabarovsk Kray?    Judging by everything, there nevertheless is. As follows  from  the speech of N. Pisarenko, the expansion of the sale of  products in China is regarded by many entrepreneurs as one of  the variants of the way out of the crisis. Our cutters and  boats, furniture, machine tools, and cable, not to mention metal  and other materials, "go." On the other hand, the kray will have  a difficult time without some Chinese products, above all, food  products. It is another matter that all this Russian-Chinese  business must go into a civilized framework. How to do  this--that is the question.</p>

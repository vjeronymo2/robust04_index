			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses look towards interest rate cuts THE possibility of a further round of European interest rate cuts stimulated activity yesterday, but opinion was divided as to whether governments and central banks would bow to the pressure, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS took its cue from the bond market which stuck to the view that the French government had to lower interest rates. This interpretation was not followed by all equity analysts yesterday, some of whom believed that the government would continue to defend the franc in the currency markets. The CAC 40 index closed up 25.38 at 2,139.26, a week's loss of 0.8 per cent. Turnover was FFr4.6bn. LVMH regained some of the ground it had lost in recent days as various rumours circulated: the shares added FFr117 to FFr3,735. Cap Gemini firmed FFr10.60 to FFr198.90 in spite of reporting first half losses and a gloomy earnings forecast. BRUSSELS swept to a new record close as further speculation against the domestic currency prompted hopes of a cut in interest rates. The Bel-20 index put on 8.15 to 1,370.86, a week's gain of 1.7 per cent. ZURICH rose to its sixth consecutive record close with a continuing firm dollar and easier interest rates pushing prices higher in active trading. The SMI index added 26.2 to 2,612.6, after an intraday high of 2,624.6, for a 3.1 per cent rise on the week. Nestle, the most active stock added SFr11 to SFr1,153 as Mr Ronald Morrow of Smith Barney Shearson in New York cut his rating on the stock to neural from outperform due to the stock price which had aggressively outperformed the rest of the sector this year. Sandoz rose strongly on Thursday's announcement that turnover rose 4 per cent in the first nine months. Registered shares gained SFr100 to SFr3,400. Among the smaller issues, Surveillance lost SFr83 to SFr1,757 as the company said net profit in the first eight months of the year was slightly below last year's level. MILAN turned higher after a week of reverses as buying was sparked by the first day of Fiat's rights issue, the largest ever on the market. The Comit index rose 6.95 or 1.6 per cent to 577.59, but was still 2.2 per cent lower on the week. Buyers were out in force for Fiat shares and rights, the shares rising L177 to L3,828 in heavy volume of 11.6m. Rinascente added L239 to L9,689. Mediobanca shed L215 to L15,400 amid media reports that the merchant bank might freeze plans to raise new capital because Credito Italiano and BCI, two of its large shareholders, were doubtful about underwriting the call. Montedison fell L10 to L800 after a day's low of L760 following Thursday's announcement of a rights issue. Trading in Ferruzzi was halted when the shares were bid at less than half Thursday's closing price, after the regrouping of 200 old shares for one new. AMSTERDAM was driven higher partly by options trading and strong foreign interest. The CBS Tendency index added 1.4 to 130.8, a week's gain of 2.2 per cent. Unilever maintained its rally which began earlier this week, the stock rising Fl 4.00 to FL 211.90. Commentators noted that buyers coming into the market were looking for laggards and Unilever has been a notable underperformer. STOCKHOLM advanced to a record close on renewed demand for Ericsson stock. The Affarsvarlden general index added 13.10 to 1,381.90, up 2.6 per cent over the week, as Ericsson B's rose SKr8 to SKr470. ISTANBUL recovered some of Thursday's losses and the composite index added 139.3 to 15,194.1. Since last week the index has slipped 1.6 per cent. Turnover was TL1,100bn. Carnegie International's Turkish analysts in London noted that with daily volumes some 50 per cent off September peaks the impression is that the market will not be lured back to higher ground until it has seen whether the privatisation programme will actually start to produce results.

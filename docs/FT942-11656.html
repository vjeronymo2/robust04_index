			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Clarke marks centre ground by backing welfare state Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night threw his weight behind a strong welfare state, arguing that it could complement more flexible labour markets in the effort to reduce unemployment. Delivering the Mais Lecture at the City University Business School, Mr Clarke set out a UK approach towards pursuing full employment that would combine 'the best aspects' of American enterprise and free market efficiency and the European commitment to the welfare state. Unemployment, Mr Clarke said, 'must be the main preoccupation of economic policy makers in the 1990s'. Politicians across Europe had been slow to face rigidities in the labour market, which were 'the fundamental cause of structural unemployment'. A strong welfare state was needed to 'complement, not hinder, more flexible labour markets by reducing fear of change and opposition to it'. Mr Clarke's speech was seen at Westminster as a clear attempt to stake out the Conservative centre ground on the future of the welfare state after a long period when the right of the party has held the initiative. His insistence that the social provision by the state was an essential buttress to efficient markets was in sharp contrast to the rhetoric of Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary. It marked the chancellor's return to the political limelight as a potential Tory leadership contender if Mr John Major were to be overturned. Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Portillo have dominated speculation about the succession in recent weeks. Mr Clarke said the labour market should be left to work as freely as possible. However, government policies should help not only those who cannot work but also ease social problems for the working population. He showed that he was sensitive to people's fears in an age of rapid technological change. 'Families need a sense of security in their personal finances,' he argued. 'No individual will see any advantage in a flexible labour market unless he or she sees how career prospects and life cycle finances can be enhanced by it.' The role of the state should not be confined to welfare provision, he added. 'A whole range of other social policies should alleviate such fears and offer a sense of security in a world where retraining and changes of job are becoming necessary events in most people's working lives.' Arguing that Britain had a 'huge advantage' in its free national health service and free education system, Mr Clarke said he 'would never support any attempt to dismantle them'. However, the chancellor also insisted that market mechanisms were the key to economic success. Wages should be based on the economic performance of the enterprise providing employment and ideas such as a 'going rate' for wage increases and the annual pay round should become things of the past.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 5 Jun (AFP) -- A Haitian was killed  yesterday in a scuffle with Dominican soldiers guarding the  border between the two countries, General Luis Luna Paulino,  chief of operations in the border town of Dajabon, confirmed to  AFP this Sunday.    The general indicated the Haitian died from a bullet wound  in  the thigh when he was struggling with a soldier. This is the  first violent death of a Haitian since the UN Security Council  declared a total embargo against Haiti two weeks ago.    According to Gen. Luna Paulino, the incident occurred when a  soldier tried to stop a group of Haitians who were returning to  their country with a few liters of fuel. "The quickest were  able to escape, but the soldier was able to stop one of them,  with whom he began to struggle. The other Haitians then  returned and in the scuffle to seize the weapon, the weapon was  fired, wounding a Haitian in the thigh," the general said.  "Considering that the weapon was a military weapon, it was too  late when the ambulance arrived, even though first aid was  provided," he added.    Gen. Luna Paulino also confirmed that some soldiers deployed  on the border have been attacked, although he did not specify  how many. "It seems the embargo is very hard for the Haitians  and they now cross the border not only in search of fuel but  also to take anything, a pitcher of water, ice...," he explained.</p>

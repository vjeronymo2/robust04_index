			<p>SUMMARY                                Clearly alarmed by the swiftness with which the IAEA is calling a  Board of Governors meeting, Pyongyang has made a public effort to  explain its differences with the IAEA on resolution of the  nuclear inspection issue, an effort apparently motivated by  concern over the need to salvage high-level talks with Washington  and head off possible UN sanctions.                            END SUMMARY     Pyongyang's latest authoritative pronouncement on the nuclear  inspection issue, which came in an 18 March Atomic Energy General  Department(SEE NOTE) spokesman's press statement, seemed to  carefully avoid foreclosing the possibility of a negotiated  settlement (Pyongyang radio, 18 March).  Although the statement  carried the standard warning against applying pressure on  Pyongyang and charges of Western plans to "crush" the DPRK, its  major complaint seemed to be that the IAEA is convening a Board  of Governors meeting--reportedly for 21 March (Yonhap, 17 March)-  -"even before" analyzing the results of the just concluded  inspections, having "hastily" reached the "unjust" conclusion  that "it cannot guarantee" non-diversion of nuclear materials.     (NOTE: The department was previously known as the Ministry of  Atomic Energy Industry.  Pyongyang media have not been observed  to report on the apparent reorganization.)     The statement, which made it clear that Pyongyang had allowed the  IAEA inspection this time solely to facilitate DPRK-U.S. high-  level talks,(SEE NOTE) noted areas of basic disagreement with the  IAEA.  This disagreement is due, the statement claimed, to the  inspection team's attempts to go beyond the contents of a 15  March bilateral agreement reached in Vienna with the IAEA.  According to Pyongyang:     + The IAEA inspection team unfairly maintained that the  inspections were being conducted under Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) safeguards.  The North Korean statement claimed that  Pyongyang had agreed only to allow inspections "purely" to ensure  continuity of the safeguards, reiterating Pyongyang's contention  that its "special status" of having only "temporarily suspended"  withdrawal from the NPT exempts it from normal safeguards  obligations.     + The IAEA's insistence on 1) extracting samples in sealed-off  areas where the seals remained intact; 2) gamma radiation mapping  at all points, instead of selected points; and 3) examining "the  cooling system,"  went beyond what is needed to merely ensure  continuity of the safeguards.  Such inspections, the statement  maintained, would have made the inspections "equivalent" to  routine and ad hoc inspections required under the safeguards.     (NOTE: Underscoring Pyongyang's eagerness to resume high-level  bilateral talks with Washington, North Korean Ambassador to  Moscow Son Song-pil has reiterated Pyongyang's contention that  the DPRK-U.S. talks, once held, will serve as "an important  occasion" to solve the nuclear issue and will also lead to "easy  resolution" of pending inter-Korean issues (Pyongyang radio, 18  March).)     Charges of "Pressure" Tactics     The statement complained that  the IAEA had sent three messages to Pyongyang during the  inspection, "threatening" to "report to the Board of Governors  that the agency is not in a position to verify non-diversion of  nuclear materials" unless its demands were met.  However, in  warning against such "pressure" tactics, the North Korean  statement said that any attempts at pressuring the DPRK "would  lead to a situation in which we would have no choice but to take  a decisive measure to counter them."  The statement went on to  pledge that Pyongyang will watch to see if the IAEA "intends to  resolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use it for  political aims"--a relatively circumspect formulation that would  appear to allow Pyongyang a certain range of latitude in judging  IAEA action on the inspection issue.     Implications     Although the statement seemed to leave little  room for compromise, it did stop short of an ultimatum, adopting  instead a wait-and-see attitude toward future IAEA action.  These  caveats suggests that Pyongyang is trying to protect the  possibility of engaging in bilateral talks with Washington by  somehow preventing referral of the nuclear issue to the UN  Security Council.

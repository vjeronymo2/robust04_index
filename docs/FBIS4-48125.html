			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The fighting is continuing in the country.  Firmino Lucamba, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel  correspondent in Cuanza Norte Province, reports that  N'dalatando, the provincial capital, was again rocked by violent  clashes this morning. N'dalatando has become a kind of  laboratory in which the destructive power of [word indistinct]  weapons is tested, but the fighting is taking a break at this  stage.    In clashes this morning the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] dropped  internationally forbidden bombs containing phosphine, a toxic  product, in addition to napalm and phosphorus bombs. The  shelling was backed by two PC-7 aircraft, which carried out 13  air raids. Firmino Lucamba reports:    [Begin Lucamba recording] The fighting is continuing in the  center of the city and it is so fierce it can be compared to the  fighting during the Second World War. The MPLA-PT (?threw  everything) [words indistinct] at this stage. What worries the  local military command most is the fact that the MPLA-PT is  underhandedly using internationally forbidden weapons such as  napalm, toxic and phosphorus bombs, as well as (?other types)  yet to be discovered. The use of those weapons has been  affecting the people of N'dalatando at large, and pregnant women  and children in particular. These women and children have been  receiving treatment at the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola, UNITA, hospital. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

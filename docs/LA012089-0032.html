			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 50% PAY RAISE FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Incredibly, The Times has endorsed the 50% pay increase for Congress, federal  judges, and top executive officials (editorial, "Washington Pay Day," Jan. 8).  In its endorsement, The Times calls the increase "sensible and long overdue."  Hogwash! Strangely, the endorsement is silent on the matter of perquisites  (pensions, tax exemptions, allowances, medical benefits, and various other  privileges and amenities).  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and former Sen. William Proxmire maintain that  when the monetary value of these perquisites is added to the current salaries  these positions are adequately compensated. The Times editors should read the  article of Dec. 19 (Part I) which outlines these perks in detail. Let's have a  reconsideration of the endorsement.  </P> <P> WILLIAM USHER  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

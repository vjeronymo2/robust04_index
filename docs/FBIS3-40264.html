			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Post Bank President Elena Petculescu by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "No One  Claims To Not Want Privatization, but No One Says That It Needs  To Happen"]    [Text] [ROMANIA LIBERA] Ms. President, the bank that you  head is a relatively new institution in the financial-banking  picture. I remember that within the framework of your seminar  regarding the history of banking you presented a work entitled  "The Post Bank -- A Young Bank With a Dynamic Evolution." For  our readers, would you, please, review its path since its  creation?    [Petculescu] In fact, the Post Bank is a young bank, one  created by government decree on 1 July 1991. We are a state  institution having received an initial level of social capital  of 450 million lei, of which 226 million lei had been obligated  at that time. Not long after our establishment, the National  Bank set the minimum level of capital at 700 million lei and we,  therefore, also had to increase our capital to 900 million lei,  otherwise it would have been impossible to operate. With these  actions we began, and we have the full amount of capital  required. But, we have problems once again, since the central  bank has once again increased the minimum level of capital to 2  billion lei, and once more we need to find new sources of  capitalization. In order to achieve this, I have gone to our  current owners, the State Property Fund and the Private Property  Fund, so as to give us the opportunity to increase our capital.  I want to mention that last year's dividends were paid in full  to these funds. With regards to our network of banks, we have 41  branches throughout the country, aligned with the  administrative-territorial districting, in each of the judet  capitals. In addition to this, there are 10 offices and the  central headquarters. Beyond our own network, we also work  through the more than 3,000 post offices on the basis of an  agreement reached with the Romanian Postal System.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] I would like, nonetheless, to return to the  issue of capitalization, a problem confronting the majority of  banks operating on state capital. In the wake of the latest news  conference organized by the BNR [Romanian National Bank], an  agreement was mentioned, one signed by the central bank with  EBRD [European Bank of Reconstruction and Development] precisely  for the capitalization of these banks. What is the status of  implementing this agreement?    [Petculescu] To date, nothing has been finalized, with there  being the intention of both the World Bank and EBRD of being  involved in this capitalization process. But, in order to do  this certain conditions were imposed, such as the privatization  of the banks. In this regard, each commercial bank funded by  state capital was given a document, and was even invited to a  discussion with these two organizations on this theme. In  principal, no one is saying that they do not want privatization,  but also no one is stating that this must take place. In my  opinion, those who are our owners must give their opinion. I am  referring to the appropriate moment for privatization, and also  to the conditions for such an action.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is it true that by taking advantage of the  services of the more than 3,000 post offices you have exceeded  the CEC [Savings and Loan Bank] network, which had been  recognized as having the largest number of units in the country?    [Petculescu] I want to be very clear: We were not created to  break the CEC monopoly, as one newspaper noted. We were  established as a full-service bank, and we carry out all the  operations of a commercial bank. Furthermore, we aim at  attracting the people's savings. If the banking services that we  offer and will continue to offer are more attractive, with more  flexible rates, with certain services, then it is normal for  competition to exist.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Would you like to refer to these banking  services?    [Petculescu] We have created certain savings programs. Some  are passbook accounts, with the depositor being able to make a  deposit without selecting a specific period of time, for which  the interest rate is 35 percent. We also have, however, term  savings accounts for periods of three, six, and 12 months, with  rates of 45, 55 and 70 percent, respectively. The advantage of  these accounts, I would say, is not just the fact that our  potential client can make a deposit for a shorter period of time  for which he can get interest, but, first of all, that we have  not required a very large minimum deposit. The minimum deposit  is not 100,000 lei, but rather 5,000 lei. On one hand, if the  depositor goes to his account and withdraws a certain amount of  money, he will receive interest on his passbook account and, on  the other hand, the party has the opportunity to benefit from  credit in the amount of 80 percent of the amount on deposit.  Thus, if he has an account balance of 100,000 lei, he could get  80,000 lei in credit and the cost would be the difference  between the interest rate on the account and the interest rate  of the loan. Ultimately, it would cost him about 10 percent. We  also have a fixed-amount passbook account (25,000 lei) and  interest rate, which is like a type of value book. The depositor  can hold onto it and he will be paid interest or he can purchase  goods instead. But, the most important payment instruments are  the checks that belong to the holder of a personal account. In  this way, we offer the possibility to any citizen to open a  personal account on the basis of which he becomes the holder of  a checking account. With this account, upon acceptance, he can  pay for certain services that are offered. We have already  concluded agreements with 15 commercial agencies, including gas  supply companies, Romtelecom, and telephone service payments,  with the idea of paying with these checks rather than cash.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Can you tell us something about your loan  policy?    [Petculescu] With regards to credit, I would like to tell  you  that in January 1992, through April 1993, we were not in a  position to grant loans to commercial agencies except for a  30-day loan period. For the people, we issued short-, medium-,  and long-term loans. Certainly, this was a safeguard since we  were required to be prudent and not make any mistakes. Despite  all this, our results were very good. Under conditions where we  had to operate with restrictions, the Post Bank profits in the  first year were 500 million lei, while, today, in just 10 months  our profit is 4.4 billion lei. We started to issue loans for a  maximum term of one year and to give them to commercial  agencies. Currently, about 20-25 percent of our loans go to the  people and the remainder are for commercial entities. We have  reached a volume of 22 billion lei for companies and 3.9 billion  for the people. And, in conditions where funding sources have  become very expensive, the loans for the population have become  unprofitable. A recent calculation showed that if we continue to  give loans to the people we will record losses of approximately  55 million lei per month.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] Given that you are a still-developing bank,  what seems to you to be the most important project in the future?    [Petculescu] Right from the beginning we wanted to have an  information system, which, currently, is being implemented, one  requiring us to move through a number of stages. We are in the  first stage, the creation of a prototype facility, after which  we need to connect eight branches (located throughout the  country), then to expand the network of all the branches to the  information branch, which will be located in Bucharest.  Similarly, I would stress the cooperation with the Post Bank in  Holland for introducing the "Gyro" payment system, where cash  payments are replaced with electronic payments.    [ROMANIA LIBERA] As you well know, since the beginning of  this month the National Bank increased the interest rate on  overdraft loans, as well as the level of required minimum  reserves. What do you think the bank was pursuing by these  decisions and what are their effects?    [Petculescu] According to the legal regulations, the  National Bank, as the central bank, is empowered to establish  and direct monetary, hard currency, and loan policy. Through the  measures you mentioned, the National Bank is pursuing the  avoidance of making loans without sufficient reserve funds, the  restriction of loans generated by inflation, and the reduction  of the amount of money in circulation.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR MOVES TO SPEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE TO MEET TOUGH NEW DEADLINES ON APPLICATIONS.  IF THEY DON'T, APPROVAL WILL BE AUTOMATIC.  </P> <P> To encourage construction of affordable housing, Mayor Tom Bradley today will  direct Los Angeles city departments to meet tough new deadlines for expediting  low-income housing projects that now face costly delays of up to one year,  officials said.  </P> <P> Under the plan, applications submitted by affordable housing developers  automatically will be approved if city departments fail to meet strict new  deadlines for reviewing building plans, zoning changes, variances,  environmental impacts or other matters.  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Thursday that Bradley's new policy does not  require City Council approval and takes effect immediately.  </P> <P> "When projects come through the city bureaucracy, those including affordable  housing will be given the quickest treatment," Fabiani said.  </P> <P> Developers have complained for many years that the city's permit process is  hampered by layers of confusing red tape that creates unnecessary delays and  drives up housing construction costs -- which are passed directly on to renters  and home buyers.  </P> <P> City officials say that, in essence, Bradley's directive will allow a developer  to bypass any bureaucrat who cannot meet a given deadline. In such a case, the  project would be forwarded to its next phase of approval.  </P> <P> "We are not just saying to city departments, 'This particular part of the  approval must be done by the deadline,' " said city housing coordinator Michael  Bodaken. "We are saying this must be done by the deadline, or it will be deemed  approved and your department will be out of it."  </P> <P> City officials were quick to point out that they do not expect any departments  to miss deadlines or allow projects to move forward without review.  </P> <P> "This will be a strong incentive to (city departments) to deal with these  projects expeditiously, because no department will want something moving  forward without their input," Fabiani said. "The pressure is practical as well  as psychological."  </P> <P> Fabiani said any project that includes at least 30% affordable housing will be  affected, and estimated that 4,000 such units will be built in the next year.  </P> <P> Bodaken said the new deadlines should trim up to a year off the time required  for city approval of such projects. In the past, he said, affordable housing  developers who applied for building permits were often forced to wait 18 months  to begin construction.  </P> <P> Housing developers said they welcome the policy change.  </P> <P> Arnold Stalk of Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., a nonprofit developer of  housing for the poor, estimated that he spends $30,000 to $50,000 in staff  salaries "just finding out why an average, basic project has run into a snag.  I've been doing this since 1983 and it hasn't gotten any easier."  </P> <P> Loren Bloch, a for-profit developer of affordable apartment complexes, said  developers tie up millions of dollars to hold land and pay pre-development  costs while weathering bureaucratic delays.  </P> <P> "If you didn't have to put that money out months before you actually built the  housing, you'd have it invested and be making 10% on it," Bloch said. "That  loss is what is known as the cost of the money, and the longer the city delays,  the more cost is included in the final price charged to a buyer or renter."  </P> <P> Gerry Hertzberg, an aide to City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, said that although  Molina had not yet seen the mayor's directive, "it sounds like it . . . forces  the bureaucrats to do their jobs."  </P> <P> According to city officials, affordable housing developers are often forced to  wait longer than any other developers for routine permit approvals because they  cannot afford to hire lawyers or lobbyists to expedite their projects.  </P> <P> "Right now, if you stand right on top of your project and put all your efforts  into pushing it through, the truth is it takes about six to eight months to get  it approved," Bodaken said. "But if you do it the regular way, it takes 1 1/2  years."  </P></p>

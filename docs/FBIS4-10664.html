			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alfredo Munoz-Unsain] </F>   [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (AFP) -- The free sale of medicines,  with the sole exception of oral contraceptives, will be banned  in Cuba, according to a drastic plan drafted by the Public  Health Ministry which AFP managed to read.    A document entitled "Plan for the Improvement of the  National  Medicine Program" also indicates that aspirin and six other home  remedies usually found in first aid kits will only be sold by  minimal annual quotas and not in any pharmacy. Each Havana  resident will be entitled to 40 aspirins each year, with  one-quarter of the total to be distributed every three months.  Rural residents will be able to cure fewer migraines, because  they will only be allotted five aspirins per trimester.    An aromatic balsam and another balsam used as an inhalant,  three skin disinfectants, and sodium bicarbonate complete the  seven medicines that may be purchased without prescription, but  only at the pharmacy closest to home. Quotas assigned to each  family are usually minimal: 30 grams of ointments and balsams  and three small bottles of disinfectant for external use each  year. In comparison, the yearly quota for bicarbonate per  family seems to be more generous: 160 grams.    Should they be available at pharmacies, another 64  medicines,  which used to be freely sold, will now be available under  medical prescription, but will be under multiple controls  established by new regulations issued by the Public Health  Ministry. These 64 medicines to be sold only by prescription  involve a visit to a doctor and a visit to the pharmacy later.  The inevitable delay in obtaining some of these medicines (for  example, Kaoenterin, a diarrhea suppressant) will place ill  persons in embarrassing situations. It seems that an equally  deplorable possibility, but the opposite situation, will be  created by the need to buy laxatives and ointments by  prescription to relieve hemorrhoids under prescription.    A similar labyrinth will face those who will undoubtedly  have  to urgently buy lotions to combat head lice and "crab lice"  [pediculos pubis] (pediculosis). Other medicines that must be  sold by prescription are: antacids, antihistamines, febrifuges,  antimycotics [antimicoticos], digestive medicines, vitamins,  hydrogen peroxide, and distilled water for shots.    The Public Health Ministry deemed as obsolete the active  elements [principios activos) of 21 medicines that were  eliminated, including milk of magnesia and lime flowers. It  also added a list of medicines that are available in Cuba such  as garlic syrup, pumpkin emulsion, guava powder, onion creme,  fennel tincture, cress sachets, polen capsules, and various  kinds of phyto-medicines.    It also notes that an oral home serum (water, sugar, salt,  and lemon drops) is also available for dehydration cases.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/4/1994 -- Romania's Chamber  of Deputies adopted a declaration on April 14 on the recent  decision of the Parliament in Chisinau referring to Moldova's  adherence to the Commonwealth of Independent States.    ``Both in 1812 and in 1940, Bessarabia was broken away from  Romania in consequence of understandings of the great powers of  that time, contrary to the will of the Romanian people, that has  never accepted the consequences of these understandings,'' says  the declaration.    ``Developments having taken place starting 1989 have made us  entertain hopes that Bessarabia will be restored to the  homeland. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet of the Union  of Soviet Socialist Republics has declared null and void the  pact between the two great tyrants of this century, Hitler and  Stalin, by which Bessarabia split from Romania in 1940.    ``It is regrettable that the recent vote of the Parliament  in  Chisinau reconfirms the criminal pact and repeals the right of  the Romanian nation to live within the boundaries of its entire  historical and spiritual space.    ``Owing to the geographical position, culture, history and  traditions, the normal place of our brothers on the left bank of  the Prut is, no doubt, with us, in the big family of the  European nations and not as part of Euro-Asian structures.    ``We think that the application of the Republic of Moldova  for admission to the Council of Europe, Moldova's signing among  the first of the Partnership for Peace plan and the development  of its relations with Western countries are significant steps,  they express the Republic of Moldova's wish to be part of the  present general process of European integration.    ``Romania's Chamber of Deputies therefore declares in front  of the whole world that it energetically supports the normal  efforts of the Republic of Moldova to get integrated with the  European structures and condemns the actions of political forces  that are making an attempt to integrate Moldova in the old  structures.    ``The special relations between Romania and the Republic of  Moldova, based on a community in terms of kinship, national  language, culture and history are and will continue to be one of  the main priorities of Romania's foreign policy.    ``Irrespective of situations specific to one moment or  another, Romania, the Romanian people will continue to keep  close to their brothers on the left bank of the Prut, to back  them on a political, diplomatic, material and spiritual plane,  in order to overcome the great problems confronting them.''</p>

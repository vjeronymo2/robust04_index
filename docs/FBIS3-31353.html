On Wednesday Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party, the  Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Greens-Ecological  Social Party, will sign a charter on their proposals and  intentions to link up. The merger congress is to take place in  Bled on 12 March.    A coordinating group of the parties compiled a draft statute  of the new party last Friday. A group for program documents is  to complete its work this week. The so-called coordinating group  of party presidents has already harmonized the majority of views  regarding the forthcoming merger. A meeting of the Liberal  Democratic Party Council is scheduled for next Monday. At that  meeting the highest party authority will adopt a stance on the  proposed statute and pass concrete decisions about future  linkage.    According to the scenario of the merger, all the parties are  to hold their congresses on the morning of 12 March. After  passing a decision to merge into a new party, the congress of  the new party is scheduled to be held in Bled the same day. The  new party does not have a name yet. It has been agreed that  Janez Drnovsek will be its president. The party will have three  or four vice presidents.    As the leaderships of the Democratic Party and the Greens-  Ecological Social Party explained to STA news agency this  morning, the Democrats, the Socialists, the Greens-Ecological  Social Party, and the Slovene Craftsmen-Entrepreneurial Party  will form a new joint party even if they do not find a common  language with the Liberal Democrats.</p>

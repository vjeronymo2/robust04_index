However, the Russian Defense Ministry  knows nothing about this. One thing is known for sure, a group  of NATO representatives really did work in Moscow for two days  and discussed cooperation prospects with the Russian military.  Mutual understanding was reached on many problems. But no  official documents were signed.</p>

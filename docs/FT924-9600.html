			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Domtex returns to black with earnings of CDollars 3.6m DOMINION Textile, North America's international integrated textile group, has returned to profitability after two years of losses and heavy rationalisation. It will keep its big yarn division and is investing CDollars 30m (USDollars 24.1m) to expand non-woven products capacity in the US and in France. No further asset sales are planned, according to Mr Charles Hantho, president. The company operates manufacturing and import-export businesses in Canada, the US, Europe, North Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia. It is North America's leading denim cloth producer. Domtex earned CDollars 3.6m or 7 cents a share in the first quarter to end-September, against a loss of CDollars 12.5m, or 40 cents a share a year earlier. Sales gained 8 per cent to almost CDollars 300m. The board will consider restoring common share dividends later in fiscal 1993, and profit is expected to improve in each successive quarter. Domtex last paid a dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 1991. The yarn group represents 25 per cent of Domtex's North American business, employing 2,000 in Canada and the US. Mr Hantho said Domtex's overall business had turned round and it was no longer necessary to sell the yarn business. It is profitable and faces expanding markets particularly for knitted garments. The company is negotiating payment schedules on CDollars 400m of debt due in 1994-1995.</p>

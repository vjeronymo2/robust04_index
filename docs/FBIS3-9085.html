			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic </F> by 'Ali Maghniyah in Sarajevo; date not given]    [Text] The Muslim Bosnians hope that the equation in Bosnia  will change after the signing of the cease-fire agreement with  the Bosnian Croats last month and starting negotiations on the  establishment of a federal union with the Bosnian Croats  followed by another federal union between the new federation and  Croatia.    The Muslims are also hoping that NATO's threats last month  will be effective. NATO recently threatened to bomb the Serbian  heavy artillery positions if it is not withdrawn to a distance  of 20 kilometers from the besieged Bosnian capital or placed  under the supervision of the UN forces.    Despite what has been said about the agreement between the  Muslims and the Croats being fragile, and that observers believe  that this agreement does not mean the complete end of the  fighting between the two sides, there is great optimism  regarding an extended truce. This truce, if it is destined to  continue, is enough to relieve the pressure on the Muslims in  central Bosnia and give them a chance to concentrate on the  territories occupied by the Serbs. It is also natural for the  Bosnian Army to continue preparing to build a strong military  base to confront any future dangers. That army's preparations  are expected to rely on supplies coming through the center of  Bosnia and Croatia -- as was the case before the war erupted  between the Croatians and the Muslims -- in light of the  cease-fire and the political understanding between the two sides.    Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said he hoped that NATO  will maintain its credibility regarding the warning it issued to  the Bosnian Serbs. He called for lifting the arms embargo on  Bosnia so that it can defend itself. He believes that Britain  is putting pressure on the United States to weaken the  enthusiasm of U.S. President Bill Clinton for the Muslim  Bosnians. Ganic strongly attacked the European Union's mediator  in Bosnia, David Owen. He said: "We do not want to deal with  this arrogant Briton, who becomes more and more arrogant every  time he appears on the international television networks."    In an interview with AL-SAFIR conducted at the presidential  palace in Sarajevo, Ganic said: "We hope that NATO will keep  its credibility. If NATO strikes the Serbs, we will be very  grateful. If it does not, we will remain steadfast and fight  until our territory is liberated. All we ask of the West is to  let us defend ourselves and lift the embargo. Sarajevo is not  the whole of Bosnia. Over 70 percent of our territory needs to  be liberated. Getting back this territory is our duty to our  people."    He added: "Everything the crazy Serbs are doing is being  permitted and accepted because they have not encountered anyone  to deter them. The international organization [UN] is playing  the role of the doctor who is trying to cure the wound  superficially because he does not want to remove the microbe  that causes it. We in Bosnia are telling them to let us do that  for ourselves. We do not want your help, but do not get in our  way and hamper us."    [Maghniyah] Do you believe that the West really wants to  defend the Muslims in Bosnia?    [Ganic] I believe that the West is concerned about  maintaining its credibility and appearing in history as an  honorable party. World public opinion is on our side and  supports our cause. However, nowadays we are living in a fascist  age. Ethnic cleansing is now condoned in the eyes of the  Europeans. If the Serbs insist on altering Bosnia's borders, we  will have a real state of chaos in the whole of Europe.    Russia today supports the Serbs. There is a prevalent  opinion in Europe hoping that the Serbs continue to kill the  Muslim Bosnians so that Europe will have ample justification to  deal with them once and for all with the approval of the  Russians. However, all this will happen at the expense of our  people.    I personally believe that Britain is putting pressure on the  United States to undermine the Clinton Administration's  enthusiasm for backing the Muslims. France was not on our side  but it was not able to oppose striking the Serbs. But Germany  had an honorable and very clear stand in our favor. This is why  I am somewhat optimistic regarding the fate of the Muslims in  Bosnia.    [Maghniyah] It is said that you head the extremist Muslim  current.    [Ganic] I am a nationalist, not an extremist. I am an  educated man who studied in the United States. But today, I  lead my people because they are being killed. I asked the  Muslims to train to fight because the Briton Lord Owen would not  negotiate with us if we had no weapons. When the battles  between the Muslims and Croats started, I asked Lord Owen why he  was negotiating with the latter. He said because they had  weapons. We are defending ourselves and they are accusing us of  extremism.    [Maghniyah] Do you want to establish an Islamic republic in  Bosnia? And are you really Muslims?    [Ganic, after a long silence] This is a cheap question. We  are Europeans and we believe in our religion and respect all  other religions. However, Europe's disregard for us has created  some extremist currents.    The Europeans discovered about two years ago that we are  Muslims. This is why they are not helping us. To confirm this,  some Muslims in some Islamic countries told us that Europe will  annihilate us even if we change our names and identities. These  days, we find some individuals in Bosnia actually becoming  religious because they are afraid of the results of war. But  talk about an Islamic republic is not accurate. Only the  Muslims agree among themselves in Bosnia now; and I believe that  this will cause future economic problems with all those who are  fighting the Muslims. As for extremism, I say: Yes, there are  many hundreds of Muslim fighters who have come from various  parts of the Islamic world to fight alongside us. But I told  them to go back home. I said: You are only a few hundred, no  more. Had you been 50,000, I would have led you into battle in  the name of Islam.    [Maghniyah] Your stance on the Serbs is clear, but it is not  clear on the Croats. Why is that?    [Ganic] No. My stance on the Croats is also clear. We  fight anyone who follows the policies of Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman. But there are some Croats fighting alongside  the Muslims. I tell all the Croats right now: If Bosnia had not  existed, Croatia would have had to create Bosnia to protect  itself. Anyone who stands in our way will be dragged along with  us. We have many options that we have not yet used. We are  keeping them until the appropriate time.    [Maghniyah] What are these methods?    [Ganic] I do not want to talk about them. They are forcing  us into a gangster war. I do not want to add anything more.    [Maghniyah] Who are they?    [Ganic] The extremist Serbs and Croats. If they push us in  this direction, no one will be saved. The war will go on for  many years. Whoever takes land by force will not be able to  keep it.    However, we shall not abandon the principle of negotiations;  and the way to peace is open to whoever wants to follow it.  Lord Owen destroyed the theory of "land for peace," as has  happened in Palestine. We do not want to have any dealings with  this arrogant Briton. But the problem is that we did not  appoint him, therefore we cannot dismiss him. He appears on the  television screens every day, which only makes him more arrogant.    [Maghniyah] Do you still want an outlet on Nayum Sea [name  as published]?    [Ganic] Nayum is Bosnian territory. We cannot accept being  besieged. We want an airport and a port. When I am in an  airplane and we fly over Bosnia, I see the flames of democracy  burning here. Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and will always  be the capital, just as Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine.  War has caused many woes for everyone in the former Yugoslavia.  We want these woes to end. We have no other choice, and we  want an outlet on the sea. If they do not give us this outlet,  we will drown everyone else along with us. I ask the Arab and  Islamic countries to put pressure on the United States, France,  and Britain. There are many ways to boycott Western goods and  freeze Western projects. I thank the Muslims for standing at  our side. I tell the Muslims to be careful. There is a great  deal of discrimination in Europe if you are Muslim. I did not  know this when I was young because I did not grow up like that.  But, this is a sad reality.</p>

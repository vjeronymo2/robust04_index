			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Warning on motor insurance premiums MOTOR insurance premiums could rise because of new EC rules restricting the use of independently produced car components, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday, Richard Lapper writes. If introduced as drafted, the EC Design Protection Directive would ban the use of pattern parts such as bonnets, wings and bumpers, which are usually cheaper than those produced by motor manufacturers. The cost of components used in insurance repairs accounts for about half the Pounds 4bn paid each year in claims. 'We believe the EC proposals are not in the interests of free competition or beneficial to motorists,' said Mr Mike Jones, ABI chief executive.</p>

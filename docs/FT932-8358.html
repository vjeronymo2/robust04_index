			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Newcomer Linx issues profit warning LINX Printing Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink-jet printing equipment, yesterday shocked the market with a profits warning just six months after its listing. The shares fell 36p to 139p, some 9p above the price at which they were placed last October. The warning comes six weeks after a similar statement from Domino Printing Sciences, its larger UK rival. The unexpected difficulties both companies have come up against suggest their products have met greater than expected competition from Videojet, of the US, and Imaje, of France. Linx said pre-tax profit this year would be 'around the same level' as the Pounds 1.64m achieved in the year ended June 30 1992, and lower than it expected at the time of the interim results on March 3. It still intended to recommend a final dividend of 1.73p, giving 2.08p for 1992-93. The market had been expecting profits of about Pounds 2.2m. Shortly after the interim statement, Mr Derek Harris, chairman, sold 300,000 shares at 183p. That was for personal reasons and he retains 500,000 shares. In the interim statement Linx said sales in Europe, including the UK, had risen. There was strong growth in France and Italy and slower progress in Germany and the UK. Yesterday it conceded that sales had suffered 'particularly in the UK and Germany due to tighter market conditions caused by recession. It was reviewing the sales and marketing strategy in Europe. Mr Harris said the company had been expecting to sell significantly more in the second half. As the product carried high gross margins, any reduction in sales had a large impact on the bottom line. 'At the time of the interims we had no idea (about the lower sales)', said Mr Harris. Shares in Domino Printing fell 11p to 508p after its profit warning.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the Danes TOMORROW'S Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty will be the principal focus in foreign exchange and money markets this week, writes James Blitz. In recent days, it has looked increasingly likely that Denmark will vote Yes to the treaty. A Gallup opinion poll which was published on Friday in a leading Danish daily newspaper showed that support for the Yes camp had widened to 50 per cent with 32 per cent of people opposed. This compared to a 49-33 per cent lead published in a Gallup survey the previous day. There are even suggestions that a No vote would not immediately threaten the Danish krone's position in the European exchange rate mechanism's grid. Mr Mads Jacobsen, a vice director at Den Danske Bank, said on Friday that the important factors in Denmark were the country's strong macro-economic fundamentals, the Danish loyalty to the ERM and the fact that implementation of European Monetary Union has become rather hypothetical. However, there are grounds for thinking that, even if the ERM is unaffected by this week's strains, tensions could return at the end of the year if France's fundamental economic performance has not improved. France is unlikely to cut its short-term rates at a more aggressive pace than Germany, because this would put the franc under pressure in the ERM. However, French inflation is lower than Germany's. France's real interest rates are likely to remain comparatively high by the end of the year. Sterling's short-term future should be strongly influenced by a host of economic data this week, of which the most important are probably the April unemployment figures due out on Thursday.</p>

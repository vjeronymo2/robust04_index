			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- On 24 June the  political council of the Constitutional-Democratic Party of  Ukraine circulated a statement on the decrees by the president  of Ukraine "on urgent measures to ensure correct legislation on  trade and to step up the fight against black marketing" and "on  urgent measures to return currency valuables to Ukraine."    The statement refers to the first decree that will lead to  the "ruination of trade which, for some reason, is being  permanently called black marketing." Tremendous powers vested  by this decree in state bodies, including the fire inspectorate,  and the right to determine "the expediency of accommodating  trade facilities" will inevitably lead to the further  development of corruption and trade's transition to the "shadow  [as received]." "The ruination of trade was not the last of the  factors which resulted in an end to the all-Ukrainian market  ceased, and the volume of production has decreased as a result  of this," says the statement. "Abuses in state trade can be done  away with only with large-scale privatization and  demonopolization of state trade and an end to price regulation,"  believe the Constitutional Democrats.    The decree on the return of currency valuables will have  opposite consequences: Currency will forever remain in the  West. In the opinion of the Constitutional Democratic Party,  both decrees are purely populist. They show Leonid Kravchuk as  a person who is ready to harm country's economy for the sake of  winning the election.</p>

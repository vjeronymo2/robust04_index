			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President is a Guest of the </F> Press Club"]    [Text] At a meeting of the press club for market reforms  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk answered reporters'  questions. The reporters asked many questions in both the  political and economic domains, and in a future issue of our  paper we will carry an extended report on the meeting. The  media representatives could not, of course, refrain from asking  questions about the situation in the Crimea. In answering them,  the Ukrainian president stated that from the very beginning he  was in favor of granting the Crimean Republic most extensive  economic powers (incidentally, like the Ukrainian oblasts), but  not a single edict dealing with the economy has been adopted in  the Crimea. He said the power structures there are engaged in  political bustle, adopting decisions on various referendums, the  dismissal of the head of Crimean television and radio, and  moving the clocks forward. However, the Ukrainian president  emphasized, the present budget of the Crimean Republic has been  approved completely in accordance with Crimea's wishes.  Therefore, the Crimean authorities themselves will have to be  answerable for their mistakes before the people. I can move the  clock even now, Kravchuk concluded. However, this will not  improve the economic situation.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Glass disc holds more data - Worth Watching Glass-maker Corning and disc drive specialist Seagate Technology have teamed up to make a computer storage disc of glass, rather than the traditional aluminium. The glass ceramic substrate, coated with the magnetic layer, can store more data while retaining the crispness of the text. This should result in higher capacity disc drives when the MemCor brand products are launched in the autumn. Seagate: US, 408 438 6550; UK, 0628 890366.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RHA GROUP TO JOIN SOVIETS IN COMPUTER DEAL  </P> <P> RHA Group, a small Irvine trading company, has signed an agreement with a  division of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Transport Construction, establishing  a joint venture company that will assemble personal computers in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Soviet venture, Arif, is 50% owned by RHA and 50% by the Soviet  ministry's computer division. The two partners will initially invest $500,000  each.  </P> <P> Paul H. Armstrong, RHA's president, said Arif will buy computer components  "from throughout the world via the RHA Group." Roughly 90% of the  IBM-compatible computers to be assembled by the venture will be sold in the  Soviet market. The rest will be exported to Eastern Europe for payment in hard  currencies, Soviet rubles or through bartered trade agreements, he added.  </P> <P> Andre Lefebvre, an RHA vice president, was named assistant director-general of  the venture. He will be based in Moscow.  </P> <P> Arif plans to hire 30 Soviet workers to assemble the computers at a plant in  the Moscow area, Armstrong said. At the height of production, the company is  expected to turn out about 1,000 computers a month.  </P> <P> RHA will need to apply for export licenses from the U.S. Commerce Department  for the components that will be used in the assembly operation. Some previous  U.S.-Soviet computer deals -- including one announced last year by Phoenix  Group International Inc. of Irvine -- have encountered problems for various  reasons, including bureaucratic delays and difficulties obtaining financing and  licensing approvals.  </P> <P> The licensing problem may be resolved, however, if the 17-nation Coordinating  Committee on Multilateral Export Controls decides to loosen export controls on  low-level computer technology to the Soviet Union when the group meets in Paris  in June. Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export administration at  the Commerce Department, said during a recent visit to Orange County that  exporters of low-level computers should expect some easing of export control  requirements later this year.  </P> <P> Armstrong said RHA plans to establish a subsidiary in Mission Viejo next month  that will support RHA's computer project in the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The body of a woman who appeared to be a foreigner  and was accused of stealing children was found yesterday along  the banks of the Cabus River in Malacatan Municipality, San  Marcos Department. The body showed signs of bruises and machete  wounds. The body of the woman, who was described as being about  40 years old and 1.7 meters tall, was found by passersby who  immediately notified police.    The regional judge and National Police arrived at the scene  and determined that the woman had been murdered several days  earlier. Because the body was already decomposing, they ordered  an immediate burial. Her identity remains unknown.    Police report that an investigation has begun and that four  individuals have confessed to killing the woman, who apparently  was a foreigner. Those arrested were identified as Hector Perez  Vicente, 21; Valentin Santos, 27; Jesus Martin, 20; and Roberto  Perez. They confessed to committing the crime because the woman  was allegedly involved in the theft of children at El Silencio  ranch, San Marcos Department.</p>

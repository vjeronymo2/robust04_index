			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Placer Dome outbids Newmont for big Peruvian gold deposit Placer Dome, of Canada, through its newly-established Peruvian subsidiary, snapped up the option on a Peruvian gold deposit owned by state mining company Mineroperu at auction in Lima yesterday. It is Placer Dome's first Peruvian acquisition. Placer Dome offered a total of USDollars 7.1m over five years for the rights to the 3,500-hectare deposit known as Jehuamarca, in the northern department of Lambayeque. It will also commit Dollars 2.45m to development of the deposit. The Canadian company, which is looking at a number of investment possibilities in Peru, outbid Newmont Mining, of the US, joint owner and operator of the recently-opened and hugely-profitable Yanacocha gold deposit in the department of Cajamarca. Newmont offered Dollars 3m and Anaconda, of Chile, in association with a Peruvian company, Dollars 1.8m. Local representatives of Placer Dome described their offer as a 'blow-out bid'. 'Geologically, it looks very attractive,' said Mr Jose Antonio Olaechea, legal representative. Jehuamarca was discovered in 1970 and has been partially explored with assistance from Japanese mining engineers. Initial tests indicate the ore contains around one gramme of gold per tonne, between 160 and 480 grammes per tonne of silver and up to nine per cent zinc. Placer will have three years to complete further studies before a definitive contract is signed. Next on the Mineroperu sell-off calendar is its modern copper refinery located in the southern port of Ilo. The sale date is February 2 and five potential purchasers have been pre-qualified to bid - Southern Peru Copper Corporation and Cyprus Minerals, both from the US; Mitsui and Marubeni, of Japan; and Britain's Montagu Mining and Finance. The Ilo refinery is up to date and relatively efficient. It presently exists solely to produce 99.99 pure copper cathodes from SPCC's blister under a tolling agreement. This requires SPCC to pay Dollars 300 a tonne, refined, considerably above the international norm, hence the US-owned company's interest in acquiring the refinery for itself. The minimum price for Ilo has been set at Dollars 75m with an additional investment commitment of Dollars 20m over three years.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Walt Disney seeks expansion WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, plans to expand its animated film production following the box office success of Aladdin, its latest feature, which has grossed more than Dollars 212m in North America. The company, which last month reported a Dollars 30.9m quarterly loss on its investment in the Euro Disney theme park near Paris, said it intended to produce two feature-length animated films a year at studios in California and Florida. Mr Max Howard, vice-president of Walt Disney Animation in Florida, said yesterday the decision 'represents a move back into film-making'. Although the company expects to make further losses on Euro Disney in the fourth quarter, Mr Howard denied it was hoping to capitalise on increased box office demand to offset losses at the theme park. 'We're just maximising every part of our business,' he said. 'Expectations at Euro Disney have been too short-term. We've built a city there with a huge infrastructure. The returns will be in the future.' Mr Howard said the films would be funded by revenue from Aladdin - due to be released in Europe later this year - and Beauty and the Beast, which has earned more than Dollars 147m in the US and Pounds 94m (Dollars 140m) in the UK since 1991. Walt Disney, which is seeking artists in Europe because of a shortage of US animators, said new recruits would work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both scheduled for release in 1995. Last year's sterling devaluation had made the UK a more attractive location, Mr Howard said, but the company was more likely to set up a European studio in France.</p>

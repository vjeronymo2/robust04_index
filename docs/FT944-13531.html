			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Tireless Solti fires up LSO - Concert Not everybody is joining in the London Symphony Orchestra's birthday celebrations. Reflecting on last year's bruising battle for cash, the managing director of a rival London orchestra recently observed sourly that only the LSO kept its mouth shut when the time came for the orchestras to stand up for fair play. Out of range of the firing line, the LSO had clearly decided its own interests were best served by keeping its head down. Alone of the London orchestras, it had not been required to present itself as a competitor for funds, in effect judged a winner before battle commenced. The LSO is certainly entering its 90th birthday season in fine fettle. Unlike its London rivals, it is not in debt, has a secure home, and is in a position to plan for its future with confidence. On Tuesday it presented a gala concert to benefit the LSO Millennium Fund (such hubris, when the other London orchestras will be glad to survive as far as the millennium at all]). The event was also part of the 'Great Orchestras of the World' series at the Barbican, which seems rather a cheat when the purpose of the event is to promote visiting foreign orchestras, but perhaps a point was being made there, too. The LSO likes to see itself on a par with the leading orchestras of Europe and the US. Tuesday's concert - an all-Brahms programme under Georg Solti - was not the best evidence to support that claim, but at least the playing was strong and vital. Ironically, the main competition recently in Brahms' First Symphony was at the Proms with the Dresden Staatskapelle under Colin Davis, the LSO's own music director elect, who performed the music with the utmost refinement. In his LSO appearances over the past few years Davis has started to instil some of that well-bred finesse, but Solti clearly prefers the LSO as it used to be. His Brahms was a high-octane drive down the symphonic fast lane, arteries pumping with tension, foot down on the volume control. It is astonishing that Solti in his 80s still has this kind of energy. As the last movement powered towards its conclusion, he was bounding from side to side of the podium, arms jerking violently through the air as though whipping the final chords into place. There was limited scope for the autumnal Brahms to show his face, either here or in the Violin Concerto. Itzhak Perlman's view of the solo part as an outpouring of lyricism, unfailingly sweet in tone and generous with portamentos, really presupposes a different kind of performance. Apparently tireless, Solti ended the evening by throwing in the overture to Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia as an encore. Only a few years and he will be enjoying a 90th birthday season himself.

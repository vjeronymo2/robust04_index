			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Aldrich Ames, a  veteran employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  pleaded guilty today to espionage charges and was sentenced to  life imprisonment.    Ames' wife, Rosario, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of  espionage and tax evasion conspiracy, but her sentencing was  delayed until August 28th, reports said.    In a brief statement released after his sentencing in  Alexandria, Virginia, Ames said "I bitterly regret the  catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife  and son."    Ames, who had been chief to CIA counter-intelligence  center's  Soviet section, said his wife knew of his spying activities  seven- and-a-half years after the beginning of his "criminal  activity."    He said his wife had "pleaded with me to break off the  relationship with the Russians."    Before today's sentencing, the Ames signed an agreement with  the federal government under which both would plead guilty and  thereby avoid a trial.    Although Ames' wife Rosario's sentencing is delayed until  August, reports said she would serve some five years in prison,  after which she would be able to take care of her five-year-old  son, Paul.    Paul is now staying with relatives of Ames' wife in her  native Colombia.    Under the agreement, Ames also agreed to cooperate with the  government in assessing the damage done to the U.S. during his  years spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1985  until 1993.    Prosecutors accused Ames of selling intelligence about CIA  personnel and operations to the Soviets and later the Russians  in return for as much as 2.7 million dollars.</p>

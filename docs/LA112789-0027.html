			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> EARDRUM THEORY PUT IN DOUBT  </P> <P> Fossils recently discovered in east Greenland indicate that the earliest known  land vertebrates may have breathed through their ears, according to  paleontologist Jennifer Clack of Cambridge University. The discovery  contradicts the accepted view that the first land animals with backbones had an  eardrum, a feature that all modern amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals were  thought to have inherited directly.  </P> <P> The new findings were based on a large group of fossils found by a 1987  English-Danish expedition to east Greenland, an area that was once a lush  tropical forest. Clack said the fossils included the largest samples ever found  of Acanthostega, a 360-million-year-old creature about the size and shape of a  modern newt.  </P> <P> Other backboned animals from the same period had an eardrum connected to the  inner ear by a thin rod which scientists thought conducted sound. They also  believed the eardrums were housed in notches on each side of the skull. Clack  said Acanthostega had the same notches but its rods, which were thick and  plate-like, were unsuitable for conducting sound, suggesting that the notches  did not house eardrums but instead supported small openings through which the  animal breathed.  </P> <P> The rods could have been used as pump handles powering the breathing movements,  an arrangement still found today in some primitive fish.  </P></p>

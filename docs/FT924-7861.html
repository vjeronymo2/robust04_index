			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and The European Community (9): Fears over long-term impact - Japanese concern over Maastricht treaty rows THE UNCERTAINTY generated by the rows over the Maastricht treaty have prompted executives at many Japanese-owned companies to be more outspoken than usual over political issues. In Britain in particular, the most popular target for Japanese investment, companies are concerned that the bridge into the rest of the European community may be weakened. Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, said last week that final ratification of the Maastrict treaty would be delayed until after a second Danish referendum next May. Most Japanese-owned companies in Britain, contacted by the Financial Times, believe a division within countries over the Maastricht treaty could damage their businesses in the long term. They said their immediate business plans would not be affected, but that countries should move closer to each other, especially over the single market and single currency. Mr Kazumi Ueda, managing director of County Durham bearings maker NSK, said: 'The UK and other governments are being hasty in pushing it (the Maastricht treaty) through. A rejection would cause confusion for a short time (and) in the long term the treaty should be approved.' Other companies expressed their concerns more cautiously. Toyota, the car maker whose Derbyshire plant starts production next month, said: 'The single market and stability are more important than votes in parliament.' More than two-thirds of production from the new Toyota plant will be exported to the Continent. The company said many people had assumed the fall in the value of sterling after the currency left the Exchange Rate Mechanism would improve profitability. But much of the gain was lost because half the components are to be imported from the Continent. Sony, Britain's biggest manufacturer and exporter of televisions, from its factories in South Wales, said: 'The Maastricht treaty represents the willingness of national authorities to consider Europe as a single entity. We welcome the idea of a single currency to simplify transactions between member-states.' Another large consumer electronics company, which did not want to comment officially, said: 'The UK's economic position continues to deteriorate. It is important for Britain to move at the same pace as the rest of Europe.' Meanwhile, Honda, one of the newer arrivals from Japan, is investing Pounds 370m in its Swindon car plant - 'part of the reason for our growth is that we now have an effective European headquarters (in Britain). But there will be no effect on our business plans either way the vote goes.' Not all Japanese-owned companies were worried at the possibility of disruptions to the progress of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Elfed Lewis, president of North Yorkshire car radiator-manufacturer ND Marston, owned by Nippondenso, is sanguine - 'we have been trading in Europe for more than 10 years and the vote won't affect us very much,' he added. Much of the production is exported to Volkswagen and Volvo among others, and a single currency would nevertheless help, said Mr Lewis.</p>

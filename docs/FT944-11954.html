			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: US hospital group rises on improved margins Columbia/HCA, the US's biggest hospital group, recorded a 14 per cent increase in operating earnings in the three months to the end of September on the back of a jump in out-patient services. The company's operating profit margin improved to 18.6 per cent, from 17.9 per cent a year ago, said Mr David Vandewater, chief operating officer. Columbia/HCA has pulled off a string of multi-billion dollar acquisitions in the past 18 months in an attempt to bolster its market position and strengthen profit margins at a time when healthcare companies across the US are under pressure to reduce their prices. The third-quarter figures reflect a 2 per cent increase in admissions at hospitals which the company had owned a year before, and a 52 per cent increase in out-patient visits. While hospital stays are declining overall in the US, Columbia/HCA has advanced in part by buying new hospitals in the same areas as its existing facilities and then shifting patients between sites to boost admission rates. Operating profits for the period were Dollars 507m, up 14 per cent on a year ago, while total revenues were Dollars 2.7bn, up 9.5 per cent. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 153m, or 44 cents a share, after a Dollars 23m charge for the early retirement of debt. The company reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 56m, or 16 cents a share, in the 1993 period after Dollars 193m of one-off charges. The latest figures include some contribution from Medical Care America, an acquisition of which was completed during September, but do not include HealthTrust, which Columbia/HCA agreed to acquire after the end of the third quarter.</p>

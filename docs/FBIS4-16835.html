			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development  confirms its priorities in the sphere of developing private  property and support for small and medium-size businesses,  President of the Bank Jacques de Larosiere said at a press  conference. He noted that the important sphere is the  development of infrastructure, the effective development of the  energy industry and further growth of expenditure to ensure  nuclear safety.    So far, expenditure in this field have been approved in  Lithuania and Bulgaria. Besides, three accounts in the same  sphere are being formulated in Russia, the president said.    He also said that during meetings in St. Petersburg three  agreements on co-financing had been signed. In particular, the  Japanese Export-Import Bank had granted a credit worth 100  million dollars to the Baltic states.    Among the initiatives the EBRD president noted the proposal  by managers from Finland, Norway and Sweden to set up a venture  fund for northwestern Russia. The fund is designed for  post-privatization support of small enterprises in the region.    According to the president, a German representative  announced  plans to set up a regional venture fund in St. Petersburg, which  would be co-sponsored by the Center of Technical Support of  Germany. The president also noted the agreements signed recently  between Belarus and the EBRD about the reconstruction of the  Moscow-Minsk-Warsaw-Berlin highway.    With the participation of the Russian prime minister the  EBRD  signed on April 17 its first aerospace project. Finally a  project on the creation of a modern office building in St.  Petersburg was signed, which will be the first investment  project of the EBRD in the city.    In conclusion the president of the bank pointed out that the  choice of Russia as the country for holding meetings of the bank  is not a coincidence, because "the Russian Federation is the  main country for our operations."</p>

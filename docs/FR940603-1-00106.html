			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The time for Completion of Construction herein set forth shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including acts of God, fires, floods, direction by the Architect to cease construction during periods when in the judgment of the Architect it is impractical to perform any operation of construction and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible, provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner and provided further, that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes or from any changes in construction which may be made pursuant to Subsection (d) of this Section shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Owner, acting through the Architect and with the approval of the Administrator, if approval of the Administrator is required, may from time to time during the progress of construction make revisions in the Project. If the revision is such as to require an extension in the time of construction, a reasonable extension shall be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such revision. If the cost of the Project to the Bidder to make revision shall be increased or decreased, the contract price shall be amended by an amount equivalent to the reasonable cost thereof by a Construction Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder, and approved by the Administrator, if approval of the Administrator is required; but no claim for additional compensation for any revision will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request therefore to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such revision. The reasonable cost of any increase or decrease in the contract amendment as outlined above, in the absence of any other mutual agreement, shall be computed on the basis of the direct cost of materials, F.O.B. the site of the Project, plus the direct cost of labor necessary to incorporate such materials into the Project (including actual cost of payroll taxes and insurance) plus twenty-five percent (25%) of the direct cost of materials and labor. Labor cost shall be limited to the direct costs for workmen and foremen. Costs for Bidder's main office overhead, job office overhead and superintendence shall not be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2. Supervision: The Bidder will give sufficient supervision to the work, using his best skill and attention. He will carefully study and compare all drawings, specifications and other instructions, and report at once to the architect any error, inconsistency or omission which he may discover. The Bidder will make available during construction a competent superintendent and any necessary assistants, all satisfactory to the architect. The superintendent shall not be changed except with the consent of the Architect unless the superintendent proves to be unsatisfactory to the Bidder and ceases to be his employ. The superintendent shall represent the Bidder in his absence and all directions given to him shall be as binding as if given to the Bidder. When requested, such directions shall be confirmed in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3. Shop Drawings: The Bidder, after reviewing, will submit to the Architect, with such promptness as to cause no delay in the work two copies of all shop or setting drawings and schedules required for the work of the various trades, and the Architect shall pass on them with reasonable promptness, requesting corrections required thereto to be made. The Bidder will make any corrections required and file with the Architect three corrected copies and furnish such other copies as may be needed. The Architect's approval of such drawings or schedules shall not relieve the Bidder of responsibility for deviations from the Plans and Specifications. The Bidder will keep one copy of the contract documents on the site, in good order, available to the Architect. All drawings and specifications will be returned to the Architect upon completion of construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Russia's move in Bosnia It was strangely obliging of the Bosnian Serb airforce to provide Nato with such a clearcut casus belli. Had the Serbs rejected last month's ultimatum, or resumed shelling Sarajevo after the ultimatum expired, Nato would have had to launch air strikes against Serb weapons in order to retain any credibility. But by doing so in the teeth of strong Russian warnings, it would have risked a very serious crisis both on the ground and in the UN Security Council. As it was, both the Serbs and Nato were spared that confrontation by the Russian intervention. That left an ambiguous situation in which no one was quite sure who had won. Now, by a flagrant violation of the no-fly zone, the Serbs have allowed Nato to establish its credibility unambiguously, but also in circumstances of indisputable legality. Last March the Security Council explicitly authorised 'member states . . . acting nationally or through regional organisations or arrangements', to use force against aircraft violating the NFZ. Russia voted in favour of that resolution, and yesterday the Russian foreign ministry supported Nato's action, while awaiting 'clarification' of the aircraft's identity, which the Bosnian Serb command has tried to disclaim. Thus the Serbs appear to have embarked on a strategy of escalation without bothering to secure the support of their Russian protectors. Already involved in a joint onslaught with the Croats on the Moslem enclave of Maglaj, yesterday they also launched an intense heavy artillery attack on the town of Tuzla and its airport, which the UN is hoping to reopen next Monday. In addition, their chief of staff, General Manojlo Milovanovic, said he would use weapons against aid convoys if the UN commander, General Sir Michael Rose, acted on his decision to send them through Serb lines under armed escort without applying for Serb permission. All these actions are clear provocations to both the UN and Nato, particularly the shelling of Tuzla (supposedly one of the UN's 'safe areas') and its airport. Reopening the airport was the object of Nato's last ultimatum but one - though it was inexplicably omitted from the more recent one, the first to set a specific deadline. Nato is unlikely to react with immediate air strikes, but Gen Rose may well call for air support if Gen Milovanovic carries out his threat to attack UN-escorted convoys. The Serbs are probing Nato, but thereby implicitly also testing the limits of Russian support. This may actually be useful to Nato, which needs to know how far it can count on Russia to moderate Serb behaviour. The correct response for Nato at this stage is to hold back from further air strikes unless the provocation is very direct (further violations of the NFZ, or renewed shelling of Sarajevo), while asking Russia to use its influence with the Serbs so that further ultimatums are not necessary.</p>

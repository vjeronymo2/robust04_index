			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Aleksandr </F> Prokhanov; place and date not given: "Zhirinovskiy: `I Will  Drive Into the Kremlin!'"]    [Text] [Prokhanov] Vladimir Volfovich, you are a very  eccentric politician. Your takeoff, which occurred several years  ago, has been noticed and conceptualized seriously by patriotic  circles. Some have sympathized with you, others have called for  caution in relation to you. Following the party's victory at the  December elections you have become a political star, and for  this reason the "Zhirinovskiy in the patriotic movement" problem  has become very pertinent, problem No. 1. I would very much like  to understand a number of your statements and postulates and to  listen to you not as a propagandist formulating a political  cosmogony but as an experienced technologist because the  political role you have chosen for yourself--No. 1 in the  country, president--demands a knowledge of technology. And the  task I have set myself is to listen to Zhirinovskiy primarily as  a political technologist.    You employ, like I myself and my friends, such a category as  the Russian idea. In concise terms, the Russian idea in its  contemporary interpretation amounts approximately to four or  five positions. The first: Russia has to be vast--I refer to the  spatial factor. The second: Russia is a polyethnic empire, and  Russians, as the dominating people, are nonetheless open to  other nations, that is, this is not some mono-ethnic fascist  state. The third: Russia must under any system be a country of  justice, it is embedded in the Russian idea. And the fourth:  Russia is a religious country, a country of mystical search and  a cosmic perception of the world.    It is in these areas that I would like to talk with you. My  first question, therefore, is this. You will agree that this  escheated, cloven, diminished, and mongrel so-called Russian  Federation is in no way Russia as such. Russia is an empire from  Vladivostok, and you would say, to Belgrade even. What do you  think, will this weakened, this castrated Russia once again  assemble its territories? What political techniques do you see  for the reconstitution of these super-expanses?    [Zhirinovskiy] When the USSR was falling apart, I was very  distressed. I thought that this was a tragedy. Now I believe  that this was objective reality. It had to happen. For the real  victory of the Russian idea we had to have the collapse of the  artificial state of the USSR, in which Russians were swallowed  up by the general masses, as in a musical ensemble in which the  Russian violin was no longer audible: there are many other  instruments, and the violin might go unnoticed altogether. We  had to break up in order to tear off from primordial Russia that  which was alien which had attempted to make it nondominant. The  Baltic, Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia tower up, for  example, everyone suddenly pays attention to them, and Russia  and its interests are forgotten, as it were.    We needed this explosion, an explosion without a war, in  order that the skeleton of the Russian state might appear. This  skeleton is associated with historical borders--everyone knows  where the borders of the Russian Empire with living Russian  people ran. The Dniester region, say--there is part of the  skeleton, and there are Russian people. There is Estonia, there  is Kazakhstan or Kushka, Ashkhabad. There are in our party's  administrative machinery several boys from Ashkhabad, Russians.  The mother remarried, the father went to Ukraine with someone  else--and the Russian boy found himself homeless. The mother in  Ashkhabad is abroad, the father in Ukraine is abroad. These are  your new families. And they are everywhere, Russian people. It  is they that show us the skeleton of the future Russian state,  that is, this means the borders, at a minimum, of the USSR. At a  minimum!    Now about techniques. I was speaking about this long since.  You can check this out, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA some time in August  1988, an article against Novodvorskiy and myself. Such people as  Novodvorskiy and Zhirinovskiy, it said, are well known for their  antisocialist views and so forth. And what has Zhirinovskiy gone  so far as to say? Russian needs to be awaken by blood!... I said  this at an Armenian demonstration, near the Armenian Cemetery at  Vagankovo. I said that you Armenians are now the victims of  Sumgait, you have become victims so that the correct processes  in the Transcaucasus might begin. Had Sumgait not happened,  everything would have continued to molder on this way. The  oppression of Armenians in Nagornyy Karabakh and its absorption  by Azerbaijan would have continued, just as they swallowed up  Nakhichevan: It used to be 100 percent Armenians there, now they  constitute 5 percent. Nagornyy Karabakh--the same thing....    Unfortunately, in Russia also, for the Russian nation to be  awaken, it could be awaken by blood. I said this at a time when  October 1993 was not even close. Not because I am blood-thirsty.  It is simply that the national consciousness and understanding  of Russia and Rus have been so enfeebled that the words "Holy  Rus" are perceived as a tale--once upon a time there was Holy  Rus, some Russian folk heroes, the Russian Church....    What the West European world is doing today we did in  1921--the USSR: a commonwealth of countries and peoples, one  language, and a single currency, remaining in principle  different peoples, without borders. They are now doing this  also, but in a somewhat different way. They simply cannot bring  all this to a conclusion. They are afraid of depersonalization,  they are afraid that in a commonwealth they will be "Europeans,"  but will not be, for example, Germans. There would no longer be  marks but ECU's. The language would be half-English,  half-German, half-French. They are afraid of becoming dissolved  and of losing themselves, they are afraid that the influx of  Turks, Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, and others could bring about  the degradation and disappearance of certain European nations.    We have been fortunate in this respect. It is this component  of Russia--its immense space--that enables us once again today  to become a great state. And the Serbs told me: We want to be  together with the Russians, and a new Slav Orthodox state and  new East European community from Vladivostok to Knin--the  southernmost Serbian city on the Adriatic coast--would then  emerge.    Here we are. There are 300-500 million of us in this space,  and we have always lived there. We never came as aggressors, as  barbarians, we did not destroy cultures--we uplifted them. The  Kazakhs lived in tents, the family lived by grazing 20 sheep and  was entirely self-sufficient--in food and woolen clothing. It  lived without lighting, without books, without an alphabet,  without indoor plumbing--without everything. People would sleep  on the felt mat, they would cover themselves with the felt mat.  It was sheep, man and sheep. All production was concentrated in  this, no science, no culture, nothing. We raised up this people  to cosmic heights! Russians, on the other hand, we are pulling  down....    [Prokhanov] And how will you once again build into Russia  these backward outlying areas--via the economy, via their  inferiority complex, their ruin, via their internal conflicts  and strife, via Russian arbitration, via Russian technology, via  the Russian hostages who live there in enormous colonies?... How?    [Zhirinovskiy] You yourself, Aleksandr Andreyevich, have  answered this question, you yourself have said it all. This is  how parties band together. You and I were not together, in one  party, but we think identically. Via the economy and the space  and the Russians living outside of the present Russian  Federation precisely. After all, today, when Russians are  leaving Ashkhabad, the ambulance service is ceasing to operate  because the physicians were Russians. Russians are leaving  Tajikistan, and the airplanes are no longer flying because the  pilots were Russians. When the Russians have left altogether,  everything will fall apart there, unfortunately.    Engineers, economists, production specialists, doctors,  architects, teachers--all were Russian specialists, and the  Bolsheviks artificially made them deputies. The local was the  top man, but it was the deputy, the Russian, who did everything.  The top man merely drank tea: the Turkmen, the Tajik, the Uzbek,  the Kazakh. The Russian deputy has left, and now everything is  caving in.... When we stop the subsidies and sales at low  prices, their economy will collapse in an instant. It is caving  in already. Tajikistan is already asking back in, as are Georgia  and Armenia and Azerbaijan. Even into this weak Russia! And if  within a few years--two-four--we have raised it up, they will  come running to us!    But the military factor is obligatory here because they will  clash with one another. Two worlds will collide in Central Asia:  the Farsi-speaking, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and the  Turkic-speaking, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan. Muslims--two schools  here: Sunni and Shi'a--will clash. In the Transcaucasus  Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis have already  clashed, and Christian Georgians and semi-Christian, semi-Muslim  Abkhaz have clashed in Georgia. They have all collided already,  they are all covered in blood.    Were we to halt supplies and trade with them altogether--the  end. No more of these states! We may be quite at ease here: In  two or three years they would be imploring Russians to return.  And they would come back in on the terms of territories,  provinces, oblasts.    One Russian family returned from Tbilisi a year ago. They  said that slogans had appeared on the walls of houses:  "Russians, don't go, who will bury the Georgians!" This is the  quintessence. When the Georgians have understood that, yes, you  can spit in the Russian's face, you can rape a Russian woman,  you can drive out a Russian family, you can attack Russian  soldiers, but the sole outcome of all this: Who will bury the  Georgians?    [Prokhanov] So reintegration will take place via the tragedy  of these people?    [Zhirinovskiy] Via their ruin! The death of millions of  Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks.    [Prokhanov] Is this, possibly, the inevitable price these  peoples will have to pay to once again be taken into the fold of  the empire?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, precisely.    [Prokhanov] Very well, now the second question. We have said  that Russia, the Russian Empire, is a country open to all  nations. Russian statehood was never ethnic. We built an empire  such that the Russian factor neighbored the Tatar factor, and  the Orthodox factor, the Muslim factor. This empire, rolling out  the carpet, as it were, encompassed a multitude of faiths and  peoples without suppressing them. And now, as I recall from your  statements and books, the statehood we are beginning to build  will contain traditional features--from the states of Kiev and  Muscovy and from tsarism and the empire, that is, formations  open to other nations.    The Russian dominant essentially presupposes the equality of  all nations before the law, before the sovereign, before the  territory, before history. This is how it is. But there is this  paradox. Here is this dreadful destruction that has befallen us,  and the calamities that are to come, that still lie ahead, will  be the most dreadful, perhaps. They will require the maximum  efforts, colossal sacrifices, essentially, for the revival of  our motherland. And these efforts and sacrifices may be made by  that same Russian people.    Speaking of the equality of the nations before history,  therefore, we understand full well that once again incumbent  upon Russians will be the immense mission of the creation of  this new statehood. And this is not some maniacal approach, what  is more, but historical necessity, expediency. We cannot live  without an outlet to the Pacific, we cannot live without  geopolitical passes through the Dzuunhaar Gate, we cannot live  without outlets to the Baltic and the Gulf stream.    Do you realize that in constantly repeating "Russians  first,"  "Russians at the center of policy," "the Russian state for the  Russians" we are thereby saying: Russians, prepare for  sacrifices, Russians, prepare for great building, Russians,  prepare for the utterance of yet one more great Russian song?    The 20th century was essentially the Russian  century--Russians in Africa, Russians in Latin America, Russians  at the poles, in space, on the ocean floor.... And will the 21st  century be a Russian century also?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is here that a new factor, which was not  used by the communists at the final stage, when it was clear  that there would be no communist world, emerges. The democrats  have not made use of it either. We need to make sure that we  Russians are paid for the fact that we have saved the world from  a general catastrophe--a possible World War III--environmental  also. We must show the world that we will not again sacrifice  the Russian people just like that. We must force them to first  pay us for the sacrifices we have borne, for the fact that they  contributed to the destruction of the Russian state. Only on the  basis of this will we move ahead.    And for this we must make use of the remnants of the Russian  Empire and the communist USSR--the powerful military industry,  the powerful weapons, and the heroic spirit of the Russian  people, but without exposing Russian boys' heads to the bullet  or putting our daughters in the beds of all the bordellos of  Europe. Via, precisely, the powerful factor of a revival of  Russian military industry, when the world would be bound to be  in a state of the constant possibility of a terrible war. We  would not start it, but the West must understand that to prevent  this happening it needs to pay today, to repay its debts to the  Russians.    I said to the Germans: Why are you paying the Jews, 6  million  of them perished? You are paying Israel tremendous amounts  annually. They said: Israel means Zionism on a world scale, we  have to do this because we are afraid of the further Zionization  of Germany, but the Russians, they are no threat to us....    This was a mistake--the withdrawal of our army from Germany.  A half million-strong Russian army would be there now also had  it not been withdrawn by Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, who  pocketed enormous sums--for the pullout of our army and the  start of the collapse of East Europe and the collapse of the  USSR. We should be telling the Germans today: First pay us for  the 26 million dead, then at the start of the century, by the  year 2010, possibly, you will reunite with East Germany. But we  gave up everything--and for pennies. Kohl offered to pay  Gorbachev 10 times more, made the offer himself. Gorbachev said:  That's okay. What is this if not treachery?    While we still have possibilities, therefore, and we do, we  need to start to act. And I absolutely do not believe that  Russia might perish, that we will not manage. We will get out,  we are already getting out of the situation. For in terms of  spirituality the Orthodox world is first today. The West has  become completely demoralized. It has nothing left but  McDonalds, pornography, and this brutal rationalism: buy-sell,  how much, if you have money, you are somebody, if not, you are  nobody.    The East has its own specific features. It is far removed  from us. We cannot be Buddhists. Shintoism, Krishnaism,  Hinduism--all this is far removed from us, a different  civilization. Nor does the Muslim faith suit us because for them  we are the infidel. It is an exploit for them to kill us, the  infidel, or to compel us to become Muslims by force. Ours, that  of Orthodox, Slavs, remains the sole spiritual world, therefore.    And we live compactly. Were we to live in Australia, South  Africa, Latin America, we would all perish, there would be no  Russians. But Slavs and Orthodox, we truly live by one territory.    Even today the Poles, knowing that I am prepared to treat  with the Germans for the return of Prussia, are agreeing to  negotiate: They understand that they would lose part of Poland,  that it is better to go over to the Russians and retain Gdansk,  not Danzig, retain Szczecin, not Stettin, Wroclaw, not Breslau.  It is this that we have to compel them to do. And I have done  so! I, no one as yet, have forced them to do it today--prior to  the 12 December elections. They have already taken fright....    The Finnish Army has been arming for two years now because  they have been saying there: If Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the  return of Finland as part of the empire is possible. I do not  want this, but they are afraid. Today they, the Finns, have a  poorer life than we do. When I was there, in 1990, they had  50,000 unemployed, today, 350,000. And the Finnish Army is  consuming several times more. We have forced them by theory  alone, not practice, only theory and a different foreign policy  concept, to change, we have made them poorer and weaker!    The Turkish Army has today halted demobilization. I do not  command the army yet, I am not yet president, but merely having  read my book, they have delayed the mobilization [as published]  of 1 million Turks--the strongest army on this flank of NATO,  trained for an assault on the Caucasus and Central Asia. I am  nobody as yet, but with this spirit and this new ideology we  have forced neighboring countries to change their policy--both  foreign and domestic.    The whole of Serbia carried posters, I am forced to say  this,  and they affirm: "Peter the Great II has come!" They, the Serbs,  compare me with Peter I. I have never compared myself with him,  of course, I am not a fanatic, and I have no plans to be a  chief, to be a great figure. But they, the Serbs, say:  "Vladimir, be the leader of the Slav peoples!" They gave me a  document attesting the creation of a cultural-political center  of Slav states, and they are imploring me to be its president.    So it is that we are winning here even today. But if  tomorrow  I am in the Kremlin, I assure you, just three months, and all  the independent states will have collapsed. Because Kravchuk,  for example, is saying: Let's do it today, while Yeltsin is in  Moscow, tomorrow it will be Zhirinovskiy--that will be it, there  will be no sovereign Ukraine. The Tatars in Kazan are saying the  same thing. They will understand the mere fact of my accession  to power thus: It's all over, there is only the Russian state.    Nazarbayev switched television off when I appeared during  the  elections. Fifteen million inhabitants of Kazakhstan were  deprived of the opportunity to watch Ostankino television merely  because I was speaking! I was still only a candidate for deputy  of the State Duma, and they were already afraid, trembling  nervously, and already packing their bags!    This is a psychological factor. They know there was a great  Russia, the Russian Empire, and that a party has appeared that  is saying plainly: "We will restore the borders of the Russian  state, but peacefully." Hearing a new, tough Russian language,  with a different vocabulary, they are already afraid.    Several persons in Turkmenia, fanatics, have already  sentenced me to death. A mullah in Ufa has been collecting money  to hire an assassin and have me killed. Information has also  been received from Zionist circles in Europe. They met and said:  We have made an accurate computation--the future president in  Russia will be Zhirinovskiy. No one will beat him again, no one.  There is just one thing for it--his physical removal. Only  this....    Others are attempting bribes. Some $100 million are being  offered for me to quit politics. Talk about a factor! I am still  nobody, I am the leader of a faction, which has only 64 deputies  out of 450, not even half the deputies, not even one-third, are  mine, and they are already so afraid that they are prepared to  kill me or pay me off.    But they forget that killing would mean causing a terrible  wave of anti-Semitism throughout Europe. The Jews would be wiped  out completely, they would be burned everywhere--in Germany, in  Serbia, in Russia.... Buying me is impossible--I am not for  sale. Once again, the greatness of the Russian spirit. Were I a  Lutheran, were I, say, a Protestant, a Catholic, they would buy  me. A hundred million--you could live your whole life on the  interest, your whole family, at the best resorts of Europe. I  shall not sell myself, however, even if the entire budget of all  the Zionists is offered. I do not want their money.    I want the homeland, my fatherland. I will stand in a torn  coat, stand on Russian soil, so that the Russian flag fly and  this be our country! It is this that they cannot understand,  that they cannot get....    [Prokhanov] Truly, giant potential is, evidently, bottled up  in our people. They are prevented from showing what they are  capable of, they are continually being beaten down, driven into  the dust, into the earth. So that were this potential to be  revealed, an absolutely new situation, global situation, would  arise, as would that resource with which it would once again be  possible to marshal an empire and throw funds into a  breakthrough into the technotronic era, into a new civilization.    And, as far as I understand it, this entire potential, being  realized, would, truly, force the world to pay its arrears for  World War II and for this immense cordon we have erected along  the Urals and for that essentially mystical energy which Russia  is continually reproducing in the world. Have I understood you  correctly?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. It was for this great breakthrough that  the potential of the great nation, which has been struggling  continuously for a thousand years, was created. We will break  through for the added reason that the Mongols were here for 300  years, because Charles XII was here, there was Napoleon, there  were the German fascists, and 30 wars with Turkey. This is  embedded in the blood of each Slavic, Russian boy raised on this  history. It is all this that will produce an explosion.    When I was in Serbia, I saw combatants of the Serbian Unity  Party--these Orthodox boys in black uniforms. This is it, the  new Orthodox army! These are men condemned to die, they will  sweep aside all in their path. And these are Serbs, a small  people, a small country! And were Russian boys to rise up this  way, with our great science, with our tremendous military  potential, with our missiles, with our Buran, with our tanks and  vertical-takeoff aircraft, with our new weapons! The world would  tremble.    After all, I alone have caused so much clamor, take a look  at  the press for December 1993--they all went mad! I merely amassed  13 percent in the Duma, and the world is already going mad! They  have all already taken fright. They have come to a halt because  they have seen the new Russia. Even if this might well not be in  my person. But they have sensed the beginning of the collapse:  of both socialist Russia and pseudo-democratic Russia, and that  the new Russian state is emerging. This is putting them in all  in a fearful quiver for it is smashing all their plans.    [Prokhanov] All that you say impresses the Russian  imperialist and the Russian nationalist and the Russian patriot.  This is, most likely, correct. Now tell us about the third  postulate of the Russian idea. This is the proposition  concerning justice. Truly, "God is not in strength but in  truth," God is not in a vertical-takeoff aircraft but, in some  relationship of the pilot and copilot, probably, or the sailor,  who puts this craft into the air and brings it in, lacerated,  onto the deck of the carrier.    What do you think, what path will the building of Russian  statehood take? What will it be--tsarism, a monarchy, a  dictatorship, a country of presidents, a country with a chief, a  parliamentary republic, an assembly, a town meeting? After all,  Russia has tremendous experience of state building and a  multitude of options. One collapses, another jumps to the  surface. And embedded in all this is the idea of fraternity, the  idea of mutual assistance--give the last crumb to your loved  one, give the last shirt off your back.    What do you think, will the principle of justice be embedded  in the institution of state power?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am a supporter of the modern form of  government here. I am not a monarchist. I understand that  monarchy and Orthodoxy were the basis of the Russian Empire.  But, nonetheless, I believe that to call the head of state the  Russian tsar, in a polyethnic state, would today be something of  an impediment for us.    Were there a purely Russian state, there would be the town  meeting, the tsar--everything Russian. But considering the  polyethnic composition of the population, it is better to take  the international form in the shape of a presidential republic.  He could be called in Russian chairman of the republic, as with  the Chinese. This would be easier for the world, the word  "empire" is intimidating. It is a good word, Russia needs it,  but it intimidates part of the populace, just like the idea of  communism--also not bad in itself but it intimidated people by  the methods of its implementation.    We should keep the word "republic," we should keep the form  of presidential republic where the head of state has the greater  powers for parliament with us will willy-nilly become  polyethnic, and we will have, like it or not, to decide  questions of the territories there. The nationality issue will  arise. And we provisionally need a strong executive so that we  not deliberate but execute, and swiftly, within the framework of  the law, because certain questions simply cannot be raised  within the framework of parliament.    The treaty with Georgia today, for example. We don't need  it.  The president is wrong, he is making a mistake in concluding a  treaty with Georgia. But this is not what I'm talking about. Had  this issue been discussed in parliament, this would have evoked,  in Georgia, for example, many reasons for not approving it.    Let us look at this event from the other side. Let us  imagine  that the president was someone else, that he was myself.  Shevardnadze calls Yeltsin: Let's conclude a treaty, look at  what's happening, help me, save me, we were, after all, in the  Politburo together. He would not talk to me this way because he  and I were not in the Politburo together. This is what the idea  of a new president consists of! So that Shevardnadze, Aliyev,  Karimov, Nazarbayev cannot bring it up: We are party comrades,  we were in the same Central Committee, help me, as a party  comrade. The "party comrades" business is over!    With me there would be one thing: We are the Russian state.  We will accept you, certainly, as Tiflis Province. Certainly, we  could agree provisionally to you, Eduard Amvrosiyevich, being  governor of this province. But it would be even better were  there a Russian there.... But the way in which this is happening  today--the attempt to reconstitute the amorphous CIS in the form  of the former model of the USSR--we don't need this.    The state, therefore, should be only Russian, only a  republic. God forbid that we have some autonomies, republics  within Russia. Only provinces--40 large provinces. We are now  160 million--4 million in each. If we get back the former  territories, we will be 300 million, that is, this would be  approximately 80 provinces with a purely administrative division.    Forget about national state formations within our state!  This  would then be a modern republic with a strong presidential  regime, a strong parliament, and a strong government. And, in  addition, another judicial system--we need to return to the jury  system, where the best people of the city--about 20  persons--decide, and a highly skilled legal expert formalizes  this decision.    It is Russian statehood that is needed, and it is in this  that this goodness of ours and our attitude toward the peoples,  which we did not destroy, consists. We made mistakes here and  there. Destroying was out of the question, but so was elevating  them artificially, belittling Russians here. Only that which was  surplus should have been given. But under no circumstances the  very last thing. It was this goodness of ours that was excessive.    And here is the drawback of the Mongol invasion. When the  Russian was down to his last shirt and went against the  conqueror with his spear, he could, indeed, share his last  crust. But seven centuries have gone by. We are not the same. We  cannot today undertake the privatization of forests for the  Yakuts so that they might have hunting grounds on private  property. Three Yakuts would have 10,000 square kilometers of  forest, and 9 million-strong Krasnodar Kray, where Russians  live, would have nothing. Privatization would not come off on a  national basis either. We are Russia--one state.    [Prokhanov] You mentioned that Russia and the Slav world  have  a mysterious inexhaustible spiritual energy. As though we derive  this energy from our valleys, expanses, and rivers, from  history, from space, and this is, evidently, as giant a  resource, as much a source of wealth, more even, perhaps, as  uranium, as production itself, as, iron, steel, and the  professional skills of the nation. It is very often asked what  kind of system for Russia you see in the future: communist,  bourgeois, mixed, primitive-communal....    In actual fact, the future will most likely be an absolutely  new civilization, which will not lend itself to such classical  descriptions. And this potential of spirituality--awareness of  God, sensory perception, and use of the colossal elements of  history and the nation--will essentially become the driving  factor of society, the body politic. New ethics, new  environmental consciousness. When the perception of the life of  grass, a rock, or a river, like the life of your own family....    So if we are speaking of this component of religious,  mystical, and scientific cognition, which will become the  principal resource for the future state and which Russia  possesses like no other nation--how will you avail yourself of  this resource in the building of the future body politic?  Primarily, of course, the economy, plants, the organization of  the plants--and how will this be? Will the country be ruled by  an oligarchy or, on the other hand, an equals sign?... How do  you conceptualize this new civilization in your program of  future restoration?    [Zhirinovskiy] The equalizing principle is just is some  places. A person is born and wants to have good clothes, a good  house, good food. But economics requires that gifted people get  more, for all that. Not because he needs black caviar, but it is  simply that he has to see this appreciation of his labor in  order to work harder and do more for others. Remuneration not on  a party basis, it is not the communist who should receive more,  not the mafioso, not the partocrat but the gifted individual, in  any sphere: the gifted cabdriver, the gifted janitor, the gifted  manager, the gifted scientist. We must pay talent in any sphere.  This must be a rule of the evaluation of labor....    I go abroad. Everyone knows and talks about us:  Dostoyevskiy,  Pushkin, Tchaikovsky. Throughout the world, the names of great  Russians are known everywhere. Everyone knows Lenin also,  Stalin--although with the blood and violence there--they know  him, then space--Gagarin.... Russia has influenced the world  consciousness to such an extent that any country will name  someone Russian for you.    About Poles--nothing of the sort. I know Oginski's  polonaise,  I like it, the rest are not known. Or Bulgaria--some people  simply do not know that there is such a country.    We are already putting pressure on the whole world  psychologically, for we have in some respects become engraved on  the consciousness of all of mankind. But for this new Russian  state we must have an additional source of financing in order to  more quickly raise up research and our education. We need to  clear out all the inter-nation higher educational institutions.  No University of Friendship of the Peoples--a Russian national  university! And we must teach our children--Russians, Slavs.    Why are we teaching tribes which are returning to Africa and  destroying one another? They are, after all, still cannibals,  and we are teaching them! Had we ourselves assimilated the  entire potential which the communists threw virtually free of  charge into assistance to the world--Cuba, Nicaragua, Laos,  Vietnam, Africa--we would be a very rich state. We need to stop  helping others. We need to stop temporarily being kind.    Let us be kind to ourselves and think about ourselves a  little. Let us be kinder among ourselves--we are, after all,  Slavs, Russians, Orthodox. Let us get by without helping those  who are living better than us. If we stop feeding people who  today have a hostile attitude toward us, we will win  automatically!    Nationalism has today been imposed artificially. Were we to  halt supplies of Russian timber to Central Asia, all their  construction projects would come to a halt. They would be left  roofless, without homes. They should know: We would not perish  without Uzbek cotton, Egyptian cotton is of better quality, and  the Egyptians still owe us for the Aswan Dam. We would obtain  cotton from Iraq, Iraq owes us too. But Uzbeks without Russian  timber--that would be it, the end. The end for all of Central  Asia--Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan. The Transcaucasus  particularly--they have all been living on subsidies.    Within the next 10 years the new Russian state will be a  leading light. Delegations of dying nations, worn out and bled  white by a lengthy war, epidemic disease, and gangster raids,  will be applying to join us--standing in line to get into the  Kremlin, to see another president. They will beseech the  president of Russia to incorporate them as a territorial unit  within Russia.    We can do all this only thanks to the existing Russian  industry, science, and culture. We need only a different form of  government. To free ourselves from the vestiges of the communist  past and this entire fraudulent democracy and to return to the  best that had been accumulated in the Russian Empire, to some of  the positive aspects in the communist USSR, to some positive  endeavors at this time. We have some pluralism, for all that.    Despite all these bloody events, Russia is still without  civil war. There is somewhat of this in the North Caucasus and  in the Transcaucasus, but it is not taking place on the  territory of Russia. We have been able to negotiate this tight  spot.    Even today more than half the Russian Parliament practically  is composed of the new, patriotic Russia. Five of the eight  traitor-ministers have already left the government, just three  remain. I will name them: Kozyrev, Chubays, Shokhin. Just three  out of 23! And there are a further 56 committees, that is, out  of the almost 80 members of the government, just three  traitor-ministers. This is negligible! And the most repulsive  faction of deputies consists of just 76 persons. Out of 450!  Were they to unite, there would be 150 of them, but no more. And  300 are different deputies. We have already won!    And the Russian Army is already restoring its might, our new  MiG's are the fastest fighters, and no one has surpassed our  Buran. In half an hour it can deliver a 60-tonne payload to any  part of the planet. The Americans do not have anything like  this. We have the necessary power today even. We need only a  conclusive change of political leadership.    We will restore what we had and will develop further. Our  scientists will return, our daughters will return, our boys will  return from all the "flash points," families will be restored,  and our economic potential will begin to work.    The Serbs are saying: We will clothe you and feed you, give  us your raw material. Our chemical plants are at a standstill,  you used to supply us with phosphates, let us have them today.  India is saying: Let us have 100 submarines, and we will clothe  you and feed you. Saddam Husayn said to me: I don't understand  you, I owe you $10 billion--take it. Why don't you take it?    Were we to revise our foreign and domestic policy a little  and take what we are being given, being implored to take, this  in itself would have an enormous effect. But we need to quit the  blockade of Iraq and the blockade of Yugoslavia and to restore  normal relations with India, China, Japan. And we would resolve  all our problems! Two or three years, and Russia would be  unrecognizable. But for this one last step is needed--elections  to the Russian Parliament once more, elections for the president  of Russia once more. That's all!    [Prokhanov] I am most grateful to you for the interview. I  have deliberately not commented on what you have said, merely  asked you questions. And you have stated your ideas frankly and  with absolute candor. I believe that what you have to say will  be of interest to the readers of my newspaper and to patriotic  intellectuals, who are concentrated around the newspaper, in  general. I repeat: I have no desire to comment on it, to dress  it up. Here is Zhirinovskiy extempore, in this interview....    But the final, very brief, question. When do you plan the  breakthrough into the Kremlin? What difficulties do you expect  on this path and when do you intend to concentrate your entire  willpower and your entire party machinery and potential for this  surge? A push not to the South but to the Cathedral of the  Assumption....    [Zhirinovskiy] We will officially begin our campaign on 2  April--the party's fifth congress. We will begin a furious  campaign for elections both for a new parliament and for the  president of Russia. Some fall of 1994 option is entirely  possible, I believe....    [Prokhanov] Your intuition tells you this, as a political  improvisation?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, yes, this is possible. The fall could  once again bring surprises. When we put on one more spurt and  the Kremlin is finally purged of anti-Russian forces.</p>

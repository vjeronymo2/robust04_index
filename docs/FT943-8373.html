			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba looks forward to output boost Cuba is expecting coffee production of 23,000 tonnes this year, the same as in 1993, but is looking forward to a significant increase over the next few years following the establishment of new farms, mainly in the island's more mountainous regions. This year's exports are expected to be around 12,000 tonnes, also about the same as last year's, according to one of the country's official information agencies, with the main market continuing to be Japan. Cuba also sells to Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The planned expansion of coffee production is part of a programme to broaden the base of Cuban agriculture, following last year's dramatic fall in the production of sugar, the main pillar of the island's economy. Officials report increasing demand for Cuban coffee from foreign buyers seeking new sources because of the anticipated tight situation in the international market.</p>

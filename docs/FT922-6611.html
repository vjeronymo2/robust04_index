			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Council cash delay confirmed A DELAY in the usual arrangements for announcing next year's council spending was confirmed yesterday by Mr John Redwood, local government minister. Ministers usually give in July the overall figures for local authority spending. Mr Redwood said, however, that the move to the council tax and the change in local authorities' responsibility for community care were special factors that made it sensible to postpone the announcement until the autumn, when the detailed arrangements will also be published. Normally, the overall figures are used in discussions during the summer between local authority associations and environment department officials. The delay will reinforce fears that the arrangements for the first year of council tax will be made at the last minute. Mr Redwood said the scale of a transitional relief scheme for the move to council tax could not be properly assessed until the valuation exercise had been completed, and that the necessary information would not be available in July. The postponement has been seen by Labour MPs as a sign that local government will face a particularly tough settlement in this year's public spending round.</p>

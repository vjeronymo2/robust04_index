			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Defence spending trims Man Utd profits SPENDING ON two players reduced pre-tax profit at Manchester United by 19 per cent, from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 3.17m, in the six months to January 31 1992. Before the Pounds 2.23m net outlay on Paul Parker (defender) and Peter Schmeichel (goalkeeper), the football club - which floated last May - increased profit by 39 per cent to Pounds 5.41m. Transfer spending in the first half of last year was negligible. The club, which heads the first division, had Pounds 12.8m cash in hand on January 31. Only half of this was raised via last May's flotation. Turnover increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 10.4m) as prices were raised and the average attendance at each league match moved up to 44,840 (43,242). Gate receipts accounted for 53 per cent of sales. Next most important were Pounds 1.76m of television fees and Pounds 1.64m in sponsorship and royalties. Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said that Pounds 522,000 was taken on average at each home game, compared with Pounds 382,000 last season. The estimated cost of building a new stand at the Old Trafford ground had been cut from Pounds 12m to Pounds 10.5m through reducing the executive and VIP accommodation. It is due to open next June. Mr Launders said that although capacity would fall to 34,000 at the start of next season, price rises of about 30 per cent would more than compensate for the loss of volume. Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, said that most of the games and television appearances had fallen in the first half of the year. The club had no immediate plans to buy players. To smooth out the impact of transfers on earnings, the club has set up a reserve fund. After taking Pounds 750,000 from this, earnings per share fell to 24p (28.6p). Before this movement, earnings were 17.9p. The interim dividend is 6p and the board intends to pay a total of at least 17.4p.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Parties optimistic about national poll 'rehearsal' - Local Council Elections THE GOVERNMENT yesterday marked the closing stages of the local elections campaign with a confident claim that the outcome would underline that it is on course for a fourth general election victory - but not quite yet. On a day when all of the main contenders in tomorrow's poll announced advance plans to celebrate their success, Mr Chris Patten delivered an ebullient assessment of the Conservatives' recent recovery in the opinion polls. In a series of characteristically eliptical statements he did nothing to dispel the impression that Mr John Major, the prime minister, will wait at least until the Autumn for a general election. Although the Conservatives' appear to have a fractional lead in the opinion polls, it is fighting tomorrow's elections from the much higher base it achieved in 1987, when it was a full 10 points ahead. So this year, Mr Patten can expect substantial losses in terms of council seats. The lengthening odds against a June poll - the view at Conservative Central Office is that the 6 to 1 against offered by the bookmakers is a fair assessment - did nothing to diminish the energy of Labour's campaigning. Flanked by senior members of the shadow cabinet, Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaigns manager, indicated that Labour remained determined to keep national attention focused on its chosen electoral battlegrounds. The Labour team, which has treated the local elections as a dress-rehearsal for a general election, produced a sheaf of new figures to reinforce its attack on the government's handling of the economy. Mr Tony Blair, the employment spokesman, claimed the recent rise in unemployment was hitting Tory voters as hard as Labour, while Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow industry spokesman, offered scores of statistics to illustrate the decline in Britain's manufacturing base. Mr Blair said that the rising jobless total - now presented by Labour as a symbol of the government's wider mismanagement of the economy - demonstrated that Mr Major had produced a 'classless' recession. White-collar employees were as badly hit as blue-collar workers, the south as much as the north. Labour's stance on strictly local issues was helped by another apparent volte-face by the government on the details of its new council tax. Whitehall officials said last week that the Government was considering increasing the number of property bands from 7 to 9. Yesterday, however, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, ruled out categorically any such switch. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, offered the prediction that his party would do much better than its opinion poll standing suggests. He argued - correctly - that its performance in recent local elections had consistently confounded the pundits.</p>

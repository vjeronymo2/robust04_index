			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill pleases City with rise to Pounds 13m STEEL BURRILL Jones, the insurance and reinsurance broker, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m and maintained a total dividend of 13.25p. The news prompted a positive response from investors and the shares rose 10p to close at 261p, even though earnings declined to 18.11p, from a restated 20.66p for 1991. The final dividend is 9p. In line with FRS 3 some Pounds 1.15m in net profits from the sale of the group's investments in two associates was been included in pre-tax profits. Operating profits, however, fell to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 3.6m). Investment income increased by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 7.83m and associates contributed Pounds 911,000 (Pounds 115,000) to pre-tax profits. Mr George Boden, chief executive, said he expected falling interest rates and tough trading conditions to constrain growth in 1993. 'Growth of total group income is likely to be modest . . . and the group's results will inevitably be affected if short term interest rates continue at current low levels,' he warned. The group, however, will continue to control its expense base. In 1992 expenses increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 37.4m) - against growth in turnover of 15.27 per cent to Pounds 47.3m. But expenses were down at an underlying rate of 8 per cent, with the group's headcount falling from 880 to 830. A poor performance by SBJ Regis Low, the offshore energy broker acquired for Pounds 35m in January 1992, was the biggest blot on the performance. SBJ Regis Low lost an important account insuring US construction liabilities - worth some Pounds 2m in commission income - in April, and was subsequently hit by reduced demand for offshore insurance. Despite a cut back in expenses pre-tax profits were only just over half of their pre-acquisition level of about Pounds 5m. Mr Allan Nicholls, analyst with James Capel, said the market was relieved that Regis Low's had not produced worse results, and that this has contributed to yesterday's positive reaction. 'The figures are not out of line with what was expected but Regis Low has shown a capacity to disappoint.'</p>

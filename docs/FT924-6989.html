			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Plan extends life of Yeoman Inv Trust YEOMAN Investment Trust has produced new restructuring proposals following an earlier plan which was abandoned in August. The split capital trust is due to be wound up next month but the new plan, devised by brokers Greig Middleton, will extend its life for a further six years. The previous proposals had involved a seven year extension. Yeoman's original plan was blocked by the reluctance of Orion Insurance, a principal income shareholder, to support the proposals. Orion's stake - 24 per cent of the income shares - was bought by Abbey Life. Abbey Life will also be the new manager of the trust when the present manager, Mr Rodney Pellatt, retires next year. Mr George Yoxall, managing director of Abbey Life Investment Services, said there were no discussions of the management contract before Abbey bought the stake, which was originally acquired for its attractive redemption yield. Abbey's management fee will be 0.3 per cent of total assets per annum, no higher than the previous charge. The new plan is designed to meet some of the objections to the previous scheme. In particular, income shareholders will be offered a cash exit at 100p, an option unavailable in the earlier plan. If shareholders opt to hold on to their income shares the new redemption value - in December 1998 - will be 50p. Three institutions, holding some 71 per cent of the income shares, have approved the scheme in principle. Capital shareholders are being offered zero dividend preference shares on a 1-for-1 basis. Conversion will be based on mid-market asset value. Greig Middleton has undertaken to find standby purchasers of the zeros, effectively giving capital shareholders a cash exit. In addition, Greig Middleton is seeking sub-underwriters to buy capital shares from those holders who are unwilling to convert into zeros. The zeros will offer an annualised redemption yield of 9.3 per cent between issue and maturity in 1998. An extraordinary meeting will be held on December 21 to approve the proposals.</p>

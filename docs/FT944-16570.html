			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Moscow's star wanes with rouble: John Lloyd measures reaction in Vladivostock to the currency's collapse The dollar was selling at 4,000 roubles in Vladivostock's banks yesterday and it cost Rbs4,300 to buy. At one point, it had a street price of 7,000, as rumours spread that Dialog Bank in Moscow had pushed the rate down to over 6,000, but there were few takers. Russia's Far Eastern port, semi-detached from a capital eight time zones away across the Siberian tundra, reacts more nervously even than Moscow to falls in the currency. Its surface glitter is buoyed by trade  - over 80 per cent of the cars are secondhand Japanese imports and the dowdy shops offer a profusion of Japanese, South Korean, Australian and US goods. Mr Sergei Frank, vice president of the 160-vessel, Far East Shipping Company  -the star stock on Vladivostock's active little stock exchange - says: 'It's good and bad. Good because we are paid largely in dollars and our costs are largely in roubles, so we have just had a 30 per cent cut in our cost structure. But bad because it will hit imports and thus our trade: and it means continuing instability. We had forecast the rate of Rbs3,000-3,500 to the dollar by the end of the year, based on the ministry of the economy forecasts. We pay Rbs6bn a year in taxes for this for the politicians in Moscow not doing their job.' Other comments reflected this ambiguous reaction. Mr Andrei Malyutin, deputy head of the stock exchange, said: 'This will be good for the exchange, especially for foreign investors. It will mean stocks here are even cheaper.' Mr Andrew Fox, a Briton whose Pacific Gemini company is the sole foreign company allowed to trade on Vladivostock's developing market, said: 'A New York investor described the Russian market now as a 'lolly grab'. This just increases the size of the lolly grab.' However, Mr Nikolai Pimenov, the first deputy governor of the region responsible for its economy - and thus for the economic well-being of the more than three million citizens - was more gloomy. 'It's just awful. All imports will cost 30 per cent more and our standard of living depends so much on imports because people don't buy Russian goods. A secondhand Japanese car is a third the price of a Russian Lada and there's no comparison in quality. Besides this must mean a rise in inflation.' The Far Eastern region has been flirting with thoughts of becoming an autonomous republic and, though serious opinion discounts the possibility, Moscow's failure to hold the currency played into the grievances of a peripheral nation which is testing its commercial strength.</p>

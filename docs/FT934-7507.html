			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Calling on stronger phone signals - Worth Watching One of the big drawbacks of cordless telephones can be poor sound quality, which is hard to eliminate because the telephone is usually tuned to a specific channel. But the latest Southwestern Bell cordless telephone, sold by Audioline, can tune in to one of eight channels, choosing the one with the clearest signal. The eight-channel selector on the IQ FF800 automatically memorises the three strongest channels. Then if the signal suffers, the caller can select the second-best channel, then the third. The caller is even able to change channels during a call. Audioline: 0527 584584.</p>

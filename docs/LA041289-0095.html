			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WALTON, GRACE HIT HOME RUNS; CUBS WIN 4TH STRAIGHT  </P> <P> Jerome Walton and Mark Grace both have something to prove. Each made his point  Tuesday as the Chicago Cubs won their fourth straight game with a 5-4 victory  over the St. Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> Walton, a rookie who earned the center field job in spring training, hit safely  in his seventh straight game, homered and scored three runs, including the  tie-breaker in the eighth inning. Grace, who joined the Cubs last season, hit  his first homer in Wrigley Field and drove in three runs, including the  game-winner.  </P> <P> "I've got something to prove," said Walton, who's trying to make the jump from  the double-A Eastern League. "Everybody said the Cubs were rushing me. All I'm  trying to do is prove I can play in the big leagues."  </P> <P> "He's been outstanding," Cubs Manager Don Zimmer said. "he has played seven  games as good as you can play."  </P> <P> Walton and Mitch Webster drew walks off losing pitcher Jose DeLeon, 1-1, to  open the eighth. DeLeon was relieved by Todd Worrell and Walton and Webster  pulled off a double steal.  </P> <P> Ryne Sandberg fouled out and Andre Dawson was walked intentionally to fill the  bases. Ken Dayley, a left-hander, came in to pitch to the left-handed-hitting  Grace -- with Worrell moved to right field.  </P> <P> Grace grounded into a force play at second as Walton scored the tie-breaking  run.  </P> <P> "Almost worked," said Herzog, who was looking for a double play. "Grace just  didn't hit the ball hard enough."  </P> <P> Herzog said he's switched a pitcher to the outfield "seven or eight times in  the past." Zimmer said he wasn't surprised by the switch and had done the same  thing.  </P> <P> "That move has been going on as long as there's been baseball," said Zimmer.  </P> <P> Grace hit seven home runs as a rookie last year -- all on the road.  </P> <P> "I wasn't worried about it," said Grace of his lack of power at Wrigley Field  last season. "I knew it would happen eventually. The law of averages you know."  </P> <P> Grace's homer, which gave the Cubs a 4-3 lead, came on a 3-0 pitch with two  outs in the sixth after Dawson had singled.  </P> <P> "It's nice to know Zimmer has confidence in me," said Grace.  </P> <P> Calvin Schiraldi, 1-0, was the winner and Mitch Williams picked up his third  save.  </P> <P> The Cardinals tied it 4-4 with a run in the seventh. Terry Pendleton led off  with a single, chasing starter Greg Maddux, and Schiraldi walked Brunansky.  Milt Thompson drove in the run with a single.  </P> <P> Walton led off the Cubs first with his second homer, extending his hitting  streak to seven games. He is hitting .357.  </P> <P> The Cardinals went ahead 2-1 in the third when Vince Coleman singled and Pedro  Guerrero hit his third homer, a 400-foot-plus drive that cleared the wall in  left-center and landed on Waveland Ave.  </P> <P> The Cubs tied it in the bottom of the third. Walton beat out a bunt single,  went to third on DeLeon's throwing error and scored on a bunt single by  Webster.  </P> <P> The Cardinals regained the lead in the sixth on successive singles by Thompson,  Jose Oquendo and Tony Pena.  </P> <P> Maddux struck out six but gave up 11 hits before he left in the seventh.  </P></p>

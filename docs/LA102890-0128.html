			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> THE 5-MILLION-YEAR-OLD DESK  </P> <P> CHUNKS OF the planet's oldest rock are given contemporary incarnations when  stoneArt Designs transforms 5-million-year-old granite into strikingly unusual  furniture. The company's four-piece desk, for example, would complement any  office interior that draws heavily on natural materials.  </P> <P> The lean, angular design communicates a no-nonsense message about the person  who sits behind it.  </P> <P> The gray model (pictured, about $9,000) is just one of the color options; each  desk claims the individual signature of its earthly component with a variety of  colors (grays, brown, black, red or pink), veining and mineral intrusion,  limited only by nature's imagination. It's composed of a writing surface  resting atop two bases -- one triangular, the other L-shaped -- and comes with  a separate mobile workstation that fits beneath it (the piece also can stand  alone as a computer table or shelving unit).  </P> <P> The desk is not the only stoneArt design; the firm produces unusual granite  furniture for many purposes. All pieces are polished to a maintenance-free  finish, and granite, the hardest of the igneous rocks, never fades or discolors  and seldom suffers chips or scratches. Like sculpture, each desk is cut from a  solid piece of stone. Because each piece is as individual as a thumbprint, the  furniture is signed, dated and numbered by the worker who crafted it by hand in  Melbourne, Australia.  </P> <P> Figuratively speaking, stoneArt creations are not set in stone. So if you fancy  the idea but not the particular execution, the company is equipped and willing  to accommodate custom designs.  </P> <P>  stoneArt Designs are available at Uniquely Australian, Pacific Design Center,  8687 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 854-6100.

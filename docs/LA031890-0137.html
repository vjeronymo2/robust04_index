			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WEEK IN REVIEW: NEWBURY PARK;  </P> <P> SLAIN YOUTH'S FATHER FACES TRIAL IN THREAT  </P> <P> A Newbury Park man has been ordered by a Municipal Court judge to stand trial  for allegedly threatening to murder a Ventura County deputy district attorney.  </P> <P> Charles Flores, 48, believed that Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes botched  cases against three men charged with beating to death his 19-year-old son at a  party in January, 1989, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes, supervisor in charge of the major crimes  and narcotics division, testified in a preliminary hearing last week that  Flores' threats took place during two telephone calls on Feb. 6.  </P> <P> During the first conversation, Janes testified, Flores said: "I'm at my wit's  end. I've had enough of you people. I'm coming after you."  </P> <P> Janes testified that Flores then told him that the evening before he had taken  his gun to a parking lot and waited for Holmes to come out of a building.  </P> <P> "He sounded dead serious," Janes said. "I was very concerned. I believed he  might try to murder Mr. Holmes."  </P> <P> During the preliminary hearing, a 15-minute tape-recording was played of the  second telephone conversation, in which Flores said he intended to seek  retribution against the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "I don't care how long it takes. I'm going to put you down," Flores told Janes,  according to the tape. "If it's through politics, the media, I don't care if I  have to hire someone to blow the building to Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Thomas Hutchins ordered Flores to stand trial in two weeks on a  felony count of threatening great bodily injury or death and a misdemeanor  count of making a telephone call with the intent to annoy or threaten or  inflict injury.  </P> <P> The felony count is punishable by a year in jail or a state prison term of 16  months to three years. The misdemeanor is punishable with a maximum of one year  in jail.  </P> <P> John Flores, 19, was killed on Jan. 20, 1989, after he arrived uninvited at a  party in Newbury Park. He was asked to leave three times but refused,  authorities said. A witness said another party-goer grabbed Flores by the hair  and slammed his head against the pavement. Flores died that night as a result  of brain injuries.  </P> <P> It was determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one man. A  jury acquitted another man of manslaughter charges. And another man was  convicted of aggravated assault, spent 90 days in the Ventura County Jail and  received five years' probation.  </P></p>

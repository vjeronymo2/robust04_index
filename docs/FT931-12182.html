			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): A time to lean on the dollar - The Professionals / Changes reflect damage limitation and the search for pockets of growth RECESSION IN Germany. Recession in Japan. Equities in the US and the UK at demanding levels, fully discounting fragile recoveries. In this bleak investment setting at the start of 1993, our professionals have chosen to lean hard on the one apparent certainty - a strengthening dollar. Other changes, as we move into the first quarter of 1993, smack of damage limitation - as in the divestment by both Baillie Gifford and Newton of their small Japanese equity stakes - or increasingly fastidious targetting of possible pockets of growth in the otherwise faltering march of equity markets in Europe or the US. The one positive exception is continuing enthusiasm for the smaller markets of the Pacific Rim, though views differ on prospects in Hong Kong, where Chinese threats against plans to develop local democracy have brought turbulence to the market. One must also ask how large a proportion of any portfolio can be put into Asian markets that account for a tiny share of total world stock market capitalisation. Baillie Gifford are immensely overweight, with 25 per cent of the portfolio's assets now in these markets following the latest 5 per cent boost. Gartmore are not far behind at 17.5 per cent. There has been a slight shift in attitudes towards bonds, which have over the past year strongly outperformed equities. Paul Myners has switched some of his large US bond holding into US equities, on a view that comparative performances are poised to change; while Howard Beaufort has added a 5 per cent US bond holding as a means of capturing dollar strength. There has also been a strong move in Europe away from sterling or Deutsche Mark bonds into France. Douglas McDougall's (Baillie Gifford) only change at the turn of the year has been to sell his remaining Japanese equity stake, using the funds to boost holdings elsewhere in Asia. Given comparative performances in 1992, he probably wishes, in retrospect, that he had shifted from Japan to South-east Asia much earlier. He remains bullish about Hong Kong, confident that 'commercial realism will prevail'. In the UK, he says recent strength 'has taken the market to the top end of a range of reasonable value'. He also sees US equities as expensive: 'The most attractive feature in the US is the dollar, which can be played with more confidence through the bond market.' He sees Europe's markets being held hostage to the D-Mark, and, with the German economy still likely to decline through 1993, is concentrating his holdings in France. Paul Myners (Gartmore) goes further than Mr McDougall, saying that the economies of continental Europe look 'more and more like an economic disaster'. His exposure remains limited to bonds. His only change is to double his US equity stake to 10 per cent by transferring funds from his substantial US bond portfolio, driven by a singular confidence that the US economy is set to grow strongly. 'We seem to be in something of a golden scenario for US long-term assets . . . The question is the relative preference for equities and bonds, which is finely balanced, but probably in favour of equities at this point,' he says. He remains enthusiastic about Asia, but prefers to avoid Hong Kong for the time being, and is 'more pessimistic than the consensus' about Japan. He is encouraged by economic prospects in the UK, predicting that 'for the first time in four years the earnings surprises may be on the upside', but feels that equity prices are 'to put it in the kindest possible way, forward-looking'. Mr Myners feels that small companies 'are interesting again', and is focusing on companies that carry low levels of debt and have used the recession to restructure and cut costs. Howard Beaufort (Newton) says he is allergic to 'playing the currently fashionable second- and third-liner game'. He remains 'cautious and concentrated wholly on quality'. He has cut his cash holdings to 5 per cent, and sold D-Marks for dollars. He has further raised exposure to US dollar strength by adding 2 per cent to his US equity holdings, and acquiring a 5 per cent stake in US bonds. The only other new purchase has been to add 2 per cent to his equity stake in South-east Asia. This has been funded by selling his small Japanese equity holding, and shaving his European bond holdings. He is optimistic about markets in Asia. The US economy is expected to grow well, but equities there are fully valued. In contrast, he shares Mr McDougall's concern that Europe's economies are being held hostage to German interest rates, and confines interest to multinationals with substantial dollar earnings, and companies in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In the UK, new investment will be 'confined to the highest quality, international, defensive companies'. Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) is almost alone in being willing to adopt an optimistic tone - though, in Europe, optimism is confined to those countries that have cut loose from Germany's obsession with inflation, and 'gone for growth'. He sees good prospects for second- and third-line stocks in the UK, predicts a healthy recovery in the US, and even suggests that Japan 'may surprise on the upside' this year. He plans to raise his UK equity holding by 7 per cent to 65 per cent, and his stake in US equities by 2 per cent to 7 per cent. This is funded by taking profits on his 5 per cent UK bond holding, and shaving his holdings in Pacific equities, European bonds, and cash. This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise, in which four professional fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice - either wealthy a individual or a small self-administered pension fund. The fund managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of March.

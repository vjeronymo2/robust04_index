Last year, Jiangsu's  servce sector accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's gross  domestic prouct. For a long time, the service industry had  trailed the more developed manufacturing industry. Since the  1990's the local authorities have given priority to boost the  province's service sector. Of the newly lanched industrial and  commercial enterprises over the past two years, more than half  were in the service sector. They range from commodity  circulation and catering to real estate and entertainment.    Most privtely-run busiesses are in the service industries.  More than 300 private establishments are engaged in consultancy  in science and technology.    Investment in fixed assets of the service industry doubled  last year, as it also did the previous year. Infrastructure  such as transport and posts and telecommunications made  remarkable achievements.    In 1993, the province built additional electric generating  capacity of two million kw and installed telephone exchanges  with a capacity of 1.132 million lines. Construction is in full  swing for highways connecting the provincial capital with  Shanghai and other cities, ports and airports.    As a major commodities transfer center in the lower reaches  of the Chang Jiang River, Jiangsu has set up close to the  marketplace, more than 300 capital goods markets and over 130  financial markets. Overseas funds also poured into the  developmet of tourism, retail business, property and  infrastructure.    Experts believe the flourishing service industry in Jiangsu  helps optimize its overall industrial setup and improve the  investment environment. A service industry with a core  diversified pattern is shaping up in major cities along the  Chang Jiang river as they try to bring themselves up to  internationl standards.</p>

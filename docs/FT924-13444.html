			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Pits turn into bitter memory: Richard Donkin meets the miners whose fate ends a working era IN THREE weeks when production stops at Bilsthorpe colliery in north Nottinghamshire - perhaps a little later if he is kept to develop a linking scheme with a neighbouring pit - Colin Black will leave more than memories behind him. At 21, he is one of the colliery's youngest recruits. But his whole life has been shaped by the coal mining industry, and this pit in particular. 'My grandad was killed down Bilsthorpe pit 22 years ago,' he said. 'Another grandad died of emphysema after working in the pit.' His father, uncle and cousin all worked down the mine. 'I thought I had a long future here when I started just over two years ago,' he said. 'They told me the colliery would have a life of 50 years.' He and his wife Jane are expecting their first child in February. They have just bought one of the former British Coal houses for Pounds 29,000. 'We took out a mortgage protection policy for the first two years, which should help,' said Mrs Black. 'We're not sure yet what Colin will get in redundancy payments but it might be around Pounds 5,000.' She has worked out that with her wage at a hosiery factory and unemployment benefit they should have an income of nearly Pounds 160 a week when Mr Black stops work. 'He was earning Pounds 500 a week at the pit, so we are going to see a big drop in standards. And where round here is he going to find work?' Many of the younger miners were encouraged into the pits by their fathers. They have mining in their blood. Mr Harold Sheppard, 52, is one of the oldest among the 568 miners at Cotgrave pit near Nottingham who will work their last shift tomorrow. 'I'll be all right,' he said. 'My house is paid for and I'll have my redundancy pay, but it's the young ones I feel for. The average age of the men at our pit is 32. I brought my son in there. He is 24, married with a child on the way and he's bought a house. What is he going to do?' Only the suddenness of Cotgrave's closure came as a surprise. The pit had geological difficulties and the miners knew that its days were numbered, but previously the closure programme has allowed transfers to other mines. This time transfers are not in the deal. The relocation programmes have led to a broad mix of regional backgrounds across the coalfields. In north Nottinghamshire, men from Durham, western Scotland and south Wales work beside with second-generation Latvians and Estonians. Mr Jim Campbell came down to Clipstone with his father Hamish from Girvan, Ayrshire, in 1978. He and his brother followed their father into the pit. 'We thought we were set up here, but look at us now,' he said. 'It doesn't matter what union you're in now. It's finished for everybody.' Recriminations, sadness and a few old scores have begun to emerge among the miners' welfare clubs across the Nottinghamshire coalfield as the full implications of the cuts become apparent. Divided loyalties between members of the National Union of Mineworkers and the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers have resurfaced, although not with the bitterness that broke up whole families in the 1984-85 strike. At Bilsthorpe Miners' Welfare, men drink side by side with those they picketed eight years ago. The NUM men are determined to salvage some pride from their defeat in the year-long dispute. Brandishing a tattoo on his forearm that recounted his battle honours in previous strikes, Mr Ronnie Green, a former miner, said: 'A lot of people here sold their souls, but by God they wish they hadn't now.' But there was no gloating. 'My heart goes out to these people here,' he said, 'but I saw it coming. These lads have been sold down the river more than I have been.' In the confused aftermath of the announcements, miners who have been enjoying the best wages of their careers cannot come to terms with the loss of their jobs. Some have notched up earnings of Pounds 21,000 in less than six months and could have expected to have earned Pounds 50,000 this year. Mr David Bates, the 33-year-old NUM branch secretary at Bilsthorpe, said the hardest part about the closure was that it came at a time of high productivity. 'We have turned production on its head but the trouble is we have done too much. We have the largest recoverable reserves in this area. There is a mile of coal down there worth Pounds 33m and ready to mine. Now we have to break through to the Thoresby colliery workings so they can mine our coal.' Mr Paul Sterland, a member of Nacods, the supervisors' union, was numbed at the news. 'I have worked in the mine 17 years, I'm married with three young kids, aged three, six and nine, and I have no future. I'm 33 and my life is finished.' He forecast the end of communities like Bilsthorpe. 'It had a special feeling here. Everyone has always helped each other but they won't be able to do that now. In another four or five years it will be like a ghost town.' Mr Alan Stoneman, another NUM man who joined the 1984 strike, compared the government's coal policy with that of its support for nuclear power, which has included subsidies levied from other energy producers. Mining colleagues at the club studied their beer glasses when he claimed the NUM had been right about the threat to the coalfields eight years ago. 'The time has come for you to admit it,' he said to them. Mr David Smith, a UDM man, looked him in the eyes, and said: 'You were right and I was wrong.'</p>

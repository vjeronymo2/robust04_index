			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK launches a final sortie: Britain is anxious to dissuade Germany from quitting the European Fighter Aircraft project BRITAIN'S defence ministry is mounting a last-ditch effort to keep Germany in the four-nation European Fighter Aircraft project by arguing that it can be produced more cheaply than Bonn estimates. At the same time, it is preparing the ground for a German withdrawal from the Pounds 20bn project, which could be followed by a similar move by Spain. This would leave Britain and Italy to carry out the remainder of the programme, now near the end of an Pounds 8bn development phase. Initial contacts have been made with other European countries that might join in the production phase to ensure EFA's viability. Spain, which delayed before joining the development programme four years ago, is understood to have assured Britain it will stay in the project as long as Germany does, and will not quit unless the price of the aircraft increases. If Germany does withdraw, however, some increase in costs to the other partners appears inevitable. The odds on Bonn pulling out from the sophisticated fighter, widely seen in Germany as exceeding the country's needs in a transformed east-west climate, have increased sharply since the industrial partners tabled production proposals in April. Initial British calculations were that German withdrawal might increase the EFA's price to the UK by 7 per cent. If Spain backed out, too, the increase would be 12 per cent. However, officials now indicate that the extra cost might be smaller. Negotiations are under way with the two German-based industry consortia  - the airframe grouping Eurofighter (British Aerospace, MBB of Germany, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain) and the engine team Eurojet (Rolls-Royce, MTU of Germany, Fiat and the Spanish company ITP) - to bring down production costs. A decision to set up production - at a cost of some Pounds 3.5bn between the four countries - was initially due to be made this year, but UK officials say it is not now required before mid-1993. The decision requires a commitment by the partners on how many aircraft they intend to buy, but actual production orders would not be placed until 1995, enabling producers to meet the 1998 target for starting deliveries. The UK says Germany could push back its delivery schedule to ease costs in the initial years. Bonn has a more pressing timetable, however, because it needs Bundestag approval to allocate money next year for tooling-up. Industry has already offered to cut its price by 5 per cent and UK officials expect further reductions. The original proposal gave the Germans what they call a 'system price' of DM133.9m (Pounds 46m) per aircraft - an accounting concept used by the German military which, say British officials, nobody else recognises. It includes what in the UK is known a 'unit production price' - the price of each aircraft as it comes off the assembly line, plus a share of the production investment cost - with 35 per cent added on to cover logistics support, and value-added tax. Britain says the logistical support allowance is too high for an aircraft designed to be cheaper to operate and maintain than current-generation aircraft. It is understood to be aiming for a unit production cost of about Pounds 28m-Pounds 29m. With initial support costs this would come to about Pounds 36m. The UK believes costs can be cut by reorganising the production plan. The partner countries could be assured of high-technology work without automatically sharing in each major element such as flight controls. Final assembly lines, instead of one in each country, would be reduced to two at most: one at BAe in Lancashire, another either in Bavaria or Italy. If Germany pulls out, more work would go to the UK. British officials reckon this would save costs because British wages are lower than Germany's. But the saving would be unlikely to compensate for the extra burden of production investment, shared between fewer partners. Any add-on cost would be likely to force down the numbers of aircraft the remaining partners buy. The RAF wants 250 aircraft as originally planned, but the UK Treasury can be expected to block any extra spending. The other partners have already reduced their declared plans - Germany to 200, Italy to 130 and Spain to 87, making a total of 667. This is 13 per cent down on the original programme. None of the plans is secure. The project needs a production run of at least 350-400 aircraft. Below that, say officials, it will cease to be competitive with the alternatives. The UK argues strongly that there is 'no cheaper aircraft with acceptable performance'. Among the main options, the McDonnell Douglas F-15, the top-of-the-range US fighter, would be costlier; its planned successor, the Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics F-22, even more so; McDonnell Douglas's F/A-18 is judged less capable than EFA and, the way Britain does its sums on aircraft costs, no cheaper. The industrial stakes are high. Government and industry officials estimate EFA production, under present plans, would sustain 60,000 jobs in Europe, including 20,000 in the UK, and an equivalent number among indirect suppliers.</p>

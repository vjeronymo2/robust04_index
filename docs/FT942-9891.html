			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / European rivals pay more for telecoms Businesses in the UK pay less for telecommunications than those in France, Germany and Italy, with large business users considerably better off, says a survey published today. The survey also says that the price gap between British Telecommunications and Mercury, the leading UK operators, is steadily narrowing, and shows typical UK residential customers to be worse off than those in France. The study by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, is one of the most comprehensive telecoms price comparisons to include the UK. It makes allowance for Britain's comparatively large local-call zones, notably in London. Comparing prices for residential customers and different sizes of business in the four countries, it reveals Italy to be consistently the most expensive. Italian businesses with more than 100 lines pay almost twice as much as UK counterparts per line in calls - Pounds 5,302 a year, at January prices, against Pounds 2,847 for UK Mercury lines and Pounds 3,176 for BT. Smaller businesses in the UK are similarly well placed. At January prices, those with three lines pay Pounds 721 a year per line with Mercury and Pounds 739 with BT, against Pounds 860 in France, Pounds 930 in Ger-many and Pounds 1,277 in Italy. However, taking into account line-rental charges, the typical residential customer was found to pay Pounds 26 a year less in France than in Britain with BT. This is explained by the introduction of value added tax on telephone calls in France in 1989 without a corresponding increase in tariffs. The survey finds a steady convergence in the cost of international telephone calls from the four countries in the past 10 years, with particularly steep falls in Italy and France. In Britain, large businesses with 100 lines have seen the average cost per minute of an international call fall from 78p to 40p (BT) and 37p (Mercury) since 1983 (at 1994 prices). In France the equivalent decline has been from Pounds 1.06 to 47p, in Germany from 91p to 46p and in Italy from Pounds 1.44 to 60p. The survey gives a mixed verdict on the impact of privatisation and competition. While large businesses - until recently the main battleground for UK competition - appear to have made substantial gains in the UK compared with their continental counterparts, small businesses and residential customers have not made notable gains on a comparative basis.

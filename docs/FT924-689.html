			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Seoul and Hanoi set up diplomatic ties The establishment of diplomatic ties between Seoul and Hanoi yesterday removes the main obstacle to expanding Korean investment in Vietnam, writes John Burton in Seoul. Vietnam is the last country with which South Korea has forged ties as part of President Roh Tae-woo's policy to normalise relations with current and former socialist nations. Seoul has already allowed Korean companies to make limited investments in Vietnam and there are more than 30 Korean concerns with branch offices there. Trade has expanded from Dollars 77m in 1988 to more than Dollars 440m this year.</p>

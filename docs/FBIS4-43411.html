The first positive  results are being received, she said, adding that the mechanism  is now at work that will seriously improve the exports that had  reached a deadlock and the current transactions deficit that was  getting larger and larger.    As a result of a series of measures that had to be taken,  Ciller explained that, on the one hand, while the capital and  interest on loans are being paid, one the other hand, getting  further loans is being kept at a minimum. In this way, she  said,the amount of money paid in interest from tax revenues has  dropped significantly for the first time since 1987..    The prime minister pointed out that the budget deficit,  which  had reached 32 trillion Turkish lira, was 4.5 trillion lira last  month. This drop will continue, she stressed.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Babangida makes way for new ruler GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida yesterday stepped down as Nigeria's military ruler and installed a non-elected administration of civilians and soldiers, in which the military is expected to retain an upper hand. It remains unclear, however, what role, if any, will be played by the man who seized power in 1985 and has since postponed the handover to civilian government on three occasions. The composition of the administration was also uncertain, although civilians are expected to outnumber the soldiers. In a prepared speech due to be broadcast last night, Gen Babangida said: 'I believe the time has come for me, my service chiefs, deputy Chief of Defence Staff and Inspector General of Police to give way to a new set of leadership to propel our march towards lasting civilian democratic governance at all levels of our country.' He urged Nigerians to give the interim government a chance to finish the transition to civilian rule. The new administration's length of tenure has not been announced. Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the outgoing administration which served under Gen Babangida, was expected to be named as Nigeria's head of government. Gen Sani Abacha will continue to hold his post of defence minister in addition to the new post of vice-president. Gen Abacha played a pivotal role in pressuring Gen Babangida to quit office. Several members of the outgoing Transitional Council, appointed by Gen Babangida eight months ago to oversee the transition to civilian rule, are expected to stay on in new jobs. Mr Aminu Saleh, the former industry minister, becomes finance minister. Mr Matthew Mbu remains foreign secretary, as does Mr Clement Apango as attorney general. And Comrade Uche Chukwumerije, nicknamed the 'North Korean' for his zeal in promoting the Babangida regime, stays put as information minister. New faces are likely to include Mr Don Etiebet in the strategic post of petroleum minister, and Mr Sam Aluko, an economist, as the minister for national planning. What was meant to be the crowning moment of Nigeria's transition to democracy degenerated into cruel farce as Gen Babangida kept secret the identity of his successors until the last minute of his rule. Gen Babangida leaves behind a bankrupt legacy. During his eight-year rule, Nigerians saw their country drop out of the club of middle-income countries to join the mass of impoverished nations. Per capita income has fallen from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300. The naira, once worth more than the dollar, is now worth only a few cents. Nigeria owes around Dollars 34bn to foreign creditors, including arrears. 'At least Babangida destroyed one myth for us: that civilians are more corrupt and inefficient than the military,' a businessman in Lagos said.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Travelers agrees to offer by Primerica THE BOARD of Travelers, one of the biggest US composite insurance companies, agreed yesterday to an offer from financial services group Primerica for the 73 per cent of the company it does not already own. The Dollars 4.1bn deal had already been by approved by the board of Primerica, but must still win the support of shareholders of both companies and insurance regulators in a number of states. The Travelers takeover would mark the culmination of a drive by Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive of Primerica, to turn his consumer finance, stockbroking and insurance group into one of the biggest diversified financial services groups in the US. Based on yesterday's market valuations of the two companies, the takeover would create a group with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 17bn - identical to American Express, the financial services group which Mr Weill left in the mid-1980s to begin building his own operation. Mr Weill said the deal would give Primerica 'an even more diversified earnings stream, a large portion of which is recurring and predictable'.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: A TRIBUTE TO MSGR. EAGEN AND SHELTER  </P> <P> In 1988, Dr. Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual leader of  the Church of England, awarded a trophy to the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc  Center that named it the premier shelter on the planet.  </P> <P> That trophy was on display Saturday in the downtown Marriott's San Diego  Ballroom, but the spotlight shone even brighter on Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, named  "A Man for All Seasons" by both the organizers of the fund-raiser to benefit  St. Vincent and the 800 guests who gathered to applaud the man who is known  fondly by many as "the Silver Fox." Since 1968, Eagen has juggled  responsibilities as chancellor of the Catholic Diocese of San Diego, pastor of  the Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala and chaplain of the San Diego  Chargers.  </P> <P> The tribute marked a change in direction for the annual St. Vincent benefit,  which previously has been something of a warm-up for St. Patrick's Day. Linda  Katz, who shared general chairmanship duties with her husband, Mel, and with  Jan and Mike Madigan, said that, since "A Man for All Seasons" was chosen as  the focus, the theme aimed at a feeling of Old World sophistication. Thus,  shamrocks (one year, baskets of Irish potatoes decorated the tables) were  discarded in favor of clusters of potted Easter lilies, a handsome gesture that  meant three days of work for decorations honcho Karen Speidel, whose job was to  glue sheet moss to each of the 460 pots.  </P> <P> The week ended with a somewhat mind-boggling number of major benefits -- most  of them held at the San Diego Marriott, which seems for the moment to have  virtually cornered the charity market -- but the Eagen tribute brought out the  largest crowd of all. The honorary committee list read like a roster of  community leaders and included Kathy and George Pardee, Ernest and Jean Hahn,  Episcopal Bishop C. Brinkley Morton, Kathryn and James Colachis, Jane Guymon,  Rabbi Michael Sternfield, Joanne and Frank Warren, Linda and Frank Alessio,  Mary and Bruce Hazard, and Betsy and Doug Manchester; the Hazards and  Manchesters underwrote the dinner.  </P> <P> Jan Madigan said the event sold out early, a situation that disappointed those  turned away but resulted in remarkable net proceeds.  </P> <P> "It's just great when you have a total sell-out," said Madigan. "We're going to  make $210,000, honest to God!"  </P> <P> "Isn't that something?" commented Madigan's co-chair, Linda Katz. "We were able  to do it because of Msgr. Eagen. He's never been honored before in town, even  though he's done so much for San Diego, and I think that's really the key --  people called all week asking for tickets, and many of those who couldn't get  in still sent contributions."  </P> <P> "This money provides an opportunity of hope to the children," said Msgr. Joe  Carroll, director of the St. Vincent center. "It also proves that San Diego  cares."  </P> <P> The proceeds are earmarked specifically for childrens' programs at the downtown  homeless shelter. Among specific services noted by the program are after-school  and tutorial programs, meals and shelter, as well as a few less tangible  benefits, one of which was described as "a parent who is not so frightened or  exhausted worrying about tomorrow that there is no time for a hug today."  </P> <P> Eagen, who was surrounded by a constant crush of well-wishers through the  lengthy cocktail hour, seemed to take the attention in stride, although he was  self-effacing when it came to accepting the honor. "The cause is the important  thing," he said. "That's what I'm excited about, the fact that these children  will be helped. I'm just pleased to be part of the program."  </P> <P> The evening progressed with a certain decorum. After the dinner, of  seafood-stuffed artichokes and medallions of beef tenderloin, the brief formal  program -- interrupted by several standing ovations -- centered mainly on a  videotaped tribute to Eagen that also showed scenes of daily life at the St.  Vincent shelter. The event concluded with dancing to the Sterling orchestra.  </P> <P> Tijuana Bishop Emilio Berlie joined Bishop Leo Maher at a table hosted by  trans-border philanthropist Yolanda Walther-Meade. Among others present were  Bill and Lollie Nelson, Pat and Maggie Crowell, Jack and Lynn Stedd White,  Helen Anne Bunn, Roger and Judy Benson, Rick Smith, Janet Gallison with Walter  Fitch, Cush and Betty Dow, and San Diego State University President Tom Day and  his wife, Anne.  </P> <P> The full San Diego Symphony Orchestra went on a field trip Friday to Marriott  Hall, but not just to fiddle around.  </P> <P> Resplendent in white dinner jackets, the orchestra made an unprecedented  appearance at the annual fashion luncheon presented by the symphony's Auxiliary  Council. The downtown Marriott's largest ballroom proved just large enough to  accommodate both the immense stage and ramp required by the concert cum clothes  fest, and the 650 guests.  </P> <P> The event generated intense excitement among the many lifelong symphony  supporters in the crowd, so much so that more than half attended at the  top-price patrons category. This fact pleased chairwoman Luba Johnston so much  that, during the luncheon, she congratulated the group for its wisdom in  attending.  </P> <P> "You can't have a wonderful party without wonderful people, so congratulations  to all of you for being here," said Johnston.  </P> <P> During the cocktail reception, co-chairwoman Virginia Monday said luring the  orchestra to the show was a genuine coup for the committee, since it was the  first time in the symphony's 60-year history that it had agreed to play for the  annual women's luncheon. (Monday, who chaired the final three Combo galas as  well as other major events before taking a lengthy hiatus from fund-raising,  will chair the May 1 Celebrity Sports Stars show to be given for the San Diego  Hall of Champions at the Town &amp; Country.)  </P> <P> It was probably inevitable that the committee chose "Symphony of Fashion" as  the name of the event, but it did suit the day. The orchestra offered  Shostakovich's "Festival Overture" straight through the spinach salad, the  usual roar of voices suppressed to a hushed babble under the baton of conductor  Richard Amos. The musicians departed before the poached salmon, however, and  did not return until designer Michael Novarese, who presented his Spring  collection, had told the audience that having the orchestra play for the show  would be "an interesting marriage."  </P> <P> At times, in fact, it seemed like the marriage of Figaro, since the orchestra  swung through a cheerful selection of Broadway standards while the models  marched down the long, flower-decked ramp wearing severe expressions that might  better have been accompanied by a dirge. Yet the presentation of music and  gowns made for a unique and in many ways exhilarating combination, the violins  tittering at a collection of pastel dresses, the oboes percolating for a sultry  march of cocktail ensembles. In the audience, there was more agreement over the  music than the clothes, which one observer described as "Barbara Bush  fashions."  </P> <P> The close of the show brought applause not only for the orchestra, but for a  day that many called a landmark occasion. The response, in fact, prompted  Symphony President Elsie Weston to pledge that the orchestra will play at next  year's event. "It was such a smash hit that we've got to do it again," she  said.  </P></p>

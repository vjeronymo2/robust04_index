			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / US prison chief joins private jail group ONE OF Britain's new private-sector prison companies has appointed Mr Michael Quinlan, until recently director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, to its board. Mr Quinlan, who occupied the most senior executive position in the US prison system, is joining UK Detention Services. The company runs Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester - one of only two private prisons operating in the UK  -and is a consortium of John Mowlem, Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and Corrections Corporation of America. The appointment of Mr Quinlan, who has 21 years' experience of public-sector prison management in the US, illustrates the way emerging private prison operators are preparing for a substantial growth in business opportunities. With no previous expertise in the private sector, the companies are having to seek it elsewhere. UK Detention Services and Group 4, which runs the Wolds remand centre, Humberside, have attracted directors and managers formerly with the UK public sector. Last month Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced that a further 10 prisons would join Wolds and Blakenhurst under private management. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, yesterday said that his agency was negotiating to buy a site for one of these - the former Parc hospital at Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan. The Bridgend prison, and another new one planned for Liverpool, are the first establishments for which the private sector will be invited to bid to finance, design, build and manage. In addition, eight existing prisons will be transferred to private management under the government's proposals. Ministers believe that the plan for 12 privately managed prisons - nearly 10 per cent of the total prison estate - will be enough to create and sustain a viable private sector. The next private contract to be awarded will be for the management of the new Doncaster prison. Bids went to the Prison Service last week. There are about eight companies interested in prison management in Britain. It is likely the market will sustain about half of these.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Post Office first-half profit leaps: Parcelforce loss cut to Pounds 21m THE POST Office reported record pre-tax profits of Pounds 135m for the half year to September 27 yesterday - more than double the Pounds 62m achieved last year. The increase was achieved largely through Pounds 70m of cost savings, mostly from Royal Mail, the letters division. Turnover increased to Pounds 2.56bn (Pounds 2.41bn). Ministers are close to announcing their recommendation on the review of the Post Office's structure, which may lead to privatisation. Royal Mail's increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 62m to Pounds 131m, is expected to bolster the arguments in favour of floating the division with special incentives for employee participation. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman, while not wishing to comment on the government's review, said: 'Whatever ministers decide, we would want to see the highest level of employee involvement.' It is understood that the Post Office has already submitted a report to the government recommending that Royal Mail should be floated with special incentives, such as share bonuses, to encourage employees to take part in privatisation. Sir Bryan repeated the Post Office's pledge to keep letter prices at their present level until April. 'Prices will be frozen at least until next April . . . and will continue to be held as long as possible,' he said. The company's Parcelforce division recorded a loss of Pounds 21m, compared with a loss of Pounds 27m. Sir Bryan said the division, which is for sale, hoped to break even by the end of its financial year in March because it was now in its strongest trading period. Pre-tax profits from Post Office Counters, which sells stationery and pays out pensions, declined from Pounds 24m to Pounds 12m. Sir Bryan described the result as a 'short-term aberration' and predicted that it would recover in the second half. It was the third successive fall in pre-tax profits. The Post Office Users' National Council, the official postal services watchdog, has accused the government of imposing 'unreasonable and uncommercial' financial targets on the Post Office. The Post Office's contribution to the government will rise by more than Pounds 200m over the next two financial years. The amount the Post Office has to generate from cashflow above its own investment needs - negative external financing limits (EFLs) - will increase from Pounds 68m in 1993-94 and Pounds 70m in 1994-95 to Pounds 180m in both years. Sir Bryan said he believed the financial targets were 'by and large fair' and compared them to a dividend a private company would pay. Capital expenditure is expected to have risen to Pounds 300m by the end of the corporation's financial year. Sir Bryan said that suggested the Post Office could both invest and meet its financial targets.</p>

"The boom of rural townships has greatly helped boost local  economic and social development," said Minister of Construction  Hou Jie yesterday.    He spoke at a national meeting held by the ministry, in  which  25 rural township heads from around the country were invited to  be advisers on rural township construction.    The rapid development of rural reform over the past years  has  brought an unprecedented surge of townships and small cities in  the country's vast rural areas.    Some 40,000 villages have expanded to become towns since  1978, when China launched its reform drive in rural areas,  according to ministry sources.    Another 14,500 small or medium cities have also sprung up,  with their own administrative, cultural, and economic  structures, modern public services and advanced living  facilities. In 1979, there were only 2,850 such entities--most  of them established by the government.    The newly-emerged towns have accommodated more than 150  million residents, of whom 100 million are former farmers.    Most of the new towns have been founded on the success of  rural industry, especially in economically developed rural areas  such as south China's Pearl River Delta, east China's Yangtze  [Chang Jiang] River Delta, and the Jiaodong and Liaodong  Peninsulas.    In East China's Anhui Province, some 40 new rural towns have  mushroomed in recent years.    Hou pointed out that these boom towns play an important role  in absorbing the excessive rural labour force, furthering the  rural market economy, and helping to restructure and reform  rural production.    The development of small towns also means residents can  enjoy  improved living conditions with more roads, water supply  facilities, communications and other public service facilities,  and special districts for industry and commerce, Hou said.    The towns have increasingly become political, economic,  cultural, scientific and technological, educational, and  information centres in the country's rural areas, said the  minister.</p>

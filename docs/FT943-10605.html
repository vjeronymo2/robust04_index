			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Meter problems confuse electricity users Thousands of industrial and commercial consumers of electricity are facing confusion over their bills as a result of severe metering problems in the section of the supply market recently opened to competition. Four months after medium to large users were given the choice of who supplies their electricity, many of about 12,000 which took advantage of this have no firm idea how much their electricity is costing and are working from estimates. According to the Major Energy Users' Council some consumers fear they will never be given accurate bills for the last four months. Mr Richard Wills, its technical director, said: 'The degree of incompetence on the part of the electricity industry is breathtaking. Our members are having to divert a horrendous amount of management time to sorting out the mess.' The problems arise in part because about 5,000 consumers are either still awaiting installation of special meters or have had meters installed which are not working properly. This is partly due to meter shortages in some areas, although some companies share the blame for slowness in appointing meter operators. Reasons for meters not working properly include incorrect installation - in some cases because of poor training - and a failure to ensure that the meter is connected to telecommunication lines. Relatively sophisticated 'code 5' meters are needed because they can gauge how much power is used every half hour and can be read remotely by the electricity bill settlement authorities. Power prices are determined by the pool for every half hour, and vary according to demand. The thousands of customers without 'code 5' meters are facing weekly visits from the local electricity companies' readers to enable the bill settlements department at the pool to make estimates. Monthly meter readings were the norm before April 1. The inconvenience caused by the more frequent meter readings is counterbalanced to some extent by electricity suppliers sending bills which in general underestimate what will eventually have to be paid, thus helping customers' cash flow. The suppliers say part of the confusion has been caused by late decisions by Offer, the industry regulator, on several issues affecting the market. One decision was to introduce competition in meter reading. Previously it was the preserve of regional electricity companies. A regional company executive said: 'Introducing competition in both meter reading and electricity supply at the same time has proved too much.' Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said deciding who should install the meter and associated technology, and how, had proved a bureaucratic nightmare. The system which was introduced involved too many people and organisations. The pool has set up a task force of eight people to sort out the settlements problem. In spite of the problems many companies will benefit financially from the introduction of competition because of the fall in prices that has resulted. Estimates of annual bill reductions of at least 4 per cent are common.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Listing sought for tower block THE ROYAL Fine Art Commission has recommended that Centrepoint, the central London office block, become a listed building, Rachel Johnson writes. The commission says the block has a 'structure deftly turning the corner' and 'elegance worthy of a Wren steeple'. Meanwhile, Lord St John of Fawsley, the former arts minister, said yesterday that the commission should have a statutory role in the listing of buildings. The commission is best known for the advice it gives on new architecture - but it also emphasises preservation and conservation. Lord Fawsley said a change in the commission's powers should be made and 'buildings should be listed if it so recommends'. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, however, has rejected his call. Listing recommendations currently rest with English Heritage. Lord Fawsley complained that most post-war buildings referred to the commission were worth listing, but only the Economist Building and Bracken House - the former home of the Financial Times  - in London had been listed.</p>

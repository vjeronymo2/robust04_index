			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / US trade deficit down 7.7% THE US merchandise trade deficit fell 7.7 per cent in June to Dollars 6.59bn, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, providing a modest fillip to President George Bush and his fellow Republicans at their current party convention in Houston. The administration hailed the 7.2 per cent rise in exports to a record Dollars 38.3bn as a vindication of Mr Bush's trade policies. However, imports were also a record, at Dollars 44.9bn, and more than 40 per cent of the increased exports was due to a volatile component, foreign sales of civilian aircraft, which rose by Dollars 1.1bn during the month to Dollars 2.57bn. For the first six months of 1992, the adjusted trade deficit totalled Dollars 35.5bn, compared with Dollars 30.5bn in the equivalent period last year. The higher export figure reflected increasing foreign sales of capital goods, industrial supplies and materials, vehicles, parts and engines, foods, feeds and beverages, and consumer goods. Although the rise in exports might not be sustained, foreign sales continue to provide the best news in the sluggish US recovery. The administration will use export growth to try to win voters over to the newly negotiated North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. In June, the US ran a trade surplus of Dollars 334m with Mexico and a Dollars 440.6m deficit with Canada.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                               Already tense relations between the illegal but largely tolerated  Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its electoral ally the Socialist  Labor Party (SLP) have been further strained by reports that the  Egyptian government is considering a new change in the law  governing parliamentary elections.  While an official decision on  changing the law is evidently still far off, the MB has evinced  concern that such a change would benefit the SLP to the  Brotherhood's detriment.                            END SUMMARY      Over the past few months, both Egypt's state-owned and opposition  newspapers have published reports that the ruling National  Democratic Party (NDP) is contemplating yet another change in the  parliamentary election system, presumably to take effect prior to  the elections expected to occur at the expiration of the current  People's Assembly term in late 1995.  According to the reports  and news commentaries, the change being considered would restore  in some form the recently abolished proportional representation  party list system, which was introduced by President Husni  Mubarak in 1984.  Under that system, the banned Muslim  Brotherhood could enter candidates only if legal parties  integrated them in their lists.  The party list system was  abolished prior to the 1990 parliamentary elections, after the  Constitutional Court ruled that it did not give independent  candidates sufficient opportunity to compete; it was replaced by  a system based on individual candidacies (see Note 1).  According  to the government-owned daily Al-Ahram, the government's interest  in restoring the old system is largely motivated by its concern  to rein in independent-minded NDP deputies by ensuring that they  are beholden to the party (Al-Ahram international edition, 30  March).     (Note 1) The Brotherhood--together with its SLP ally and two  other parties--nonetheless opted to boycott the 1990 elections in  protest against what they claimed was the absence of guarantees  for free and honest elections.     Minister of People's Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs  Muhammad Zaki Abu-'Amir appeared to confirm in February that the  government is seriously considering restoring the party slate  system with modifications that would bring it into compliance  with the 1990 court ruling.  In comments reported by the weekly  Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm, Abu-'Amir denied that he knew of any official  inclination to change the system.  He added, however, that the  government's "economic liberalization policy will force a return  to the proportional system," because individual candidacies are  more susceptible to the "influence of money."  The same report  quoted Fawziyah 'Abd-al-Sattar, head of parliament's Legislative  Committee, as saying that a compromise might be found in which  half the seats in every district are reserved for independents  and the other half for party slates (5 February).     One suggested modification to the electoral system--lowering the  threshold for parliamentary representation--would theoretically  enable the SLP to contest the next People's Assembly elections  without having to rely on its Muslim Brotherhood allies.  Deputy  Prime Minister and NDP Secretary General Yusuf Wali reportedly  told SLP officials that restoring the proportional list system  might also involve a lowering of the threshold for parliamentary  representation from 8 percent of the vote that a party was  required to win under the old system to 4 percent (Al-Ahram  international edition, 5 January).  It was that threshold that  forced the SLP into its "Islamic Alliance" with the Brotherhood  and a smaller party--the Liberals--in 1987 (see Note 2).  Accordingly, lowering the threshold would make the SLP less  dependent on the MB and would diminish MB opportunities to  contest parliamentary seats independently, through the individual  candidacies of organization members.     (Note 2) The SLP fell just short of the threshold when it  contested the previous elections of 1984 on its own.     To the extent that the projected change could serve to undermine  the MB-SLP alliance and damage MB chances in coming elections, it  would be consistent with government attempts in the past couple  of years to marginalize the organization through legislative  action:     --In February 1993, the People's Assembly passed a law aimed at  turning back MB advances in professional syndicates by  invalidating elections that fail to draw fifty percent of the  eligible voters (Uktubar, 28 February 1993).     --In December 1992, an amendment to the law governing political  parties was passed, banning all political activities by  organizations seeking party status that have not yet been legally  recognized (Al-Ahram, 19 December 1992).  That legislation  followed rumors--evidently encouraged by NDP officials to  intimidate the SLP and the Brotherhood--that the government was  considering a bill to ban any alliance with an illegal  organization.      Rising Tensions in Islamic Alliance      Concern over the possible electoral change has been an evident  factor in recent tensions between MB and SLP leaders.  Those  relations have been particularly strained by the SLP's decision  to engage in discussions with NDP officials on the "national  dialogue"--which President Mubarak called for last November (see  Note 3)--without MB representatives, despite the fact that the  MB, along with most other opposition parties, signed a statement  conditionally agreeing to participate in the dialogue (text of  statement published in Al-Wafd, 7 December 1993).  It was in a  meeting with the SLP on the national dialogue that NDP Secretary  General Wali reportedly indicated official openness to restoring  the party list election system and lowering the threshold for  representation.  The dispute over participation in the dialogue  broke out into the open last January with public bickering in the  pages of the semiweekly SLP organ and MB mouthpiece Al-Sha'b, as  well as the international edition of Al-Ahram.  Although  differences between leaders of the two groups have occasionally  been expressed publicly in the past, such open bickering is  extremely unusual, particularly in the Islamic Alliance's own  paper.     (Note 3) Mubarak invited "all the democratic forces in Egypt,"  including not only the political parties but "all of Egypt's  thinkers and individuals, regardless of their affiliation," to  join in a national dialogue that would "contribute toward  drafting a sound scientific outlook for Egypt during the 21st  century" (Cairo radio, 11 November 1993).  More recently, Mubarak  said he would call for the dialogue to take place in April (MENA,  20 March).  Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi asserted in an interview  that "only the legitimate forces will take part" in the dialogue  and that "the Muslim Brotherhood is an illegitimate and illegal  force" (Al-Musawwar, 4 February).  But neither Sidqi nor his  interviewer referred to press reports that the MB might  participate in the dialogue at some point through the  professional syndicates under its control.     MB official Ma'mun al-Hudaybi used the organization's regular  column in Al-Sha'b to attack the SLP together with four other  opposition parties for allegedly agreeing to engage in the  dialogue under reported government conditions that would exclude,  at least initially, the MB and other parties (11 January).  He  devoted a separate box in the same column to chastising SLP  Secretary General 'Adil Husayn for his account in the paper's  previous issue of his meeting with NDP officials.  Alluding,  inter alia, to Husayn's report that the SLP representatives said  they would "welcome" discussion of a change to the proportional  list system as a topic of the "national dialogue," al-Hudaybi  accused Husayn of flouting MB interests at the meeting "in the  knowledge that your party leans toward agreement to the party  list [electoral system] and that the political forces, foremost  the MB, will be unable to participate in those elections if this  is realized" (11 January).     Responding to al-Hudaybi's remarks, Husayn objected to much of  the criticism directed at him; but he made no effort to deny al-  Hudaybi's allegation that the SLP supported a return to the  proportional party list system (Al-Sha'b, 14 January).  (For a  summary of the exchange, see box.)     Subsequent public bickering has brought to the surface other  objects of longstanding tension between elements of the MB and  SLP--tension that could increase if the government decides to  restore the proportional party list system.  Most notably, MB  domination of the most prominent professional syndicates has  evidently bred some resentment on the part of some SLP officials.  Thus, SLP Assistant Secretary General and Secretary for  Organization Affairs 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat was quoted as  complaining that "the Brotherhood is working on monopolizing" the  syndicates throughout the country and "not opening the door to  participation by members of the party, except to a minimal degree  that does not meet the party's aspirations."  He asserted that  the Brothers "view these syndicates as their legitimate party, as  they have no legal presence" as an organization and thus believe  "that the [Socialist] Labor Party may not compete with them in  their party."  This dispute, Barakat was quoted as saying, "has  had a clear impact on the course of the alliance as it now  stands" (Al-Ahram international edition, 15 January).      Heading Toward a Break?      The strains within the Islamic Alliance have led to open  suggestions from SLP officials of ending the partnership; but it  is unclear how much of the discussion is simply posturing or, if  it is serious, whether it reflects the views of a significant  sector of the party's leadership.  Naji al-Shihabi, an assistant  secretary general of the SLP and member of its Executive Bureau,  was quoted in the press as claiming that a consensus was reached  at a recent Bureau meeting in support of his proposal to end the  alliance.  He added, however, that it was agreed to wait until  the thousands of elected local councils in Egypt are dissolved-  -presumably as a result of an eventual court decision striking  down that electoral system on the same basis that the  parliamentary electoral system was earlier struck down (see Note  4).  Noting that Alliance candidates won control over a number of  these local councils in the elections of November 1992, al-  Shihabi said the delay in ending the alliance would serve to  prevent "a weakening of the members of the party in these  councils" (Al-Ahram international edition, 8 January).  While  indicating that no firm decision has been made to abandon the  Islamic Alliance, the SLP's Barakat, in his subsequent comments  to Al-Ahram, implied that the party would be ready to break with  the MB when the local councils are dissolved, unless the latter  is ready to meet tough demands from the SLP.  He was quoted as  saying that "the existence of the local councils call for the  continuation of the alliance in view of their division between  the MB and Labor [Party]," adding that "should there be a  decision dissolving the local councils, the matter will be  reviewed" and certain understandings would have to be worked out  before the alliance is renewed.     (Note 4) The issue is awaiting a ruling by the Constitutional  Court, to which it was referred immediately following the 1992  local council elections (Al-Wafd, 4 November 1992).     Consistent with the SLP leaders' expression of a commitment to  maintaining the Islamic Alliance at least until the local  councils are dissolved, the open bickering between the MB and SLP  ended in late January and al-Shihabi himself has made clear that  party leaders unhappy with the alliance are not yet ready to burn  their bridges with the MB.  Most recently, al-Shihabi was cited  as saying that his party is already "preparing for the  possibility of a change in the election law to the unconditional  proportional list system" --presumably referring to the absence of  any threshold for representation--and that his party might form a  "unified slate" that would include elements of both the MB and  the [secular leftist] Nasirites (Al-Ahram international edition,  19 March).  However, highlighting the potential for further  discord, at least some within the MB leadership have reportedly  opposed cooperation with Nasirites (Rose Al-Yusuf, 31 May 1993,  Al-Yasar, February 1994)--anathema to many Brothers who recall  the long years (mid-1950s to 1970) of brutal oppression of MB  leaders by the late President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir and abhor the  Nasirites' secular orientation.     Complicating any assessment of prospects for the continuation of  the alliance--even following a change in the electoral law--are  the conflicting indications of the extent to which the MB has  succeeded in taking control of the SLP party structure.  Officials from both groups--but particularly the MB--often stress  that they remain separate organizations.  For example, al-Hudaybi  was quoted as claiming that "there has never been a merger  between the Brothers and the [Socialist Labor] party or a taking  over of the party by the MB."  Moreover, he pointed to what he  claimed was SLP support for the regimes of Iraq's Saddam Husayn  and Libya's Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi--regimes which the MB strongly  opposes--as evidence of their separate identities (Al-Ahram  international edition, 22 January).  The very ability of the SLP  to participate in the dialogue with NDP officials over MB  objections appears to confirm al-Hudaybi's claims.  Nonetheless,  the SLP's Barakat acknowledged in his mid-January statements to  Al-Ahram that "there did take place a certain merger of the  organizational structures [of the two parties] in some areas,"  saying that it is "necessary to make this clarification publicly"  and that "there is no embarrassment in that."  In addition, the  state-owned but relatively independent anti-fundamentalist weekly  Rose Al-Yusuf claimed in a detailed report on SLP internal  elections that, while the SLP leadership has attempted in some  respects to curb the MB's influence in the party, the Brothers  were increasingly taking over leadership positions in the SLP  organizational structure.  It claimed that "many" MB members  "have spread throughout the party institutions" and that 28 of  them had become members of the party's 45-member Executive Bureau  (31 May 1993).      Implications      While the government's contemplation of a reversion to the  proportional party slate system may be motivated largely by an  interest in strengthening discipline among the NDP deputies, it  may also be driven in part by a desire to drive a wedge in the  Islamic Alliance and thus limit the organization's potential  advances in the next elections.  While such a change, if it  materializes, might ultimately be extremely modest in light of  constitutional constraints, Al-Hudaybi's expressed concern  suggests that the Brotherhood itself assumes that it can only be  hurt by the change--notwithstanding indications of growing MB  domination of the SLP structure.  The MB probably also fears that  if the government is considering restoring a party slate system  for parliamentary elections, it may also be determined not to  abandon entirely the current party slate system governing local  council elections--even in the face of the expected court ruling  against the current system.      BOX      Brotherhood and SLP Leaders Exchange Bitter Words      In his 11 January article, al-Hudaybi expressed astonishment at  the reported agreement by five opposition political parties,  including the SLP, to engage in a "national dialogue" with the  ruling NDP that would exclude, at least initially, MB  representatives as well as other parties and political  organizations.  "We say clearly that these six parties do not  represent anyone but themselves," he asserted.  In a separate  box, he sharply criticized 'Adil Husayn for his 7 January account  of a meeting on the national dialogue between the SLP and the  NDP, accusing Husayn of ignoring MB interests.  Although Husayn's  account stressed the SLP's insistence on political reform, al-  Hudaybi noted accurately:  "You repeatedly said that the elections  should be held with the participation of what you called the  legal parties.  You did not say one word about the need to  recognize other political forces, notably the MB."  Claiming that  the SLP would not have reached the People's Assembly through the  elections of 1987 without its MB partners, al-Hudaybi asserted  that their joint campaign slogan--"Islam is the Solution"--was  "originally an MB slogan."     Responding to al-Hudaybi, Husayn took issue with both the  substance and tone of his criticisms, claiming that "those who do  not wish for the good fortune of the Islamic Alliance were  gladdened by what you published."  He claimed that, by signing  the joint opposition statement welcoming the national dialogue,  the MB had agreed to allow itself to be represented initially by  the SLP.  (According to its text, that statement asserted that  the dialogue "must be conducted, at least during its first phase,  among the parties and political forces through their leaders or  accredited representatives"--a point stressed by Husayn.)  Husayn  took particular objection to al-Hudaybi's claim that the slogan  "Islam is the Solution" was taken from the MB, saying "it is the  slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every age" and that the SLP  had used it prior to the formation of the Islamic Alliance.  Expressing objection to the "tone" of the article from "beginning  to end," Husayn concluded:  "The enemies of Islam are lying in  wait for its proponents and concocting plots and sedition.  We  must be wary and vigilant....I pray that God will clear up  the differences between you and me according to righteousness.  May this chapter be closed."     END BOX  (AUTHOR: BROWN.

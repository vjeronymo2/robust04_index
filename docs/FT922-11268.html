			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Right time Sir, When Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan rose to power it was because they represented political changes wanted by the majority of the people in Britain and the US. Today, the main single difference between Majorism and Thatcherism, no doubt, is that John Major seems to have realised that you cannot just turn the clocks back; you have also to come up with the contemporary solutions and ideas. John Major represents the kind of politician who gives people of the western world a glimmer of hope for the future. Let us just hope that we can say the same about the next US president.

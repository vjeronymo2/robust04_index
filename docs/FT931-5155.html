			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Danes try to break HDTV logjam EC MINISTERS may be asked to rewrite a hard-won compromise on advanced television standards as part of a Danish attempt to unblock the EC's strategy on high-definition television. Revision of existing legislation - agreed in December 1991 after 15 hours of ministerial debate - would further dilute the EC's original standards-based strategy for developing cinema-quality television in Europe. However, outline proposals being prepared by Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, have not yet gone far enough to attract the support of the UK. Britain is blocking the European Commission's much-diluted Ecu500m (Pounds 413m) HDTV funding plan on the grounds that the spending is not justified. Britain believes so-called 'Mac' technology backed by the EC will soon be overtaken by digital HDTV under development in the US. Denmark has yet to receive any hint that the UK will relax its position. The Danes want to schedule a special early meeting of telecommunications ministers, and prevent the scheduled May meeting from being overshadowed by rows on HDTV. The directive agreed in December 1991 dictates that only one intermediate standard - called D2-Mac - can be used for wide-screen television broadcasts in the EC. Wide-screen television sets must also be built to receive D2-Mac transmissions. So far, Commission proposals for funding have reflected that obligation. But Denmark's compromise would allow funding for other wide-screen standards and probably require the original directive to be broadened, to the benefit of rival intermediate technologies such as PALplus, which is being developed by a consortium of European broadcasters and manufacturers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Jun (PL) -- The 24th OAS General  Assembly continued today receiving new requests urging the  readmittance of Cuba into the OAS, from which it was removed in  1962 due to its political disagreement with the United States.    During the second day of talks in Belem, Para State,  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim reintroduced the topic  of Cuba's readmittance before the OAS meeting and reiterated the  need for "reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric  community."    During the inauguration of the 24th OAS Assembly on Monday,  outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares as well as  Brazilian President Itamar Franco recommended that Cuba's  readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of  the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude  Friday.    In his speech to the foreign ministers and representatives  of  the 34 OAS-member countries, Amorim recalled that his country  "maintains friendly relations and has significant cultural links  with Cuba."    "Despite everything, we do not believe that economic and  political isolation is the best way to contribute to a  transition that is already in the making in that country,"  Amorim added.    Baena Soares, who will conclude almost a decade as head of  the OAS on 20 June, made similar statements yesterday.    "As everyone knows, I have been inquiring whether this is  the  right moment for OAS members to review the measure adopted over  30 years ago when the Cuban Government was suspended ... the  90's are not the 60's," he stated.    According to diplomatic sources, this was the first time the  outgoing OAS head has dealt with this topic officially before a  regular OAS General Assembly.    "Cuba's removal is not in keeping with the political  revolution the world has faced in the past years," he added.    Meanwhile, President Franco supports that Cuba be readmitted  and the OAS reassess its position regarding Cuba. "Brazil  favors a harmonious dialogue among all nations, without  exceptions," he added.    In statements to the media in Belem, Bolivian Foreign  Minister Antonio Aranibar expressed his support for Cuba's  readmittance into the OAS while his Costa Rican counterpart  Fernando Naranjo proposed that the OAS establish channels of  communication with the Cuban Government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The CORD [chemical oxidation reduction  decontamination] process has successfully been used to  decontaminate a nuclear power station reactor pressure vessel  for the first time in the world. CORD, which was developed by  the power generation (KWU) division of Siemens AG, has thus  proved its efficacy in this field as well.    In addition to the reactor pressure vessel, all four  circulation loops and the reactor water purification and  residual heat removal system in the Swedish Oskarshamn 1 nuclear  power station (442 megawatts) were decontaminated in 13 days.  The test results available to date show that well over 99.6  percent of the radioactivity was flushed out, in other words  that the average decontamination factor was much greater than  200.    This process makes it possible to convert all the chemicals  involved into carbon dioxide and water without residue, even  while the decontamination work is still under way. On  completion of decontamination, therefore, the water reacquires  demineralized water quality. The dissolved cations and  radioactivity have been removed by the ion exchanger filter in  the reactor water purification system, thus requiring no  additional ion exchanger. Once the reactor pressure vessel had  been hosed out with high-pressure water, it showed only a  "residual wipe-off activity" of about 4 Bq/sq.cm. The dose rate  at the bottom of the vessel was lowered by more than 20 mSv/h to  under 0.02 mSv/h, and this extremely low radiation level now  makes it possible to carry out the relevant tests and repair  work.    Following the positive results obtained with CORD,  Siemens-KWU has been commissioned to undertake a similar job in  Finland, where the 300-cu.m primary system of the Lovlisa  nuclear power station is scheduled for decontamination in August  1994.</p>

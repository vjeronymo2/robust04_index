			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Keeper of Germany's peace - Gen Klaus Naumann, first head of the nation's armed forces since unification General Klaus Naumann, the first man to be appointed Inspector-General of a united German Bundeswehr since unification, is acutely conscious that his most immediate challenges are social and political, as much as military. Other countries, such as Britain or France, may take their armed forces for granted. Germany does not. 'Germany is living in a special situation which many people do not quite understand,' he says. 'In the 1950s, the reason for re-armament so shortly after the war, and after the misuse of military power by a totalitarian government, was the Warsaw Pact. The threat was obvious. And now it does not exist. 'You British do not have such dramatic demolitions in your history. You have always grown up with the idea that there are British forces. But there is a great hole in our history about what constitutes a 'normal' military force. 'It is not a question which interests the simple man in the street, but is rather for the intellectual upper classes. They have a rather idealised view of international politics, that you can somehow tackle all problems without using military force. 'I understand these people, but it does not correspond to the reality of this world. I would say rather that those who are unarmed, and have no defence policy, cannot pursue any policy at all.' Two months ago, at a convention in Leipzig of more than 400 of his most senior officers, Gen Naumann delivered an extraordinary speech. Parts of the German military had become infected with 'idleness, paralysis and even arrogance', he charged. There was grumbling in the ranks. Others had succumbed to 'whining and despondency'. It was intolerable, and it had to stop. If the Germany armed forces were asked tomorrow to take part in a major international peace-keeping exercise, he said, they would not be ready to do so 'from a standing start'. 'Haven't we allowed ourselves over the years to put on a bit of fat, to grow a little rusty?' he demanded. It was a devastating performance, by a normally most mild-mannered man. Gen Naumann was catapulted into the position of Inspector-General last October after only six months as a corps commander and ahead of several more senior men. He is quite unlike any caricature of a Prussian army officer one might expect from the German military. He is a slight man, soft-spoken, with rimless spectacles and alert, friendly eyes. He is obviously intelligent, and certainly not very frightening. At least, not until he spoke in Leipzig. He was the personal choice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who came to know him as his main military adviser during the two-plus-four negotiations between the two Germanies, and the four wartime allies, which led to German unification in 1990. At that time he impressed with his grasp of the issues, but also with his willingness to speak out. He was also adviser during the Gulf war, when German prevarication over the use of force against Iraq, and its inability to participate in the operation, was widely seen as very damaging to the country's international credibility. Gen Naumann made no secret of his concern to the Chancellor. Germany could not go on 'paying but not participating', he said. It clearly struck a chord. He has taken over the top position in the Bundeswehr at an acutely sensitive moment. The immediate problems are three, but behind them lies another, much more fundamental. The first is to reduce the size of the armed forces to 370,000 men, compared with 495,000 in the West German military alone before unification. The second task is to dismantle the former National People's Army of East Germany and integrate its remnants into the Bundeswehr, including some 2,000 of the officer corps. And the third is to carry out both those actions at a time of hefty budget cuts. It is perhaps no wonder that there is grumbling in the ranks. More important, however, and an issue of which Gen Naumann is acutely aware, is the loss of the Bundeswehr's sole raison d'etre: to defend Germany against the visible threat of the Warsaw Pact on its borders. Gen Naumann knows that he has to persuade not just public opinion, but also his own officers and men, that they have a vital and valid role in the post-cold war world. There is a strong neutralist tendency, albeit a minority one, within the German body politic. It is the reason why the German constitution is interpreted as forbidding the use of German troops outside the Nato area. 'Everyone seems to have the idea that the constitution forbids the use of German troops outside (the Nato) area. It is not true,' Gen Naumann says. 'But it is a political reality.' He is seeking to define a new role for the Bundeswehr which would include out-of-area operations. His speech at Leipzig was far more than a reading of the riot act to his top commanders. It was also a far-reaching attempt, from a military perspective, to redefine the strategic priorities for the German armed forces. They must no longer think in terms of confrontation, he said. The collapse of the Communist empire meant that the immediate threat of attack on Germany had been removed. But the uncertainties, and the instability in nearly-neighbouring countries to the east, had increased enormously. He believes that Russia will not succeed in destroying its arsenal of chemical and tactical nuclear weapons before the year 2000. Nobody can be sure that Russia will remain politically stable for that long. 'In this new situation, the role of the German military should not be seen as an answer to an obvious threat,' he says. 'The task which has been set politically for us soldiers is to provide an instrument for the politicians, so that they can overcome the risks to the external security of the country, and prevent or limit any external conflicts.' Gen Naumann sees the Bundeswehr undertaking peace-keeping and peace-making operations. He is convinced that peace can only be restored if peace-making forces carry an adequate threat of force. Within Nato, he is involved in the controversial debate over strengthening the 'European pillar' of the alliance. He believes that not only Russia, but the US too, will be increasingly concerned with domestic issues in the coming years, and Europeans must take on a greater burden within Nato. 'The US as an ally and powerful economic partner will continue to find it easy to influence Europe as a friend, but no longer with such a decisive influence,' he says. Nato has a transitional strategy but still has to work out a lasting strategy, he says. That means developing a balanced relationship with the European Community and the Western European Union, the forum within which the EC members of Nato are seeking to develop a separate European defence identity. The WEU, he says, should remain a bridge between Nato and the EC (as the British would like to see it). But it should also provide Europe with the means to act militarily if the US, or Canada, are not ready to do so. Hence the need to allocate forces at its disposal, headed by the Franco-German idea of a Euro-corps, whose first purpose will be to serve the WEU, and only secondarily to serve Nato. That is a very sensitive point, above all for the US. Gen Naumann insists there should be no conflict. 'Everything we do should be directed to strengthening the European effort, complementary to Nato and compatible with Nato. We don't want to build any separate armed forces.' He is equally adamant on the question of setting up a new German national military command structure, in the unified and now sovereign Germany. It is a reorganisation which may even do away with his own title of Inspector-General and make him a 'Chief of Defence Staff' like his Nato colleagues. The process, he says, will leave Germany still totally integrated in the Nato command structure. 'The name is not important,' he says. 'It is just like changing the label on a bottle of wine. The contents will remain the same.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1939 Born in Munich. 1958 Joined Bundeswehr. 1981 Colonel, on staff of German military representative, Nato military      committee, Brussels. 1984 Brigade commander, armoured infantry brigade, Ellwangen. 1986 Brigadier, department head, force planning, general staff, Ministry      of Defence. 1988 Major-General, head of defence policy and operations staff,      Ministry of Defence. 1990 Adviser in two-plus-four negotiations before German      unification.

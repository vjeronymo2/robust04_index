			<p>BFN     [Text] They do not give up. After lending their party's  name to the maharajah hunter [Fernando Collor de Mello] -- who  managed to reach the presidency in 1990 only to be impeached two  years later on charges of deep involvement in corruption --  yesterday, 49 delegates of the PRN [National Reconstruction  Party] nominated businessman Walter Carlos Gomes Queiroz as PRN  candidate for replacing President Itamar Franco.    Speaking at the end of the convention, Gomes Queiroz said:  "I  am going to win the election." He did not appear, however,  anywhere near as obstinate as his predecessor, who was  conspicuously absent at the convention. PRN President Daniel  Tourinho said: "President Fernando Collor continues to remain in  seclusion, but he will participate in all of our rallies."    Gomes Queiroz employs 100 workers at his sunglass factory in  Salvador, Bahia State. He is 38 years old, just as Fernando  Collor was when he began his electoral campaign in 1989. PRN  National Secretary Rivalinton Veloso da Silva said that Gomes  Queiroz fits the profile obtained in a survey of voters: "a  middle-aged man, clean, who is not a professional politician."</p>

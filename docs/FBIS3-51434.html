The firm Paraguayan position even forced the presidents to  meet again yesterday afternoon after which the respective  economy ministers were instructed to meet next April, in a place  yet to be determined, to express each country's commitment to  comply with the treaty's chapter on coordination of the economic  policies.    Only under these conditions will Paraguay agree to continue  negotiating the common external tariff to establish a customs  union as of 1 January 1995.    In principle there is an agreement to reach a common  external  tariff within the following guidelines: the tariffs of 80  percent of products agreed upon by the country members will  converge according to the technical criteria adopted by the  negotiators. That is, they will reach a common external tariff.    A list of sensitive products will be drawn up immediately.  These products will be treated on an exceptional (that is,  protectionist) basis until the year 2001. Very sensitive  products will be protected until the year 2006. Within these  latter products, which have yet not been totally specified,  Paraguay managed to obtain zero import tariffs for raw materials  or inputs for its national industrial production.    The country members can negotiate the list of sensitive  products until April, and the very sensitive products until 30  June 1994.    In his speech, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said that  Paraguay understands that the integration of Mercosur should  develop through symmetrical and simultaneous progress in all  market areas. The establishment of the common external tariff,  he added, demands a coordination of macroeconomic policies and  the harmonization of general and specific laws. This must be  implemented by the country members together if the much desired  common market is to be attained.    "This is why it is preferable to discuss the situation in  the  present and not on 31 December 1994 if we want to be efficient  administrators of the Treaty of Asuncion," he said.    "Paraguay, as it has always been, is currently faithful to  its integrationist vocation and ratifies its commitment to  achieve a common market. Our four countries must act jointly and  with solidarity, making a simultaneous and balanced effort to  overcome the basic problems we just referred to," the Paraguayan  president said.    The Paraguayan president also pointed out the need "to  accept  the reality and make the political decision of establishing  reasonable deadlines to ensure that the final objective be  reached in harmony with the adjustment process of the economies  that will be integrated."    Wasmosy added that "it is also worthwhile to reflect on the  possibility of creating a solidarity program in favor of the  countries with less developed economies to stimulate the  redistribution of resources in the region and to minimize the  negative aspects that may come about with the adjustments that  will be made to form the common market."    This solidarity, he said, could consist of technological and  financial support to allow the industrial structures of the less  developed economies to improve their level of efficiency and  competitiveness which, without doubt, will benefit the community  interests. He also asked for special treatment within the  common external tariff framework for a greater amount of  products sensitive for the less developed economies.    President Juan Carlos Wasmosy talked with the media and said  he left the meeting very satisfied with the talks held with the  presidents in Colonia. He said they spoke sincerely and that  between now and 1 June it will be known with certainty whether  Mercosur will work as a common market. Such is the period of  time Paraguay asked for so that the country members could define  and assume their commitment to make adjustments within their  respective economies.</p>

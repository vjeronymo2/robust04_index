			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WORK-FURLOUGH PROPOSAL DENIED;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS REJECT A PLAN TO CONVERT A RETIREMENT HOTEL INTO AN  ALTERNATE JAIL FACILITY, CITING CONCERN FOR THE FATE OF THE HOME'S 80 ELDERLY  RESIDENTS.  </P> <P> The City Planning Commission on Thursday rejected a proposal for a prisoners'  work-furlough residence in Studio City -- but not until commission President  William G. Luddy strongly condemned what he termed "a Willie Horton staff  report" for pandering to neighbors' fears.  </P> <P> Luddy also criticized the program's sponsors for failing to address parking  and, more important, the fate of 80 elderly residents who would be displaced by  conversion of their boarding house into an alternate jail facility.  </P> <P> When an owner of the home said residents could choose to remain there once it  becomes a work-furlough facility, Luddy and his colleagues expressed disbelief  and called for a vote.  </P> <P> "A Willie Horton report; a Frankenstein proposal," Luddy said after the  commission unanimously denied the program a conditional use permit.  </P> <P> His reference to Willie Horton recalled the controversial political ads of  President George Bush's campaign, which tried to discredit opponent Michael  Dukakis by linking him to a state prison furlough program approved prior to his  election as Massachusetts governor. Horton, a black convicted murderer, raped a  white woman after escaping from a weekend furlough.  </P> <P> Luddy said later he characterized the work-furlough proposal itself as  "Frankenstein" because it appeared to be a "pieced-together monster," hastily  conceived to bail out a failing board-and-care home.  </P> <P> Only 80 of the home's 146 beds are filled, and the facility is losing $10,000 a  month, its operator, Donald Gormly, said.  </P> <P> The rejected plan called for changing the Ventura Retirement Villa, at 11201  Ventura Blvd., into a residence for nonviolent lawbreakers. Participants, most  of them convicted on drunk-driving charges, would have been allowed to continue  working at their own jobs while serving their jail sentences.  </P> <P> No one with a history of violence would have been eligible, said Carl E.  Curtis, director of Los Angeles County's work-furlough program.  </P> <P> The facility, part of an effort to ease jail overcrowding, would have been the  second of its kind in the county.  </P> <P> During Thursday's meeting at the Van Nuys Woman's Club, Curtis testified that  he was dismayed by hearing examiner Richard M. Takase's repeated use of the  word convict in his staff report.  </P> <P> Curtis said the word convict connotes "a dangerous, predatory felon," and was  an unfair description of his program's participants.  </P> <P> He also said Takase exaggerated the program's dangers by describing how the  drunk drivers -- denied the use of their driver's licenses -- would stand in  the same lines as the public while waiting for city buses.  </P> <P> Most of the 16 people who testified Thursday opposed the plan, many of them  elderly, longtime residents of the neighborhood. One Chiquita Street mother,  Julie Boyd, said she considered drunk drivers dangerous because she was once  involved in a head-on crash with one and might have been killed if not for her  seat belt.  </P> <P> After the public testimony, Luddy called Takase's report outrageous and  unprofessional, and said it "goes off into scare tactics."  </P> <P> Takase said later that he was surprised by Luddy's comments and that "I was  certainly not kowtowing to any crowd."  </P> <P> He said the criteria for granting a conditional use permit included "finding  that the location will be desirable to the public convenience or welfare," so  he was obligated to note the program's lack of popularity.  </P> <P> His report was based on an Aug. 20 hearing.  </P></p>

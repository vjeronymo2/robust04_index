			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Wang Yangzu, deputy  director of the State Bureau of Environmental Protection, said  that the Chinese Government will take measures to prevent  hazardous waste materials from being shipped from overseas into  its territory.    Wang expressed the Chinese Government's stance against  importing wastes at a conference in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu  Province, Saturday [11 June] to commend Nanjing port for its  discovery and return of harmful chemical wastes to Republic of  Korea.    On September 25, 1993, two Chinese corporations and some  companies of the Republic of Korea had 1,288 tons of harmful  chemical wastes shipped to Nanjing port under the label "other  fuel oil".    The matter caught the attention of the State Council and  through joint efforts of departments involved, on March 5, the  wastes were all returned to the port of origin abroad.    Experts noted that in recent years, the cases of  transnational transferring of harmful wastes and rubbish were on  the increase.    The State Bureau of Environmental Protection and General  Administration of Customs are now closely cooperating to prevent  pollutants from abroad from being shipped into China.    China is now formulating a law governing solid waste  pollution.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wimpey Wimpey's dividend decision was always going to be one of the closest calls of the current reporting season. In the end, shareholders can probably thank Wessex Water for the maintained payout, though the disposal of Wimpey's waste management business for what now looks like a fancy price was just one element of last year's extensive balance sheet repairs. In rejecting a dividend cut, the board may also have been conscious of the commercial advantages to be gained from the contrast with weaker competitors. For all the plaudits rightly heaped on chief executive Joe Dwyer, it would not do to swallow the claim that Wimpey has ridden the current recession without scars. There are certainly scratches. A mere 7 per cent fall in group net assets, for instance, is undeniably impressive given the apparent thoroughness of the provisions, but the reduction would have been greater without the handy Pounds 45m revaluation surplus on group owned and used properties. There will also be a Pounds 16m gap in this year's profits from businesses which have been sold. More pertinent for investors is how Wimpey exploits its newly restored financial health to recapture the art of earnings growth. Housebuilding hardly looks exciting for a volume player these days, a view implicit in Wimpey's indication that this activity should be self-financing. Contracting may labour under a Channel Tunnel cloud for a couple of years, while the scope for adding to minerals is not limitless. At 147p the shares are underpinned by a 9.5 per cent yield. Wimpey will have to prove that resumed dividend growth is not just a distant dream before they go much higher.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SPEAK, MEMORY BY VLADIMIR NABOKOV (VINTAGE: $9.95,  ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Nabokov eschews the "and then I wrote" cliches of conventional literary  autobiographies and presents a series of elegant vignettes, most of them from  his luxurious childhood in Imperial Russia. (He discusses the creation of only  one book in detail: an embarrassing collection of adolescent poems in Russian.)  Nabokov downplays the dramatic events in his life -- his flight to Germany  after the Revolution, his often penniless existence as an emigre in Berlin and  Paris, his escape to America during World War II -- but he re-creates the  pleasures of aristocratic life under the czars in exquisite detail. He  originally wrote "Speak, Memory" in English, translated it into Russian then  re-translated it into English, expanding and polishing the text each time,  until the sentences became as delicately filigreed as the wings of the  butterflies he passionately collected.  </P></p>

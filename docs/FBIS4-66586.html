			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Imad Darwish] </F>   [Text] With the rising role of the private sector in  development, an increase in the hiring of Saudi workers is  inevitable, in line with the role assigned to the private sector  in the scheme of the gross national product. It is a strategic  goal restated by the fifth and sixth development plans. And yet  has this strategic goal been achieved as it should be in the  private sector? Governed by considerations of achieving balance  between the greatest possible return, and lowest possible cost,  and it is seen that foreign labor is cheaper, making it possible  to achieve the desired return. [sentence as published] So, what  are the ways of increasing Saudization in the private sector?  How can trained Saudi labor be provided to meet businessmen's  requirements?    From Mr. Salih al-Tu'aymi, secretary general of the Riyadh  Chamber of Commerce, who polled businessmen and relevant  officials in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor  and Social Affairs, we find that there are three basic  indicators. These are: the continuation by the private sector to  meet its labor needs from sources that provide the greatest  possible profit, which is the labor that offers lower wages and  high qualifications. The other view is that the private sector  should be directed to fill its labor needs from the local  market, in order to provide more economic stability, to raise  the rate of working capital formation, and the participation of  the private sector in developing the abilities of Saudi Arabia's  human resources by giving them the chance to learn necessary  skills. The third view involves the preparation of a timetable  overseeing the readiness of the local labor market to assess how  well it is meeting the needs of the private sector. It views the  private sector as the most important sector for absorbing  civilian labor in the Kingdom. The timetable would set out  deadlines for all quarters affected by this issue, in both the  private sector and government agencies.  <H5>  National Demand </H5>   Al-Tu'aymi restated the goals of the successive five-year  development plans in terms of human resource development--the  Saudization of jobs by finding work for every able citizen, by  which palpable successes may be achieved in the government  sectors and some private sector institutions. The state has  understood since the beginning of the development process that,  while the importation of expatriate labor brings some economic  benefits, the Saudization of available positions is a mandatory  national demand that must be fulfilled, working with the  limitation that there are not an abundance of qualified national  workers.    The balance is one of costs and benefits, and the  interrelation of economic, social, and political factors in  defining the nature of the labor problem in the Saudi economy.  That is, the state desires action larger than the capacity of  the local market to supply the local needs, so it is necessary  to bring in tens of thousands of expatriate workers to fill the  gap between developmental needs for manpower and local manpower  supply. This has imposed a delicate balance of the benefits  obtainable through the use of national versus expatriate labor,  defining the cost involved in hiring, and studying the needed  profitability on the part of government institutions and the  national economy. The determination of benefits and  profitability is of costs at the private company level, for both  local and imported labor. The decision to employ either one in  an activity may be positive or negative, in the sense that a  purely commercial measure as a basis of computing this factor is  inaccurate if it does not take sufficiently into consideration  the indirect effects of making a hiring decision. A  businessman anticipates revenue from hiring a worker. The  accounting produces a result in favor of expatriate labor, with  the hiring company getting a profitability it would be difficult  to achieve using local labor, given the open market, low customs  fees, and the low wage level acceptable to imported workers,  compared with what a national worker would accept. The use of  imported labor is in line with company needs (profession,  expertise, qualifications) and is not contracted unless the  needed skills are offered. This leads to the expatriate worker  being assimilated directly into the institutional activity.  There is no training or familiarization period. In addition, an  expatriate employee will accept a job any place in the Kingdom;  this is not the case with a native employee, who prefers settled  work. There is also a relative weakness in native workers' job  stability: he is always looking for an opportunity for a pay  raise, promotion, and better working conditions. And expatriate  laborer can be obtained in the numbers and types needed for  company activity more quickly than national labor can be. This  is because trained labor is available whenever it is sought.    Among the other factors that turned up in the Riyadh  Chamber's questionnaire were the ease of getting rid of  expatriate labor, should there be a drop in their level of  performance, and the fact that the proprieter must pay  installments of his share of the Saudi workers' social  insurance. Furthermore, a Saudi worker may bother him during the  whole workday, leaving the promotion process up to the private  business owner.  <H5>  National Benefits </H5>   In spite of these factors, the hiring of Saudi workers  brings  national benefits that exceed the cost of employing them, and  which make them more economically profitable than hiring  expatriate workers. One of these points is stability in economic  activity, as these activities are based on workers who are not  affected by changes in the Kingdom's labor market due to  developments occurring in the home countries of expatriate  workers, such as bans or limits on the movement of workers, or  the existence of more attractive job opportunities for them.    By hiring expatriate workers, the Saudi economy bears  indirect burdens, such as the financial remittances that these  workers send back to their countries, with the volume of these  remittances corresponding to the difference between the income  of these workers and their consumption, which usually is in line  with their level of consumption in their home countries. This  situation creates an increase in the Saudi riyal supply versus  free currencies. This may affect the exchange rate between the  riyal and those currencies, and of course this corresponds to  the extent of the drain on the Saudi economy with the expansion  in the hiring of expatriate labor. As to the growth in use of  national labor, the development benefits within the Saudi  economy will increase in a self-sustaining way, with the capital  accumulation it brings.    The increase in importing expatriate labor leads to Saudi  workers being deprived of the chance to learn the technical  skills necessary to the continued expansion of the development  process, as the national economy is deprived of the expertise  that is compounded in the course of this process, when the  expatriate workers return home.    Improving the financial circumstances of Saudi consumers  permits them to reduce a better part of the course of the  national economy's financial outflows, and its stability.    [Hiring Saudis] safeguards the values, customs, and  traditions of Saudi society that stem from Islamic law, while  expatriate workers come from many diverse--and  non-Arab--sources.  <H5>  Strategy of Replacement </H5>   The fifth development plan emphasized the replacement of  expatriate labor with Saudi labor to an extent greater than  finding new job opportunities; the plan aimed to orient 220,400  workers with the goal of replacement, representing 50.8 percent  of total Saudi labor with the chance of increasing it over the  years covered by the plan, versus 213,500 employed workers with  new job opportunities, representing 49.2 percent of the same  total. The plan included the orienting of a higher percentage of  new Saudi workers, destined for clerical affairs; the campaign  of target workers in this activity reached 119,300 workers, with  a 27.5 percent of the total target increase in workers in the  plan's time period, against a goal of orienting 59.1 percent of  the workers in various productive sectors, with 13.6 percent of  this increase. The plan aimed at reducing agricultural labor by  25.1 percent, representing 5.5 percent of total workers  employed, despite the increased importance of agricultural  activity and its role in driving the development process, both  in terms of other productive sectors and of the national  economy. Figures showed a 13.9 percent reduction in technical  and vocational labor in the total labor picture. This figure  does not include the number of Saudis expected to be hired out  of technical, training, and vocational institutes, though one  may remark here that university graduates represent 12 percent  of labor targeted for increase over the years covered by the  plan, as against 15.7 percent of workers pre-elementary level  and 22.1 percent of workers with certificates of completion of  the elementary level only. It may be noted that the five-year  plan's estimates could result from a base anticipation of  218,700 workers entering the private sector, who left schools  the intermediate level, representing 50.4 percent of total  targeted labor, with regard to the schools run by the Ministry  of Education and the General Directorate for Women's Education.    Addressing the size of the problem, we must point out the  inactive surplus of workers in the Kingdom. These workers  represent a demand for work in government agencies and the  private sector. The five-year plan anticipated an increase of  334,900 Saudi workers over the five years, of which 220,400  would replace expatriate workers, who number 173,500, a net  increase over the work force. That is an average level of  86,700, 41,000, amd 42,700 workers respectively, of which the  private sector would absorb 47,000 in the period 1988-1991, at  an annual average of 18,500. This would be the annual average  surplus of Saudi labor, 68,300 workers, with government agencies  absorbing an average of 8,300 workers per year.    According to the study made by the Riyadh Chamber of  Commerce  and Industry, an average of 12,000 workers annually get jobs in  the private sector through employment offices. This is an  average annual increase in new private firms, with an annual  average labor surplus of 48,000. This does not generally mean a  problem for the Saudi economy, given the private job  opportunities available to some, who prefer voluntary  unemployment, and others, who work in non-civilian sectors.  <H5>  Linking Loans to Saudization </H5>   To encourage the private sector to hire Saudis, Dr. Sayyid  Fathi al-Khuli, Professor of Economics at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  University, in a study of the private sector's actual manpower  needs, emphasized that vocational and technical training  institutes should graduate the kinds of workers the private  sector actually needs. He also proposed linking the government's  agricultural and industrial loans to the private sector to an  actual commitment on the part of the borrowers to have no less  than 10-percent Saudi employees. And this percentage would  gradually rise. He supported the preparation of a field study to  find the reasons for Saudi youth's aversion to private sector  work, and the real reasons for the private sector's aversion to  hiring Saudi workers; and in the light of these studies,  appropriate solutions would be found.    Prof. Ibrahim Kamal, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in  al-Ta'if, is of the opinion that Saudi youth are responsible and  capable of work in various trades. In recent years, he said,  numerous classes have graduated from the training centers and  industrial institutes. They have been trained in the most modern  systems and methods. This highlighted the role of the Council of  Saudi Chambers of Commerce in perceiving the private sector's  actual needs for Saudi labor, and in organizing training  courses, both in terms of direct hiring and prior training based  on studies of the labor market's actual need.  <H5>  Rise in Local Workers </H5>   Turning to the subject of the extent of the private sector's  dependence on imported labor, the economic study prepared by the  Riyadh Chamber of Commerce made it clear that the number of  Saudi workers in the private sector would not decrease over  seven consecutive years. Expatriate labor, on the other hand,  would decline, meaning an increase in Saudi labor in the private  sector, from 16 percent in 1985 to 17.8 percent in 1989.    This increase has kept mounting in subequent years with the  growing role of the private sector in development, and the  government's increased attention--through government agencies  and the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce--to supplying and  training Saudi workers.  <H5>  Detailed Calculations </H5>   The Riyadh Chamber of Commerce study recommended that more  attention be given to manpower research, by continuing to  conduct regular censuses; detailed calculations, such as of  workers in various activities; and their distribution in terms  of job and nationality. It also recommended behavior studies in  the labor market to find positive and negative aspects and deal  with them; it recommended a study of habits and traditions that  belittle the worth of manual labor, and an attempt to inculcate  new concepts in our youth to accentuate the worth of manual  labor in service to the nation.  <H5>  Summary </H5>   A sampling of opinions among the economists and field  studies  on ways of promoting Saudization led us to an important fact,  which is that channels must be created for ongoing liaison  between the private sector and Saudi manpower, through the  Kingdom's chambers of commerce, to determine the actual needs of  the national sector; plus the organization of training courses  in line with market needs, and training workers for management;  and directing youth to appropriate positions in line with actual  needs. They also highlighted the importance of studying the  labor market and its movements, watching for negative aspects  from time to time; studying jobs to which Saudi youth have an  aversion, in order to find solutions; finding ways to encourage  the private sector to hire Saudis, such as linking loans to the  degree to which private firms Saudize; and granting incentives  in the form of reduced customs fees, charity, and income taxes  for companies that achieve high degrees of Saudization. All of  this must be achieved in the context of an integrated strategy  with the specific goal of Saudization and the methods needed to  meet this goal.</p>

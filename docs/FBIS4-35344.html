			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Unionist Alliance Party has stated that  the house of brother Muhammad Abduh Nu'man, the founder of the  party, has been stormed and searched in Sanaa. Some of his  possessions were looted. The statement said this must be  considered as the beginning of a unique type of terrorism,  oppression, and arbitrariness.    In an official statement issued by its secretariat general,  and distributed in Aden yesterday, the Yemeni Unionist Alliance  Party said that it was not really concerned about television  interviews with some of its members or the issuing of statements  which did not come from its leadership. It stressed that the  party ranks everywhere were first for stopping the war and then  forming a modern union based on the pledge and accord document.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Regional developments  have shown the soundness and precision of the Syrian position  toward the Middle East peace process. Syria believes that the  desired peace can only be achieved within the context of  international legitimacy and the Arab unity of ranks. Likewise,  Syria believes that this peace must ensure the restoration of  all Arab territorial and political rights. There should be  neither abandonment of any such rights, nor bargaining over any  such rights.    AL-BA'TH adds: These principles could have created an  international pressure that might have made the Zionist entity  abandon its provocative and intransigent positions. Such  pressure could also have created the propitious objective  circumstances needed to achieve just and comprehensive peace.  However, these principles have been immensely undermined by the  PLO's decision to depart from Arab consensus and jump to deals  with Israel, believing that this unilateral approach, which was  manifested in the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho accord, would  help it make some gains. However, what has happened is quite  the opposite. For, the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have  confirmed that it is only Israel which emerged as the winner.  The Oslo agreement has begun to collapse under Zionist  pressures. Even the flawed and fragile autonomy accord appears  to be rejected by the Israelis.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: These  fast-breaking regional developments have revealed the cards of  all parties to the peace process. They have shown that any  attempts to violate the principles of peace is doomed to  failure, and that any such attempts will hurt the Arabs'  pan-Arab interests. All this highlights Syria's redemptive role  in this crucial phase of the Arab nation's history, and renders  the imminent Geneva summit, due to be held between Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, an important opportunity for  ending the stalemate plaguing the peace process.    For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the world's  hopes for the success of the Syrian-U.S. summit due to be held  in Geneva in mid-January, as well as the disappointment caused  by the consequences of the Oslo agreement.    TISHRIN says: Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer  has inaugurated a new neighborhood in the Qatzrin settlement in  the occupied Syrian Golan. The Israeli minister pledged to work  to promote and expand Zionist settlements in the Golan,  something which shows that this provocative act is part of  efforts to scuttle the peace process, sabotage the U.S. peace  initiative, thwart the al-Asad-Clinton summit in advance, and  present to the United States and the world community a fait  accompli.    TISHRIN adds: Since the signing of the Oslo accord, Israel  has attempted to delude the world in general and the United  States in particular into believing that peace has been realized  in the region, that the Palestine question has been resolved,  and that peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can  wait. Likewise, it has striven to marginalize Syria's role,  obscure the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and  promote separate deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, instead  of comprehensive peace.    TISHRIN goes on to say: However, deception was short-lived.  For Secretary of State Christopher has commended Syria's  primary role in the peace process and arranged a summit between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since the news of the summit  was announced, the Israelis have been casting doubts on its  usefulness and leaking deceptive reports on an alleged Syria  role in this or that incident. In the aftermath of the failure  of their maneuvers in this regard, they have initiated a  provocation that has taken the form of encouraging Zionist  settlers to settle in the Golan and pledging aid to expand the  existing settlements in the hope of confusing the Clinton  Administration.    TISHRIN indicates that the entire world is fully aware that  Middle East peace cannot be achieved in the absence of an  effective Syrian involvement, and that peace with Syria is  contingent upon the restoration of all occupied Golan territory,  and the dismantlement of settlements there.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian  territory, and will remain so regardless of how many settlements  Israel builds there. Moreover, Syria will not abandon a single  inch of Golan territory. Certainly, there will be neither a  regional peace, nor a peace with Syria unless all Golan  territory is returned to its rightful owners.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the Oslo agreement, which  was concluded more than four months ago, saying that it has  failed to produce any tangible results. The regional  developments which have unfolded since the signing of the accord  have shown that the accord has failed to bring peace to the  Palestinian people or the region, the paper argues. Worse  still, by way of this accord, Israel has managed to dissociate  the PLO from the Palestinian people and its pan-Arab depth and  surroundings, namely, Syria and other frontline Arab states.  This accord has, indeed, legimitized Israel's aggression and  occupation. The alleged differences being promoted on the  provisions of the Oslo deal, the interpretations and  implementation of this deal, and the intransigent PLO and  Israeli stands are all parts of a campaign of contrived  maneuvering and deception designed to promote the credibility of  both Israel and the PLO with their constituencies after the deal  has failed to bring the region closer to peace.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Under all circumstances, the PLO looks like  the only loser. As for the Palestinian people and Arabs, they  are also big losers in all this. This is because the Oslo  agreement consecrates the final liquidation of the Palestine  question and replaces the Palestinian people's aspirations, as  well as their legitimate right to build an independent state on  Palestinian national soil, with control over a municipality  whose borders will remain confined to the area of Gaza and  Jericho.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH notes the approach of  Rabin, who is humiliating the PLO and its leaders by reiterating  the intransigent Israeli positions with regard to control over  border crossings and security and negotiations on Israeli terms.  If Israeli terms and positions are not accepted by the PLO, his  government is not in a hurry to conclude an agreement with it,  as Rabin put it. All this shows the futility of unilateral  deals, as well as their failure to bring just and comprehensive  peace, which must result in complete Israeli withdrawal on all  fronts.</p>

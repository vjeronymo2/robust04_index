			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Labour confusion on ERM deepens DISARRAY within the Labour party over UK membership of the European exchange rate mechanism deepened yesterday as Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called for the opposition to support a currency realignment. Mr Blunkett's words came the day after Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary, launched a sharp attack on the Maastricht treaty and on the deflationary nature of the ERM. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett welcomed the measures the party had already outlined, but added: 'The benefits which were gained 25 years ago when belatedly sterling was realigned, could provide the basis for our economic recovery today.' Although Mr Blunkett's words are more cautious than the statement from Mr Gould, they intensify pressure on the party leadership to ensure that there is a full and open debate on the stance it should take over the impact on the domestic economy of the high interest rates needed to support the pound in the ERM. 'If interest rates are not to rise with further damage to industry and millions of families with mortgages, then realignment within the ERM would appear to be a necessity,' Mr Blunkett said last night. He argued that a comprehensive realignment was vital for the survival of manufacturing, but did not say whether he thought the UK should act unilaterally if there were not enough support for a general realignment. Mr Gould yesterday refused to rule out resigning from the shadow cabinet over Europe. 'That is, I suppose, in theory always open to any member of the shadow cabinet on any issue,' he said on BBC breakfast news when asked about Maastricht. He added, however: 'I have no reason to suppose that when the shadow cabinet reaches a decision it won't be one I cannot support.' He went on to make clear that he 'did not think for a moment' that there was a damaging split in Labour's leadership.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Oversize and out of town: Concern over the impact of shopping centres The government must face up to the impact that big new out of town shopping centres have on established retail locations, warns a report commissioned by the Department of the Environment. The document draws attention to the plight of many town and city centres, declining against a background of recession and fierce competition from out of town rivals. Produced by the Oxford Institute of Retail Management and the Building Design Partnership, a firm of planners and architects, it also stresses the need for more research into the social, environmental and trade implications of the big new retail centres spawned by the spending boom of the 1980s. The report is part of a DoE review of the government's retail planning guidance to local authorities issued four years ago. A consultation paper on new guidelines will be issued in the summer. Mr Ross Davis, institute director, said a survey of retailers by the Oxford Retail Group, a think-tank of 14 big retailers, developers, estate agents and funding institutions, showed strong concern that present guidelines tended, partly through lack of clarity, to encourage out of town retailing. 'Their view was that the swing of the pendulum had gone too far,' he said. The Oxford Retail Group, of which he is secretary, believes the DoE is coming round to that view, he said. Concern is directed particularly at the new 'regional' out of town shopping centres; the 'big four', all opened since the mid-1980s, are the MetroCentre in Gateshead, Meadowhall near Sheffield, Merry Hill, west of Birmingham, and Lakeside, Essex. Research by Boots, one of the think-tank's members, indicates such centres are significantly harming the performance of its nearby stores. Its shops near Lakeside have suffered a drop in trade almost exactly equal to that recorded by the Boots store in the new centre, opened in late 1990. In Tyneside, Boots blames the impact of the MetroCentre, where it also trades, for depressing the performance of its large branch in Newcastle's Eldon Square, the MetroCentre's biggest rival. Of Boots' 42 largest UK stores, Newcastle ranked fortieth in terms of accumulated real sales growth in the four years from 1986, when the MetroCentre's first phase opened. 'The impact of the MetroCentre was not as great as first feared but it has been sustained,' said Mr David Stathers, estates director for Boots the Chemist. 'These centres can only survive by cannibalising others.' Mr Stathers said Boots was monitoring its Eldon Square store's 'quite worrying' relative lack of growth. Boots was also concerned, he said, at the implications for centres such as Newcastle of the pull exercised by out of town complexes on more affluent shoppers. Researchers at the institute, part of Templeton College, the university's management studies centre, have monitored since 1986 the MetroCentre, Europe's largest out of town shopping and leisure complex, which has three miles of malls and as much retail space as Romford or Oxford. As it was the first of the 'big four' to open and has been trading at its 2.2m sq ft size for two years, they believe it offers clues to such centres' performance and impact generally. 'It has been very successful  - and it has some problems,' said retail research fellow Elizabeth Howard. Last year the MetroCentre attracted 26m visitors; turnover of its 340 shops, 35 trading barrows and leisure facilities was Pounds 550m. Mr John Bryson, MetroCentre manager, said its trade - 84 per cent of which comes from people living within 30 minutes' road travelling distance - reflected its success in tapping 'suppressed consumer demand'. Mrs Howard said it had clearly generated consumer enthusiasm. But, she said, its impact on older retail centres was not being faced up to. Within the MetroCentre, there is also divergence between the performance of the big multiples, with well located units, and that of many small traders whose little shops are in fringe areas. While the MetroCentre's managers reported a record Christmas for visitors, many small traders were disappointed and some have pulled out. Discontent is strongest in the 'themed' Mediterranean Village. 'It's pretty desolate; we aren't getting the trade going past the door,' said Mr Howard Robson, joint proprietor of children's wear shop Peek a Boo, near six empty units. 'The rents are too high. People can't pay them.' Mr Martin Glendavison, of Chestertons, letting agent for the MetroCentre's owner, the Church Commissioners, confirms that while trade has been very good for those in the main malls, small traders say life has been 'extremely tough'. He said: 'We're prepared to be more flexible in the terms we offer to tenants in the Mediterranean Village.' The ending in August of the rates-free Enterprise Zone and the imposition of high uniform business rates is another headache for small traders. Mr Bryson said there was a high percentage failure rate among the MetroCentre's small traders; he blamed it on inexperience and choice of product lines. But the institute believes it indicates more general problems for small traders in such centres. The MetroCentre, suggests Mrs Howard, is too big. 'It just grew like Topsy.'</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Jaguar pulls out of GKN deal: Telford pressings plant faces closure as production moves to Ford's Halewood factory JAGUAR, Ford's lossmaking luxury cars subsidiary, said yesterday it was abandoning the joint venture it set up with GKN, the automotive components group, to supply body pressings. The move, involving the transfer of production to the Ford Halewood stamping plant in Liverpool, is expected to lead to the closure of Venture Pressings, the Telford-based company set up by the two groups at a cost of Pounds 40m in 1988 and which employs about 200 people. Mr Keith Chambers, director of Venture Pressings, said: 'The decision is a serious blow. As Jaguar is VPL's sole customer it will ultimately lead to the closure of the plant.' There is a possibility that some employees could be offered jobs at other GKN group plants in the immediate area and which together employ about 2,000 people. However, all parties involved ruled out any prospect of finding alternative work for the plant itself. Jaguar said the economic benefits of going to Halewood, where Ford has excess capacity in its pressings plant, were 'overwhelming'. Its parent, Ford, is urgently concerned to find every means possible of reducing costs at Jaguar, which has made losses totalling more than Pounds 500m over the past 4 1/2 years. However, Ford made clear last night that the decision did not imply any shortcomings in the efficiency or productivity of the Telford venture, which has established an industry reputation as a model plant, with good industrial relations, a flexible workforce and state-of-the-art equipment. GKN Sankey, Jaguar's joint-venture partner at Venture Pressings, said it was dismayed by the decision. However, under the provisions of the shareholders' agreement in the 50-50 joint venture, GKN itself is protected from any financial losses arising from closure. The venture was set up following Jaguar's privatisation but before its purchase by Ford. It has the capacity to produce pressings for 50,000 Jaguars a year but has been operating at only a little over half this level as a result of the worldwide recession in luxury car markets. Ford's Halewood pressings facility, now used for Escort body pressings, is also running below capacity. Halewood is believed capable of meeting the demands of both makes in the future. The potential for expansion is understood to be such that Halewood would also be capable of providing pressings for the XJ200, the smaller car Jaguar intends to produce from 1998 and which is expected to lift its total output to more than 100,000 units a year. A final decision on whether to produce the XJ200 in the UK or North America is expected in about a year's time.</p>

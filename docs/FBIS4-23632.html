			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigeria Police has offered a cash reward of  50,000 naira for anyone who offers information that will lead to  the arrest of Chief M.K.O. Abiola. The police declared Chief  Abiola wanted on Saturday [11 June] and asked anyone with  information about his whereabouts to give such information to  the nearest police station or security agency.    A statement by the police in Lagos said that it has been  established that the activities of Chief Abiola and his clique  transcended the quest for the actualization of the 12 June  phenomenon. The police stated that the activities included well  laid down plans to cause public disorder, breakdown of law and  order, and forceful overthrow of the Federal Military  Government. It added that their activities had enjoyed the tacit  support of linkages of some foreign missions in Lagos. The  police said all efforts made to invite Chief M.K.O. Abiola to  clarify issues on current investigations had failed. It also  said that investigations are being conducted in the premises of  some media houses suspected to be storing some arms as part of a  grand design to force a change of government.</p>

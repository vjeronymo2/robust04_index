			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL CLEAN AIR BILL STANDARDS  </P> <P> Pardon us if we don't share David Broder's celebration of the Senate's passage  of a new clean air bill ("Clean Air Survives the Deal-Breakers," Op-Ed Page,  April 11).  </P> <P> While a milestone for the rest of the nation, the Senate bill does little for  California -- we're way ahead of the Senate and everybody else.  </P> <P> In some ways, it is even weaker than the present law. Most disappointing, the  bill continues to absolve the federal government from any responsibility in the  cleanup effort. This is true even where the federal government alone has  authority to control emissions: from trains, planes and ships, and from Defense  Department activities.  </P> <P> The Senate bill still requires Los Angeles to meet federal clean air standards.  Thus, by allowing the federal government to shirk its own cleanup  responsibility, the Senate is dumping a greater burden on Southland residents  and industries, who must make up the difference.  </P> <P> The trouble with the Senate's approach on clean air is that, like the weakest  link in the chain, the bill is only as strong as the least likely senator to  support it.  </P> <P> Unlike Broder, we applaud the efforts of California Sens. Pete Wilson and Alan  Cranston to seek amendments to help California -- and other urban areas -- meet  the standards mandated in the bill.  </P> <P> JAMES M. LENTS  </P> <P> Executive Officer, South Coast Air Quality Management District  </P> <P> El Monte  </P></p>

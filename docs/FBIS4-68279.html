Executed in the city of Moscow on 15 April 1994 in one  authentic copy in Russian.

FROM THE EDITOR: A protocol decision signed by Chairman  of the Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS and  Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Viktor  Chernomyrdin discusses the need "for drafting proposals on the  procedure for using the above-named documents, and for  submitting them for examination to the next meeting of the  Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS." It should be  added to this that time is of essence, since after all, this has  to do with elderly and, as a rule, ailing people. We will hope  that there will be no problems in the procedure of using the  documents, while on the other hand, the Agreement itself also  provides wide room for initiative, and for loving assistance to  our veterans, no matter where in the former Union they may find  themselves today.</p>

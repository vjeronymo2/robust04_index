			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Dezhu (2621 1795 3178) From "Earnestly Study </F> Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"  Column: "Strive To Create a New Situation of United Front Work"]    [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the united front  for the new period is an essential part of his theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. While  creatively carrying forward and developing Comrade Mao Zedong's  idea on the united front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a  whole set of theories, which meets the objective needs of  China's modernization drive, accords with the law governing  historical development, and bears the distinctive imprint of the  times. To breathe new life into united front work, we must  earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially his theory on  united front work for the new period, to facilitate our study of  new situations and problems arising from united front work.  <H5>  I. The Nature of the United Front Is More Clearly Defined </H5> in the New Period    As one of the three magic weapons for China's revolution and  development, the united front led by the CPC has gone through  several historical periods. The nature of the united front  varied with the change in the principal contradiction in society  and in the party's central task.    In his opening speech at the second session of the fifth  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National  Committee held in June 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  China's working class has greatly strengthened its position and  the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated and  developed on the new basis of the socialist modernization drive.  A great number of intellectuals have become a component part of  the working class, and they are consciously working for the  socialist cause. The means of production owned by the capitalist  class have been turned over to the state for a long time, and  most members of the capitalist class who are fit to work have  become self-supporting workers. Various fraternal minority  nationalities have taken the socialist road in turn and  established a new relationship between themselves characterized  by fraternal unity and mutual assistance. Patriotic religious  believers in various nationalities have made great progress.  Compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas  Chinese love the motherland and are playing an increasingly  important, active role in the reunification of the motherland  and in the modernization drive. "China's united front has  become a broad union of socialist laborers and patriots  supporting socialism led by the working class and based on the  worker-peasant alliance." In September of the same year, after  listening to a report on the 14th national conference on the  united front work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping extended the front by  embracing in it all people cherishing a fervent love for the  motherland, stressing that the united front "is the union of  socialist laborers and patriots" by nature. Later, he pointed  out more clearly that the united front in the new period is by  nature "the broadest union of all socialist laborers and all  patriots supporting socialism and the reunification of the  motherland." It is safe to say that this is a most fundamental  and important thesis showing that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  creatively carried forward and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's  idea on the united front. Since then, the united front in the  new period has freed itself from the yoke of the doctrine of  "taking class struggle as the key link" and has grown and become  more consolidated with each passing day, holding high the two  banners of socialism and patriotism.  <H5>  II. The Patriotic United Front Has Become Broader in the </H5> New Period    After a basic change took place in the class mix in the  country, some comrades were doubtful as to whether the range  covered by the united front was too broad or too narrow and  whether the targets for the united front were too many or too  few. In light of the circumstances, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  expounded the target and the range of the united front in a  scientific way. He said: "Clearly the targets for the united  front, as the term suggests, are all the people that can be  united. It is a broader range rather than a narrower one that  is to our advantage." In June 1981, the "Decision on the  Party's Several Historical Problems Since the Founding of the  PRC" drafted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and adopted  by the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  formally stated: The concept of "patriotic united front" is  designed to enable all individuals and organizations to join the  front, irrespective of their social systems, political stands,  ideologies, and ways of life, to expand the range. Patriotism  is a banner with a tremendous cohesive force and a strong appeal  that can achieve broad unity among the people of the Chinese  nation.    Holding high the two banners of patriotism and socialism,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the scientific idea of "one  country, two systems" in 1982.    By doing so he put forward a  practical strategy for the united front in the new period, a  front which comprises two unions: One is composed of all  laborers and patriots on the mainland on the political basis of  socialism and the other is composed of compatriots in Taiwan,  Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as overseas Chinese, on the  political basis of supporting reunification of the motherland.  On the whole, the two unions have three goals, namely:  Achieving unity among the people on the mainland on the basis  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; achieving  unity between compatriots on the mainland and those in Taiwan,  Hong Kong, and Macao on the basis of supporting peaceful  reunification of the motherland; and achieving unity among the  Chinese at home and abroad on the basis of reinvigorating the  Chinese nation.    The presentation and implementation of the principle of  "one country, two systems" and the interpretation of the range  covered by the two unions constituted a new departure in united  front work for the new period characterized by being based on  the mainland and keeping in view the outside world.  Consequently, the range for united front work became broader  and the number of people drawn into the front greater.  <H5>  III. There Is a Great Change in the Targets for the </H5> Patriotic United Front in the New Period    With the establishment of a socialist market economy and a  new change in the socio-economic structure, there has been a  great change in the targets for the united front.    One. The change in the social structure brought about  by adjustment of the structure of production and the shift  from primary to secondary and tertiary industries has affected  united front work.    Two. A shift in the ownership structure has resulted in  a change in the economic structure. A prominent phenomenon  over the last few years is that the private sector, including  self-employed industrial and commercial operators, private  enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises, has grown very  rapidly. The expansion of the private sector has brought forth  a number of new representative figures. An important  mission for our comrades responsible for promoting united front  work is to carry out the principle of uniting, helping, guiding,  and educating these representative figures of the private  sector, so we can choose from them activists who will cooperate  with our party for a long period, and can encourage, through  them, their colleagues to love the country, develop respect for  their work, and abide by law to contribute to the building of  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Three. There is also a change in the contingent of  intellectuals. A certain number of intellectuals, including  cultural workers, teachers, scientific researchers, and medical  and public health workers, quit their posts to "go into  business" or join managerial staffs of industries using new and  high technologies. Intellectuals drifting away from their  original posts have imposed on united front workers a new task  involving, in particular, winning over non-party  intellectuals.    Four. As members of democratic parties and  representatives of minority nationalities and religious circles  of the second and the third generations are replacing their  predecessors, it is a difficult task to train new  representatives of democratic parties and religious circles as  well as minority nationality cadres. And,    Five. The increase in the number of overseas Chinese  and the change in their mix also calls for a change in the  united front work and presents new problems.  <H5>  IV. The Patriotic United Front's Task for the New Period Is </H5> More Important    In June 1976, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The task  for the united front in the new period is to bring every  positive factor into play and unite with all the forces that can  be united in a common effort to safeguard and develop political  stability and unity and build China into a modern, strong  socialist country. Soon after that he said that it is necessary  to vigorously develop the patriotic united front to achieve  reunification of the motherland at an early date. As we are  trying to make breakthroughs in some key areas, and, at the same  time, pressing ahead with the whole project of establishing a  socialist market economy, which represents a profound  revolution, we will certainly witness a situation in which the  new system contradicts the old one and advantages are  accompanied by disadvantages. Radical change in the economic  field will inevitably exert extensive and intensive influence in  politics and social activities. This year the party Central  Committee advanced the 20-character principle of "seizing the  current opportunity, deepening reform, opening China wider to  the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining  stability." This is the general task of the country and the  party as well as the general task of the patriotic united front.  Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thesis on the mission of the  patriotic united front in the new period and on the general task  of the country and the party, the tasks of the patriotic  united front in the new period are: To work in the interest of,  first, stability and unity; second, the reform, opening up, and  modernization drive; third, strengthening democracy and the  legal system; and forth, the reunification of the motherland--in  short, to work for the general objective of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Clearly, the responsibility  of the united front is heavier rather than lighter than before,  and the united front is more important to us now than in any  period before. The united front is not something which is  dispensable. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the  united front remains a magic weapon for us and that it should be  strengthened and expanded rather than weakened and reduced.    V. The Patriotic United Front Has More Prominent  Social Functions in the New Period    In the new internal and external environment, the  united front has the social function of uniting with as many  people as possible, promoting democracy, coordinating relations,  and maintaining stability to serve the general objective of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To  accomplish the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, we must unite with all the forces that can be  united and bring every positive factor into play. In this  respect, the united front has a special role to play. The  essential task of the united front is to achieve unity on the  broadest possible scale. The competence of a ruling party or a  leading body is mainly judged by their abilities to make policy  decisions and to achieve unity. If they make an inappropriate  policy decision, all will go wrong; if they do not do a good job  in uniting all forces, all will end with failure. In a sense,  unity shows how competent they are; unity represents the overall  interest; unity is strength; and unity is victory. As the  old system is being replaced by a new one, adjustment of various  interest relations will inevitably give rise to new  contradictions. These contradictions are basically  contradictions among the people. Correctly handling them is an  important subject of the our political life and also for the  united front. As the reform deepens and China opens more  widely to the outside world, especially in the process of  building up a socialist market economy, new contradictions and  problems will keep cropping up. Failure to deal with and solve  these contradictions and problems earnestly and in a timely  manner will lead to chaos. For example, in general, minority  nationalities and religious believers are united and the  relevant situation is stable, but certain contradictions are  unavoidable. We must make painstaking efforts to solve problems  concerning minority nationalities and religion when and where  they make their appearance. Doing a good job in coordinating  relations among various parties, various nationalities, and  members of various sectors within the united front is essential  to consolidating and developing the political situation of  solidarity, stability, and harmony.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Hanke: "Operation Deflect Risk"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Is the pendulum swinging back?  For about two decades the world financial markets were  liberalized and deregulated. Banks, insurance companies, and  brokerage firms were able to extend the limits of their  activities further and further. But in the interim, supervisory  bodies and governments have grown increasingly worried. They are  afraid that the world financial system may have become  crisis-prone. The concerns focus on the market for new  speculative financial instruments known as derivatives.    Like a bolt out of the blue the U.S. General Acccounting  Office [GAO] issued a set of demands last week which ran into  the opposition of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and  the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC], however. Still,  the examiners who are looking into futures, swaps, and options  at the request of several Congressional committees are now  pressing for wide-ranging new regulations and taking aim at the  heart of the financial innovations of the eighties in the  process. [passage omitted]    The Americans are not so much worried about the explosion of  the derivatives trade, as such, as about the fact that 90  percent of that trade is concentrated on just seven banks and  five brokerage firms. "If one of these large dealers goes  bankrupt," the GAO noted, "it could endanger other firms,  including those which are part of the U.S. deposit insurance  system and, ultimately, the financial system as a whole." In  view of the fact that the American taxpayer has already had to  come up with several hundred billion dollars to pay for the  collapse of the savings and loan industry, the GAO report went  on to say, the government may be threatened with yet another  drain on its resources in case of a derivatives crisis.    The Bundesbank has similar concerns. It is not opposed to  the  new instruments in principle but it would like to "keep the  risks involved in these trades from becoming a matter for the  government to deal with," says Edgar Meister, who heads the  Bundesbank's division of banks and regulatory activities. What  Meister is saying is that the Bundesbank would be forced to prop  up the financial system by pumping in large sums of money in the  event of a major derivatives crisis.    As part of the fifth amendment to the German credit industry  law, which is presently being considered, the Bundesbank wants  the banks to report their derivatives risks and their contract  partners to the Bundesbank from now on just as they report  normal major credits. This would provide the Bundesbank with  information on the magnitude of the risks incurred by individual  banks and on what firms are involved to what extent in the new  market.    The boom, at any rate, is quite formidable. At present,  there  are derivatives with a face value of 3,579 billion German marks  [DM] in circulation. According to banking industry estimates  this represents credit risks amounting to DM115 billion.    Up to now, the Association of German Banks has been firmly  opposed to the expanded reporting requirement because it is  afraid that this will lead to increased costs for its member  institutions. For some time now German credit institutions and  insurance companies have had to maintain certain reserves  against the possibility that their contract partners fail to  meet their obligations. From now on the actual market risks are  going to have to be secured with the banks' own capital. In  other words, the banks will have to protect themselves better  against the worst case scenario of derivatives becoming  worthless.    This really amounts to a blow at the banks' very resources.  "For us it would be the worst case scenario," the director of a  major bank says, "if the security deposits would make our  derivatives business too expensive." The banks not only make a  profit on their own speculation with swaps, futures, and  options, but, above all, by trading these instruments. Such  trades are attractive because the spread between the purchase  and selling price is four to eight times as large as in the case  of traditional securities. But if they would now have to put  more of their own capital on the line, their profits would melt  away.    This is why the banks would prefer to calculate risk  according to their own concepts, but the Bundesbank's Meister is  firmly opposed to such an approach. "In the absence of minimal  standards," he says, "we would reach a point where the banks  would all be protected in completely different ways." The  experts of the Basel Bank for International Settlements, the  parent organization of all the large national banks, agree.    The GAO report provides greater impetus to these efforts.  "The United States should continue to play a leading role in the  efforts aimed at harmonizing the international regulation of  financial activities, including derivatives," the report  emphatically states. The GAO categorically states that all those  who deal in futures and options must have adequate capital  resources to cover their activities and calls on the U.S.  Congress to make this part of a new and rigid regulatory code.  Congress should make dealers who have operated without any  restrictions up to now accountable to the SEC, which is  considered to be particularly strict. American derivatives  traders have reacted to this demand with cries of outrage.    The GAO also calls for uniform accounting rules for  derivatives and a far-reaching requirement to provide  information on contract partners, outstanding amounts and  profits from derivatives. In addition, not only derivatives  traders but end consumers of derivatives should be required to  establish an airtight internal control and reporting system.    Both the Bundesbank and the Berlin Credit Supervision  Authority agree with a good many of these ideas. A joint task  force is already trying to work out the exact requirements for  the banks' internal control systems. The major German banking  institutions themselves do agree that the traders should be  under the internal control of individuals who operate on a  functionally separate basis from them. One of the financial  experts in the ministry of finance disagrees. "For that kind of  job," he says, "you need people who are just as good as the  derivatives traders themselves--but they would earn only  one-half as much money." London derivatives dealers earn more  than DM300,000 a year; those in Frankfurt earn a little less.  Their exceptional knowledge of mathematics and statistics are  well remunerated.    The banks mollify the controllers by saying that the trade  volume in the billions only represents nominal amounts while a  mere three or four percent of the total is really at risk and  most of that is secured by reciprocal deals. "By and large,"  says Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, director of the treasury  division of Deutsche Bank, "we are playing a zero-sum game." In  other words: contracts which are targeted to take advantage of  rising stock prices are secured by contrasting deals.    To be sure, it is often impossible to strike such a balance.  And it is also unclear to what an extent those involved really  do pursue such a defensive strategy. At any rate, it cannot  overcome another problem. "Banks know their own partners but not  their partners' partners because those are not subject to  control in view of the fact that they are not banks themselves,"  says Axel Bertuch-Samuels of the Association of German Savings  Banks. This can lead to unpleasant surprises, as in the case of  the Metallgesellschaft. Nor would one have thought that Procter  and Gamble, the conservative detergent manufacturer, would  squander $100 million on diff swaps.    Such losses do not push the world financial system to the  brink of collapse, of course. But if a major bad speculation  creates problems for a major banking institution the resulting  crisis might quickly spread. Which is why the overseers are more  than ever resolved to act. The heads of the national banks of  the 10 largest industrial nations have been asked to work out  proposals for reregulation to submit to the annual meeting of  the IMF and the World Bank this fall.</p>

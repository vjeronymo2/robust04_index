			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (12): Multimedia spurs ATM advance / ATM technology opens the door to exciting new applications for computer networks. It is ideally suited for handling multimedia projects - A breakthrough in communications technology ATM (which stands for Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has the potential to support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45 megabits per second. Developed in the French laboratory CNET in the mid-l980s, the switching system employs fixed length instead of variable length 'packets' to achieve greater efficiency. How soon it becomes widespread depends on the ability of equipment vendors and service providers to supply a range of functions which are needed to convert the extra network bandwidth into a useful tool. Vendors have to make it easy and attractive for users to migrate from current transmission systems. Most experts think that 1996 will be the year in which the ATM market comes of age. Many large organisations which are suffering from congestion of their data networks are eager to have the extra bandwidth. Many hope to start using ATM within the next couple of years, but it needs to be properly managed to be of any benefit to them. The shift to client-server computing, coupled with a big increase in workgroup applications, file transfers and online transaction processing, are the main factors in creating the demand for ATM. The imminent arrival of multimedia systems has added to the urgency. Mr Massimo Pacini, a product manager for IBM UK's bandwidth management systems division, says that ATM is ideally suited to handling multimedia applications in which data transfer is time-critical. 'Unlike previous generations of technology, there is no other technology coming up on the horizon to replace it,' he says. 'Users will therefore build ATM networks as a way of 'future-proofing' themselves.' Many organisations are finding that today's networking systems, particularly the Ethernet and Token Ring local area network structures, can barely cope. Nor do Fast Ethernet and Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) appear to be fully capable of taking over from them. When the price of ATM falls to the point where it becomes competitive with these systems, it will have several important advantages. It can run over existing cables; it can be applied to both local area and wide area networks; and, above all, there is a consensus that there is no alternative. This lack of an alternative has concentrated the industry on bringing about rapid standardisation, steered by the ATM Forum. Mr Pacini says there is still a need for more standards before ATM can become universal, particularly for an application programming interface. The Superjanet academic and research network is undertaking a pioneering ATM project which is the most advanced in the UK and among the most innovative of its kind in the world. Supported by the Higher Education Funding Councils for England, Scotland and Wales, the network is managed by the Rutherford-Appleton laboratory in Oxfordshire. Based on BT's broadband technology, it was begun five years ago as an extension of the research community's Janet network and now claims to lead the world in high-speed wide area networks running complex imaging applications across fibre optic cables. Since the middle of last year, four universities - Cambridge, Manchester, Edinburgh and University College, London - have been connected by an ATM system running at 34 megabits per second. Superjanet has four ATM switches supplied by Netcomm, a UK ATM specialist which was acquired last year by General Datacom of the US. The first ATM application for Superjanet has been teaching surgery. An operation is captured on a overhead camera; the surgeon is equipped with a microphone so that the operation can be discussed with medical students who watch it on screens in the other hospitals. Dr Robert Cooper, director of networking for the Superjanet project, says this gives medical students a chance to obtain the right experience which might not otherwise be available to them. In the next few months the number of sites linked to the Superjanet ATM system will rise to 14. Next year the maximum speed of the network will be increased to 155 megabits, allowing many more users to be connected and greatly improving the quality of the images. The project also involves a pilot scheme to connect CISCO routers to the network. Other applications will soon be added. It is expected that one of them will be a video-conferencing facility for molecular chemistry students. They will be able to work together using images of three-dimensional models. Superjanet has been described by BT as the world's first big information super-highway. BT's broadband product manager Mr Steve Taylor expects that in the long-term the whole network will be run over ATM. In the US there are at least three similar pioneering ATM ventures, involving industry, government, research laboratories and academia. These have had enthusiastic support from president Clinton and vice-president Gore. The US is by far the biggest initial market for ATM products, according to Mr Richard Barnett, director of research and development for Netcomm. The main interest in it comes from US telecom companies which are now installing ATM networks to meet the growing demand from their customers, particularly for video-conferencing applications, he says. In Europe, users do not seem to be pushing the carriers to the same extent and European telecom companies have been much slower to develop ATM services, he says. One explanation for this is that the US has a much more competitive telecoms market, which has brought down the cost of calls and made ATM services more affordable. The first ATM-related products have been launched by equipment vendors in the past year. In May, IBM introduced its first ATM adapter, which fits into the back of a workstation. IBM has stated that in the struggle to reverse its decline it intends to be the leader in the ATM market and plans to spend Dollars 100m in developing ATM products, including microchips, intelligent hubs and carrier switches.</p>

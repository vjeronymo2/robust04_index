			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO NEBRASKA SCHOLARSHIP FOR WAGNER, OSBORNE SAYS  </P> <P> The puzzlement over former San Diego State tailback Darrin Wagner's announced  plans to transfer to Nebraska grew Tuesday when Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said  he will not offer Wagner a football scholarship.  </P> <P> "We didn't offer him a scholarship when we looked at him out of high school a  year ago," Osborne said in a telephone interview from Nashville, Tenn., where  he is attending a convention. "If we didn't recruit him a year ago, why would  we now?"  </P> <P> Osborne said that as of Tuesday afternoon he had not talked to Wagner. He said  he did not learn of Wagner's statements that he was transferring to Nebraska,  published last weekend, until told of them Tuesday by a member of his staff.  </P> <P> Wagner, The Times' 1987 San Diego County back of the year from Lincoln High  School, said Tuesday night that he still planned to fly to Lincoln, Neb.,  Thursday and enroll for the spring semester that begins Jan. 16.  </P> <P> "He should be aware that if he comes out, we do not have a scholarship for  him," Osborne said.  </P> <P> Darrin's father, Norman, said he talked Tuesday night with Osborne, who told  him a scholarship would not be offered to his son for the spring semester.  </P> <P> "If we have to pay for him to go to Nebraska, we will find a way," Norman  Wagner said. "He will come out in the spring and show them that he belongs on  the team. He will earn a scholarship."  </P> <P> Osborne said Wagner's status might have been clarified earlier had SDSU not  initially denied him permission to talk with Wagner. Under NCAA rules, schools  must receive permission from the school of a prospective transfer before  talking to the player. Osborne said he sought permission after Wagner called  "in October or November" seeking a transfer but was denied in a letter he  received from Denny Stolz, the former SDSU coach. That permission was granted  Tuesday, Osborne said.  </P> <P> "If they had let me talk to him, I would have told him to finish out the year,"  Osborne said. "We never encourage someone to leave school in the middle of his  first semester."  </P> <P> Osborne also disputed a statement by SDSU Athletic Director Fred Miller that  Wagner was "tampered" with by "a representative of Nebraska's athletic  interests." Miller has said that the individual, whom he has declined to  identify, contacted Wagner while Wagner was a member of the SDSU team and  improperly influenced him to transfer to Nebraska.  </P> <P> Such actions could violate National Collegiate Athletic Assn. recruiting rules,  endanger the athlete's eligibility and result in penalties against the  violating school.  </P> <P> "We have not tampered with Darrin Wagner," Osborne said.  </P> <P> Osborne said SDSU's complaints concern Ray Hooper, who was the coach at Lincoln  High School when Wagner was a freshman. Hooper coached Nebraska quarterback  Steve Taylor and served as Taylor's legal guardian when Taylor played at  Lincoln. The Wagners said Hooper is a family friend and that they sought his  advice because he is familiar with the college recruiting process. Hooper  accompanied the Wagners to a meeting with Miller and other SDSU officials in  November.  </P> <P> Osborne said that Hooper visits Taylor several times a year and is "pretty  positive about Nebraska," but he said that Hooper does not meet the NCAA  definition of what is required to be considered "a representative of a school's  athletic interests."  </P> <P> NCAA rules generally define such individuals as financial contributors to a  university, those who have assisted in the recruitment of athletes for a school  in the past, those who have helped secure benefits for former athletes and  anybody else viewed to be operating with the blessing of a university athletic  department.  </P> <P> "Ray Hooper is not a representative of our athletic interests," Osborne said.  "He is a good friend of Steve's, apparently a good friend of Darrin's. But we  never asked Ray to help in recruiting."  </P> <P> Hooper could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> It was after Stolz denied Nebraska permission to talk with the Wagners that  Hooper approached Nebraska about the possibility of Wagner transferring, said  Dave Gillespie, Nebraska recruiting coordinator.  </P> <P> "We did not direct Ray Hooper to do anything," Gillespie said. "Darrin's family  asked for his help."  </P> <P> Osborne said that when Hooper broached the subject with him during the same  time, he replied, "We can't talk to him. We're not interested in talking to  him."  </P></p>

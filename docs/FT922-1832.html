			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Italian seesaw continues as fears of devaluation persist ITALIAN government bond prices leapt and then plummetted yesterday in a second day of highly-volatile trading as the Bank of Italy failed to lift the spectre of devaluation from the market. Bond prices opened lower on continuing fears about the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Maastricht agreement, but jumped later in the morning as Mr Giuliano Amato was asked to form a government, raising some hopes that Italy will finally tackle its constitutional crisis. The market took further heart from reports that the Finance Ministry is considering abolishing the 12.5 per cent withholding tax paid by foreigners on government bonds. 'We've heard before that they're thinking about this,' said one sceptical observer. 'They don't yet have a treasury minister, and when they do, he will have more urgent things to think about than withholding tax.' The market's confident mood did not last. A sharp rise in the rate paid at the morning repurchase auction (the minimum rate was 14.8 per cent, up from 14.3 per cent yesterday) sent a strong signal of the Bank of Italy's intention of protecting the lira. But that didn't stop the currency falling back later, raising fears that the authorities will be forced over the weekend to raise the discount rate. The sharp price movements were reflected in the futures contract on Liffe. Having opened at 95.46, the contract leapt to 95.71 before sliding down to 94.98. It ended the day back at around 95.28. LONGER-dated UK government bonds fell slightly as the market trod water, waiting for the result today of the Irish vote on the Maastricht agreement. Early rumours that the Irish had followed the Danes in voting 'no' were largely disregarded, but did not help the mood - particularly as the gilt market is already waiting nervously on next week's Pounds 2.75bn gilts auction. Against that background, mildly encouraging earnings data (average earnings rose by 7 per cent in the year to April, down from 7.5 per cent in March) failed to lift the market's spirits. The 9 per cent bonds due 2011 lost  1/8 of a point to 99 21/32 , a yield of 9.03 per cent, although shorter-dated gilts held steady. MONTHLY US trade deficit and weekly jobless claims data that was mildly bullish for Treasury markets gave a modest boost to bond prices yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 102 3/16 , yielding 7.797 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16 at 100 13/32 , to carry a yield of 4.885 per cent. Investors reacted positively to the news that the trade gap widened to Dollars 6.97bn in April, with exports falling and imports rising only slightly, due primarily to higher oil prices. The figures, along with the much smaller-than-expected 2,000 decline in jobless claims for the first week of June, confirmed that the economy is recovering only slowly. Treasury prices were also said to have been supported by expectations of a 'flight to quality' by equity investors scared away from stocks by the steady recent decline in share prices. THE continuing collapse in Tokyo share prices helped to fuel expectations of a more relaxed monetary stance from the Bank of Japan, prompting buying of short-dated paper in particular. Mr Yasuchi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, had continued to stress on Wednesday that there would be no change in the authorities' stance: but the damage done by falling share prices on the banking system and hence the supply of credit left many convinced Mr Mieno would have no choice but to change his official position soon. The yield on the benchmark bond No 129, which closed on Wednesday with a yield of 5.405 per cent, fell further to 5.385 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Fiscal intermediaries are responsible for medical and utilization review of home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient hospital services (excluding surgery), and other outpatient services such as those provided by rehabilitation facilities, rural health clinics, and similar entities. This review assures that medical care received is necessary and appropriate, and that quality medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carriers are responsible for medical and utilization review of Part B providers and suppliers. All carriers will utilize data analysis capabilities to target on focused medical review in FY 1995. Through focused medical review, carriers will identify aberrancies from national or local carrier data and further investigate aberrancies to determine which require appropriate corrective actions to eliminate overutilization. These actions will include provider education (individual or group), development and revision of local medical review policies or screens, identification/recoupment of overpayments, and referral of cases to HCFA's Benefit Integrity staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally in FY 1995, HCFA will support the Medical Review activities of the four Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (Regional Carriers). The Regional Carriers will conduct prepayment and postpayment review of durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and supply claims to identify areas of potential abuse and overutilization and prevent payment for non-covered items and services. Through focused medical review and analysis of data, the Regional Carriers will initiate corrective action for the recoupment of overpayments and the targeting of suppliers with aberrant billing patterns. They will also continue to revise regional medical review policies and screens and make referrals where appropriate to the HHS Office of Inspector General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 5. Provider Audit (Part A Only)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For FY 1995, we have planned a modest increase in the number of onsite reviews/audits for all types of providers to help in the identification and prevention of improper payments. This increase is made possible by reducing the amount of resources needed to perform desk reviews, and by applying these resources to onsite reviews, focused reviews, and field audits. In addition, we will encourage all contractors to retain a knowledgeable audit staff and provide training in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. All contractors are expected to respond to provider appeals and file position papers with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

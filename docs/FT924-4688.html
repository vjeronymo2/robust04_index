			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Medical division behind 29% rise at Philip Harris PHILIP HARRIS, the laboratory equipment and pharmaceutical products supplier, increased pre-tax profit by 29 per cent to Pounds 806,000 (Pounds 624,000) in the half-year to September thanks to a healthy performance from its expanded medical division. The interim dividend is increased 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p) and is being paid from earnings of 6.6p (5.11). Mr Robert Jordan, chairman, said yesterday trading con-ditions in the UK market were difficult, but the main thrust of group activities was to consolidate its existing businesses. Turnover rose to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 36.6m). Revenue from the education and scientific division - Harris is the UK's largest supplier of scientific equipment to schools - was flat at Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.3m). Sales from the medical division - which sells pharmaceutical products to dispensing doctors, retail chemists and health centres - jumped to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 25.3m), after its expansion with the purchase of the Proctor chain of pharmacies in June. The costs of the deal pushed up interest charges to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 287,000), which partially offset an increase in overall operating profit to Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 911,000).</p>

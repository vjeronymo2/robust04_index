			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Doubts  about Russia's commitment to economic reform have darkened an  already bleak landscape for foreign investors who must deal with  shifting rules, poor infrastructure and a powerful Russian  Mafia, business leaders say.    Executives from Japan, Europe and the United States agreed  at  the World Economic Forum here that Russia has a long way to go  before it could hope to attract meaningful amounts of capital  from abroad. [passage omitted]    Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice president of ABB Asea  Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish supplier of heavy electrical  equipment, said the main problem in Russia is the ever-changing  rules of the game.    He said investors need stable regulatory and tax regimes, a  clear idea of the division of authority between Moscow and  Russia's regional governments, and a supportive local banking  system.    Also discouraging is the pervasive influence of organised  crime in Russia, von Koerber said. He cited a government report  which said 70-80 percent of private firms and commercial banks  in major cities have to fork over 10-20 percent of their  turnover to the Mafia.    "If this is not attacked in an aggressive, credible manner  very quickly, then whatever regulation is established in the  country will not be seen as sufficient," said von Koerber, whose  firm has investments in Russia.    Figures presented at the Forum showed a clear reticence on  the part of countries to invest in Russia, even before fears  spread that Moscow was drifting back towards central planning.    Von Koerber cited the example of German companies, which he  said invested a piddling 13 million Deutsche marks [DM] ($7.6  million) in Russia in the first half of last year. This was  less even than the DM21 million they put into a small state like  Slovenia.    Yukinori Ito, senior excutive director of the Export-Import  Bank of Japan, said accumulated Japanese investment in Russia  totaled $300 million, a scant 0.1 percent of the worldwide total.    Ito said Russia's economic instability and rampant inflation  were a key discouraging factor, as were changing investment  policies, poor roads and communications, and a time-consuming  bureaucracy.    "These factors together with the macroeconomic and political  conditions are making Japanese countries hesitant to invest in  Russia," he said.    George Vassiliou, chairman of the Cyprus-based MEMRB market  research firm, said investing in Russia would also benefit  Europe as a whole.    He said it has environmental consequences, and expansion of  the Russian market is necessary if the continent is to emerge  from its current recession and unemployment crisis.    Vassiliou was unimpressed with proud claims by Russian  officials that they are well on their way towards completing  their mass privatisation programme.    "Privatisation by itself does not mean much," he said. "It  has significance only if it can be coupled with joint ventures  and investment."</p>

In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources confirmed  that the exchange of fire was stopped within hours to avoid an  eruption of the situation because of the political crisis which  has prevailed in Yemen for about five months.    It is worth noting that these clashes occurred after the  arrival of three Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] brigades in  Shabwah from other governorates including Hadramaut. They are  the 30th Brigade, the Taysir Brigade, and the 'Abbas Brigade.  They tightened control of the oil area which was a joint area  between the two Yemens before unity. It was considered "a joint  investment zone." Oil prospecting and production rights there  were given to the French company Total which announced the  discovery of an oilfield last October after the exploratory  drilling of three wells.    While General People's Congress [GPC] sources accused the  YSP  of moving these brigades, the YSP claimed that the GPC had moved  several units from al-Hudaydah to Ta'izz near Aden and  reinforced its units in the governorates of Ibb and al-Bayda'.

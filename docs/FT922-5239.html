			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The road to Rio THE EARTH Summit, which gets under way in Rio on Wednesday, could hardly be described as a happy event. The tortuous two-year preparations have exposed a world far from united on the size and even the nature of the environmental threat that faces it. Deep divisions have appeared between the rich and poor countries over who should shoulder responsibility for the damage that has been caused already and over what should be done to prevent more damage in future. Only a week ago, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, decided not to attend, denouncing the gathering as a cocktail party with a pre-arranged outcome, a view which many undoubtedly share. Such disenchantment is not altogether a bad thing. This cumbersome event, with its 800 page agenda, was never likely to achieve anything of immediate significance. Yet it was in danger of raising false hopes all around the world - among those in the industrialised countries who saw it as the trigger for global environmental action, and among those in developing countries who were hoping for fresh flows of aid. None of these hopes will be realised; that much is now clear. But this is no reason for questioning the value of holding the summit at all; it means that more realistic yardsticks are needed. In one sense, Rio has already achieved some success merely by identifying issues and drawing a large number of constituencies into the debate. We may not have the answers, but the questions, at least, are clearer. Natural resources Have environmental pressures - for example pollution of the atmosphere and the seas, or the pace of species extinction - advanced from being local problems to matters of global concern? Is the rate at which we are using up our natural resources unsustainable? Has the world's ecology entered a new phase with man's ability to manipulate the environment? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, or just probably, Rio can serve a purpose. But three things are needed to prevent Rio from being merely a talking shop. The first is rigorous control of the proceedings. Little will be gained if the talks degenerate into finger-pointing or haggling over aid. To be fruitful, this conference must stick to identifying environmental concerns which are common to all participants, and initiating moves to deal with the most urgent. There must also be realism, both about the dangers and the action they call for. Make sacrifices Second is a willingness by all participants to make sacrifices. Most of the world's environmental problems stem from excess. There must be a recognition that the benefits of environmental protection come at a price. This is obviously true for the industrial countries, but even developing countries must play a part. The third point is that Rio will initiate a process rather than conclude one. It is essential that the politicians who put their names to the Rio conventions be held to the commitments they make, however flimsy. This will require the establishment of some kind of machinery to monitor progress and bring pressure to bear on the laggards. An annual meeting of environmental ministers is one suggestion. A sense of proportion is essential. Much can still be done by ceasing to pursue policies, such as energy subsidisation, that harm both the economy and the environment. Where conflicts between the two may exist, there is also much uncertainty. Yet it is nave to expect huge changes in social behaviour on the basis of uncertain scientific forecasts for the distant future. Rio could never have been more than a start. This is not how idealists and environmental zealots see it. They have already written off Rio. Others view it with a mixture of weariness and dread. Doubtless there will be moments over the next 12 days when stalemate and sheer verbiage will clog the mind. But Rio could create a watershed even if this fact does not appear startlingly clear at the closing ceremony on June 14. At one level it should initiate action to deal with specific threats. But at another it should encourage the global consciousness, which will be needed to ease the stresses on the planet's resources.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEWLY MARRIED SIDNEY SHELDONS HONORED AT PARTY  </P> <P> The stretch limousines stretched out the driveway and down the block. The  Rolls-Royces rolled in one after another. It was a busy night at Jimmy's, where  author Sidney Sheldon was inside celebrating his recent marriage with his  bride, Alexandra Kostoff Sheldon.  </P> <P> The couple were married Oct. 14 in Las Vegas in what Sidney Sheldon described  as "a very private ceremony, just family, no friends."  </P> <P> After a stay at Caesars Palace, they honeymooned in New England and spent a  week reviving at La Costa. Now they're back in Los Angeles for awhile; their  many friends, family and business associates had gathered Monday night to throw  them a belated wedding reception, Beverly Hills style.  </P> <P> A stack of crisply wrapped boxes and a bag from Tiffany sat near the door.  Though the invitations had specified no gifts, a Beverly Hills wedding party  without presents would be like . . . well, like a Beverly Hills wedding party  without Zsa Zsa Gabor.  </P> <P> Gabor was there, of course, becoming the instant center of attention when she  entered with her husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt. (Seems like just a year  ago when Zsa Zsa's appearance at a party would be saluted with only a few  perfunctory flashbulbs. Judging from the photographic panic that now ensues,  Zsa Zsa is the Hungarian Madonna.)  </P> <P> There were plenty of other notables to look at, too. Creative Artists Agency  head Mike Ovitz made a brief appearance and left quickly after congratulating  the Sheldons and conferring with Marvin Davis, who was there with his wife,  Barbara.  </P> <P> Also there: Sidney Sheldon's daughter, Mary, and granddaughter, Elizabeth;  Milton Berle; Mrs. Morton Phillips ("Dear Abby"); Nancy and Alan Livingston;  Lloyd Bridges; Anne and Kirk Douglas; Red Buttons; Jack Carter; Ed McMahon; and  dozens of members of the Hollywood media.  </P> <P> They and about 200 other guests had photos taken with the newlyweds and snacked  from a buffet with fresh oysters and shrimp, meatballs, lox, fresh vegetables  and other cocktail hour repasts.  </P> <P> What's up next for the couple?  </P> <P> "We're going to Europe," said Sidney, shaking hands with well-wishers.  </P> <P> Inveterate Sheldon fans also will be glad to know that his next hardback  original, a sequel to "The Other Side of Midnight" titled "Memories of  Midnight," is scheduled to be out within a year.  </P> <P> With that kind of prolificacy, the Sheldons should have their thank-you notes  written in no time at all.  </P></p>

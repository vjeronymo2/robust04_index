			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Establishing an economic  affairs minister with broad jurisdiction is possible if the  purpose is clarified, economic planning chief Manae Kubota said  Tuesday [19 April]. At a press conference after what she said  was probably the last regular meeting of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's cabinet, Kubota said the reported idea of such a post  "is possible if the purpose is made clear."    "That purpose isn't clear to me," said Kubota, director  general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). But she added,  "It may be possible. The economy is a broad field."    The idea of a broadly defined economic affairs minister was  reported in Tuesday's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, which quoted a Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] leader. The party is headed by Tsutomu  Hata, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, believed to  replace Hosokawa as premier.    Kubota also said the economy "is going in a brighter  direction" but repeated concern about such uncertainties as the  high yen and the possible effects of drawn-out political turmoil  on the budget. She said the economy is at "the most important  point in trying to get to its feet."    Kubota also said her Social Democratic Party should not  agree  to raising the consumption tax at the outset of coalition talks  on a promised overhaul of Japan's tax system.</p>

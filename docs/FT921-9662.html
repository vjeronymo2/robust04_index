			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Parmalat lifts sales and earnings PARMALAT, the Italian milk and dairy foods group whose shares are widely owned abroad, raised operating earnings by 28 per cent to L173bn (Dollars 147.2m) last year. The improvement, accompanied by a 20 per cent rise in sales to L1,325bn, is likely to be followed by an increased dividend, the company implied. Parmalat made a payout of L50 a share for the second half of 1990 following its restructuring in July 1990 and the creation of the stock market listed Parmalat Finanziaria holding company. Full 1991 figures will be released in March. The group has used its strengthened capital base for a series of acquisitions, most of which will be reflected in this year's turnover. In Italy, Parmalat has bought control of municipally owned dairies in Como and Genova, while in Brazil, its second main market, sales jumped by 97 per cent to L201bn thanks partly to two acquisitions. Last year's purchases would have raised group turnover by L115bn, but only L12bn has been consolidated into the 1991 accounts, the company said. Sales this year are expected to rise by around 23 per cent to about L1,636bn, while operating profits should rise by 16 per cent to L201bn. Parmalat intends to continue its acquisition strategy, using privatisation opportunities in Italy and in eastern Europe.</p>

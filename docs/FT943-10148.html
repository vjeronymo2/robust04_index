			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: The roller-coaster takes another dip - Wall Street Last week it was inventories, this week it was jobs. Last week it was good news, which translated into lower bond yields and higher share prices. This week it was bad news, which translated into higher bond yields and lower share prices. Wall Street's attempts to read the economic tea leaves have sent share prices jumping one minute, diving the next. This has been the pattern for several months, and it is making everyone feel a little dizzy. The failure of the stock market to establish and sustain a firm trend has been the feature of the summer. The root cause of this inconsistency has been the determination of traders and investors to make snap decisions about the likely direction of long-term interest rates based upon the latest batch of statistics on the economy. They do this sort of thing all the time, but what is different this summer is that the stock market lacks a firm foundation in the form of a consistency of underlying sentiment. Uncertainty about monetary policy is to blame. For most of 1991-1993, almost everyone agreed that interest rates were either going lower, or staying low, as the Federal Reserve took its foot off the monetary brakes in an attempt to keep the economy rolling and stave off a crisis in the banking industry. From this February through to May, almost everyone agreed that interest rates were heading higher, as the Fed stepped on the monetary brakes - lightly at first, but later with more conviction - in order to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation reviving. Since then, the Fed says that monetary policy has been on hold, which makes sense if it believes that its round of four policy tightenings this year have been enough to choke off any inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Unfortunately, many investors fear that the Fed has not finished raising interest rates. It is an understandable concern - the central bank itself has warned that policy may have to be tightened further if the economy begins to expand too rapidly again. Yet, there is a marked lack of agreement on Wall Street about what will happen to the economy over the next year. There are almost as many opinions about the economic outlook as there are people to express them. Essentially, there are three camps. The first camp believes that the economy is still growing too fast, that the Fed has not done enough yet to slow it down, and that more interest rate increases this year are, therefore, inevitable. The second camp believes the opposite: that the recent tightenings of policy are already taking effect, and that the economy will slow down in the second half of this year and on into 1995. This camp thinks that the Fed has gone too far with its policy tightenings, and the most pessimistic members believe that interest rates should come down, probably early next year. The third camp is not so sure about where the economy is headed, feels on balance that the Fed is right to keep policy on hold for now, but is worried that the policy makers will suddenly sanction another rate increase when it is least expected. The bulk of investors appear to be in this third camp, which explains why the market has failed to maintain any kind of firm direction this summer. In mid-May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was as low as 3,629, then climbed somewhat erratically up to a high of 3,814 in early June, only to retrace its steps and tumble back to 3,624 by the start of July. Since then, although the Dow has steadily regained its lost ground, there has been little sign of a genuine summer rally of the kind that many were hoping would emerge from an encouragingly positive second quarter corporate results season. Which gets us back to inventories and jobs. The big news in last week's second quarter gross domestic product report was a large jump in inventories, which the markets took as a sign that the economy was slowing. This judgment helped bond yields drop sharply, stock prices rise, and buoyed optimism that the Fed would not raise interest rates again soon. This week, the market latched on to the July employment report, and another bigger-than-expected rise in non-farm payrolls. The result was a jump in bond yields and a decline in share prices yesterday as investors sold bonds and stocks in anticipation of another policy tightening from the Fed. There will be no respite next week, when key inflation data for July will be released. In this up and down summer, no one expects the rollercoaster ride to end soon. Monday     3798.17 + 33.67 Tuesday    3796.22 -  1.95 Wednesday  3792.66 -  3.56 Thursday   3765.79 - 26.87 Friday     3747.02 - 18.77</p>

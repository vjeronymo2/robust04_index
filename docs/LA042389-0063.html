			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GINGRICH'S CORRUPTION ARGUMENT IS SO MUCH MALARKEY  </P> <P> Jim Wright's downfall will be healthy if Congress's zeal for ethical witch  hunts dies with his speakership. Yes, we should encourage high standards of  personal ethics by those in government. But the way to get high standards is to  get good people, and the present malicious mania for minutiae drives away from  government the best of those we should strive to get into government. The best  don't need a 6-foot shelf of law books to tell right from wrong. And their  interest is in serious governance, not the politics of competitive sanctimony.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Kim Kyong-hun, 32, and  Kim Yun-il, 28, who had been kidnapped by South Korean puppets  while engaging in felling in the far eastern region of Russia  and escaped, met with reporters here on Monday and threw a  revealing light on the truth behind the despicable kidnapping  campaign of the South Korean puppets against lumbermen of the  DPRK.    They were working at the forestry station No. 2 under the  first complex of the Far Eastern Forestry Mission in Elga,  Khabarovsk.    They first explained how they were kidnapped by agents of  the  South Korean "Security Planning Board [SPB]",    On May 8, 1992, they went shopping to the Birobidzhan market  and got on a train after a Russian merchant who promised them to  buy things they needed in Novosibirsk.    When they were ended up in embarrassment, having lost money  and goods while traveling in the train, a man dressed like a  Chinese volunteered to help them as a compatriot and led them to  Moscow. Upon arriving in Moscow, they got on a taxi, which took  them directly to the South Korean "embassy". The Russian  merchant and Korean who kidnapped them were members of the  "Association of Koreans" in Moscow.    The "Association of Koreans" was an anti-DPRK plot-breeding  group on the payroll of the South Korean puppet embassy.    South Korean "SPB" men including Choe Chon-yop, first  secretary of the "embassy", tried to force them to admit that  they came to the South Korean "embassy" of their own accord,  branding them as "criminals" who intruded into the "land of  South Korea".    Later, they were held in detention in the office of Ho Chin,  chairman of the "Association of Koreans" and general director of  the newspaper LENIN KICHI, for one week before being taken to Yi  Vadim, vice-chairman of the Rostov chapter of the "Association  of Koreans".    In Rostov they underwent brainwashing under the watch of  gangsters who tried to force them to write articles against the  DPRK. The rogues also tried to make them write a letter to  Yeltsin saying they could not live in North Korea and requesting  him to grant them political asylum so they might live as  citizens of Russia.    But they refused to do such things against the DPRK. When  those lumbermen refused to comply with their demand, the "SPB"  operatives and their underlings threatened them in every way.    One day in August, they threatened to kill the lumbermen,  saying they would not be allowed to leave there alive. The  lumbermen, unafraid of death, pounced upon them with a kitchen  knife and an axe.    The villains who had been in a killing mood just moments  before were struck with terror and ran away. The lumbermen fled  and took shelter in the house of a man sympathetic with them.  Later they escaped from the grip of the enemy with his help.    Kim Kyong-hun exposed the relations between the South Korean  "embassy" and Ho Chin's "Association of Koreans" in Moscow and  their kidnapping methods.    Choe Chon-yop, acting in the guise of a first secretary of  the South Korean "embassy", is an operative of the "SPB" who  directly wirepulls the "Association of Koreans". He personally  questions kidnapped lumberjacks and decides on their fate.    He disguises those who are to be taken to South Korea as  "political exiles" or "refugees" and sends those who are to be  left in Russia back to the "Association of Koreans" and  manipulates it to brainwash them and use them in anti-DPRK  intrigues.    Kim Kyong-hun told reporters that through his own experience  he learned that the "Security Planning Board" section in the  South Korean "embassy" is a den of kidnappers of DPRK lumbermen  in Russia, and the members of the kidnapping gang including the  "Association of Koreans" are servants paid by the "SPB" for  their criminal doings.    According to him, the South Korean "embassy" in Moscow does  the dirty job in Europe and the "consulate-general" in  Vladivostok in the far east. A certain Pak, deputy consul of  the "consulate-general," is a high-ranking operative of the  "SPB" under whose baton the chairman of the "Association of  Koreans" in Nakhodka supervises operations of alluring and  kidnapping DPRK lumbermen.    Kim Yun-il told reporters about the purpose sought by the  "Association of Koreans" in trying to force him to write a  letter to President Yeltsin. In this, the "SPB" of South Korea  and the reactionaries of the "Association of Koreans" intended  to disguise their illegal organisation as a "charity"  organisation, he said.    Kim Kyong-hun and Kim Yun-il said if the South Korean  puppets  continued to frame plots against DPRK lumbermen in the far  eastern region of Russia, distorting facts, they will eventually  drink a bitter cup.    They urged the Russian authorities never to allow the South  Korean puppets' kidnapping of DPRK lumbermen in the far eastern  region, because it harms the traditional friendship between the  Korean and Russian peoples and it is an international crime  creating instability in the Russian territory.</p>

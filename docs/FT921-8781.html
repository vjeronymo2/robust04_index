			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Can the Recovery theory recover? - Serious Money WHEN investment trusts start being advertised on television, cynics could reasonably assume that we had reached the height of a bull market. The traditional time to float a specialist trust has been when that sector is top of the performance tables. All too often, private investors are lured in to buy at the peak of the market. M&amp;G's Recovery investment trust certainly cannot be criticised on such grounds. It is being launched in the middle of a recession and at a time when its sister vehicle, the Recovery unit trust, has lagged badly in the short term performance tables. Instead, the launch owes much to the end of tax year Personal Equity Plan season and to the imminent general election. As John Authers writes on Page III, Labour now says it will not abolish PEPs, which effectively negates much recent marketing hype. Investors must assess the trust for its investment potential and see the tax break as a bonus. So how should one view the trust? Many readers will already have received the M&amp;G mailshot, citing the impressive long term record of the Recovery unit trust - Pounds 1,000 invested at launch in 1969 grew to Pounds 65,280 (with income reinvested) by the end of January 1992. However, two eagle-eyed readers have pointed out that of the 105 funds M&amp;G lists, only three have beaten the All-Share over the last five years. None of the 11 M&amp;G trusts in the list beat the All-Share over a five year period, and nine, including Recovery, failed to beat the building societies. So one has to decide whether the recent years have been a aberration in M&amp;G's otherwise excellent long term record, or whether the company has lost its touch. There is a case for arguing the latter. Richard Hughes took over as manager of the Recovery trust in 1987, replacing the highly successful David Tucker. The unlucky Hughes came in at the peak of the bull market, only to face the Crash, and then a long recession. Nevertheless, it could be that the departure of Tucker has weakened the trust. A second question, which we raised last month, was whether the recovery philosophy has as much mileage as it used to. The core idea is that companies get into difficulties which cause their share prices to slump. A point is reached where these difficulties are overestimated, and at that point shares in such companies are cheap. It has been those companies that are affected by the economic cycle which have tended to offer the greatest rewards to recovery fund managers. But analyst Bill Smith of BZW argues that such cyclical stocks have previously benefited from the devaluation of sterling as the UK comes out of recession  -a process that is unlikely to be repeated within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Having said all that, the long term performance of the Recovery unit trust, and its strong growth at the end of previous recessions, cannot be ignored. If you have not already got a PEP for the current year, then this is a prime candidate for consideration. Whether one needs to use up next year's PEP allowance as well - by investing Pounds 12,000 - is much less certain. One can now turn the marketing men's anti-Labour crusade on its head. If Labour is elected, then most City folk believe it will be bad for shares, at least in the short term. So why take the risk of committing a substantial sum to the stock market before the polls, particularly as Pounds 12,000 would be a large chunk of most people's portfolios. The structure of the trust is similar to that of M&amp;G Income. There are three classes of shares - zero dividend, income and capital - but most investors will probably want to apply for the package. To those investors, the split structure will be irrelevant, save that it should stop the trust from falling to a discount. There are two important caveats. Investment trusts new issues are not like privatisations; there will be no opportunity for short term profit. And the PEP attractions should not be over-emphasised. The trust will yield 5 per cent, so the maximum income tax gain to a higher rate taxpayer who invests Pounds 6,000 in the trust is just Pounds 120. A moderately bad stock market could wipe out that saving in one day. However, the good news is that the initial charges, at 3.99 per cent, are lower than on other recent investment trust issues. And some of those costs could be saved by applying through a execution-only adviser such as Baronworth Investment Services (081-518-1218), Boyton Financial Services (0787-61919) or Chamberlain de Broe (071-235-5999). Under the tender offer, investors have to bid a fixed price for the individual classes of shares. Here the vast majority of investors will need advice, which must be paid for. It will be a tricky calculation; if the assets of the trust grow at 5 per cent per annum, then at 40p, the gross redemption yield on the zeroes will be 14.1 per cent. If the assets do not grow at all, then the investor who pays 45p will get a yield of just 7.4 per cent. Those who want the advantage of a PEP will have to switch the shares into a general PEP when they know their tender has been successful. The obvious candidate for PEP inclusion is the income shares, which get all the income of the trust but have virtually no redemption value. They are thus rather like a ten year annuity, and in early years should carry a high yield. At 35p, the running yield will be 14.3 per cent. But beware. If the income on the trust grows at only 2.5 per cent per annum, an investor who bids 40p will get a gross redemption yield of just 6.4 per cent. As you can see, good advice is essential.

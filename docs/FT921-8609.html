			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Letter: Ideas for all strands of opinion Sir, It is unfortunate that your columnist Joe Rogaly (February 14) said 'the IPPR is Labour's think-tank in the same way as the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute are the Conservatives''. The IEA is independent and puts out ideas which anyone - Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat or whoever - is welcome to pick up. If Joe Rogaly will look around next time he is here, he is very likely to see evidence that our academic, opinion-forming and policy-making guests come from all strands of political opinion. Graham Mather, general director, Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB</p>

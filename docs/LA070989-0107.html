			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL RECEIVES AWARD  </P> <P> Huntington Memorial Hospital has received the third annual transportation award  of excellence from Commuter Transportation Services (Commuter Computer). The  award recognizes outstanding efforts to improve air-quality, traffic and  parking problems.  </P> <P> The hospital's commuter alternatives program provides for monetary incentives,  facility improvements and a marketing program to encourage ride-sharing among  its 3,500 employees. The Huntington was the first organization in Pasadena to  hire a full-time coordinator to implement the program.  </P> <P> The plan offers subsidies for new van pools and nearly half-price bus passes.  After employees pay for a month's worth of bus tickets or van pool expenses,  the hospital pays the fees for the second month. Employees then must resume the  payments.  </P> <P> The hospital plans to add 140 preferred parking spaces for car pools and van  pools.  </P> <P> The plan also calls for a hospital shuttle service for employees who live  within half a mile of the hospital and guarantees a ride home in case of  emergency for any employee who ride shares.  </P></p>

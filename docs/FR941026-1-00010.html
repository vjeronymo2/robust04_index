There are several subordinate issues related to cost. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Would air carriers provide child safety seats?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) What would it cost air carriers to purchase and maintain child safety seats?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) How often would child safety seats have to be replaced? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) How many times annually would child safety seats be used on air carrier aircraft?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) How many child safety seats would be purchased during a year by air carriers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. For a family traveling with infants, what is the price elasticity of demand for air travel?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) What fares doe air carriers now charge for infants currently seated in child safety seats?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If parents had to purchase a ticket for their child under the age of two and the price of the seats on their flight of choice was such that their only alternatives would be to (1) drive or (2) fly paying discount fares during off-peak hours (or a non-direct flight), which alternative would they choose?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Is there a difference in the elasticity of short versus long trips_(less than 300 miles and 300 miles or greater)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Is 300 miles the appropriate demarcation for a short versus a long trip for a family traveling with infants? What, if any, is a relevant demarcation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) What is the cross-price elasticity of demand for air and automobile travel for families traveling with infants?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What are the profiles of families with infants who drive? What are the profiles of families with infants who fly?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) How many infants are enplaned annually aboard domestic air carriers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) How many infants would be represented in an average size family that flies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) What is the average number of individuals in a family that flies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) How many families fly annually?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Of those families with infants who fly, what percent of families currently use child safety seats?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What are the infant and adult mortality rates for air travel, automobile travel, and other modes of transportation? There are several subordinate issues related to mortality rates. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

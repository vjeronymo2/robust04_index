			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Confectionery jobs to go ALMA Holdings, the confectionery maker that was placed in receivership last week, is to make 286 of its 775 staff redundant. The job losses will be split almost equally between two factories in Dundee, Tayside, and Glenrothes, Fife. KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, said that the company, which has sweet brands including Barker &amp; Dobson, Keiller and Hacks, had recently been losing about Pounds 1m a month. It added that the Dundee factory was on a three-day week. KPMG said it would prefer to sell the whole group but was ready to consider offers for parts of it. Several leading companies in the food and confectionery industries had made serious inquiries about the group.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (9): A clear contrast - The Rivals: Danske Bank vs Unibank DEN Danske Bank shocked the Danish public in February when it simultaneously reported a sizeable DKr1.3bn profit and announced that it was going to cut its staff by 20 per cent from 15,000 to 12,000 over the coming three years. It gave staff three months to consider offers of redundancy payments or, alternatively, face the risk that some of them would be dismissed. Danske, the result of a merger in 1990 of the former Danske Bank, Copenhagen Handelsbank and Provinsbanken, has established itself firmly in the lead as the country's biggest bank, with a balance sheet total of DKr363bn to the Unidanmark group's DK263bn. Unidanmark is the result of a 1990 merger between Privatbanken, SDS and Andelsbanken. The announcement of staff reductions, however, was in keeping with the disciplined culture of the bank. It is a culture which is reflected in a cautious lending policy, a conservative loss provisions policy, and a policy of sticking to doing what it knows best. It has avoided grand alliances, either with banks in other countries or with non-bank financial institutions, such as insurance and mortgage credit associations, at home. The bank has not ignored the potential from insurance and mortgage credit business, but is proceeding cautiously. It has a pilot project together with the Hafnia insurance group for selling standard accident policies from bank branches. It has set up its own life assurance company to help it attract long-term savings, and it is offering bond-backed, fixed interest mortgage credit to its own customers. There is a clear contrast between Danske and its rival. Unibank accepts bigger risks. It has, for example, a larger portfolio of property-related loans than Danske, and these go some way to explaining why the bank increased provisions to DKr5.4bn in 1991, some 3.1 per cent of loans and guarantees. 'Asset quality' was given as a reason when Moody's, the US rating agency, announced in February that it was reviewing Unibank's Aa2 long-term credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor's also has Unibank under review. A few days before publishing its 1991 results, Unibank announced a strengthening of its central credit control function. The purpose is to provide a better overview of the credit policies of its four divisions (domestic banking, merchant banking, trade and international divisions). 'We have introduced slightly more distance between the sellers of credit and the credit assessment function,' said Mr Steen Rasborg, Unidanmark's chief executive. The measure was announced in an eight-page internal paper to all employees, a paper which also suggested that any employees, at whatever level, who found difficulty in accepting management decisions should reconsider their position with the bank. The climate and morale among employees is excellent, explained Mr Rasborg, but the merger process had inevitably left a few people dissatisfied, including one or two who aired their views in the media. 'All we are saying now is that we don't want to hear any more complaining,' said Mr Rasborg. Unibank believes in alliances. It is involved in the Scandinavian Banking Partner alliance with Den norske Bank and Skandinaviska-Enskilda Bank and it plans to become part of a gigantic financial services group together with mortgage credit association Nykredit and Tryg, the insurance company. Nykredit and Tryg have already merged under a holding company. Danish legislation has so far hindered Unidanmark from joining them, but Mr Rasborg says that when the European Community's fifth company law directive comes into force, Danish law will have to be amended to permit the tie-up. The reason for Danske's decision to reduce its staff so substantially is found in the bank's meagre net interest earnings and earnings from fees and commissions, which declined from DKr10.22bn in 1990 to DKr9.82bn in 1991m. Earnings per krone of operating expenses fell from DKr1.64 to DKr1.54 compared with DKr1.58 for Unidanmark. Looking ahead, said Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive, budgets showed that this was an unsatisfactory level of primary operating profits, requiring action to ensure that profits return to a more satisfactory level. 'We want to see sound basic earnings,' he said. Earnings per krone of costs should be Dkr1.75-2.00, putting them in line with the performance of the more profitable Swedish banks, he told the Financial Times. The planned staff reductions should mean an improvement in earnings of DKr800m-900m, he said. The other large banks, including Unibank, managed to increase net interest and fee income last year. Among explanations put forward by Mr Sorensen for Danske's relatively poor performance on this count were that the relatively high quality of the lending portfolio may be reflected in the prices that the bank can take; tough competition for corporate sector loans in a market which increasingly international; failure of the economy to grow significantly; and the decline of the retail market, which now accounts for about 25 per cent of lending compared with 40 per cent a few years ago. This latter point reflects the fact that low inflation (only 2.5 per cent in 1991) and changes in the income tax regime have made saving worthwhile and borrowing much less attractive than it used to be, which has helped turn Denmark's long-standing deficit on the balance of payments current account into a surplus but has significantly changed the climate in which the banks must operate. Where Danske managed to pull ahead was on its provisions, which were reduced to DKr2.88bn, or 1.45 per cent of loans and guarantees, from DKr4.25bn in 1990, when the figure was inflated partly by the process of bringing the provisions policy of the three merging banks into line with each other.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Observer: Over the top Has no-one told James Sherwood, Sea Containers' ebullient boss, that a private helipad atop one's building is these days considered, well, a little vulgar? The company is seeking planning permission to park its choppers up to 10 times a week on its Blackfriars office roof. Vulgar or no, it was, however, the practical matter of noise that was on the minds of American-born Sherwood's neighbours as they trooped along to the recent two-week inquiry. Next door is the Oxo tower, where plans for a roof garden restaurant as part of a big restoration could be dished by the proximity of whirring blades. Bang opposite is the Inner Temple, whose delegation argued eloquently for the listed buildings and the right to throw wide the single-glazed windows in the summer. And 73-year-old Sam Wanamaker, one of Sherwood's fellow countrymen, who is almost single-handedly trying to resurrect the Globe Theatre, delivered a rousing peroration on the subject of how the first Shakespearian words heard on the site since 1644 were well nigh drowned by a police whirlybird. But then James Sherwood's Discriminating Guide to London would not have approved either. This neat little compendium detailing where to imbibe in the capital - both victuals and culture - published in the mid-1970s was quite stern about aural intrusion. A section entitled Not For Us included noisy eateries among the other pariahs.</p>

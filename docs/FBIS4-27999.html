			<p>BFN     [Commentary from the "Guest Column" by Omar Farouk: "A New  Post-Socialist Burma"]    [Text] Irreversible changes are taking place in Burma after  the "Young Turks" quietly forced the retirement of "the last  surviving soldier from the socialist era," General Saw Maung.  My recent visit to the country revealed that Ne Win's socialist  revolution is over. Karl Marx is out; Gautam Buddha is in.    Since early 1992 Slorc [State Law and Restoration Council],  led by a new generation of officer corps, has been reversing the  negative and ruinous policies of the now-defunct Burma Socialist  Party Programme (BSPP) that ruled Burma with an iron fist for 26  years. Under the Marxist-oriented socialist dictatorship, there  was told repression: [as published] politically, economically  and socially. Today, the degree of personal though not  political freedom has expanded enormously in Burma.    Social Changes: It's ironic but true that the  people are much freer today than they were under the one-party  socialist dictatorship. The powerful neighbourhood People's  Councils, which spied on the people for the party, have been  dismantled and replaced by citizens at the grassroots level.    Burmese no longer need 14-day permits for internal travel.  Once-forbidden border zones are now open to traders. Burmese  embassies now issue "visit visas" to former Burmese citizens;  decades-old suspended and expired passports are now being  renewed without any questions. Former Burmese nationals now  have the right of citizenship.    Even dissidents have been allowed to visit the country.  Former Prime Minister U Nu's daughter and her family were the  latest visitors. Than Than Nu and her husband, Ko Nyein, vocal  critics of the regime, were given back their passports. During  the revolution, those who left Burma were branded as "traitors  to the socialist cause" and were denied entry to the country --  for nearly three decades.    The exception was Aung San Suu Kyi. She had unrestricted  entry to Burma during the "dark Burmese days." After all, the  Burmese way to socialism was declared the continuation of her  father, Gen Aung San's dream.    People have gotten back religion. There is more freedom of  worship today. A Buddhist revival has spread throughout the  land. Monks have been relegated to their former supreme position  in society.    It's a bit of a shock to see the young generals prostrating  before the Sayadaws (senior monks) in public. No one recalls  seeing military or party officials bowing to the monks during  the socialist era. To the party ideologues, the clergy were  "meddlesome" and treated as "parasites." (Ironically, the monks  were the first to accuse the BSPP of being communist.)    The Burmese Muslims are again free to use loudspeakers from  the minarets. Visiting foreign pastors can now address their  congregations in churches. Pilgrimages to Mecca and the Vatican  are no longer a problem. The revolution of the mind has begun.    The Economy: From the very beginning of  independence in 1948, Burmese leaders, both civilian and  military, have been steadfast in building a socialist economy,  with little or no room for capitalist institutions. This was in  line with Aung San's thinking. The legendary Burmese  independence hero was the founding member of the Burma Communist  Party. U Nu and Gen. Ne Win were his comrades.    Under British rule, they were all leftists and "because  capitalism had worked to their disadvantage, they mistrusted  capital. And because capital is derived from profit they  mistrusted profit as an incentive to industry. And they  associated capitalism with foreign rule."    The civilian government of U Nu (1948-1962) preferred  Western  democratic socialism to communism. On the other extreme, the  BSPP chose Marxist socialism, which led to formal adoption of  the Sino- Soviet model of development and to a total denial of  the role of private enterprise.    Slorc's switch from command to market economy has done some  good for the country: life has returned to normal. Food and  consumer goods have filled up the once-bare shelves. The people  eat and dress better. The markets and bazaars are bustling.  The sidewalks are full of hawkers selling goods from Thailand,  China and India.    The department stores are stocked with electronics from  Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The shops in  Rangoon and Mandalay -- nationalised and shuttered for 26 years  -- have opened with a zest and proudly display their signboards.    The military have turned into entrepreneurs, too: Tatmadaw  [defense services]-owned department stores are now competing in  Mandalay and other cities.    The kon-the (trading) class is once again respectable after  being shunned, imprisoned and impoverished by the previous  socialist regime. Today they count their profits and losses in  dollars, baht and rupees. Under socialism, foreign exchange  dealings were illegal and "economic saboteurs" faced the death  penalty.    There are two currencies circulating in Burma today. One is  the overvalued kyat and the other is the Foreign Exchange Unit  or the "Burmese dollar" as the locals call it. The dollar  coupons signify a de facto devaluation of the kyat. The coupons  fetch slightly less than the US dollar, (the official rate is 6  kyat to the dollar). Burmese can open foreign exchange bank  accounts with the coupons and facilitate import and export.  Burma today has turned into a giant re-export centre, tapping  the two-billion-people market of China and India. To sum it up:  it is no longer a crime to make a living in Burma.    The Burmese way to socialism turned from a Utopian dream  into a nightmare. More people went to jail for "economic  crimes" (black marketing) than for political dissent during the  revolution. The people aptly nicknamed the infamous Insein Jail  "Moscow." The Burmese say, in the Soviet Union criminals are  sent to Siberia -- in Burma they send you to Moscow.    The socialist regime made up of fellow-travellers in the  army  and radical leftwing politicians -- brutalised a nation. In  order to create "a new socialist society of affluence," people  had their properties confiscated (nationalised), their money  cancelled (demonetised). The private sector was dealt a death  blow in 1964 when the entire economy was nationalised. These  disastrous moves levelled the society, forcing the fiercely  proud Burmese to beg, borrow and steal. Overnight, Burma became  a nation of black- marketeers.    The "Young Turks": From all indications General  Ne Win and his generation of nationalist army officers are  fading away into history. Taking over the command are the  younger generation of military officers. The "Young Turks" --  in their forties and early fifties -- have now moved into  important posts replacing the half-educated veterans of the  Burmese nationalist struggle for independence.    Graduates of the Maymyo military Academy and the Officers  Training Corps, the new commanders in the past never saw  eye-to-eye with the old guard. In July 1976, young army  officers attempted to overthrow the socialist regime. The plot  was discovered and the coup leader, Capt Ohn Kyaw Myint, was  executed. Although unsuccessful, the coup plotters had  denounced the socialist system. Since the removal of Gen Saw  Maung, pragmatic changes have taken place: the economy has been  unshackled, there is a thriving middle- class, fratricidal civil  war is coming to an end, economic and social freedoms have been  restored. Today, the military is devoid of ideology. Marxist  jargon used by politicians, intellectuals and the military over  the past half-century has been abandoned.    The draft constitution: The Burmese military is  under fire for demanding a constitutional role -- like in Turkey  -- that will fortify civilian rule. Most Burmese want stability  and expect trouble once power is transferred to the political  parties. Violence has been part of the political culture in  Burma, mainly because of factionalism. It's bizarre but true,  that the military takeovers in 1958 and 1962 were generally  welcomed by even the most articulate Burmese.    It should not come as a surprise to observers if the  military  steps in again when the civilians take power and a violent power  struggle erupts.    To many Burmese, the most important laws enshrined in the  draft constitution are: the State shall not nationalise  economic enterprises, and the State shall not make legal tender  illegal (demonetisation) -- the twin evils that pauperised the  nation. Both the democratic and Socialist constitutions of 1947  and 1974 call for the nationalisation of "capitalist"  enterprises.    NLD vs the Tatmadaw: The military is locked in a  power struggle with the former BSPP members who now control the  NLD [National League for Democracy]. Ex-members of the BSPP  politburo now serve on the Central Executive Committee of the  NLD. More than 80 per cent of those elected under the NLD  banner are former BSPP members and purged military officers.    Slorc claims that Suu Kyi has been "hijacked" by the  leftists. Some of these allegations are not totally baseless.  It is no secret that one of her top advisers is a former  communist, Thakin Tin Mya, an ex-member of BSPP Central  Committee. He was arrested along with other hardcore ex-BSPP  members. Not surprisingly, Slorc has cracked down hard on the  NLD while other moderate parties have been left alone.    There are many disturbing questions facing Suu Kyi today  which may resurface in the future to haunt her. Like, where was  Suu Kyi when the thousands of fleeing Burmese lost everything  during the socialist revolution: money, property, friends, a  whole way of life, a country.    And the West and Japan must be held responsible for  rewarding  and supporting a brutal socialist regime for 26 years -- the  most repressive in modern Burmese history. The kneejerk  reaction today by the West to the situation in Burma is too  little, too late. Plus, they are barking up the wrong tree.</p>

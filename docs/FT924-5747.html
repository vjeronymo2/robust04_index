			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone If the yuppie is dead and buried, someone is still using his phone. Vodafone produced results which would have been impressive even in the good old days. The 23 per cent rise in earnings per share underlined how the company is squeezing the most from all parts of its business. And while the weighting of capital expenditure and amortisation to the second half flatter the interim figures somewhat, there is no doubt that Vodafone's management has done a good job. However, any company producing an operating profit of Pounds 152m from Pounds 320m of sales is on to a pretty good thing. The UK cellular duopoly has served Vodafone well, and the management must be wondering how long its good fortune can last. The company is certainly doing its best to get its eggs out of one basket before the mobile phone market becomes more competitive. It is moving into cellular overseas and is developing digital systems aimed at both the pan-European business market and the not-very-mobile consumer. Still, margins on cellular will fall as extra competition enters the market. Vodafone still has to manage the transition from running a high-margin, low-volume operation to a low-margin mass-market range of services. Next year's proliferation of standards may postpone the day of reckoning if confused consumers hang back. But then investors with vertigo may feel nervous about a market value of Pounds 4bn for a company with about Pounds 500m assets.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAINTENANCE WILL EXTEND TOOL FUNCTION  </P> <P> A little preventive maintenance can extend the life of garden equipment and  make it safer and easier to use.  </P> <P> Throughout the season, it makes good sense to protect hand tools from rust.  Wash and dry then after use, and at the end of the season polish the metal  parts with steel wool, then wipe the metal with oil to prevent rust. Lubricate  tools that have moving parts, including grass, hedge and pruning shears. Use a  hammer to straighten bent metal edges.  </P> <P> To avoid injuries from s;linters on wooden handles, sand off all rough spots.  If the wood splits, apply waterproof glue to the area and strap outdoor plastic  tape over, above and below the split.  </P> <P> Fall is a good time to fix those pesky leaks. To repair small cracks and holes  in a hose, spread a thick layer of rubber glue over the crack. Bend the crack  open to allow some of the glue to seep in: let it dry for about 15 minutes.  Apply a second coat. After the second layer has dried, wind an overlapping  strip of friction or plastic tape over, above and below the crack.  </P></p>

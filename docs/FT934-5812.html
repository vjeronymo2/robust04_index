			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Silja's mature Czech monster / Review of Janacek's 'The Makropoulos Case' in Vienna After spending most of her career in German roles, Anja Silja has found a new lease of life portraying the mature female monsters of Janacek's operas. First came Kostelnicka in Jenufa at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. Now she is focusing on the grandest and most pathetic of them all - Emilia Marty in The Makropoulos Case, which she has just sung in Vienna and will repeat at Glyndebourne in 1995. Her stage magnetism is perfectly suited to this opera, so much so that the new production at the Volksoper turns out to be even more of a one-woman show than usual. Anyone looking for a summation of all Janacek's previous female portraits - which is how some commentators view the heroine of Makropoulos - will be disappointed, for Silja avoids extremes of pathos or the grotesque. Instead, we get a distillation of the histrionic skills which have made her such a charismatic singing actress these past 30 years: the erotic power of a Lulu, the scheming calculation of an Ortrud, the self-destructive passion of Elektra. If that sounds more than a touch Germanic, it suits the expressionist style of this German-language production. The character is established before she sings a note. The wide-rimmed black hat and fur coat announce a grande dame, the flowing red wig reeks of temperament and the leather trousers suggest this fictional 337-year old is real and young at heart. With her tall, slim figure, Silja carries it off in style, her stage manner a mixture of purposeful stillness and dynamic gestures. Small wonder everything around her pales into insignificance. Act two produces some authentic diva behaviour, and after the subsequent humiliations - all graphically realised - she sings the closing monologue from the front of the orchestra pit, dressed in nothing more than a long black underskirt. What saves it from melodrama is the giant conviction she invests in every word. The voice is still strong, if not perfectly steady, and she is more than a match for Janacek's terse declamatory lines. She deserves better support from her production team. Under Isaac Karabtchevsky, the Volksoper orchestra was poorly balanced and slack. The staging devised by Christine Mielitz and her designer Reinhard Heinrich looked like a bad night at the Komische Oper in Berlin, where both are based. The decor was skimpy and poorly lit, consisting of little more than interchangeable blocks and ill-defined projections. There was too much movement, much of it needlessly brutalist. As a result, the Volksoper ensemble made little impact. Kurt Schreibmayer turned Gregor into an ardent wooer, Wicus Slabbert made an unusually sinister Prus and Ernst-Dieter Suttheimer's Hauk was a beautifully eccentric sketch. Discounting visits by Czech companies from Brno and Prague, this is the first staging of The Makropoulos Case in Vienna. Broucek, Vixen and House of the Dead have already been given at the Volksoper. Jenufa and Katya Kabanova are in the Staatsoper's repertory, and Osud was given a concert performance last year. But judging by this production, the Viennese approach to Janacek is still somewhat cavalier. Thanks to Anja Silja alone, Volksoper audiences have seen what Makropoulos is really about.</p>

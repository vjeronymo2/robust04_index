			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by unidentified </F> reporter after the cabinet meeting in Vienna on 15 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified reporter] The cabinet today  discussed the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic  and the trip of a delegation of Austrian experts scheduled to  arrive in the United States today. Chancellor Vranitzky  described the task of the experts as follows:    [Vranitzky] The main job of the experts delegation is to  explain in Washington that we believe that the coal power  stations that contaminate the environment in the Czech Republic  can be replaced by methods other than the construction of  nuclear power plants. As is known, we have developed numerous  concepts in this respect and have presented them to the Czechs.  We were also prepared to offer financing and other forms of  industrial cooperation.    It will also be important to point out in Washington that  the  Temelin nuclear power plant would not correspond to U.S.  environmental standards. It is not yet clear whether our  experts will be able to attend the hearing in Congress.  However, this is not the most important thing. The most  important thing for our experts is to talk with the advisers and  the scientific staff of the congressmen and with the advisers  and officials of the Exim bank during their stay, and to explain  Austria's position there. These are the plans as far as the  trip of the delegation to the United States is concerned.    Referring to the discussion in Austria that has been going  on  for several days, I would like to state the following: The  discussion is mainly characterized by domestic aspects. There  have been massive attacks and exaggerated demands -- above all,  by Greens deputies. It seems obvious to me that the Greens have  realized that a topic on which they may have liked to focus has  been taken up by the government, that the government has adopted  a clear position on the issue. This is the way I interpret  things. Other similar statements can probably also be  considered domestic politicking.    [Reporter] Does the fact that an Austrian bank mainly owned  by the state has issued option bonds for stocks of a company  that builds Temelin not make the mission in the United States  more difficult?    [Vranitzky] A report from sources close to the Austrian  People's Party brought up this matter. I can only state the  following: According to information provided by the general  manager of the Bank Austria, the bank was not involved in  financing the Temelin power plant. It was invited by Citibank  last year to participate in the large-scale international  financing of the project, but declined to do so. As we all  know, it has transpired that a subsidiary of Bank Austria  offered option bonds. I have been assured that the management  has in the meantime stopped this. The lie was spread that the  manager of the Bank Austria, Randa, briefed me for weeks about  Bank Austria's financial projects in connection with Temelin.  This is simply a lie -- in two respects. First, the bank did  not finance the Temelin power plant, and -- second -- this means  that it was not possible to brief me on anything. I do not hold  any position in this bank. Thus, this also belongs to the realm  of domestic politicking, as mentioned earlier.</p>

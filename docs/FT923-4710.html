			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UN agrees pact on chemical arms The UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament agreed yesterday to send a treaty banning chemical weapons to the United Nations for approval, despite a last-minute Iranian objections, Reuter reports from Geneva. The decision ended 24 years of negotiations on the pact, which were deadlocked by cold war rivalry. It will ban the use, possession and manufacture of chemical arms. Iran, victim of chemical attacks in the Iran-Iraq war, opposed the composition of the body that would supervise the treaty.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Militant Comment" column: "The `Scrupulous' </F> Package"]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton described the package of  confidence-building measures submitted by UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali as balanced and scrupulous and called on the  two sides to accept it. We doubt whether the U.S. President has  found time to deal with Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building  measures. Some employees at the White House or State Department  have again written the President's report, which appears to be  three months late. Consequently, Clinton's report is outdated  and out of touch with reality. Cypriot Hellenism demands that  the U.S. President view the Cyprus issue seriously and honestly  and stop acting as others have. He promised in Brussels that  when he returned to Washington he would personally deal with the  Cyprus issue. Instead of dealing with the substance and trying  to promote an honest solution, he is signing documents presented  to him by officials and submitting worthless reports written by  bureaucrats. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will come to Cyprus at the  weekend but it appears that he will come to resuscitate the  confidence-building measures. Unfortunately, the Americans do  not appear willing to get seriously and effectively involved in  the Cyprus issue and this disappoints Cypriot Hellenism.</p>

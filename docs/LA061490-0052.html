			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER PLEADS GUILTY TO MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A teacher at Knox Elementary School pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of  molesting two 12-year-old female students.  </P> <P> Ernest Booker Brown, 48, who has been in custody since his arrest Nov. 30,  1989, entered into a plea bargain agreement Tuesday in which 26 other sex  charges involving the same girls were dropped.  </P> <P> Brown faces a maximum sentence of eight years in state prison and a $10,000  fine. Upon his release on parole, he must register as a sex offender.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz said the pleas were taken to avoid traumatizing  the girls, who would have had to testify in open court at the trial, scheduled  for Friday.  </P> <P> They testified at Brown's preliminary hearing in February, but that hearing was  closed to the press and public.  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for July 11.  </P> <P> Brown pleaded guilty to performing lewd acts on the girls that occurred in 1987  and 1988.  </P> <P> Because of his felony conviction for molestation, Brown will probably lose his  teaching credential.  </P></p>

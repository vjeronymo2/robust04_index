			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Setback at Novell in fourth term Novell, the leading supplier of software for personal computer networks and Microsoft's biggest rival in the personal computer software market, reported a decline in fourth-quarter earnings. Sales of PC applications programs fell, largely because of delays in the introduction of a planned suite of office software. Novell said it would launch the long-awaited product, Perfect Office, today. Net earnings for the fourth quarter to October 29, totalled Dollars 20m, or 6 cents a share, after Dollars 61m merger and restructuring charges. Excluding the charges, earnings were Dollars 61m, or 17 cents, below Wall Street forecasts of about 22 cents. In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 103m, or 28 cents, before charges, and Dollars 88m, or 24 cents, after charges. Revenues for the quarter declined 5 per cent to Dollars 486m from Dollars 509m last year. The 1994 charges relate to Novell's acquisition of WordPerfect, a PC applications software publisher, and Borland International's spreadsheet products. Charges in 1993 were in connection with Novell's acquisition of UNIX System Laboratories. For the full year, Novell reported revenues of Dollars 2bn, up 9 per cent from Dollars 1.83bn in fiscal 1993. Net income was Dollars 207m, or 56 cents a share, compared with Dollars 41m, or 11 cents. The results include non-recurring charges of Dollars 196m in 1994 and Dollars 357m in 1993. Total revenue grew 9 per cent from a year earlier, although it varied across product groups. Sales of Novell's flagship NetWare program were up 11 per cent at Dollars 1bn.</p>

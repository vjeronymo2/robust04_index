The  department paid $5 for each tagged catch.  </P> <P> Top winner was Robert Loll of La Habra, who landed a 29-pound, 4-ounce  specimen. He received a trip for two to fish the Great Barrier Reef in  Australia.  </P> <P> Second place went to Steve John of Westminster who hooked a 25-pound, 3-ounce  halibut.

Russ Izor's boat, First String. According to organizer Tony Salas,  last year's trip paid for more than 8,000 meals at the Los Angeles Rescue  Mission. The cost for the event, which includes more than $1,000 in prizes and  drawings, is $75 per angler. Call Salas at (818) 244-5348.  </P> <P> Three Avalon siblings dropped their lines at Little Harbor while aboard their  boat, May Time, and found plenty of action.  </P> <P> Ryan Kerr got a bite from a 40-pound sand shark just as his sister, Justine,  hooked a 14-pound halibut. Meanwhile, brother Phil tossed a line baited with  squid overboard and got an immediate tug from a 16-pound white sea bass. All  three catches were landed.  </P> <P> Ron Hardcastle of San Pedro, fishing from a skiff outside the kelp beds near  Pt. Fermin, caught a 10-pound halibut, then moved out to deeper water, tossing  baited jigs in search of small calico bass. The fish refused to bite, so he  removed the jig and inserted a hook with live squid. He reeled in a white sea  bass that weighed just under 12 pounds.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Tom Honaker of Long Beach, fishing aboard the City of Seal  Beach at the Oil Rigs, caught the whopper of the week, a 36-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> The cows were out of the barn again last week. Sandy Bross of Redondo Beach,  fishing aboard the Blackjack at the Cherry Bank, won the jackpot with a  25-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> John Nance of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 19-pound  cow cod at San Nicolas Island.  </P> <P> And James Tani of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina  Island, won the jackpot with a 19-pound cow.  </P></p>

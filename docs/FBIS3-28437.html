			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The obstacle lying  in the way of reunification at present is the anti-national  separatist Kim Yong-sam regime, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed  article today.    Stressing that this regime must be toppled, it says:    The record of nearly one year after the appearance of the  present regime in South Korea proves in stark reality that the  Kim Yong-sam group is the heinous enemy of national  reunification.    In his "inaugural address" the traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed  eloquent about "the priority of the nation." But, in no time, he  resumed the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, which had  been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic Regime",  against the North in league with outside forces and drove the  North-South relations into a dangerous phase under the pretext  of North's "nuclear problem." The puppets intercepted a letter  containing the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation sent by the North to the South Korean authorities and  representatives of different political parties, organisations  and public figures and even totally rejected the North's  proposal for the exchange of special envoys.    After taking office the traitor Kim Yong-sam has utterly  ignored the reunification question and repeated the trite  "stage-by-stage" doctrine of the preceding dictators.    In his "New Year address" and "New Year press conference",  he  did not utter even a word about reunification but spun out trash  decrying the North and getting on its nerve. From this we can  foresee that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime will work viciously  to aggravate the North-South relations and block reunification  this year, too.    If the cause of national reunification is to be promoted, a  powerful force for reunification must be built up and, at the  same time, the force obstructive to reunification must be  decisively removed. The movement for independence, democracy  and reunification must be developed to a new, higher stage in  South Korea to topple the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" fascist  dictatorship.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION 89;  </P> <P> ARMANI EXPANDS HIS TASTE FOR NEW VENTURES  </P> <P> Fettuccine Armani? It's possible, beamed Giorgio Armani, who stopped in Los  Angeles for a few hours last Friday and announced, among other things, that  he'll have restaurants in his new Emporio shops slated to open in Europe this  spring.  </P> <P> Emporio Armani is the Italian designer's zippy young sportswear collection for  men and women, with lower prices than his regular Giorgio Armani lines. It is  fast becoming the status label among trendy young Europeans, who buy it in 150  free-standing Emporio shops that dot the Continent and will soon invade the  Orient and the United States.  </P> <P> Plans for expansion of Emporio, which Armani calls "my favorite child," include  10 new boutiques in England, 10 in Germany, 4 in France and 75 in Japan. A  10,000-square-foot Emporio will open on lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in  March.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First to Open  </P> <P> The first Cafe Armani opens Feb. 14 within the new Emporio in the Knightsbridge  district of London, Armani said. The 50-seat eatery will have the decor of a  sleek, 1930s railroad dining car and will offer light, all-natural foods like  those he eats. (Armani serves simple, vegetarian meals at his own home, a  16th-Century palazzo in Milan.)  </P> <P> Another Armani restaurant, same menu, will open in March in his new Florence,  Italy, shop.  </P> <P> Armani has looked for the right spot to open a Los Angeles Emporio, but says he  hasn't found it yet. Besides, he admitted, he'd like to make sure his recently  opened Rodeo Drive Giorgio Armani boutique is properly launched before he  commits to any other L.A. endeavors.  </P> <P> He needn't worry. The King of Italian fashion has a worldwide clientele of the  fashionable and famous, including many top Hollywood names. (He will reportedly  do costumes for an upcoming Meryl Streep film, but would not confirm it.)  </P> <P> And as proof of their devotion, about 40 Los Angeles friends turned up for a  luncheon last Friday to which they were invited only hours before. (Armani had  a 5-hour layover here on his way home to Milan from vacation in Bora Bora.)  </P> <P> The last-minute Bistro Gardens guest list included Lakers coach Pat Riley (who  wears Armani on the cover of GQ this month), Elton John, Dennis Hopper, Ali  MacGraw, Alexander Godunov, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Diane Lane, Gordon Thompson,  "Mississippi Burning" director Alan Parker, Mike and Patricia Medavoy and  sculptor Robert Graham.  </P> <P> After lunch, the designer inspected his new Rodeo Drive shop, which he hadn't  seen since its completion.  </P> <P> How did he like the store?  </P> <P> "I would need days to understand this space, which is all about subtlety and  details," he replied.  </P> <P> It was a thoughtful appraisal of the 13,000-square-foot boutique, which ranks  among the more elaborate architectural understatements in L.A. retailing. It is  the largest of his U.S. boutiques and is expected to gross $17 million this  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He Is a Rare Species  </P> <P> Armani is not glib. And though his life style appears relaxed and his social  connections glamorous, he is known within the industry as a workaholic, a  perfectionist and a design genius. He is also prolific. In addition to the  multiple menswear and women's-wear collections he designs each season, he said  he personally designs all the shoes, ties, scarfs, umbrellas, belts and other  accessories that bear his logo. In other words, he is that rare species: a  successful designer with no licensees. "I would never sell my name for use by  someone else, just to earn money."  </P> <P> Since 1974, when he first designed under his own label, Armani has won  worldwide acclaim for inventing unconstructed men's clothes and minimalist  women's sportswear so unique that they are immediately identifiable as Armani  to any fashion buff who sees them.  </P> <P> But what on Earth was this taste maker wearing on his feet, a reporter asked on  Friday, staring at what looked suspiciously like well-worn American Topsiders.  "They're by Timberland," Armani laughed. "I only wear them on holiday."  </P> <P> Nor was he dressed to impress. His pale, cotton knit polo shirt, rumpled jacket  and blue wash pants were obviously vacation clothes, which he said he had worn  for 14 hours on the plane and then out to lunch. If he had been "dressed as  usual," he would have been in the navy sweater and gray pants outfit he  normally wears to greet guests after fashion shows in the theater of his Milan  home.  </P> <P> "I wear navy because I don't like to be noticed and it helps to fade me out,"  Armani said, typically humble. As Women's Wear Daily once wrote of him, "like a  simple, country doctor, Armani's manner and personality are devoid of  affectation. There are no stereotyped fashion house-head mannerisms."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Profits and Awards  </P> <P> In fact, to hear Armani talk, he doesn't even realize he's "arrived." Forget  the $350-million annual gross, the numerous fashion awards, the worldwide  reputation for creativity and understated elegance. Armani leaned back in his  chair the other day, pondered his goals and announced he "would like to build  something lasting."  </P> <P> "I want all my boutiques, and the merchandise inside them, to have  lasting-power. Nothing must be disposable or good for just one season or two.  That sounds simple, but it is the hardest thing for a designer to do."  </P> <P> Yes, but his clothes are already collectors' items, worn until they are  threadbare by some of his fans.  </P> <P> "I want to do the same for home furnishings," Armani said. He will begin with  Emporio-label stationery, paper goods and sachets, he said. Eventually, he will  design all sorts of Emporio home accessories, including bed linens and towels.  </P></p>

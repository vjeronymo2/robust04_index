			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / EC threatens trade curbs on Croatia: Belgian minister sent to issue warning THE European Community will this week threaten Croatia with trade sanctions unless it halts aggression in Bosnia, EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday. Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, will deliver the warning during a trip to former Yugoslavia, where he is also due to meet the Serb and Bosnian Moslem leaders. Mr Claes' mission follows weekend talks in Geneva aimed at persuading Bosnia's Moslems to accept a UN-EC brokered plan to turn Bosnia into a confederation of three republics. During a meeting in Brussels yesterday, divisions emerged over how tough a policy to adopt toward Croatia. The UK and France were ready to withdraw existing EC trade privileges, but Germany warned that this could trigger an exodus among the 750,000 refugees in Croatia. Mr Claes will visit former Yugoslavia on behalf of the Belgian presidency of the EC. He will urge the Bosnian Moslems to take part in the UN-EC negotiations, while warning President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia that a political settlement must be acceptable to all parties, including a 'viable Moslem entity' in Bosnia. The Belgian foreign minister will not travel as part of the EC 'troika' of past, present and future presidencies. The inclusion of Greece, which take over the EC presidency in January, might have proved controversial because of the Athens government's close ties to Serbia. Diplomats said yesterday this was a further sign of the difficulties of reaching a common EC foreign and security policy as envisaged under the Maastricht treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, urged member states to intensify the humanitarian aid effort to head off a potential disaster this winter. The Community had provided 68 per cent of the emergency aid to former Yugoslavia, with the UK having stumped up Dollars 68m (Pounds 45m) plus an additional Dollars 27m at last week's UN conference in Geneva. Mr Hurd insisted that aid was flowing to the besieged Moslem populations and raised hopes that the UN may be able to muster the minimum 7,500 troops required to defend the six designated 'safe havens.' Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian peace envoy, yesterday met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. He urged the leaders of all sides to stop the fighting in Bosnia so that top-level talks could take place in Geneva. While the Russian envoy described as 'positive' his meeting with Mr Milosevic, he conceded that they had a 'difficult' discussion on Serbia's decision to expel the mission of the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Mr Milosevic so far has refused to extend the mandate for the international monitors of human and minority rights in Serbia.</p>

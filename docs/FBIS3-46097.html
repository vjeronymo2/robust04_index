			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hohhot, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing is to get  more electricity from the neighboring Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Region in the next few years.    By 1995 the capacity of power supply from Inner Mongolia is  to rise to 1.50 million kw, and by 2000 that figure will climb  to five million kw, according to the power department of the  region.    Beijing gets one seventh of its electric power from Inner  Mongolia, which is rich in coal resources. Since 1990 a total  of four billion kwh of electricity have been transmitted to  Beijing from the region.    In the past, most of the herdsmen in the region had to rely  on cow dung for heat and light, and as late as the 1950s there  were only seven small power plants with a total capacity of  1,750 kw in the autonomous region. But by 1987 the total  electricity production capacity in the autonomous region had  surpassed 800,000 kw.    Officials said that since 1988 a group of large  thermoelectric power plants have been built. So far, the  generating capacity has topped 2.40 million kw -- more than  enough to meet the local demand.    At present, several large power plants are still under  construction. Upon their completion in 1995 they will increase  the total capacity to eight million kw.</p>

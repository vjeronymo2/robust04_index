			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> TOUCHING '50S-STYLE NOVEL OF A MAN, WOMEN HE LOVES  </P> <P> Loving Women by Pete Hamill (Random House: $18.95; 414 pages)  </P> <P> "Loving Women" is aptly sub-titled "A Novel of the Fifties," and more than  anything else it is that. Written by a self-styled old guy, this is a  thoughtful and touching recollection of the days around the Korean War and what  it was like to be a youth in those days; to yearn above all to know how to be  cool; to know about Bird and Dizzy -- to have saved your pennies to hear Art  Tatum for one last time before his death, to go out (again, just as a kid, a  timid little white kid, to some black club in the farthest Southern Boondocks)  and hear a weird black guy (our own, dear, famous Little Richard) sing -- for  the first, first time in the author's consciousness -- the magically evocative  "Awop-Bop-a-Loo-Mop Alop-Bam-Boom!"  </P> <P> Really, "Loving Women" is several novels at once. At its most accessible, it's  a chest-beating, masculinist, How-I-got-to-be-the-guy-I-am narrative, with  literary ancestors as disparate as Norman Mailer's "The Deer Park" and "An  American Dream," Horace McCoy's "Scalpel," Irwin Shaw's "Two Weeks in Another  Town" and '50s cult-classics like Wirt Williams' "Love in a Windy Space," and  Gene D'Olive's "Chiara." In all these novels, the hero-narrators feel blue as  they edge into a perceived, dry, middle age, but they are, in one way or  another, saved by the love of a "bad" woman, a woman of uninhibited flesh who  physically nudges them back to life. (Hamill's novel follows this paradigm  perfectly, with the pleasing side effect that these sex scenes prove beyond a  doubt that he, Hamill, really does know about "loving women" and that Norman  Mailer is still just a timid Girl Scout in this particular area.)  </P> <P> But -- if I read correctly -- I don't think that's what this book is really  about. "Loving Women" really may be about loving women, an unlikely subject for  a real he-man novel. At the beginning of this narrative, Mike Devlin, a  burnt-out news-photographer, is locked into a supremely irritating relationship  with his third wife, a New York feminist who insists on "intimacy," asking him  how many women he's had. When he tells her the number comes to about 1,200 over  a period of 30 years she can't stand the truth and has a four-star tantrum.  (Reviewer's note: I'd bet the family property that the original number here was  12,000. One new woman every 8 1/2 weeks seems awfully low for an authentic  hard-boiled journalist who grew up in the '50s. Devlin would have been stripped  of his photographer's jacket for a figure in the wimpy hundreds, considering  it's a period as long as 30 years.)  </P> <P> Anyway. Devlin's third wife leaves him. And, in a funk, Devlin tries to  remember if he ever loved anyone. Yes. The first. A woman in the South named  Eden Santana. A woman he met as a green Navy recruit when he served at Ellyson  Field near Pensacola, Fla. Flash back to the year 1953, when Devlin, 17 and  still a virgin, voyages away from a stark, unloving, austere Catholic childhood  in Brooklyn to the experiences that will make him into a "man."  </P> <P> At first, Mike is so sexually preoccupied he can only see sex, feel sex,  breathe sex. And, along with his horny longings, he meets handfuls of other  recruits who could have come from a World War II movie: An Italian, a Jew, a  dreadful creep named Red Cannon who has a dreadful reason for his creepiness.  But beyond these expected characters, Mike encounters a nice guy who's gay and  terribly tormented, and a black musician who's fought in Korea, and a woman 14  years older than Mike, who teaches him to love women, shows him what a loving  woman should be.  </P> <P> This lady, Eden Santana, is a creature of layered mysteries whose secrets  shouldn't be given away here. But the main thing is that she's believable,  unashamed, a little goofy, and though she withholds the truth, she's never  afraid of it. By the end of this novel, Mike Devlin has received a double  education in his first six months away from home -- to feel or not to feel, to  love or not to love; to accept the man's world (all the reasons, for instance,  for the Navy's authoritarianism), or to decide to live his life intuitively, to  be alive. If I read the last page here correctly, this is an amazing book. If I  don't, it's still a touching, nostalgic, affectionate embrace of a novel.  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Peres says talks best 10 days ever MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the latest round of Middle East peace talks in Washington yielded 'the best 10 days ever' in Israeli-Syrian relations, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US acting secretary of state, was similarly optimistic yesterday, saying there had been important movement in the US-brokered talks between Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians, which adjourned on Thursday. Mr Peres told Israeli television: 'In the 44 years since the founding of Israel, there have never been 10 days like these in Syrian-Israeli relations . . . From the peace standpoint, these have been the best 10 days ever.' Israel has long seen Syria as its most implacable enemy. It has formally been at war with Israel since the Jewish state was established in 1948. However, some Arab delegates expressed disappointment that Israel had not shown more flexibility. 'We have seen improvement in atmosphere, in tone, in style, but we haven't seen yet that promise in change concerning substantive matters,' Mr Mouwafaq al-Allaf, chief Syrian delegate, told reporters. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said yesterday both Israel and Syria had yet to set out their full negotiating positions. 'I don't think the Syrians have yet shown all their cards, just as we haven't shown all our cards. We have not revealed what price we are prepared to pay in exchange for full peace,' he told Israeli television. The talks had been scheduled to run for a month, but the Israelis have asked for a 10-day recess for consultations.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Painful path to zero inflation THE PRIME minister still does not seem willing to acknowledge what membership of the ERM means. In this he is in the company of most of the great and the good. ERM membership guaranteed neither economic growth in the future nor recovery now. It means being tied to the Bundesbank, an institution that has never shown more than a passing interest in the UK. What the Bundesbank does guarantee is a painful, possibly erratic, journey to low inflation. The pain is undeniable. Between its trough in April 1990 and June 1992, unemployment has risen by 1,126,000, from 5.6 per cent of the labour force to 9.6 per cent. The rate of increase is slowing, but unemployment is still up by 171,500 this year. At a seasonally adjusted 2.7m, unemployment is back where it was in August 1987. In addition, manufacturing output fell by 8.2 per cent between its peak in April 1990 and May 1992. This year the decline has ceased, though May was an unexpectedly poor month, registering a fall of 0.6 per cent. Manufacturing output is now no higher than it was in April 1988. More happily, the underlying increase in annual earnings was down to 6 1/2 per cent in the year to May 1992. Over the past six months earnings have risen at an annual rate of only 4.7 per cent, while pay settlements are now running at below 4 per cent. Price inflation, too, is falling. The increase in the prices of manufactured products was 3.6 per cent in the year to June 1992. Meanwhile, unit labour costs in manufacturing rose by 2.9 per cent in the year to May. With output per head in manufacturing up 4 per cent over the 12 months to May, lower pay settlements should mean an end to the squeeze on profits generated by membership of the ERM. Has the disinflationary gain been worth the pain? Whether inflation at 0-2 per cent is better for an economy than at 5-6 per cent is not something on which certainty is possible. But the cost is a certainty: 1.1m jobs have been lost for a fall of four percentage points in underlying consumer price inflation. At that rate, zero inflation might mean close to 4m unemployed. No choice Whether zero inflation is what the government wants must be doubted. But it is in no position to choose. So long as the UK is in the ERM, the prime minister has to accept whatever rate of inflation (or even price deflation) is produced by the rate of interest that allows sterling to stay within its band. With the margin between the Bundesbank's Lombard rate and British base rate only a quarter of a percentage point, what happens depends on Germany. On Thursday precisely what this means was made still plainer. The Bundesbank decided to raise the discount rate - its floor rate for lending to commercial banks - from 8 to 8 3/4 per cent. While this should have little direct effect on money markets, it has already led to a comparable increase in the Italian discount rate. Limping recovery More important than the increase is what it says about the Bundesbank's mood. A cut in German interest rates this year looks as likely as a win on the football pools. A cut of more than one percentage point next year looks little more probable. As UK inflation falls further, real rates of interest, both short and long term, will rise. Short-term real interest rates of 7 per cent by the end of this year are conceivable. Next year's could be higher still. Much more than a limping recovery looks more a hope than a reasonable expectation. But 'low inflation one, recovery nil' is not the end of this match. If growth does not pick up quite soon, the public sector's finances will be limping off the field injured. One city economist who foresaw the prolongation of the recession into this year, Bill Martin of Phillips and Drew, suggests that the public sector borrowing requirement may be Pounds 40bn in 1993-94. On current spending plans and only a limited recovery, the PSBR would be 8-9 per cent of GDP by 1996, the year in which the UK is pledged to reach the Maastricht target of 3 per cent. Something would have to give, certainly public spending, probably the Maastricht target and possibly even the government's desire not to increase taxes. Well before that, long-term interest rates would rise. Moreover, if the government feels it must offer such attractive terms to those members of the public who invest in National Savings, increases in mortgage rates beyond those announced yesterday are also likely. What price recovery in the housing market then? This government committed itself to the ERM knowingly, after German unification. It did so presumably understanding that any policy to lower inflation was bound to be costly. The real problem is different. It is not that disinflation has been costly, as that no end is in sight. Long after inflation has fallen to a level that any reasonable person would think low enough, the economy may still be stagnant. Low inflation does not guarantee that there will be a strong recovery. All the government can do is pray that, despite German unification, it will produce one nevertheless.</p>

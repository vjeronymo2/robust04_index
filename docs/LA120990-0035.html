			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO / BRADLEY INMAN;  </P> <P> STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND HAS PLENTY FOR RAINY DAYS AHEAD  </P> <P> At least one part of state government isn't inflicted with a budget ailment. As  lawmakers grapple with an estimated $4.3-billion state budget deficit, the  Unemployment Insurance Fund has $5.6 billion in reserves. Financial analysts  say the plump unemployment kitty should be more than enough to cover the costs  of a climbing jobless rate.  </P> <P> Mandated by a federal law but administered by the state, the 55-year-old fund  is responsible for paying out unemployment insurance benefits to workers who  have lost their jobs. The fund was created in 1935 to protect workers from the  worst ravages of unemployment and keep money flowing through the economy.  </P> <P> After eight years of strong growth, the California fund has a record high  balance -- it has nearly doubled in the past five years.  </P> <P> Plus, when the unemployment rate rises, the tax will go up, which shores up the  fund. The number of people receiving unemployment insurance benefits has  increased to 386,700 in 1990 from 293,400 in 1989 because of a sharp increase  in layoffs in the state. A year ago, 721,000 California workers were out of  work; today, 884,000 are.  </P> <P> On Jan. 1, the ceiling for unemployment insurance benefits will jump to $210  from $190 a week. In 1992, it will go up to $230.  </P> <P> When lawmakers were negotiating the benefits last year, "the arguments were the  same," said Carol Ross, research director at the California Taxpayers Assn. in  Sacramento. "Labor wanted higher benefits and said the fund was too fat, and  business said reduce the tax and save the surplus for a rainy day."  </P> <P> After the two sides agreed on a new benefits and tax formula, they finally got  the governor's support with a bill that increased benefits but also tightened  up who is entitled to unemployment insurance. Nationwide, there is concern that  the number of jobless collecting unemployment is shrinking. But in California,  the percentage of unemployed who receive benefits has jumped to 43% today from  36% in 1984. That could decrease with the new eligibility requirements,  however.  </P> <P> Beginning Jan. 1, new rules require unemployed workers to have earnings of at  least $1,250 in any three-month period of their previous jobs. This is up from  $1,200. It will increase to $1,300 in 1992.  </P> <P> California still has lower unemployment benefits than most other states. Its  average is $127 a week, which ranks California 37th among all states. The  highest benefits are paid in Massachusetts, with an average weekly benefit of  $211.  </P> <P> The unemployment insurance fund is often hailed for its fairness to employers.  Businesses that have high turnover have a higher tax rate; those that keep  workers for a long period pay the least.  </P> <P> California businesses pay two unemployment insurance taxes: a 0.8% federal tax  on the first $7,000 of income for each employee, which covers the costs of  administering the federal and state unemployment insurance program. A state tax  covers the cost of benefits and ranges from 0.1% to 5.4% on the first $7,000 of  taxable income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manufacturing Yields More, Better Jobs  </P> <P> Communities interested in creating more jobs, higher incomes and more sales  should recruit a big manufacturing plant -- not a supermarket or a computer  research facility -- a new study by the state Department of Commerce says.  </P> <P> Dubbed "The Economic Benefits of 100 New Jobs," the analysis examines the  benefits a new business with 100 employees would bring to a community.  </P> <P> The conclusion is that the multiplier effect from 100 manufacturing jobs is  much greater than the economic spinoff from retail or service industries.  </P> <P> For example, a new supermarket in the San Joaquin Valley that employs 100  workers would generate 67 more jobs in the community, but a manufacturing  facility, such as a food processer, would spawn 480 more jobs. Also, food  processing workers earn 54% higher salaries than retail clerks in the San  Joaquin Valley.  </P> <P> For those cities that are hungry for tax revenue, however, retail is a better  option. The food processing plant will generate an estimated $320 million in  tax revenue, while the supermarket brings in $761 million in tax receipts.  </P> <P> But "if the choice is manufacturing or service jobs, manufacturing is still the  way to go," said Lance Barnett, chief economist of the Department of Commerce  in Sacramento. "Manufacturing gives workers a better job ladder to earn more  and move up," he said.  </P> <P> Despite the drop in manufacturing nationwide, Barnett said, the sector is  strong in California. In the past 10 years, manufacturing employment rolls grew  to 2,158,000 from 2,018,000, and the state's share of manufacturing jobs  nationwide climbed from 8% to 11%.  </P></p>

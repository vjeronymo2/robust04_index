			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by Peter </F> Pirker; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Pirker] As far as the timing and the priority of  participation in Partnership for Peace with NATO are concerned,  are you siding with the chancellor rather than your party  chairman, who wants cooperation with NATO as early as now?    [Fasslabend] This would certainly be far too one-sided or an  incorrect representation of a contrast that does not exist. The  first priority of Austria's security policy is entering the  European Union, integration within the joint security policy of  the 12 states. Ranking second are integration and active  participation in the Western European Union, whose importance  will probably further increase in the future because the  Europeans themselves will have to do more for their security in  the future. Third, cooperation with NATO certainly is to be  continued and developed. I have clearly expressed this. In the  future, our relations with NATO will be as friendly and based on  partnership as those with Sweden and France were in the past.</p>

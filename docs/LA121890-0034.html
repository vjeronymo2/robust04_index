			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A masked gunman robbed a San Diego bank Monday morning in what appears to be  the sixth of a series of related bank robberies across the county in the past  two months, authorities said.  </P> <P> A man wearing a gray ski mask entered the Jackson-Hyde Park branch of Bank of  America shortly after it opened at 9 a.m., leaped over the teller's counter and  demanded money from two tellers, touching them with his revolver for emphasis,  San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> The robber stuffed an undisclosed amount of money into a canvas bag before  escaping on foot, Robinson said. The tellers and eight customers inside the  bank, at 7404 Jackson Drive, were unhurt.  </P> <P> The robber's methods were similar to those used in a series of bank robberies  that began Nov. 2, leading police to believe they may have been committed by  the same man, Robinson said. One difference, however, was the color of the  man's ski mask, which was described as flesh-colored in a previous robbery.  </P></p>

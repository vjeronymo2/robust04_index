			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: French blamed as UK pig industry 'bleeds to death' The European Commission is being urged to investigate French payments of alleged state aid to pig producers, which the National Farmers' Union says is causing the British pig industry to bleed to death. In a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, yesterday, Mr David Naish president of the NFU, said farmers were angry at the 'apparent lack of political will to investigate possible state aids paid by the French government to its pig industry'. Pork prices collapsed across the European Union last year following an expansion of herds in France, Denmark, Spain and to a lesser extent, the UK. EU pig meat production rose by 4 per cent last year to 14.9m tonnes. The British Pig Association estimates that farmers are losing Pounds 12 per animal - equal to 20 per cent of gross returns. Mr Naish's letter said that producers accepted that the industry was cyclical and that there would be phases when prices were depressed. 'But it is absolutely intolerable if member states are allowed to distort the operation of the common market organisation by paying illegal state aid.' The French government has introduced several measures to assist pig farmers since last September and British producers claim the government is paying roughly FFr370m in financial aid. Estimates put the expansion of the French pig herd at about 18 per cent, which British farmers claim is not justified by current prices. British pig output increased by about 3 per cent last year, but Mr Grenville Welsh, chief executive of the pig producers group, expects a drop in production of at least 8 per cent by the middle of this year. 'We're looking at maybe 2,000 to 3,000 producers going out of business,' he said. The UK currently has 11,500 pig farmers. UK pig farmers have been caught in a squeeze caused by the aftermath of devaluation of sterling, which raised the price of feed, and its subsequent recovery, which was making pork exports to Europe uncompetitive. Ministry of Agriculture figures show that pig farm incomes almost halved last year while overall farm earnings were up 40 per cent. The NFU has pressed the commission for action to alleviate market pressure and provide producers with a breathing space while supply adjusts to balance demand. Producers are particularly irked that retail prices have not fully reflected the drop in pork prices to farmers. The producers' association has urged the Pork and Bacon Promotion Council to start an advertising campaign in an effort to boost sales.</p>

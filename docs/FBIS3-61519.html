Pirozhkov; UDC  617.751.98-02:617.7-001.17-036.18]-76]    [Abstract] The issue of blepharospastic blindness, usually  as a result of battlefield wounds, is addressed, and the  shortcomings of known methods of cupping off this phenomenon are  noted. The use of soft contact lenses (MKL) first introduced in  the 1960s and their therapeutic properties, i.e., the ability of  creating favorable conditions for the recovery of regenerative  processes and protecting the damaged eye from infection as well  as retaining the drugs in damaged tissues for a longer time, is  considered. The outcome of eye burn treatment using soft contact  lenses at various burn gravities, the visual results of eye  burns after treatment using soft contact lenses, and the  anatomical outcome of eye burns after treatment using soft  contact lenses are summarized. The conclusion is drawn that soft  contact lenses may be quite effective in correcting  blepharospastic blindness and removing or alleviating the  corneal syndrome and may be recommended for use in ophthalmic  therapeutic films.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Recruitment: The cost of a touch of human decency - Rare headhunter who still treats rejects as though they're worth more than ten a penny WHAT price a bit of human decency? 'Well, it's a mite controversial,' replied headhunter Terry Ward. 'I put it at about Pounds 1.50 a head, but my wife reckons Pounds 2 - though she includes secretaries' time, which doesn't strike me as justified. They'd be here anyway, you see, even if we weren't doing it . . . .' All of which rather took the Jobs column aback. My last wish in asking the question was to stir up marital disagreements. What prompted it was just journalistic impulse in line with the old saw which, before the fuss over pit bull terriers at least, stated that while dog bites man is commonplace, man bites dog is news. One thing rarely missing from the postbag is complaints from job-seekers about recruiters, and vice versa. They have been biting one another so regularly for so long that, with the idealism of mere middle-age in 1978, I proposed a peace treaty which Britain's Institute of Personnel Management developed into its professional recruitment code. Alas it has not proved very effective, especially these past two years. Indeed, to judge by the current gnashing of teeth on both sides of the employment market, it seems clear that whether or not the first casualty of war is truth, considerate treatment is an early one of recession. Hence this particular hack's delighted surprise when a reader wrote in praising a headhunter to whom he'd applied for a job, even though he'd been rejected without nearing the interview stage. That in itself is nothing new to the reader concerned, since he has vainly applied for a couple of hundred others over 18 months or so. Mostly, he had no response at all. The sole exceptions, he says, were brief acknowledgments from employers recruiting directly, and from a few 'quality agencies such as NB Selection, MSL and Selector'. But on this latest occasion, the reader adds, back came a reply which despite being a rejection, shows 'human understanding of applicants' needs'. And having read the copy he sent along, I can see why he was so pleased. Although confessing itself 'a standard letter', it focuses its 400-plus words on the specific job for which he had applied. 'The response included several videos, many customised and beautifully presented applications, and even one compact disc.' it says. 'We received nearly 400 applications and my interview programme includes 39 people.' Then after indicating why the reader was not one of them, the headhunter adds: 'However, I may well have thrown out the odd baby with the bath water  -probably you] - but I hope you will appreciate my position.' What particularly pleased me was that the signature below was that of Terry Ward, whom I've known for years. He began his recruitment career with Ford, and since 1987 has been running the Ward Executive consultancy in Richmond-upon-Thames, in conjunction with his wife Claire. So I telephoned him and asked how much it cost to respond to rejected applicants with such care when as many as 400 of them come in for a single post. His reply was that 400 was below average these days. On three occasions fairly recently he has had over twice as many - which in each case works out at a response cost of Pounds 1,200-plus at his estimate and more than Pounds 1,600 at Mrs Ward's higher figure. 'It's irritating at times because a lot of applicants are totally unsuitable,' he said, 'and at first we just sent printed cards. But when they started coming back with rude words on them, we realised they were making some people feel insulted, and began doing the job properly. We feel it's definitely worth while.' Why? 'Well, it's partly commercial. In this business it's wise to view every candidate as a potential client. But that's not the main reason. After all, even at Pounds 2 a head, it's a small price to pay for treating someone decently.' NOW to the table alongside, which gives indicators of prevailing pay levels in City of London banks, as revealed by Day Associates' latest survey. Compiled at the beginning of this month, it is based on data supplied by 111 assorted banks and covers 230 jobs from general manager to messenger. But anyone wanting the full report will need to contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-Pounds 375 1397, fax 071-375 1723. The VAT-inclusive price is Pounds 141 to concerns which take part in the exercise, and Pounds 200 to others. My extracts - which like all such survey figures provide at best a rough guide to the real state of pay - are confined to 16 managerial posts. First we have basic salaries. The lower quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the person mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. Next comes the average salary and the percentage of it typically received as a bonus. The last two columns show the percentage of the job-holders with a company car, and its average price.</p>

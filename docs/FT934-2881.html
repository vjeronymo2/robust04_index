			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Rise of 25% in NHS managers Political arguments over the growth in the number of National Health Service managers will be intensified by official figures showing a further rise of nearly 25 per cent last year. The 24.9 per cent increase in general and senior managers between 1991 and 1992 compares with a 1 per cent rise in hospital medical staff, and a 0.8 per cent drop to 971,000 in total hospital and community health service staff levels. The Department of Health said yesterday that relatively little of the growth stemmed directly from the government's NHS reforms. Opposition MPs have expressed concern that the NHS is spending too much on administration. Publication of yesterday's figures follows a government announcement this week that the cost of providing cars in the NHS rose from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 70m between 1991-92 and 1992-93. There were also claims - based on parliamentary answers - by Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington, that the service had spent an extra Pounds 1.5bn on managers, administrators and clerical staff in the past four years. Yesterday's figures show that by last year there were 16,860 general and senior managers in England, compared with 13,500 a year earlier. The NHS's management structure was reformed in the 1980s, making valid comparisons with earlier years difficult - there were, for example, only 710 general and senior managers in 1987. The department said that about 62 per cent of last year's growth resulted from what had 'in effect been a redefinition of the group'. Senior-manager terms and conditions had been extended to other staff groups. According to the government, only 14 per cent of the increase arose from trust hospitals expanding their management teams as they took on new responsibilities under the 1991 NHS reforms. Another 15 per cent, it said, could be explained by measures to strengthen financial, personnel and information functions in the service. Hospital, public-health and community-health medical and dental staff in England grew by 15 per cent between 1982 and 1992 to 62,080.</p>

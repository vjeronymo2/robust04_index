			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: All bogged down in a myth of a cottage industry Sir, One does not challenge such a respected gardening authority as Arthur Hellyer with impunity but l am afraid that his article 'All in a mire over peat' (April 20) gives a false impression of peat production and the horticultural value of peat. The article, supported by the photograph, suggests that digging peat is a kind of a quaint cottage industry in Ireland serving Saturday gardeners in Britain. It isn't. Peat is a very big business driven by a 'market-led approach', to quote the annual report of one Irish peat producer, whose production is about 7m tons a year and whose export sales of horticultural peat products, mostly to the UK, are in the order of Pounds 25m a year. It is not the peat digger of the photograph who has traditionally and economically dug peat for his hearth fire, who has caused the peat alarm. It is rather the giant companies, gang milling and 'using the vacuum technique' to harvest the peat bogs to the tune of more than 215m tons a year. Satellite photography has revealed large areas of northern Europe and Ireland left virtually wasted by the intensity of peat winning. The big problems are yet to come. l am surprised by Mr Hellyer's assertion that 'there is no obvious substitute that has all the advantages' (of peat). The disadvantages of peat, not to mention the environmental damage, are all too evident: so acidic that it requires liming; of such poor air-filled porosity and drainage as to need added grit or vermiculite; of such poor ability to wet and rewet as to need chemical surfactants; such a low Cation Exchange Capacity as to require an excess of nutrients and of such a low carbon-nitrogen ratio as to render it useless for more than one season. Mr Donald Beaton, a celebrated gardener and gardening writer of the 1850s and 1860s, Prof John Lindley, the secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society, and James Veitch, keeper of the Royal Exotic Nursery, all eminent horticulturalists of their day, recommended the use of 'cocoa-nut refuse', or what is now called coir, as a replacement for leaf mould and superior to peat . At that time coir was a waste product of the Millwall and Kingston-on-Thames rope and rigging industry that imported coir fibre from India and Ceylon. The demand for 'cocoa nut refuse' became so great that eventually and with the advent of the steam ship, supplies ran out and gardening went back to leaf mould and sterilised soil until the 1950s. The Royal Horticultural Society library is replete with favourable and advisory references to the horticultural virtues of coir. More recently, Geoff Hamilton, of the BBC's Gardeners World, stated in the journal Horticulture Week (March 8): 'My own trials have indicated that coir composts will give perfectly good results for home gardeners and I shall be recommending them for this season.' Mr Hellyer is perfectly correct in saying, 'It is high time that the gardening public ceased to be bamboozled.' But who's bamboozling whom? Lee St Lawrence, Jenkins Well, Deal, Kent</p>

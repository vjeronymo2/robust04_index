			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: The Family Reunion - Theatre In 1951, TS Eliot reflected on the 'intentions, failures, and partial successes' of his plays. He rightly said of The Family Reunion: 'After what must seem to the audience an interminable time of preparation, the conclusion comes so abruptly that we are, after all, unready for it.' This throws down the gauntlet to both audience and director, and his challenge has been met in a bold, exciting production at the Leicester Haymarket. Putting a difficult verse drama on the Haymarket main stage calls for nerve and invention: Reunion gets both from director Julia Bardsley and designer Aldona Cunningham. The out-of-kilter country-house set works with the discordant soundtrack (Andrew Poppy) to conjure feelings which, according to Eliot, 'which we can only detect' from the corner of the eye. Frequent changes of state indicate the shiftings of consciousness implicit in Eliot's text. Reunion, based on Aeschylus and cut for Leicester, traces the return of Harry to his ancestral home. There, a chorus of aunts and uncles, a harridan of a mother and a jilted sweetheart await him. He has been haunted by 'furies' ever since his wife fell to her death from an ocean liner; he searches for peace with himself and his dying mother. Eliot wrote Reunion in 1939, midway between Murder in The Cathedral and Four Quartets. It shares technical similarities with both, and was subject to his rigorous verse-drama aesthetic. While he felt that he overvalued the verse, neglecting plot and character, Eliot managed to write speech rhythms which make one cease to be conscious of the play's verse form. This production strives to stay in touch with those rhythms: 'In an old house there is always listening . . . We do not like to walk out of a door and find ourselves back in the same room.' Eliot was later to rue the chorus and the furies. But here, two coups of stagecraft involving both make the evening. The furies are terrifying children dressed as Harry's relatives, and appear in a wonderfully frightening sequence; they reappear in a psychodrama of Harry's past. The exorcised furies become 'the friendly ones'. The fine acting of Rory Edwards (Harry) and Paola Dionisotti (his sage aunt Agatha) sends tap-roots into the subconscious. Even her dangerous lines 'May the weasel and the otter be about their proper business' find a place amidst the evil in the dark. The chorus is an apt melange of insight and stupidity, conveying their uncertainty and their knowledge; the reflective passages should be quieter. This is intelligent directing which tackles Eliot head on. If the production overreaches itself, it does so to compass Eliot's scope; for he knew that art was the imposition of credible order upon ordinary reality which elicited a perception of order in reality.

And all parties, from the Greens through the Reds,  discussed not what the year had been like but plans for the  future and set their sights on the elections.    All their platforms cannot be described (except for a  separate fee, perhaps). But we do not have the right to pass  over the forum of the Socialist Party. For if a week ago we  presented an account of the Fifth Rukh Congress, God himself has  ordained for balance a description of the Third Socialist Party  of Ukraine Congress. I was at all its previous congresses and  have the chance to make comparisons. Whereas previously they  passed off imperceptibly somehow, semi-clandestinely almost,  now.... Diplomats' Volvos at the main entrance, almost a hundred  journalists from many countries of the world, numerous guests,  greetings in various languages. To save time not all of them  were read out but A. Moroz, chairman of the Socialist Party,  acquainted the delegates with one of them as he opened the  congress. This was a message of congratulations from G.  Zyuganov--leader of Russia's communists....    The delegates heard two reports: one, very brief, on the  organizing and political work in the year since the last  congress, and the second--lengthy, discursive--on the platform  of the Socialist Party at the future elections. It was discussed  tumultuously, but without an overstepping of the mark, and the  majority of observations was to the point and opportune, as they  say. It was clear from the tone of the speeches that the times  when a presidential candidate laid his hands on supreme power  with the aid of five "D's are gone. There is no getting by  merely with letters today, and for this reason the election  platforms (with the Rukh people also, incidentally) vie in terms  of length with the platforms of the suburban-line commuter  trains almost.    The election program of the Socialist Party of Ukraine is  fully accommodated in its title: "Toward Socialism--Via the  Power of the People, Prosperity, and Security." It emphasizes  that the main, urgent method of averting economic catastrophe  and starvation is control, accounting and regulation on the part  of the state and the working people of the development of  production and the distribution of food and the preservation of  the plant outfits. Liberal, national-democratic, and  pro-bourgeois parties advocating liberalization and  privatization are up in arms against this. The socialists are  opposed to the plunder of the working people beneath verbiage  about a socially oriented economy.    "The moment of truth is at hand. We are beginning each  individually and all together to recover our sight, recognizing  how much in our life has been lost and what a difficult future  awaits us and our children, our Ukraine," the appeal to the  people of Ukraine adopted at the congress says. Its participants  emphasized once again that, as distinct from other parties, the  socialists are not aiming at their party's unfailing assumption  of office. They will support at the elections any honest  competent candidate, a nonparty candidate included, who agrees  with them on what is most important: the basis of the good  fortune of each individual may only be conscientious and  productive labor. There must be neither master nor serf in  Ukraine.    In conversation with journalists A. Moroz, who was  unanimously reelected leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine,  said that, in his opinion, the forces of the left would obtain  more than half the vote at the elections. About 20 percent will  vote for the Socialist Party, he believes.    The special issue of TOVARISHCH put out for the congress  also  published the platform of the Communist Party of Ukraine. It is  entitled "For Social Justice and the Salvation of Spirituality,  for the True Power of the People and a Life Worthy of Man." The  Central Electoral Commission the same day registered to  participate in the elections as entry No. 1 the Ukrainian  Republican Party, as No. 2, the Communist Party of Ukraine.</p>

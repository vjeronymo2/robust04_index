			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (5): How to run a one-off appeal - Fundraising and funding Since she spearheaded the Wishing Well Appeal for redeveloping London's Great Ormond Street children's hospital, Marion Allford has found herself a popular target for voluntary sector staff seeking tips on fundraising. This is hardly surprising. The Wishing Well was one of the most remarkable and successful single-issue appeals ever mounted in the UK. Launched in October, 1987, the fundraising campaign, made famous by its logo of a child's face smiling through a tear, had reached its original Pounds 30m target by January 1989 - with no sign of the flow of money it had unleashed, abating. It closed in June, 1989 - a year ahead of the original schedule - having raised Pounds 54m. This rose to Pounds 84m when interest and contributions from public funds were added. Ms Allford, a fundraising consultant who specialises in charity appeals, has now shared her experience in Charity Appeals - the Complete Guide to Success*, a manual published in association with the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers and with the support of Business in the Community. The book - net royalties will go to Great Ormond Street - is far more than a description of the Wishing Well experience. It is a thorough, comprehensive guide to running one-off capital appeals, giving detailed advice across such wide-ranging aspects of fundraising as donor research, insurance, media events, lotteries, budgeting and commercial partnerships. Ms Allford acknowledges that the Wishing Well's emotional cause, sick children, was one that few other charities could rival in terms of its potential for gaining public support. Since the Great Ormond Street success, two other hospitals - the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, London, and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh - have, with advice from the Wishing Well team, adopted similar appeal strategies with positive results. They raised Pounds 25m and Pounds 11m respectively. One-off appeals for single projects - whether on the scale of big hospital appeals or to repair the organ of a village church - are a particular, specialised sector of charitable fundraising. They need to make immediate impact and reach their financial targets relatively quickly. Established charities face different fundraising requirements, and many have developed increasingly sophisticated methods to try to combat the effects of the recession. Techniques such as direct mail, now often conducted on charities' behalf by agencies, became common in the 1970s and 1980s. They have recently been complemented by attempts to target potential donors more precisely and develop long-term relationships with them. There is also a trend towards affinity marketing campaigns, linking charities' names with credit cards or commercial products. Professional, business-style fundraising techniques are usually only available to big charities with substantial fundraising budgets and, at a time when there has been little overall growth in total giving, this may help explain why the largest charities are performing against the trend. Charities Aid Foundation figures published last month show that Britain's 200 biggest charities increased their total income by 4 per cent in real terms in 1991-92. In contrast, those in the 200-400 size bracket suffered a 9 per cent decline. The CAF research reveals some striking recent changes in sources of charities' voluntary income. Fundraising events produced 14 per cent less income last year than in 1991. Revenue from charity shops, by contrast, increased by 16 per cent. Corporate support - both financial and in terms of staff secondments, expertise and other assistance - forms a central part of many charities' plans. This, like many other areas of fundraising, has been affected by the recession. The CAF survey shows that only nine companies gave more than Pounds 5m to charity in 1992-93, compared with 13 the previous year. Many charities, particularly smaller ones, often face serious problems meeting core funding - donors are generally more willing to finance particular charitable projects and campaigns than to meet the basic running costs. Core funding difficulties can sometimes drive charities to closure. Trustees of the National Council for Child Health, the only charity promoting immunisation and preventative health care in children, decided at an extraordinary meeting last month to wind up the organisation. The charity had failed to persuade grant-making trusts or private sector donors to contribute to its core funding after a three-year government grant had come to an end. Mediation UK, which promotes mediation rather than resort to the courts as a means of resolving disputes, has warned that it will have to dismiss Ms Marian Liebmann, its director, in February unless new funds are found. Ms Liebmann says charitable trusts that financed Mediation UK's launch are not prepared to continue providing core funding, and that the charity's executive committee is spending so much time fundraising that it cannot provide an adequate service. The problem of finding funds to continue supporting projects once they have been launched was highlighted last month by the Church Urban Fund, the only national grant-making charity working exclusively in the inner cities and peripheral estates. In a report to the general synod of the Church of England, the fund - which normally makes initial grants for between three and five years - said it had expected that worthwhile social projects 'would be picked up by state or local government funding, and that some activities would be taken on to a parish's or diocese's ordinary funds.' Such developments had occurred much less than expected, and the Church Urban Fund will now have to introduce mechanisms to evaluate claims for established projects' continued funding against the needs of emerging schemes. 'We have to try to ensure both that worthwhile current work is not cut prematurely short, and also that creative new activity is not stifled,' says the report. The issue is one of the central dilemmas facing all organisations funding the voluntary sector. *Charity Appeals - the Complete Guide to Success by Marion Allford, J M Dent, Pounds 15.99</p>

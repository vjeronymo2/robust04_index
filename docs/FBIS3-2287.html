Israeli representative Jacob Fass, 46, told reporters he was  honored to be here. Fass, a career diplomat, explained that his  office would work to promote trade, investment and tourism  relations between Israel and Taiwan.    The office will also handle visa applications, most of which  can be processed in two days, Fass said.    Trade between Israel and Taiwan totaled US$500 million in  1993, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$100 million.    Taiwan's major export items to Israel include personal  computers, textiles and motorcycles, totaling US$300 million,  while Israel exported US$200 million worth of goods to Taiwan  last year, mainly hi-tech products, such as telecommunications,  medical, aerospace and computer items.    In June, a large delegation representing some of the biggest  companies and banks in Israel will visit Taiwan to explore  possible business opportunities here, Fass said.    A Taipei Economic and Trade Office opened in Israel last  May.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Thai airline battle looms THAILAND'S cabinet yesterday decided on first steps to remove Thai Airways International (THAI), the country's flag-carrier, from control of the air force. The decision was described as a matter of compliance with stock market law, but it is clearly part of the proclaimed intention of the prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, to 'demilitarise politics' and 'decommercialise the armed forces', after the shooting of scores of anti-military protesters in May. One of the officers blamed for the shooting is Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, armed forces supreme commander and therefore in charge of internal security until last week. Mr Anand still has several more sensitive steps to take in order to complete the limited task he has set himself before the September 13 general election. The most difficult will be the annual reshuffle of the top brass that takes place on October 1 and is usually announced in September. Air Chief Marshal Kaset could be promoted to a less active post in the reshuffle which could force him to leave THAI's chairmanship before the airline's new regulations take effect. The cabinet's decision yesterday was to ask Thai Airways' board of directors to amend the company's articles of association, a change that does not have to be made for two years. That is the deadline, under new stock exchange laws that came into force in May, for companies whose shares are traded on the market to become public listed companies. By law, these companies' directors have to be elected freely by shareholders.</p>

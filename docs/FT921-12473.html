			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Optimism flourishes in Garden City: Group of Seven meeting NOBODY publicly christened the latest statement by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations 'the Garden City accord', writes Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent, in Garden City, New York. But there was little doubt among the meeting's US hosts that the 7 1/2 hours of talks among finance ministers and central bank governors and the comparatively lengthy 4 1/2 page communique represented a significant improvement on recent efforts at economic policy co-ordination. Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, said the US government had secured an 'unequivocal commitment' from the seven to concentrate more on growth. 'When you have the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 changing their view and changing the way they talk about growth. . . then that's a big change,' he said. His assessment was upstaged by that of Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, France's finance minister. 'We have rediscovered the spirit of the Plaza and the Louvre accords,' he said, harking back to 1985 when the big industrial democracies agreed at the Plaza Hotel in New York to push down the overvalued dollar and to 1987 when they decided at the Louvre to try to stabilise exchange rates. The communique issued on Saturday was the 'most important in years', the French minister said. By making a commitment to do everything they could to accelerate the recovery of world growth, the G7 had sent a message of optimism to the international community. Even Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who rarely enthuses about such international gatherings, sounded hopeful. It was, he said, a 'very successful meeting indeed' which had reached agreement that the right policies were in place for resumed growth in G7 countries this year. The US and French enthusiasm for the meeting was to be expected. President George Bush faces elections later this year, with his handling of the US economy under fire. Washington has been pressing its main trading partners for nearly a year to adopt more active growth policies and France has been its most constant supporter. But hyperbole aside, the weekend marked a shift in the policy priorities of the G7. The communique stated clearly that the group's members had 'agreed to intensify their co-operative efforts to strengthen world economic growth'. However, this does not mean the G7 will embark on reckless expansion. The text stressed efforts should be devoted to achieving 'sustainable growth with price stability over the medium term.' In policy terms, they decided to hold to the so-called Sinatra doctrine which leaves countries to pursue actions best suited to their own conditions and not move in lockstep. In some countries this could mean reallocating public spending to areas that would improve confidence or boost productivity. But such an option would not be open for Italy, for example, because of its large public debt. The communique also held out the hope of monetary easing in countries with better-than-expected inflation performance. Mr Don Mazankowski, Canada's finance minister, said there was scope for monetary easing in Canada. But Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said this passage did not refer to his country and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, made it clear it was too soon to think of German interest rates falling. As long as German rates stay high, it will be difficult for France and Britain to cut theirs. Moreover, sceptics can argue that most of what the ministers agreed to do was already in train. While the US pledged in the communique it would announce a 'comprehensive programme to strengthen growth and competitiveness' in Mr Bush's State of the Union address tomorrow, the sections on the other six countries simply detailed existing policies. In the case of Germany, the text suggested that room might be created for lower interest rates. But this would depend on the fulfilment of a number of conditions, including 'a deceleration of the strong growth in money supply and credit demand as well as an easing of wage pressures and regaining price stability'. With German money supply growing at 9 per cent annually in the most recent three months, compared with the Bundesbank's target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, and strikes in prospect in support of double digit pay claims, there is little hope of an early easing in monetary policy. Both Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and Mr Schlesinger made this clear with a robust defence of their policies. However, the mood of the meeting was clearly different to recent acrimonious G7 gatherings. Mr Be're'govoy said afterwards there was a 'different tone' about the way the German delegation discussed interest rates. 'Rome wasn't built in a day and attitudes don't change overnight,' he said. But the meeting was 'an important step forwards'. A senior US Treasury official said the US expected to see 'evidence of action' to promote growth in its G7 partners by the time of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee meeting in Washington at the end of April. Both Britain and Canada were inhibited from disclosing what action they planned because they were preparing budgets, he suggested. If action results, it will be a sign the Garden City meeting has put the co-ordination process back on track. But the final judgment on the weekend's events will depend on the millions of consumers and investors in the G7 member countries.</p>

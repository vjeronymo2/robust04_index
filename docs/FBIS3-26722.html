Yesterday he listened to a work report by Jia  Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee and  governor of the province. Liu Quaqing expressed his satisfaction  with Fujian's achievements in recent years. He encouraged  Fujian to further implement the instructions of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to do  better in all aspects of work under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    After listening to Jia Qinglin's briefing that Fujian had  quadrupled its GNP seven years ahead of schedule, Comrade Liu  Huaqing happily said: I have not been to Fujian for 10 years.  There have been really great changes in Fujian, and its  development is very fast. This is very good. He added:  Economic development should remain at an appropriate rate; it  should neither be too slow nor too fast. In particular, the  scale of capital construction should not be too large and  investment should not be too excessive.    He asked Jia Qinglin about commodity prices in the market.  After learning that commodity prices were stable, he said:  This is very good. Commodity prices involve the interests of  tens of thousands of families. This is a major issue and should  be resolved properly. Agriculture and grain are also important  issues involving social stability and the country's tranquility.  We should not relax our efforts on these issues.    On relations with Taiwan, he said: Apart from strengthening  civilian, economic, and technological exchanges with Taiwan, it  is all the more important for Fujian to speed up its economic  development. This is very important to speeding up  reunification.    Liu Huaqing continued: Fujian is rich in tourism resources.  It should make great efforts to speedily develop its tourism to  promote the development of other tertiary industries.    After listening to Jia Qinglin's report, Comrade Liu Huaqing  thanked the Fujian Provincial Party Committee for supporting the  armed forces. He requested the armed forces to support local  construction so that the relations between the armed forces and  civilians will become closer.    Comrade Liu Huaqing particularly stressed the need for the  militia to display their exemplary role in the new period. He  said: In the new situation, apart from being able to use guns,  the militia should, more importantly, display their exemplary  role in cultivating a good mood in society and in carrying out  spiritual civilization.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Education needs government to adopt 'hands off' policy Sir, Joe Rogaly's praise of the government's persistence with its 'sensible' education reforms ('Less than the sum of its parts', January 26) suggests he has been taken in by the gloss rather than the reality of the reforms. Will employers see it as sensible next year when grades C, D and E, which are the grades obtained by the majority of 16-year-olds, are squeezed into national curriculum levels 6 and 7, involving the abolition of the useful C/D boundary? Do parents think it is sensible that the last age cohort which has not been following the national curriculum in English in secondary schools will be the first examined on it next year? Or that the reports for 14-year-olds this year will contain some 69 grades for every pupil? Some may even question the legality of testing 14-year-olds at levels 3-6 on Shakespeare when the statutory orders clearly specify level 7 as the first level at which this can be applied. The well-established examination boards have strict moderation procedures for speaking and listening, give schools 24 months' notice of examination texts, and maintain strict security over examination papers. Will they think it sensible that they are criticised by a government whose own examination body, SEAC, has no inter-school moderation procedures for speaking and listening, gives schools six or eight months' notice of examination texts, and seems to have been planning to use its pre-test papers as the actual exam? The procedures of the established boards are light years ahead of the government's own procedures as reflected by SEAC. The truth is that this government has alienated the profession to an unprecedented degree. The legacy of years of not listening to the profession is an administrative shambles. The sensible policy for the government to adopt would be a 'hands off' approach, and re-establishment of the GCSE in its pre-national curriculum form. Only in this way could the genuine rise in standards, reflected in consistent improvements in 'A' level results, be maintained and flourish.

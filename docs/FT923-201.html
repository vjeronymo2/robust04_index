			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Gould critical of economic policy MR BRYAN GOULD, the former shadow national heritage secretary, last night launched an attack on his party's economic policy. Speaking to a Tribune rally, Mr Gould, who resigned from the shadow cabinet earlier this week, said the party's election defeat in April had a 'silver lining' because Labour would have suffered a similar fate to that of Mr John Major's government on the so-called Black Wednesday. When the Tories had entered the exchange rate mechanism, 'we were incapable of doing anything but bleat about the consequences of the policy because we couldn't attack the policy itself,' he said. 'It pains me to say this, but does anyone in this room doubt that, if we had won the election, we would have sat around with a cabinet team in the midst of a sterling crisis raising interest rates, raiding the reserves, and eventually going down to defeat? - the inevitable that such a policy always produces.' Mr Gould claimed that Labour politicians who had objected to Labour's policy of supporting entry to the ERM at a rate he considered too high were moved out of positions of responsibility on the economy. 'I was obliged to remain silent over that period. I thought it was a sacrifice that was worthwhile in the interests of getting a Labour government elected.' In his speech, the Dagenham MP, who was voted off Labour's national executive on Monday, said the Maastricht treaty handed power over economic policy to an unelected central bank instructed to put price stability at the centre of its policy and to cut public spending.</p>

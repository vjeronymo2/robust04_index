			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Armenian parliament, Babken  Ararktsyan, who is visiting Moscow, said he supported Russia's  plan for the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.  In Ararktsyan's words, the position taken by Armenia fully  coincides with the Russian position. Its main points are a  cease-fire in the conflict zone, the disengagement of the  warring sides and the introduction of the CIS peacekeeping  forces into the buffer zone. These measures are designed to  create conditions for resolving the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

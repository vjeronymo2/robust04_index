Friendship with Russia is for us the basic  foreign political factor, proceeding from which we determine our  positions in international relations," President Saparmurat  Niyazov said in a message of greetings to President Boris  Yeltsin on Russia's Independence Day.    The message says that having embarked on a path of  deep-going  reforms the renewed democratic Russia has made it clear to the  world that it is a great power which will not succumb to  temporary difficulties. "I am confident that the time is not  far away when Russia shows the world its own "economic miracle"  and regain its might and glory," President Niyazov said.    The peoples of great Russia and Turkmenistan have been bound  together by their common historical fate and deep  inter-penetration of cultures, as well as by the common tasks  facing them now.    "We know that Russia's well-being is a major component of  our  own independence which we value highly and of our own well-being  both at present and in the future," Turkmenistan's president  said.    Niyazov also sent a message of greetings to Viktor  Chernomyrdin expressing satisfaction with the level of relations  between the two countries, as well as gratitude for support  which the Russian premier extends to Turkmenistan.</p>

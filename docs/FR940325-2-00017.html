			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner contends that ICC must be calculated to include the time CA cement clinker is produced in France until the time it is further manufactured into cement in the United States. Petitioner argues that both CA clinker and cement will be subject to the scope of any order that may be issued in this case and, therefore, CA clinker cannot be considered work-in-process, as respondent suggests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioner. The Department's general practice in all further manufacturing cases has been to begin the inventory carrying period from the time that the product comes off of the production line. (See e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France (58 FR 68865, December 29, 1993) (Wire Rods From France). In this case, we are calculating ICC for the imported product, which is the clinker that is further manufactured into finished cement. We distinguish this case from that of CTVs from Korea, where the product imported into the United States was the finished merchandise; and OPJPs from Japan and MTPs from Japan, where the products were large and made-to-order, unlike the subject merchandise in the instant investigation; and from DRAMs from Korea, where we made no adjustment regarding the imported merchandise only where it merely constituted parts of larger and considerably more complicated modules. Therefore, we have imputed ICC in this case inclusive of the period between production of the clinker in France and shipment to the first unrelated customer in the United States, and have adjusted USP accordingly. Moreover, for the portion of the ICC costs which reflect the period between production of the clinker in France and the start of production of the finished cement in the United States, we recalculated the reported ICC using the short-term interest rate prevailing in France during the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department should use the U.S. warehousing costs included in the reported U.S. indirect selling expenses for CA cement sales. Contrary to what is suggested in the sales verification report, Lafarge maintains that the reported pre-sale warehousing costs for one warehouse are consistent with the prices shown in the warehousing contract examined at verification, and the pre-sale warehousing costs included in the reported indirect selling expenses were based on the actual costs incurred and paid by Lafarge, not on the per ton cost stated in the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. Upon further examination of the documentation reviewed at verification, we noted that the verified per unit U.S. indirect selling expenses, reported inclusive of pre-sale warehousing costs, were based on actual costs incurred. Thus, we have deducted from USP the reported pre-sale warehousing costs as indirect selling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner maintains that indirect selling expenses included in the CV of CA clinker should be recalculated to include indirect selling expenses allocated to CA cement as shown in Exhibit 6 of petitioner's case brief because clinker is of the same class or kind of merchandise as cement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent argues against such a recalculation because the channels of distribution and sales process for CA clinker differ substantially from those of CA cement. Because the CV of clinker is intended to provide a surrogate for a home market sales price for clinker based on the costs and expenses that would be incurred in producing and selling clinker in the home market, Lafarge appropriately included in CV only the selling expenses that would be incurred in selling clinker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with respondent. Section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Act provides that CV should include, among other things, ``an amount for general expenses *&blank;*&blank;* equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same general class or kind as the merchandise under consideration.'' We have recalculated indirect selling expenses to include home market indirect selling expenses for cement using verified information on the record. We consider cement indirect selling expenses to be representative of selling expenses of the general class or kind of merchandise, i.e., all CA products sold within the home market country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner asserts that the Department should make an adjustment to the G&amp;A expense reported in the CV for clinker to include the amortization of patents and trademarks which respondent had not included in the reported G&amp;A amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

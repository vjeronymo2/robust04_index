			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Not enough rights left Traditionally, August is a rum month for reshuffle speculation at Westminster with MPs off on their hols. But this time it's rife and the rumour-mongers are showing a particularly keen interest in the medical bulletins of education secretary John Patten and the DTI boss Michael Heseltine. Should either of these cabinet big-wigs be declared unfit to continue, the argument runs, the prime minister would have an opening to finish off what he started in May when he sacked chancellor Norman Lamont. The keenest speculators are the Tory party's disaffected right. They are dismayed by the monopoly of 'wets' in the main economic departments (Kenneth Clarke, David Hunt and Heseltine himself). But the right's problem remains the dearth of credible alternatives. Baroness Blatch would be an obvious successor to Patten. She is not one of them, and nor is Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary and Peter Walker protege. The right's only real star is the cerebral John Redwood but he has only just been given Wales. The assumption is that Hezza will not return to duty until the Tory party conference in October but John Patten is expected back at his desk on Monday. His first public performance will give the speculators a chance to judge whether he really is fit for action.</p>

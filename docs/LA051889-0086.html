			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS REPORT BOOM;  </P> <P> 'IT'S TIME FOR PIANO LESSONS,' ADULTS TELL THEMSELVES  </P> <P> They will admit, many of them, that their mothers were right: They never should  have quit taking piano.  </P> <P> So here at the Steinway dealer, they sit before electronic keyboards, hands  poised, eyes glued to their music books.  </P> <P> At the teacher's signal, the pupils begin to play a short tune with their right  hands. Out come a few clunker notes and nervous giggles. But instructor Debbie  Adams reminds her pupils of the class rules: Be proud of your mistakes, and  forgive yourself immediately.  </P> <P> Whether in a group or in private lessons, whether in their 30s or their 80s,  more and more adults in the United States are limbering up their fingers. Many  of them were childhood students of piano, teachers say.  </P> <P> Richard Walker, a 39-year-old businessman in Adams' class, studied piano as a  youngster, "until I discovered sports and girls." Taking up the instrument  again "has been something I've wanted to do for a long time," he said.  </P> <P> For working people, playing the piano may be a relaxing finish to a busy day.  "People don't want to sit in front of a TV set, especially if they've been in  front of a computer terminal all day," said Adams. She lists doctors, lawyers,  a psychologist and a film producer among her adult students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Methods Changing  </P> <P> With the influx of adults, some piano teachers have begun to change their  teaching styles. More and more, "piano books don't have animal pictures on  them," said Brenda Dillon, project administrator of the National Piano  Foundation. Adults have goals different from children, she said. An adult may  only want to learn a specific song, Christmas carols or hymns for Sunday  school.  </P> <P> Adults tend to be highly critical of their playing. "Their oral capacities are  so far ahead of their physical capacities," said Calvin Herst, director of  education at the Community Music Center in Boston. "And that becomes  frustrating for them."  </P> <P> Sometimes it's good to start with group lessons, where adults "can see that  other people have the same problems they do and that they're not dumb, after  all," Herst said.  </P> <P> The fact that more adults are taking piano lessons can be linked to the growing  number of retirees. According to the foundation, the average American will  spend 23% of his or her life in retirement, compared with 7% in 1940. More  leisure time and more discretionary spending have made piano study "the  possible dream," said Dillon. The foundation has produced a video with that  title to alert piano teachers to this growing market.  </P> <P> Rosetta Quimby, 74, began private lessons in her 60s, but then dropped them.  She has begun enjoying piano again, only this time in a group setting. "You get  acquainted with some nice people," she said, mentioning a fellow pupil named  Frank, who is in his 80s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keyboards Help  </P> <P> Quimby said she has a piano at home but also enjoys the electronic pianos in  class, which feel and sound remarkably like acoustic pianos.  </P> <P> The introduction of electronic keyboards has prompted people to learn piano,  said Christine Hermanson, director of the Fine Arts Academy in Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> "They are deciding to try music because they don't have to make such a large  investment," Hermanson said. Rather than buying a piano for thousands of  dollars, one can purchase a basic portable keyboard for a couple of hundred.  </P> <P> But the kind of instrument one ends up playing depends on one's goals, said Tom  Long, director of music education at Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co. An expensive  home organ with "lots of bells and whistles" is usually considered  "entertainment" and played just for fun, he said. Portable keyboards are often  impulse buys, giving one the "instant gratification" of being able to create  sophisticated, magical sounds.  </P> <P> An acoustic piano, however, "is still perceived as real music," a serious  instrument, Long said. Fans of classical music, especially, will likely opt for  a traditional piano.  </P> <P> Walker, on his way out of class at the Steinway store, said he enjoys jazz  recordings and would like to be able to play jazz on the piano. Having played  some clarinet, he thinks that piano is easier -- "the keys are right in front  of you," he said.  </P> <P> Not only is the piano accessible, but "it's basic to American culture," said  Dillon, who cites a number of popular movies and television commercials that  feature piano melodies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promotes Expression  </P> <P> In addition, students have told her that playing the piano brings "peace and  order" into their lives, she said. "All of us have a need to express how we  feel, and the piano is one of the most tangible ways to do that."  </P> <P> People interested in piano lessons might contact:  </P> <P> * Community music schools. For locations, write the National Guild of Community  Music Schools, Box 8018, Englewood, NJ 07631.  </P> <P> * Adult-education centers. Programs may include group classes at night or  classes for senior citizens.  </P> <P> * Piano stores. Dealers may conduct group lessons, have studios on their  premises or recommend teachers.  </P> <P> * Music Teachers National Assn. This professional group offers a free directory  of certified members. Write 617 Vine St., Suite 1432, Cincinnati, OH 45202.  </P> <P> There are piano-teaching audiotapes, videocassettes and computer software  programs available. They can be helpful, said Long of Baldwin Piano &amp;  Organ, but sooner or later you need "a warm body to sit there with you and give  you some feedback."  </P> <P> To find the right piano teacher, it's best to interview the person before  signing up, he said. Here are some basic areas for discussion:  </P> <P> * Professional background. What music degrees does the teacher have? Does the  teacher belong to professional organizations?  </P> <P> * Teaching approach. Has the teacher worked with adults? Adults are not just  "big kids," Long said, and the teacher's attitude should reflect this. Tell the  person what you hope to learn, and see if his goals mesh with your own. How  much practicing does the teacher expect?  </P> <P> * Price. Fees vary widely. Hermanson said many teachers charge $6 to $12 for a  weekly, 30-minute private lesson. Debbie Adams, who teaches in Boston, charges  $30 an hour. Group lessons often cost less: The Community Music Center in  Boston charges $150 for a 16-week semester.  </P></p>

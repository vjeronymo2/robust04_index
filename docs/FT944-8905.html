			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fairfax posts strong advance John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper publishing group which now has about 43 per cent of its shares in the hands of Mr Rupert Murdoch, Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Conrad Black, yesterday announced a 55 per cent increase in first-quarter profits, to ADollars 39.4m (USDollars 29.68m) after tax but before abnormals. The improvement translated into a 40 per cent improvement in earnings per share, at 5 cents. There was a small ADollars 2.5m abnormal gain from the transfer of some magazine titles to a publishing joint venture, leaving bottom line profits at ADollars 41.9m, against ADollars 25.4m last time. Sales in the three months to end-September were up by 14.2 per cent to ADollars 239m, while operating costs rose by 6.7 per cent to ADollars 74.3m. Interest charges also fell by almost ADollars 2m to ADollars 8.85m. This left operating profits 52.3 per cent higher at ADollars 59.2m. Mr Stephen Mulholland, Fairfax chief executive, said advertising volumes had been 'well above last year for all publications,' although he also acknowledged that there was 'some softness' in some circulation figures during the half-year to September. Advertising volumes at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age were ahead of last year. Mr Mulholland said trading results since September had 'continued to be favourable'. Release of the figures came ahead of today's annual meeting in Melbourne, and amid continued speculation over the implications of Fairfax's unstable share register. Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, now holds almost 25 per cent of the shares, and cannot go further under Australian foreign investment rules. Mr Packer, the Australian businessman, is pegged at 15 per cent under media cross-ownership regulations. Mr Murdoch, who first acquired shares in June, is said to hold around 3 per cent of the equity, although Mr Doug Halley, Fairfax finance director, said the company was not currently sending out notices allowing it to identify share purchases, and could not verify reports of recent purchases. In August, Mr Murdoch's stake was around 2 per cent.</p>

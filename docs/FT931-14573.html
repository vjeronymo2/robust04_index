			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Fresh talks on the future of Ulster expected THE FIRST Anglo-Irish conference since the Irish elections is expected to take place next month, and is likely to herald the initiation of fresh talks about the future of Northern Ireland shortly afterwards. British ministers expect that two meetings under the Anglo-Irish conference might be necessary to agree a way forward for the talks to start again, after their breakdown last November. There appears to be a consensus in London, Belfast and Dublin that the 'three-strand' approach of the last talks will not be repeated and that there is a need for a less rigid structure. This would allow a series of bilateral contacts between the two governments and the four main political parties in the province. One point on which the UK will be pressing is the prospect of change on the Irish constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. While not expecting the Irish to concede the claim instantly, British ministers are looking for a change of tone. When the negotiations broke down the Dublin government's statement that it only 'could', not 'would', hold a referendum on changing its constitution if an overall settlement were reached caused particular difficulties for the unionists. The new Irish government, which took office only last week, has not indicated its stance on this issue. Mr Dick Spring, the new Irish foreign minister, is expected to hold an informal meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, later this week to set dates for the first Anglo-Irish conference meetings.</p>

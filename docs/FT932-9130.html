			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Georgian ceasefire agreed in Moscow A CEASEFIRE between Georgian and Abkhazian forces in the breakaway republic of Abkhazia was agreed yesterday in Moscow by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the leader of the Georgian parliament and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. The two leaders agreed to ensure a cessation of hostilities next Thursday, and to order the withdrawal of all heavy weapons and aircraft from the conflict zone. The two leaders will then reconvene the conference between themselves and the Abkhazian leaders which met last September to end the conflict. Georgian troops have been fighting rebels in the Abkhazian autonomous republic to the north of Georgia for almost a year, with much of the conflict concentrated round the regional capital of Sukhumi, where sporadic fighting has recently intensified. Russian troops continue to man bases in Abkhazia, and have been accused by the Georgians of helping the secessionists. Mr Shevardnadze said after the meeting that if the agreements on Abkhazia stood, a general agreement between Russia and Georgia should be signed by mid-June. The stalemated conflict, along with Armenia's undeclared war with Azerbaijan, has made the Caucasus mountains second only to Yugoslavia as Europe's most hostile region. Abkhazia is seeking independence, but Georgia refuses to alter its status as an autonomous republic within Georgia. The Abkhazia war has killed an estimated 3,000 people on both sides, and helped to cripple the economies of Georgia and, to the south, Armenia. The war has also ignited a mercenary movement in the troubled south Russia portion of the Caucasus, a stretch of tiny autonomous republics that form an umbrella over Georgia. Hundreds of Moslem fighters from the Russian Caucusus have gone to Abkhazia to oppose what they see as Georgian aggression. In addition, Mr Shevardnadze recently suggested that Georgia and Russia themselves risk war because of increasingly persuasive evidence that Russian military forces are backing the Abkhaz with bombing runs over Georgian-held areas. Mr Shevardnadze has been careful not to antagonise his northern neighbour by accusing Mr Yeltsin of ordering military support for the Abkhaz. He nonetheless believes that Georgia's real war is with Russians, not the Abkhaz rebels, and he has some support. A western diplomat who visited the warfront said: 'There is Russian support, there is no question about it. The Abkhaz would not be able to hold out the way they have if it weren't for Russia.' The war, and a lawless environment in Tbilisi and other regions that the conflict has spawned, have dominated Mr Shevardnadze's attention since he came to power. The economy has been left in tatters. Most of the republic's 275 factories are closed or operating at 10-30 per cent of capacity. The few foreign investors in Georgia complain that, despite Mr Shevardnadze's reformism, there can be no trade deal without assent from the leader's office. Mr Shevardnadze sees improved relations with Russia as the key to Georgia emerging from an economic crisis in which GDP has shrunk by more than 35 per cent since 1989. Russia has worsened the collapse with an economic squeeze. Moscow has tightened credit and, after months in which cash-broke Tbilisi was unable to pay many government employees, Russia in January backed out of an agreement to supply Rbs60bn to the republic.</p>

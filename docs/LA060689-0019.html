			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN: TOO EARLY TO TELL  </P> <P> The most savage tyranny of recent history ended with the death of Iran's  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the weekend. From his overthrow of the shah in  1979 through his commitment of battalions of children to slaughter in the war  against Iraq to the taking of hostages in the Middle East, Khomeini led with an  unrelenting loathing for the West and a contempt for life.  </P> <P> But the masses of grieving faithful around his glass coffin in Tehran and the  quick decision on a successor to show that the clergy remains in control make  it unlikely that major change in Iran's relations with the West are in  prospect. Khomeini may have failed to export his revolution of Islamic  fundamentalism, but it still will restrain any impulse for major change on the  part of his immediate successor, President Ali Khamenei, or other leaders who  may emerge after elections in August. That does not mean that Iran will, or  should, forever stand apart from the global community of nations. It just means  it will be along time before it feels free to make a conciliatory move toward  the United States, Khomeini's "Great Satan," or other Western countries.  </P> <P> It will take time even to discover whether the tyrant's death sentence imposed  on author Salman Rushdie for writing "Satanic Verses" will be lifted. It will  take even longer, no doubt, to discern the effect that his death will have on  hostages taken in the Middle East by, or in behalf of, Iranians. Just which of  several candidates for power, none of whom could carry the moral authority of  Khomeini, will wind up on top is not clear. But being seen as soft on America  by signaling an imminent end to the nightmare of hostages would almost  certainly guarantee a candidate's winding up near the bottom.  </P> <P> The Iran-Contra scandal gave the word moderate a bad name, but there are  leaders and emerging leaders who understand that they need to heal relations  with the West. They will have their day, as the memory of Khomeini fades.  </P></p>

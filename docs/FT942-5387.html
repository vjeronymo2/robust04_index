			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities With returns increasing by up to 15 per cent over the past few months, the annuity has bounced back from a 20-year low. Indeed, it has now reached a level where it can now provide a guaranteed income for life at rates often surpassing other regular products. Moreover, further increases this week mean those receiving annuity income can at last look ahead to the prospect of even more positive growth as the year goes on. Inflation fears over the past few days saw the gross redemption yield on the 15-year gilt move to 9.07 at close of business on Tuesday. This was a rise of 36.8 per cent compared with four months ago: on January 20, the rate was 6.63 per cent. Just how quickly the market has risen can be seen from the rates available to a 60-year-old male using a Pounds 100,000 personal pension fund to buy an annuity which is paid monthly in advance, with a five-year guarantee period. If he had retired on January 20 1994, the Prudential Assurance Co. would have paid him Pounds 8,929.08. The same fund and the same type of annuity from the Prudential would now bring him Pounds 10,244.88 a year had he purchased it on June 1. This corresponds to an increase of 14.7 per cent. Other life companies also have shifted their rates upwards to reflect the market surge (as shown in the table above). One such is Scottish Widows, which has upped the rates offered to the same man buying the same annuity by 14.5 per cent over the same period, paying Pounds 10,180.08 a year as at June 1 compared with Pounds 8,890.08 on January 20.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LATEST ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Level annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 55              Annuity  Female age 50                Annuity       Months movement    +3.9%           Months movement    +2.6% Equitable Life   Pounds 9,897.00  London &amp; Manchester  Pounds 8,721.96 Canada Life      Pounds 9,729.60  Scottish Widows      Pounds 8,690.04 Prudential       Pounds 9,654.96  Prudential           Pounds 8,677.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60              Annuity  Female 60                    Annuity       Months movement    +3.5%           Months movement    +3.2% Equitable Life  Pounds 10,815.00  London &amp; Manchester  Pounds 9,762.00 Canada Life     Pounds 10,600.92  Canada Life          Pounds 9,723.72 London &amp;  Manchester     Pounds 10,500.00  Equitable Life       Pounds 9,630.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70              Annuity  Female age 70                Annuity       Months movement    +0.3%           Months movement    +1.1% Canada Life     Pounds 13,793.28  Canada Life         Pounds 11,952.00 Equitable Life  Pounds 13,763.04  Equitable Life      Pounds 11,832.00 RNPFN           Pounds 13,758.96  RNPFN               Pounds 11,825.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint Life - 100% spouses benefit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 57        Annuity  Male 65/Female 63            Annuity       Months movement    +3.0%           Months movement    +3.2% Canada Life             8,866.20  London &amp; Manchester  Pounds 9,527.04 London &amp;  Manchester      Pounds 8,822.04  Canada Life          Pounds 9,485.52 Prudential       Pounds 8,771.04  Prudential           Pounds 9,329.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance.

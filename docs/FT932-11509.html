			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / People: Ford jumps ship from P&amp;O One of Lord Sterling's key lieutenants has decided to jump ship. Peter Ford, 54, who joined Jeffrey Sterling's Sterling Guarantee Trust in 1970, has resigned as an executive director of The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Ford is one of a small group of senior executives who followed Sterling around as he expanded out of the property business and took control of P&amp;O. Ford, who has a Harvard MBA and has worked for McKinsey &amp; Co, was appointed to the P&amp;O board in February 1985 following its merger with Sterling Guarantee Trust. During his time with Sterling he came to prominence as the chairman of P&amp;O European Ferries during the strike. But he has done several other jobs including looking after the group's shopping and exhibition centres. Most recently, Ford has been in charge of P&amp;O's industrial services businesses, a large part of which were sold to Granada last month. Rather than move to another part of the P&amp;O empire, Ford has decided that he would like to pursue his own interests outside the group. He is a past chairman of the Sheffield Business School.</p>

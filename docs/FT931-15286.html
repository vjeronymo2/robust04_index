			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: ISMA rules confirmed THE European Commission has confirmed the rules of the International Securities Market Association do not breach EC competition law, the bond market trade association said yesterday, writes Richard Waters. The EC 'comfort letter', first sought by ISMA in March 1990, gives the association limited protection from legal action under EC law, said Mr John Langton, secretary-general of the association. ISMA decided to seek the EC's assurance since it is not subject to any single national regulatory system - although it is a Designated Investment Exchange in the UK and its rules are reviewed by the UK's Office of Fair Trading. Before issuing its letter, the EC last year forced the association to drop two rules which had restricted inter-dealer brokers in the international bond markets to dealing only with market-makers, rather than with end investors.</p>

Deputy foreign ministers from Turkey, France, the United  States and Britain reviewed the implementation of the operation,  expressing their satisfaction with the work.    In a joint statement issued after the meeting, they  reiterated "the commitment to the preservation of the  independence, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq."    They also said they oppose all acts and efforts that may  lead  to the division and dismemberment of Iraq.    The statement, meanwhile, also called upon the Iraqi  Government to lift the economic blockade and remove all  restrictions imposed upon the northern part of the country.    The participants said that the future political structure of  Iraq must be determined by the "entire people of Iraq"  peacefully and democratically.    During the meeting, France, Britain and the United States  voiced their full support for Turkey's right of self-defense  against the violence of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party  (PKK), which has been launching attacks on public and military  targets of Turkey from their bases in Northern Iraq.    They said the territory of Iraq should not be a safe-haven  for the "terrorists."    Forty-eight warplanes from the U.S., Britain and France,  backed by support and transport aircraft, have been carrying out  daily patrols over northern Iraq since the Gulf war ended in  late February 1991.    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Turkish Deputy  Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk said turkey explained in detail  the heavy economic losses it continues to face due to the 1991  Gulf war and the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.    France, Britain and the U.S. promised to consult further for  ways and means of alleviating the heavy economic burden on  Turkey, which is trying to resume its border trade with Iraq.</p>

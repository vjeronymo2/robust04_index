			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Six-month pay freeze at Rover ROVER, the UK carmaking subsidiary of British Aerospace, is imposing a six-month pay freeze on its 34,000-strong workforce, including directors and senior managers. Mr John Towers, group managing director, said the freeze was necessary to 'help protect the company from the worst consequences of the recession'. The announcement came as other companies announced more job losses. These are on top of more than 4,500 announced on Tuesday. IBM said the UK share of its worldwide job reduction programme would be 600 jobs from its 26 sites, including its Portsmouth headquarters and manufacturing plants at Havant, Hampshire; and Greenock, Renfrewshire. Boulton and Paul, one of Britain's largest joinery companies, said it would close 18 sales centres with the loss of 387 jobs at sites including its Norwich headquarters and its sites at Maldon, Essex; Lowestoft, Suffolk; and Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Sales centres would also be closed. Research Machines, the computer manufacturer, is to cut 120 jobs at Didcot, Oxfordshire, and Oxford. Other job losses include 50 at Yardley Lentheric, the perfume and soap company, at Basildon, Essex; and 90 by Eastern Electricity in its contracting division. Sunblest Bakeries is to shut down half its bread production in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with the loss of 65 jobs. However, CFM Northern Ireland, the computing services company 75 per cent owned by ICL, is to create 150 jobs in Ulster in a Pounds 7.5m investment backed by the Industrial Development Board. Rover's pay freeze comes a week after it announced a Pounds 31m operating loss for the first six months of the year and follows moves last week by Ford and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to cut 2,500 jobs as the recession continues to take a heavy toll on the British motor industry. Mr Tony Woodley, national officer of the Transport and General Workers' Union and trade union chairman of the Rover joint negotiating committee, said Rover workers had only recently accepted sweeping changes in working practices, which had been agreed 'outside the normal pay and bargaining round, with no extra cash being paid. To further penalise a workforce by a pay pause, which in any other words is a pay cut, is not acceptable.' Mr Towers said Rover's costs were still too high. The freeze was 'not negotiable'. Rover was upholding the commitment to no compulsory redundancies it made as part of its 'new deal' reforms in working practices. The trade unions had been due to submit a pay claim next week. Rover intends to press ahead with the talks, but any increase agreed will not be implemented until May 1.</p>

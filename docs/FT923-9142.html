			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: CAE slips in first quarter CAE Industries, a leading international flight-simulator maker, posted lower first-quarter profit, but a CDollars 35m (USDollars 29.6m) order for Cathay Pacific will bolster its order-book. For the June quarter, CAE earned CDollars 5.7m or 5 cents a share, down 15 per cent from CDollars 6.7m, or 7 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 240m against CDollars 273m. The slowdown in world aviation has reduced commercial simulator orders and revenues will be flat this year, the company said. Earnings for fiscal 1993 should improve slightly over fiscal 1992, said Mr David Race, president.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Unilever improves 13% in spite of difficult conditions: Strong fourth quarter helps Anglo-Dutch group to Pounds 2bn profit UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, increased pre-tax profits 13 per cent last year to Pounds 2.03bn, helped by a recovery in North America and a strong performance in Latin America and Asia. Mr Michael Perry, chairman, said the result, which compared with Pounds 1.79bn in 1991, had been achieved in spite of difficult conditions, particularly in the US and Europe. 'Economic recovery proved to be an illusion in many of our major markets,' he said. Though the result augured well for this year, it was too early to be confident that the economic environment would be any less harsh. He saw no sign of any improvement in UK trading conditions and did not expect the economy to recover rapidly. However, he hoped for an upturn by the end of the year in Germany after a deeper than expected economic decline. Unilever's fourth quarter pre-tax profit rose 13 per cent to Pounds 522m from Pounds 461m on a 5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 6.37bn (Pounds 6.08bn). Full-year turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 24.7bn (Pounds 23.16bn), and operating margins remained static at 8.6 per cent. Underlying volume growth rose to 2.5 per cent from 1 per cent, though it remained below the group's 4 per cent target. Mr Perry said that though the sterling devaluation had affected only the fourth quarter, the impact of currency instability was evident in the fact that earnings for the full year grew 9 per cent when measured at constant exchange rates, 12 per cent in sterling, 5 per cent in Dutch guilders and 13 per cent in US dollars. At constant exchange rates, full year turnover grew 4 per cent and pre-tax profits 11 per cent. Most of Unilever's consumer products businesses performed well, with a particularly strong showing by personal products and detergents. However, operating profits in meals, meal components and professional markets fell in the year, while speciality chemicals turned in flat results. Exceptional items helped Unilever's North American businesses to lift operating profits 14.6 per cent but, along with the effects of disposals, produced a flat result in Europe. However, Unilever's underlying performance in Europe proved resilient. In the rest of the world, the strong growth of a number of regional economies helped the group raise operating profit by 18 per cent, while the loss in Japan was reduced. Interest costs fell to Pounds 148m (Pounds 276m), reflecting lower rates and a reduction in debt to Pounds 1.2bn from Pounds 1.5bn, which lowered gearing to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 69.14p (61.62p) in the full year and by 28 per cent to 20.3p (15.8p) in the fourth quarter. The final dividend is raised to 15.6p (13.91p), bringing the full year total to 20.8p (18.94p). Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 25</p>

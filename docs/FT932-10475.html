			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warburg in talks over Zeneca rights price SG WARBURG, the global co-ordinator for the rights issue for Zeneca, Imperial Chemical Industries' bioscience business, is testing the market with a rights price of about 600p. Opinions differ whether investors would be willing to accept that price. It implies the Pounds 1.3bn issue would be on a 1-for-3 basis. If Warburg can only achieve a lower price the issue could be on a 3-for-10 basis. Warburg was unable to comment. However, it is understood the merchant bank was actively talking to potential underwriters before the pricing of the issue next Wednesday. The bank's difficulties were compounded this week by the announcement that the US healthcare reforms would not be revealed until the middle of June. The industry had expected the reforms to be announced during the third week of May. Official trading in Zeneca's shares starts on June 1. The mixed economic indicators coming from the US, where more than 40 per cent of Zeneca's speciality businesses are based, have also upset forecasts for the group's results. 'Given the uncertainty, this deal will need a substantial discount,' says one broker. Mr Charles Lambert, chemical analyst at Smith New Court, explained: 'It's clear 600p is too high. The dilemma is trying to work out the size of the discount. If it's at the conventional 20 per cent, then it values Zeneca at an ex-rights price of Pounds 7.20, which would be far too high. We reckon that the rights price should be about 530p and an ex-rights price of 630p.' However, some brokers believe the 600p rights price is acceptable. One estimates that would imply an ultimate yield of 5.9 per cent, better than the market average of 4.8 per cent.</p>

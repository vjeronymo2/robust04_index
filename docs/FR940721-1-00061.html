			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following a full consideration of the testimony and comments, the Secretary has concluded that the 1992 final rule's employer-employee exemption was too broad. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the final rule by withdrawing the exemption set forth in &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of that rule. This amendment will have the effect of providing that, while an employer may compensate its own bona fide employees for the generation of its own business, all compensation for referrals to outside entities, including affiliates, will be prohibited under RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to withdrawing the exemption, the proposal clarifies specifically when compensation to employees runs afoul of the requirements of RESPA. The rule provides that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) No employee or agent may receive compensation from his or her employer or any other source when the compensation is tied on a one-to-one basis to, or is calculated as a multiple of the number or value of, referrals of business to an affiliated entity; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The compensation of agents or employees who routinely are in direct contact with the consumer may not be based in whole or in part on the value or number of referrals made to affiliated entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These two clarifications are designed to minimize any incentive that a person in a position to make or influence a referral might have to make a referral based on his or her own financial interests. Clearly, compensation calculated as a multiple of the number or value of referrals creates a powerful incentive to make referrals that maximize one's own compensation. Similarly, agents or employees who ordinarily are in direct contact with the consumer may be influenced in making referrals if their overall performance is measured and compensation is set, even in part, based on the number or value of referrals to affiliated entities. The proposal makes clear that RESPA prohibits such compensation. By withdrawing the broad exemption, the potential for conflict of interest by those persons making referrals is reduced, increasing the possibility of true competition among settlement service providers based on the cost and quality of the services provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most facets of the settlement services business are very competitive, and the Secretary wants to assure that the rule does nothing to harm this competitiveness. The provisions set forth above that would clarify how RESPA affects employee compensation can be enforced and will not require HUD to interfere unduly with the internal operations of controlled business arrangements. Because Congress has clearly ruled on the acceptability, with conditions, of controlled business arrangements, the role of the Department is not to encourage or discourage controlled business arrangements, but to clarify what activities between interrelated companies are permissible or not permissible under RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the withdrawal of the exemption, employees of controlled business arrangements could continue to send consumers to affiliated companies, but they may be more likely to exercise independent judgment reflecting the interests of the consumer if the inducement of referral-specific compensation is not present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to withdraw the exemption would obviate the need for a full examination of the question raised by some commenters about whether the exemption in the proposed rule is contrary to the statute, particularly since the Department has decided not to withdraw the employer-employee exemption without notice-and-comment rulemaking. In any event, the Department believes the exemption in the final rule would be legally sustainable, because of the broad exemption authority of the Secretary under Section 19 of RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pending this proposed rule becoming final, the existing employer-employee exemption remains operational and employer payments made in accordance with the existing RESPA regulation will  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> be treated by the Department as conduct violative of the RESPA statute. However, the exemption in the existing rule is only available for employees, not independent contractors, a class that, under the Internal Revenue Code, includes most real estate agents and many others in the settlement services business. Those persons engaging in sham practices in an attempt to avoid the strictures of RESPA are not protected under the 1992 final rule during the pendency of these revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Questions and comments on this proposal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary's proposal on the employer-employee issue seeks to clarify RESPA's consumer protections while avoiding unnecessary intrusion into controlled businesses. The Secretary intends to be flexible in finalizing this proposal in pursuit of these objectives. To assist in this rulemaking, the Secretary is particularly interested in comments containing responses to the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To what extent do you believe the Secretary's proposal will accomplish the objectives of eliminating compensated referrals and other payments that pose the greatest dangers to consumers without overwhelming other legitimate considerations for referrals, such as long-term customer satisfaction?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) What effect will the proposal have on the ability of firms to provide high-quality and well-priced services to consumers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) To what extent do you believe the proposal will unduly interfere with the operations of controlled businesses?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) What would be the effect of any such interference (with the operations of controlled businesses) on consumers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) To what extent do you believe this proposal will interfere with legitimate business development programs of affiliated companies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) To what extent do you believe that the proposal will result in increased competition in the settlement services industry?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) If you disagree with the approach embodied in the proposal, what alternative approaches would increase competition?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Do you believe that the proposal will adequately protect consumers from steering?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

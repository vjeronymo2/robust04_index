			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Supply side improvement as Northern Electric rises 21% A sharp improvement in the performance of its supply business helped Northern Electric lift pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 63.4m, against Pounds 52.6m, in the six months to September 30. Northern is among the most active of the regional electricity companies in the supply market, part of which was opened up to competition in April. Supply profits rose from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 12.8m. Mr David Morris, chairman, said this should lay to rest any uncertainty felt by others about the policy. However, analysts were unconvinced, with some saying that the supply business had been helped by the regulatory cap on prices in the electricity wholesale pool. Group turnover was Pounds 490.7m (Pounds 460.7m). The interim dividend of 9.6p (7.4p) will be paid from earnings of 39p (32.1p). Mr Morris said the company intended to reduce dividend cover from 3.2 times at the last year end to towards two over the next few years. Mr Tony Hadfield, chief executive, said the company benefited from an upturn in the regional economy. He pointed to strong inward investment from overseas companies including Samsung. Stripping out the effects of coal mine closures, distribution volumes grew by 1.5 per cent for operating profits of Pounds 30m (Pounds 36m), but this was after a Pounds 10m charge for redundancy costs. Mr Hadfield said the underlying profits increase in distribution was 15 per cent. Northern yesterday joined the growing number of recs which say they intend to demerge the whole of their holding in the National Grid. Northern owns 6.5 per cent. Mr Alan Groves, finance director, said the company expected gearing to be 10 to 15 per cent by the year end. Net cash at the end of September was Pounds 91m but Pounds 126m payments for a share buy-back were made after the half year ended. Mr Morris disclosed that the company had made an unsuccessful NZDollars 90m (Pounds 36.6m) bid for 49 per cent of Capital Power, an electricity distributor in Wellington, New Zealand. Northern cut 136 jobs in the period to 4,493 and expects to cut 300 more by the year end.</p>

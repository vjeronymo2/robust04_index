			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Metall Mining seeks project METALL Mining, the Canadian-based mining subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft (MG) metals group, wants to concentrate more heavily on copper production and refining. The group said yesterday it planned to buy a large mining project. Metall is 'aggressively pursuing' the acquisition of a large copper mining project. The company currently has a modest exposure to copper. It is developing the Izok Lake property in Canada's Northwest Territories, believed to be North America's biggest undeveloped zinc and copper deposit. Metall said it expected copper demand and prices to improve as countries in south-east Asia, South America and eastern Europe expanded their housing, infrastructure and communications facilities. Expansion in copper smelting would also reduce the company's vulnerability to changes in copper treatment charges, and improve its chances of acquiring mining assets. Copper and other metal smelting charges have risen sharply in the past two years. The centrepiece of the company's plans is the possible acquisition of MG's substantial copper smelting and refining assets. These include a 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie of Hamburg, one of Europe's biggest copper producers, and a 40 per cent interest in Austria's Montawerke Brixlegg. Metall would pay a 'substantial portion' of the purchase price by issuing common shares to MG. The German company presently has a 59 per cent stake in Metall Mining. Metall directors have retained NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, to prepare a valuation of MG's copper smelting assets. Smelting capacity may also be increased at 87 per cent-owned Copper Range, an integrated producer in northern Michigan. Copper Range is presently conducting a feasibility study to expand smelting capacity from 75,000 tonnes to 135,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Protests over seal exports to China International animal rights activists have clashed head-on with the devastated Newfoundland fishing industry over a proposed deal to export 50,000 seals from the Canadian Atlantic province to China. The International Fund for Animal Welfare said the seals would be used chiefly for their genitalia. According to the fund, seal penises sell for Dollars 170 (Pounds 116) each in the Far East, where they are a popular aphrodisiac. They are dried and ground and infused into rice wine. Ifaw yesterday launched a strong protest against the deal, which is being negotiated between Terra Nova Fishery and Shanghai Fisheries. It has enlisted the support of 109 British members of parliament from all parties, who signed an early day motion calling on Canada to cancel the deal. The MPs say the slaughter of seals primarily for aphrodisiacs is 'as obscene as it is absurd'. Many called on Canada's government to recognise the revulsion felt in the UK and Canada. Mr Walter Carter, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, insisted that the seal order would be allowed to proceed only on condition that the entire carcass, including fur, meat and oil, was used. Research suggests that seal oil may contain an anti-cholesterol agent. 'We would not support any person who would harvest a seal just to get the sex organs,' Mr Carter said. He acknowledged, however, that the authorities were unable to control the end uses of any particular part of the carcass. The Chinese order is more than double last year's Newfoundland seal harvest and would provide much-needed business for the province. Fish stocks have virtually disappeared from Canada's east coast, once one of the world's richest fishing grounds. Ottawa banned cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland last month, putting 30,000 people out of work. 'Newfoundlanders can't even catch a fish for their own table for the first time in 500 years,' Mr Carter said yesterday. Newfoundland's seal population has risen rapidly to an estimated 3m-4m since harvesting was cut in the 1980s after a highly effective protest against clubbing seal pups for fur. Marine biologists suspect that the seals, which each eat about 20 lbs of fish a day, have contributed to the demise of the fishery. Mr Carter believes that up to 180,000 animals could be killed each year without posing any threat to the species.</p>

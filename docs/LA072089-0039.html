			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: READER FLIPS OVER A QUARTER WITH REVERSE ON BOTH SIDES  </P> <P> Question: While searching through my laundry quarters for a 1989 flawed coin  (missing its mint mark and the last 9 in the date, which was called "worth its  weight in gold" in a recent news broadcast), I found a quarter with tails on  both sides. Is this a joke coin or did the U.S. Mint make a mistake even more  grievous than the above mentioned? Also, what's it worth? -- D.J.R.  </P> <P> Answer: Your letter helps point out both the negative and positive in today's  numismatics. The negative deals with the hype connected with the revelation  that a 1989 quarter had been discovered with a missing mint mark and other  flaws. The media immediately jumped on this story and had people all over the  country checking their quarters. After all, it was said, such coins were worth  as much as $300. Or as you indicate, "their weight in gold."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, this was not the case. In fact, it didn't take error-coin  specialists long to determine that the problem was caused by a grease-filled  die, a very common error indeed. So common, in fact, that this coin (plentiful,  not rare) that had been touted as high as $300 only a few days earlier was  downgraded to about $3. Now $3 for a 25-cent coin is still a hefty profit, but  it's not the pot at the end of the rainbow.  </P> <P> Some dealers who paid $50 or $100 or more for these error quarters are probably  still trying to recoup their losses and charging inflated prices, which is  where the negative comes in. Others are taking their losses, as well they  should, and moving on to more conventional coin transactions, which is the  positive.  </P> <P> As for your quarter with tails on both sides, it's a manufactured piece made  for magicians or flipping. Either way, it has no collector value.  </P> <P> Q: Would you be so kind as to voice your thoughts on the slow, slow delivery of  the United States Mint? -- L.W.  </P> <P> A: I know it can be very aggravating to order coins and then wait for what  seems an eternity before they arrive. Complaints are lodged from time to time  regarding the mint's delivery service, and undoubtedly mistakes are made when  you consider the millions of requests received annually. However, I believe on  balance the mint does a pretty good job. Just be patient, or order early.  </P> <P> Q: I would like to know the approximate worth of the coin shown below. (The  rubbing appears to be a Colonial half cent from Massachusetts, 1778.) -- T.B.  </P> <P> A: Colonial coins were issued by the original Colonies in order to facilitate  commerce. Massachusetts is probably most famous for the Pine Tree pieces, but  they were not officially authorized, as your coin was. It's exciting to imagine  early settlers actually handling such coinage. From the description, your coin  is copper (not bronze as you indicate), although they were also made in silver.  Such pieces are worth $75 and up, depending upon condition.  </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Korean and South Korean paper money, including many notes that have never  before appeared in a public sale, will highlight an auction Sept. 6-8 at the  1989 Hong Kong International Coin Show. Included is a Bank of Chosen 1945  100-yen uncirculated specimen note (pictured) estimated to be worth $500 to  $600. Catalogues are $10 from Pacific Coast Auction Galleries, 1013 State St.,  Santa Barbara, Calif. 93101.  </P> <P> Earlier this year I published the list of Joel Rettew's picks for investment  coins that he had submitted in competition with other coin experts. So far,  Rettew is leading the pack with his selections showing a 258% appreciation.  Rettew heads Rare Coin Investments, 1000 Bristol St. North, Newport Beach,  Calif. 92660; telephone (714) 833-1800.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alpert cannot answer mail personally but will respond to numismatic questions  of general interest in this column.

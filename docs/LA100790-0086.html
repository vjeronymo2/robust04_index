			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY HELMETS CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE, DEATH  </P> <P> As a mother who never considered purchasing safety helmets for my children, I  learned the hard way just how important it is.  </P> <P> After our 7-year-old son rode his bicycle into a parked vehicle this summer, he  lost consciousness, had amnesia, a hematoma and a 4-inch crack through his  skull. But he was one of the lucky ones -- he survived. If only we had given  him a helmet to wear along with the responsibility that goes with riding a  bicycle, we could have saved him, as well as our family, a lot of pain.  </P> <P> Please consider a helmet to go along with that new bike this Christmas. I wish  we had.  </P> <P> LINDA FORSHEE, Yorba Linda  </P></p>

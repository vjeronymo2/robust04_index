			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Aluminium industry shows its metal Aluminium has been around since the early 1800s, but industry in general remains woefully ignorant about the uses of the metal. It is a condition which Brian Turner, president of the Aluminium Federation in the UK, describes as 'one of the appalling educational failures of recent decades'. The European aluminium industry is belatedly setting out to rectify the position with a Pounds 1m programme aimed at educational institutions and industries that use the metal. Geoff Budd, the UK project manager, says the programmes should end the days of lecturers telling students: 'Aluminium is roughly the same as steel, but a bit more difficult.' He points out that undergraduate mechanical engineers were provided with no information about aluminium 30 years ago and were still not being taught about it last year. Under a European Commission programme known as Comett ll, the aluminium industries in nine EC and European Free Trade Association countries and 25 universities are setting out to put aluminium on the educational map. The EC is providing about one third of the Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) cost, while the universities are contributing their time. The industry is footing the rest of the bill, mainly through the UK's Aluminium Federation, Germany's Aluminium-Zentrale and SkanAluminium in the Nordic countries. The Aluminium Training Partnership (ATP) provides the link between the industry and the universities. The second and most important project is known as Talat, an acronym for Training for Aluminium Application Technologies. Its objective is to produce 150 hours of teaching material covering five aluminium application technology areas at three levels of attainment. The subject areas being targeted are aluminium materials technology; design; manufacturing and forming; joining technology; and surface technology. For each subject one or more groups of university partners have been formed, each with specialist contacts in the industry. They aim to produce lectures suitable for courses in nearly all the relevant areas of technical education.</p>

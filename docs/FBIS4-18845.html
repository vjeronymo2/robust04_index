			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Udine, April 12 (TANJUG)--The technical bureau of  the Italian military airport in Aviano, close to Udine, on  Monday [11 April] turned away a squadron of U.S. F-16's which  were scheduled to land there. The technical bureau froze all  contracts on servicing NATO aircraft.    Well informed sources say that this rejection of the U.S.  fighter planes, which came from Germany, is the result of  increasingly deteriorating relations between the Italian Air  Force and NATO.    Aviano has for months been one of NATO's main bases from  where air actions over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were  launched.    The two U.S. F-16's, which bombed Serb positions near  Gorazde  on Sunday, also came from this air base.    NATO warplanes on Sunday bombed Serb positions near Gorazde,  a Moslem enclave ruled by the United Nations as a safe area  which was set to be demilitarized last spring. In late March  10,000 Moslems surged from this zone in a strong offensive on  Serb territories.    After the failure of the Moslem offensive the Serbs launched  a strong counterattack coming to several km away from the city.</p>

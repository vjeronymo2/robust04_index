			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (18): Strategic link with the Met  -User view: London's Metropolitan Police adopts a corporate, rather than an ad hoc approach to information technology THE METROPOLITAN Police chose Ingres as the means to link together a number of information systems, to make possible the exchange of data between disparate multi-vendor systems. This has not precluded the use of other databases - the Met also uses Sybase, Informix and Rdb. 'We are looking for competitive pressure to improve the whole marketplace,' explains Royston Barker, manager of information technology (IT) infrastructure. The Metropolitan Police wanted to go for a collaborative venture between itself and its suppliers - 'our view was put up or shut up - I can only listen to salesmen for so long,' says Royston Barker. 'We got round the table with Unisys, DEC and Ingres.' An ICL flat file database was successfully converted to Ingres, in full view of all the parties. This convinced the Metropolitan Police that it could extract existing data and integrate it with information on the new system. This gave the Met confidence that the product worked and fitted its strategy. Accordingly, it signed a five-year, unlimited access licence, covering the whole Metropolitan Police area. This also gives the Met access to products which may be released within that period. 'We have a good relationship with Ingres, we even have access to the source code,' he adds. Client/server architecture is used to enable processing power to be located at the most appropriate location. Administrative systems will continue to be centralised, while those which are more critical will be distributed, even as far as individual police stations. The Met adopts a corporate, rather than ad hoc, approach to development. Its policy is to pool and share expertise. Ingres offers it a tool to carry this forward. 'It may not meet all our needs, but we have an eye on other developments' says Royston Barker. 'The key is to be able to extract corporate data and move it across development platforms.' Open systems capability, independent of hardware, is therefore an important requirement. Although not a commercial organisation, the Metropolitan Police shares many IT needs with large companies trying to impose coherent strategies to network corporate information.</p>

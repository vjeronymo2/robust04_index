			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Treasury auction success gives Dow modest boost Wall Street US EQUITIES posted moderate gains yesterday afternoon on news of a successful Treasury auction of 10-year notes, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 13.41 to 2,930.90 amid light New York SE volume of 157.2m shares. On the big board, advances outscored declines by 860 to 664. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.19 to 378.51. On Tuesday the Dow fell 24 points in the aftermath of disappointing demand at the three-year note sale which triggered a bond market retreat and a late afternoon sell-off in stocks. Concern about yesterday's afternoon auction resulted in exceptionally quiet trading in the bond and stock markets during the morning. Technology issues recovered after Tuesday's weakness. IBM, which plans to cut its computer workstation prices by as much as 60 per cent, gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 103 3/4 . Digital Equipment put on Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 65 1/4 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 . Upjohn, which told investors that it is committed to remaining independent although a number of its patents on important drugs will expire in the mid-1990s, declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 1/2 in heavy trading. Eljer Industries leapt Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 21 7/8 on news that a unit of the UK's Hanson had bid Dollars 20 a share in cash for the heating, ventilation and plumbing products concern. The Eljer share price had traded as low as Dollars 5 1/2 in mid-October. Occidental Petroleum, which has agreed to sell its North Sea oil interests for Dollars 1.35bn in cash to a joint venture led by France's Elf Aquitaine, added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 20 1/4 . Disappointing first-quarter sales at Toys R Us pushed the shares down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 7/8 . Fears that a takeover bid valued at more than Dollars 1bn including debt for Vista Chemical from RWE, the giant German utility, had run into trouble prompted heavy trading in Vista's shares, which dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 . Du Pont advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 3/4 after Smith Barney increased its rating on the stock to buy from hold, although it also reduced its 1991 earnings estimate to Dollars 3.25 a share from Dollars 3.35. Dow Chemical, another big chemical company, improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 . In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.00 to 492.51, but Apple Computer receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 . Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 103 after announcing a three-for-two stock split, effective on June 18. Medimmune traded at Dollars 11 1/2 . An initial offering of 2.5m of its common stock was priced at Dollars 9 1/4 late on Tuesday. Mesa Airlines, which said its new fleet of larger aircraft would put pressure on its short-term load factor, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 14 1/4 . It posted second-quarter net earnings of 31 cents a share compared with 29 cents a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly firmer bias on thin trading, after moving within a narrow range throughout the day. The composite index edged up 3.2 to 3,482.0 and rises led falls by 296 to 235. Volume amounted to 19.2m shares. Power Corp, which shed CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 16 3/8 , said its first-quarter earnings fell to 23 cents a share from the 34 cents recorded a year earlier. Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting, a 64 per cent owned subsidiary of Noranda, said workers at its lead-zinc mine in New Brunswick have voted to end a 10-month-long strike. Brunswick firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 8 and Noranda gained CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 18 1/2 . Newbridge Networks led the list of most active industrial stocks for the second day, closing up another CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 10 1/2 . The company attributed the activity to a two-year general agreement announced on Monday between Newbridge and two units of Nynex.</p>

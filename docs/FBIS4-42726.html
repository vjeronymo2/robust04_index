			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) urged its 25 member nations  Tuesday [7 June] to review regulations on wages and working  hours as a way to create jobs.    In a report on employment and unemployment, the Paris-based  Western think tank also called for improvement of education and  job training systems to meet a shift in demand away from  unskilled jobs to more highly skilled jobs.    The report came out as the OECD opened a two-day ministerial  meeting to look into ways to secure employment, with as many as  35 million people out of work within the group.    As for working hours, the report proposes introducing  flexible working schedules for part-time workers, reducing  overtime allowances and reviewing the minimum wage to provide  more job opportunities.    But the report is quick to underline the need to carry out  the changes without reducing social protection levels for  workers.    "High unemployment should be addressed not by seeking to  slow  the pace of change, but rather by restoring economies' and  societies' capacity to adapt it [as received]," the report says.    "But this must be undertaken in ways which do not abandon  the  social objectives of OECD societies. Rather, social objectives  must be met in new, more carefully designed ways that do not  have the past unintended and undesirable side effects."    It brushes aside a persistent argument in some industrial  nations that imports of low-priced goods from developing nations  is the main cause of unemployment in industrial nations,  describing such a view as "ill-founded."    The report points to data showing that the weight of  low-wage  countries' exports in the overall expenditure of OECD countries  on goods and services is only about 1.5 percent.    "The number of markets which they (low-wage countries)  contest is greater, and their effect on the intensity of  competition is increasing," it says.    "But the judgment on present evidence is that the overall  impact both of imports from these countries and their  contestation of OECD markets is too small to account for a  significant part of either current unemployment or falling  relative wages of the low-skilled."</p>

When  facing the challenge of the market economy, can this principle  still be maintained? This has become a question concerning the  CPC leaders. History has repeatedly proved that as long as the  armed forces are being effectively control, the whole country  will be kept under good control. Therefore, the CPC has long  made good preparations for this, and other people do not need to  worry. The CPC has worked out a series of countermeasures to  ensure that the armed forces will not be affected by the  torrents of the market economy, and the purity of the armed  forces will be conscientiously maintained.    According sources from Zhongnanhai, the CPC authorities will  soon adopt two important measures for the purpose of controlling  the armed forces. One is to prohibit the armed forces from  engaging in business activities, and the other is to  substantially increase the military expenses this year in order  to boost the morale of the troops.    Both measures are serious matters. If they are not arranged  and carried out carefully, they may not achieve the expected  results and may end up with a fiasco. First, the armed forces  have developed into a gigantic economic entity in recent years,  and have become the third largest foreign exchange earner in  China (including the export of armaments). Although a large  part of such foreign exchange income was handed over to the  central authorities, the armed forces still gained political  credit for such contributions. However, the economic benefit  was a strong magnet for military personnel, who are living in  difficult conditions. In the previous years, the central  authorities could not allocate substantial amounts of money to  support the armed forces, and the military units were allowed to  engage in profit-seeking business activities. The vested  business interests of the armed forces have become a fait  accompli, so the central authorities can no longer turn a blind  eye to it.    However, while engaging in business activities, the armed  forces also found that its combat strength declined. Moreover,  the central authorities decided to further reduce the size of  the troops from some 3 million people to 2.5 million people (but  the pace of disarmament will not be too quick). Thus, the  combat strength of the armed forces will become more  questionable. In addition, as the armed forced are involved in  economic activities, there are increasing opportunities for  their cooperation with local governments, and this may enable  them to form a certain type of alliance against the central  authorities. This will be very unfavorable to the central  authorities. Therefore, the central leadership must do  something to remove such hidden perils.    Through consideration and after consulting major military  leaders, the CPC central leadership decided to "again focus the  efforts of the armed forces on national defense construction by  adopting some orderly steps." To put it more plainly, that is  to prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business  activities.    Recently, when talking about government work, Jiang Zemin,  CPC Central Military Commission Chairman, and State Council  Premier Li Peng announced this intention by saying that "the  central leadership has decided to stop the production and  business activities undertaken by the armed forces, and transfer  all the enterprises run by military units to local civilian  institutions." This decision will produce a major impact. Will  the military units which are making handsome profits obediently  give up their money-making means? What financial resources will  be used to support the armed forces then? And will this change  the relationship between the armed forces and the central  authorities?    It is learned that the central authorities will adopt three  measures to solve these questions. First, personnel affairs  related to enterprises currently run by the armed forces should  be properly arranged so that they may officially be separated  from the military establishment and the enterprises can be  turned into independent legal persons. The enterprises  originally run by the armed forces will be turned into  state-owned enterprises run by demobilized soldiers as  representatives of the legal person appointed by the state, and  the state will protect their gains and interests.    Second, the state will increase the military budget and  ensure that the living conditions of military personnel will be  improved. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng both said: "Military funds  must be allocated to the armed forces, which should depend on  the state's allocations. As the commodity economy is being  developed in the whole country, people have improved their  livelihood but the troops still live in rather difficult  conditions. This may affect the work of the armed forces. Then  what should be done? After the enterprises run by the armed  forces are taken over by the state, the central authorities will  increase the appropriations to the armed forces. As the armed  forces are carrying out the mission of defending the motherland,  funds must be allocated to them." Therefore, at the forthcoming  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, it is  certain that the military budget will be directly and indirectly  increased by a big margin. Last year, military expenditure  increased by 14 percent over the previous year, and this marked  the most prominent increase among all budget items. It is  expected that this year, the military budget will be increased  by at least 10 percent.    The third measure is to convince military leaders  (especially those at advanced ages) and solicit their  endorsement and support. In the past, in addition to stressing  military modernization, they always stressed the need to  maintain the quality of the armed forces. In general, the old  guard, being different from the younger officers, tend to accept  the opinion of the central leadership on giving consideration to  overall interests. It is learned that the two vice chairmen of  the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen,  have agreed in principle to shift the enterprises run by the  armed forces to the state. However, they held that this matter  must be handled prudently and properly.    If the enterprises run by the armed forces are actually  separated from the armed forces, this will promote the process  of turning the armed forces into the hands of the state.  However, in the eyes of the CPC, the most important purpose of  this change is to ensure that the armed forces will have to rely  on the state's financial support (and the state is also the  party). Eventually, the armed forces will remain subject to the  party's absolute control. This will prevent the armed forces  from possessing their own financial sources and thus becoming  independent from the party's control. That is, this will  prevent a tendency towards independence in the armed forces.</p>

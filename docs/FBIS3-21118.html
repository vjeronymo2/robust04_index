			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation has developed a  semiconductor laser for a home optical communications system.  This new laser operates at high temperatures at low current and  emits in the 1.3 band with high reliability. Because the  laser provides stable operation even at high temperatures, there  is no need for a cooler to control the temperature, which will  lead to greater compactness and lower costs. Sample shipments  will begin in January 1994, and Mitsubishi plans to produce  10,000 units per month beginning in April. The sample price will  be &yen;10,000.    The operating current at high temperatures is only about 70  mA, which is half the current required by previous semiconductor  lasers, and the threshold current for laser emission is 20 mA,  which is only three-fifths that of previous models. Thanks to  this reduction in operating current, Mitsubishi says that the  unit will maintain stable operation at 85C with an optical  output of 10 mW for an estimated 20,000 hours or longer.    Semiconductor lasers are used as light sources in optical  communications, but they get very hot from the heat produced by  nearby electrical circuits. Because the semiconductor lasers  used in intercity trunk line systems have operating currents  exceeding 100 mA at high temperatures, the lasers deteriorate  from the high current.    Therefore, when a communications system with an optical  fiber  line running to each house is created in the future, a  semiconductor laser with high reliability and low operating  current will be needed.</p>

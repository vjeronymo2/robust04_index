			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Why the sins of one economist should not be visited on all Sir, The internal memo on the economics of the environment by the World Bank's chief economist, a professional of some distinction, prompts Michael Prowse ('Save Planet Earth from economists', February 10) to castigate the entire profession of economists. But the sins of one economist should not be visited on all. Admittedly, the memo, if taken seriously, is sloppy and flawed in its arguments. To judge the air quality in Africa as 'inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City' because transport costs and non-tradeability of air prevent trade in air pollution and waste is simply wrong. 'Efficiency' can only be determined taking these 'technological' constraints such as non-tradeability into account. Also, efficiency must reflect objectives. It could well be that former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere and the pastoral Masai have a greater preference for clean air (relative to income) than Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his BMW-driving citizens. But the assertion that a 'given amount of health-impairing pollution should be done in the country with the lowest cost (measured as the foregone earnings from increased morbidity and mortality), which will be the country with the lowest wages', and that therefore 'the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable', is a fallacy. The discharge of an equal quantity of chemical pollutants into an Indian lake where lower-wage people drink the water may be more harmful than if the target of the pollution was Lake Michigan, in the higher-wage US. Malnourished people may die far more readily from an equal dose of pollution than well-fed people. But, most of all, no modern economist, when his house is on fire, will pull his father out before his mother because the father earns more than the mother] Economists have learned, at least since the 1960s, to broaden their analysis to include objectives (including the environment) other than just goods and services. Economics, properly understood and used, has much to offer in helping the environmentalists achieve their objectives efficiently and at least cost. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade report on trade and the environment, issued last week, demonstrates this by taking seriously the environmentalists' concerns over trade rules, by analysing the relative advantages of different ways of achieving environmental objectives, and by arguing that unilateral suspensions of other nations' trading rights are the most expensive way to do so. Dialogue of this kind, based on first-rate economics, should help us find reasonable solutions to our environmental concerns. Economists and environmentalists should join hands to create a shared success. Jagdish Bhagwati, economic adviser to the director-general, Gatt, Rue de Lausanne 154, Geneva, Switzerland</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Mario Soares by Franz-Olivier </F> Giesbert and Philippe Gelie; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [LE FIGARO] What do you think is the priority: to  strengthen Europe politically, or to enlarge the club of the  Twelve?    [Soares] We must do both at the same time.    [LE FIGARO] Would not such change be too much of a shock for  newcomers?    [Soares] Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland want to join  the Union. Their motives are mostly economic. But we need to  explain to them that enlargement without a renewed political  structure is not a viable proposition. One of these days,  Europe will fall apart unless it has a political structure and a  real European constitution. We need European parties, European  trade unions, etc.    [LE FIGARO] After taking in such countries, will it be  necessary to rebalance the Union to the south, for instance by  having Malta or Cyprus join in?    [Soares] Yes, I believe it is necessary. We shall also need  to readjust eastward.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe that Europe is taking too long in  opening its doors to new Eastern democracies?    [Soares] Yes, without any doubt. I believe Europe has not  proved bold enough, that its response to the perspectives that  have opened has been completely inadequate. The Europe we built  was one based on the divide between two blocs. Now that blocs  have vanished, we cannot keep looking at Europe in the same  light as before.    [LE FIGARO] How do you view Europe's attitude with respect  to the Bosnian conflict?    [Soares] Europe has not progressed as far as external policy  and defense are concerned. Institutionally, Europe has made no  headway either. Bosnia is a good reason for us to speed up the  construction of a real European political structure.    [LE FIGARO] Is not the Maastricht crisis behind us, now?    [Soares] Things have improved, no doubt about it. But  everything remains to be done. One major problem is the fact  that since Europe's inception, the driving force has been the  Franco-German axis. What will become of this axis in the  future? That is the question. There is no certainty that all  difficulties have been overcome.    [LE FIGARO] What are you worried about?    [Soares] What will come out of the election in Germany?  Chancellor Kohl has taken a major part in the European  construction; he has always been strongly pro-European. He is a  German of the West. We do not know whether his successors will  share his European ideal.    [LE FIGARO] Doesn't Europe need a charismatic figure?    [Soares] Yes, I think so. You know, for years, all  Europeans have tended to look at Mitterrand as the man who  embodied this determination to build Europe. But Mitterrand is  now reaching the end of his term....    [LE FIGARO] Among Europe's other potentially troublesome  neighbors are also North African countries, and especially  Algeria. What turn do you expect things will take in Algeria?    [Soares] I do not see any short-term solution.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe a military dictatorship can work  toward the reestablishment of a civilian government in a few  years' time?    [Soares] This can only be a temporary solution.    [LE FIGARO] There is the example of Turkey....    [Soares] Turkey remains a problematic country, but true,  things have not gone too awry there.    [LE FIGARO] Is Islam the West's new enemy, now that  communism is dead?    [Soares] There are exponents of Islam with whom it is  possible to talk. One cannot be satisfied with a simplistic  vision of the problem; no attitude could be worse. There are  positive forces within Islam. We must encourage and help them.  One must never lose sight of the economic and social context in  which Islam thrives. This is what fuels religious fundamentalism.    [LE FIGARO] Even in Saudi Arabia?    [Soares] We should not let Saudi Arabia remain the way it  is, we should not let the people of Islam revert to archaic  models.    [LE FIGARO] And still we do nothing about it....    [Soares] The West does nothing about it; that is the West's  mistake. If one wants to foster democracy, one cannot tolerate  dictators. This is the contradiction at the core of the United  States' policies, as well as Europe's, to a lesser extent. Take  East Timor, which was annexed illegally by Indonesia after the  1975 military invasion. We have been exerting pressure on the  United Nations so that this island's right to self-determination  may be recognized. This is a just cause. And yet, when we ask  France or other European countries for help, we are faced with a  wall of silence. Of course, Indonesia is a powerful country  that purchases European goods. So we conveniently forget that  it is a dictatorship.    [LE FIGARO] Is not your position somewhat inconsistent?  On the one hand you advocate dialogue with Algeria's  fundamentalists, and on the other you believe that we should  interfere with Indonesia or Saudi Arabia's affairs -- hard-line  regimes, to be sure, but without a civil war.    [Soares] No, they do not have a civil war, they are  dictatorships. One must call a spade a spade -- and  dictatorships are dictatorships. And one must not respect those  as though they actually represent a people. I am quite  sensitive to these things because I fought dictatorship in  Portugal. And the Western world -- including England, the  United States, and France -- used to consider that the  Portuguese and Spanish dictators were acceptable because they  were anticommunist. I believe there is no excuse for such an  attitude if one wants to have a global human rights policy.    [LE FIGARO] After the Gulf war, there were aspirations to a  new world order. Today, the dream has collapsed, has it not?    [Soares] It will re-emerge, it is inevitable. Because  humankind's major problems know no border. Only a global policy  will solve problems such as environment degradation or  starvation. This is why we are necessarily headed for a global  legal order, headed by a reformed United Nations organization.  Living in a world where two-thirds of the population are  starving is an untenable proposition.    [LE FIGARO] You know Africa well. Is it a lost continent?    [Soares] No. Africa is a continent that has gone adrift,  but it is not lost. We have no overall policy with respect to  this continent.    [LE FIGARO] Which is Africa's key country?    [Soares] As far as Sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, this is  undoubtedly South Africa. If peaceful elections can be held  there, then I think settlements can be found for peripheral  conflicts -- in Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, etc.    [LE FIGARO] Do you think Mandela is the right man for the  job?    [Soares] He has learned a great deal. He is a really wise  man.    [LE FIGARO] Your trust in him is total?    [Soares] Yes I trust him. He is a moderate. He knows what  the issues are, and he wants a peaceful way out for his country.  He is prepared to make a number of vital concessions to avoid  causing a panic among the population.    [LE FIGARO] All told, you are much more optimistic than most  Western leaders....    [Soares] I am optimistic inasmuch as I think we are going to  rediscover a number of essential values. We shall finally  realize that humankind's evolution does not solely hinge on  interest rates and growth rates, but also on political and  social values. That humankind must mobilize for ideas, not only  for interests. And that notions of equality, fraternity,  democracy, and human rights are the only ones likely to free  humankind. We are still in a transitional phase. The end of  totalitarian regimes constitutes a considerable improvement.  This is important. If we feel the world has been going all  wrong lately, it is also because of the hopes for an everlasting  peace created by the collapse of communism.</p>

As the evening lights were lit  on New Year's Day, Deng Xiaoping, sitting in a car, inspected  two of Shanghai's busy commercial streets, which had taken on a  new look after thorough renovation. His car slowly drove past  Nanjing road and Huaihai road, which were shining brilliantly  with neon lights, to stop at the five-star New Jinjiang Hotel,  from the top floors of which one can overlook the entire city.    According to a source who was at the site, at about 1900 on  New Year's Day, accompanied by his family, Deng -- healthy and  spry -- walked steadily into the spacious lobby of the New  Jinjiang Hotel. Foreign guests staying at the hotel and people  seeking diversions were strolling or chatting leisurely in the  lobby, which was permeated with a warm and auspicious  atmosphere. People congratulated themselves on their good luck  to see personally the elegant demeanor of the chief architect of  China's reform and openness.    As always, Deng Xiaoping came to Shanghai when winter began,  and stayed at a hotel where he used to live every time he was in  the municipality. Compared with previous years, he came earlier  this year. It has been reported that, accompanied by his  beloved daughter Mao Mao, Deng Xiaoping inspected the  magnificent Yangpu Bridge on 13 December 1993. According to a  reliable source, it was drizzling that day as his car drove to  the cable-stayed bridge that stretches over the river, with the  roaring winds audible inside the car. Even given these weather  conditions, Deng Xiaoping, at his advanced age of 90, got out of  the car in high spirits and, braving the wind and rain, walked  steadily for more than 20 meters on the broad surface of the  bridge, halting now and then to view the landscape on both  shores of the Huangpu Jiang.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK bus group buys into New Zealand STAGECOACH, the UK's largest private bus company, has won approval from Wellington City Council in New Zealand to buy its bus, tram and funicular railway services for NZDollars 8m (Pounds 2.56m). The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this month and will add about 270 vehicles to Stagecoach's 3,000-strong worldwide fleet. The Wellington operations employ about 450 people, mainly on the city's 'Big Red' bus services. Stagecoach, based in Perth, Scotland, operates six regional bus companies in the UK. But about 20 per cent of turnover is overseas, from locations as varied as Kenya, Malawi, Canada and China. A company spokesman said Stagecoach had been interested in New Zealand since the country passed legislation similar to the UK in 1989 to privatise bus services. 'They drive on the left, which also helps,' he said. Staffing levels are now similar to those among privatised UK bus operators and the spokesman said cost savings from efficiencies would be small. Although the company is interested in further New Zealand acquisitions, other large councils such as Christchurch and Auckland have yet to announce plans to open up services to the private sector. Stagecoach has also looked at Czechoslovakia and is trying to break into Hong Kong, which recently announced plans to increase competition for the colony's bus services. The company lost out in the first new franchise to be offered earlier this year. Stagecoach already has a small joint venture in Hong Kong which repaints second-hand buses with advertisements for Japanese and South Korean companies. The buses are then given to China for free, while Stagecoach is paid by the advertisers.</p>

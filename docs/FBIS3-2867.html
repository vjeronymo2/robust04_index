			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of  the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today  delivered a report entitled "Several Questions Regarding Hong  Kong" at a report-back meeting jointly held by the CPC Central  Committee's Propaganda Department, the CPC Central Committee's  Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's  Work Committee for Government Organs, the People's Liberation  Army's [PLA] General Political Department, and the Beijing  Municipal CPC Committee.    In his report, Lu Ping first discussed the origin and  evolution of the differences between China and Britain on the  Hong Kong question. He noted: The fundamental cause of the  current differences between China and Britain on Hong Kong's  political structure is that the British Government has changed  its policies toward Hong Kong in recent years and has assumed an  uncooperative and confrontational attitude in an attempt to  maintain the greatest possible influence in Hong Kong after  1997. Lu Ping said: From the outset of Sino-British talks on  Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements held from April  through November of 1993, the British side showed a lack of  sincerity and refused to hold talks on the basis of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence  with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understandings  reached by China and Britain, all three of which had been agreed  upon by China and Britain. It stubbornly adhered to Chris  Patten's "constitutional reform package" containing "three  violations." Just as the first phase of the agreement was about  to be reached, the British side raised new issues and partially  submitted the draft legislative bill to Hong Kong's Legislative  Council [Legco] for discussion, without regard to the Chinese  side's repeated dissuasions and warnings, thereby terminating  the talks. Hong Kong's Legco, under the manipulation of the  British side, recently adopted the partial legislative bill,  thus completely closing the door on talks. The British side,  without prior consultation, also unilaterally issued a white  paper called "Representative Government in Hong Kong," in which  it divulged the contents of the talks and distorted and attacked  the Chinese side's position. For this reason, our Foreign  Ministry spokesman, citing a host of facts, explained that the  responsibility for the disruption of the talks rested entirely  with the British side.    Lu Ping also discussed the construction of Hong Kong's new  airport. He noted: The Chinese Government has always supported  the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong. The British  side, however, introduced a financing scheme, which leaves  behind a heavy burden for the future Special Administrative  Region [SAR], in violation of the relevant provisions in the  "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Chinese and British  Governments on the Construction of A New Airport in Hong Kong  and Relevant Questions." The Chinese side, driven by a desire to  protect the interests of its compatriots in Hong Kong and those  of the SAR Government, waged a struggle, through arguments and  reasoning, against the British side. Our government is now  holding consultations with the British side on the latter's  fourth financing scheme and is working to settle the financial  arrangements for the new airport on the basis of the memorandum,  with a view to prodding the British side to complete as much of  the new airport as possible before 1997 in accordance with the  provisions in the memorandum.    Lu Ping related various preparations made by the Chinese  Government to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  in the absence of cooperation from the British side following  the disruption of the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's  political structure. Lu Ping said on a firm note: The Chinese  Government is confident and capable of ensuring Hong Kong's  smooth transition in 1997 and its long-term prosperity and  stability.    Li Dengzhu, deputy secretary of the CPC Central Committee's  Work Committee for Party Organs, chaired the meeting. More than  1,000 people from the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for  Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for  Government Organs, PLA troops stationed in Beijing, and  departments under the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, heard  the report.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE VOIDS CIVIL SUIT AGAINST DEPUTIES ACCUSED IN KILLING  </P> <P> A federal judge said Monday that she will dismiss a $10-million lawsuit that  accused three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of killing a Van Nuys woman  after an evening of drinking.  </P> <P> However, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said a wrongful death claim  also contained in the lawsuit may be refiled against the deputies in Los  Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> Pfaelzer said that because the deputies had not acted in their official  capacity as law enforcement officers while with Catherine Braley, the deputies'  request to dismiss a civil rights claim filed by Braley's mother, Mary Postma  of Van Nuys, would be granted.  </P> <P> Braley's beaten and strangled body was found the morning of Jan. 15, 1988, in a  parking lot in the 8100 block of Sepulveda Boulevard.  </P> <P> The evening before, Braley, 26, had been drinking for several hours in a nearby  bar called The Hunter and had left at the same time as Robert Mallon, Robert  Waters and Mike Turner, who were among several off-duty deputies at the bar  after the funeral of another deputy.  </P> <P> All three deputies denied involvement in Braley's death, and Los Angeles  police, who are investigating the unsolved killing, have said no deputy is a  suspect in the case.  </P> <P> Waters and Turner said in court depositions that they went their separate ways  after leaving the bar. Mallon said in a deposition that he and Braley left in  his unmarked county car and drove to a nearby spot where they had consensual  sex in the car. He said Braley then got out of the car and drunkenly walked  away. The spot where they had stopped is about one block from where she was  found dead the next morning.  </P> <P> In her lawsuit, which was filed two months after the murder, Mary Postma  accused the deputies of using their authority as law officers to force Braley  to leave the bar with them. The suit alleges that Braley was killed when she  refused to have sex with them.  </P> <P> To keep the case under federal court jurisdiction, Postma needed to present  evidence that the deputies had acted "under color of law" thereby depriving  Braley of her civil rights.  </P> <P> In Monday's hearing in U.S. District Court, Postma's attorney, Marion R.  Yagman, argued that the deputies had identified themselves in the bar as law  officers and that Mallon had taken Braley in his county-owned undercover car.  </P> <P> "Braley went with the defendants after she was told they were all police  officers," Yagman said. "Police officers never really cease to be police  officers."  </P> <P> Braley, who was intoxicated, "thought it was safe," Yagman said.  </P> <P> But Pfaelzer, without addressing whether the deputies were responsible for  Braley's death, said the lawsuit's allegations did not contain evidence that  the off-duty deputies attempted to exercise their law enforcement authority.  </P> <P> However, Pfaelzer said she would refer the wrongful death claim contained in  the lawsuit to Superior Court, indicating that she believed that it was an  issue a jury should decide.  </P> <P> An identical $10-million lawsuit filed against the deputies by Braley's father,  Edward Postma of Iowa, is pending in federal court.  </P> <P> Pfaelzer said she will conduct a hearing Monday on whether Edward Postma's  lawsuit, which was filed against the deputies a month after Mary Postma's case  was filed, will proceed. Under federal statutes, a lawsuit filed by a resident  of one state against a citizen of another is routinely heard in federal court.  Mary and Edward Postma are divorced.  </P> <P> After the hearing, the deputies' attorney, Anthony P. Serritella, said he  believed that the deputies will ultimately be successful in defending  themselves in either federal or Superior Court.  </P> <P> "I think we will prevail," he said. "There is a complete absence of evidence.  They have asked the court to build inference on inference on inference."  </P></p>

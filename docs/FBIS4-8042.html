			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, Federal Republic of </F> Yugoslavia minister of foreign affairs, by Bucharest Radio  correspondent Dana Popescu in Belgrade on 8 April -- recorded,  in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed Romanian translation]    [Text] [Popescu] Let us talk about the efforts made to  settle the Yugoslav crisis. Russian Foreign Affairs Minister  Andrey Kozyrev stated a few weeks ago that there exist  privileged relations, such as the one between the Germans and  the Croats, the Americans and the Muslims, and the Russians and  the Serbs. Do you think Kozyrev is right, and if so, in which  way do such relations influence the peace negotiations?    [Jovanovic] That is a simplified assessment of the facts,  because there are no such things as privileged relations, but  rather merely interests. Privileged relations exist only in the  sense that relations are based on common interests. In our  case, we believe that as a consequence of the outbreak of the  Yugoslav crisis, the interests of foreign powers suddenly  increased in the Balkans. Above all, this is most displayed by  Germany, which unfortunately bears the greatest part of the  responsibility for the tragedy that is happening to us. Besides  that, one can now also witness the massive penetration of the  United States and Turkey. Russia is a country that is  traditionally interested in the Balkans and it will always  maintain that interest, because the Balkan region is close to  their political and geographic consciousness and important for  their own security. As far as we, as a country and a people,  are concerned, we are the major victims of the Yugoslav crisis,  because from the very beginning we have done everything possible  to maintain the former Yugoslavia and to prevent secession as an  action directed against people who decided to stay in  Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, we did not succeed and that is why  difficulties emerged that are now unfolding before our very  eyes, especially in Bosnia or Krajina.    As far as privileged relations are concerned, above all we  are believers in the idea that the international community  should adopt a fully unbiased, objective, and non-selective  stance with respect to the Yugoslav crisis. That would be the  best way of taking into consideration the equal rights of all  the parties in the Yugoslav crisis and respecting the legitimate  interests and rights of all the peoples who once made up  Yugoslavia. We do not expect anyone to be on our side and  against others. What we ask for and expect from all countries  is that they be on the side of justice, facts, and the truth,  and that, by adopting an unbiased stance, they contribute to  finding, through the parties involved in the Yugoslav crisis,  the proper path leading to rapid settlement [of the conflict].    [Popescu] The normalization of relations between the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia is, in the opinion of many  people, the key issue of the crisis. That process has already  begun with the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and  Zagreb. How do you assess the future evolution of that process?    [Jovanovic] Our problems with Croatia began when Croatia  seceded from Yugoslavia; Croatia's problems began as a  consequence of its unilateral secession by means of force. What  we have to do now is find ways to regulate relations between the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the loyal part of Yugoslavia,  and the other secessionist republics that are now independent  states. We made the first step in that direction and we are  interested in achieving full normalization. This can be  achieved parallel to successful steps taken to eliminate the  negative effects of their secession. First of all I mean  Krajina, which now is under the protection of the UN forces, and  the political status of which will eventually have to be  established by direct negotiations between Knin and Zagreb.    Normalization is also related to the great problem of  sanctions, because it is in the nature of sanctions that they  prevent other countries from establishing political relations  and achieving political objectives because of the sanctions.  The establishment of diplomatic relations with Croatia, which  also presupposes the establishment of normal economic relations,  is theoretically and practically impossible as long as the  sanctions stay in force. Therefore the sanctions, respectively  the decision of the UN Security Council, actually represent an  enormous obstacle for the normalization of relations in the  Yugoslav region.    [Popescu] The sanctions were adopted in view of the  situation in Bosnia. Yugoslavia has complied with the  preconditions established for their lifting. Have any new  preconditions been imposed lately?    [Jovanovic] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was merely  formally the cause of the sanctions. Actually, the principal  goal is a political one, as they are intended to make the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia capitulate. This means that it  is denied the right to dominion over its own country and that it  is expected to accept the mercy of foreign power centers. Apart  from all this, we are making our own policy, which is directed  at achieving peace and the peaceful solution of existing  problems. We have complied with all preconditions, that is, the  ones stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 757. However,  meanwhile the situation in Bosnia contradicted their initial  presuppositions on the basis of which they established the  sanctions. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina proved to be a classic  civil war, and this has been officially admitted by everyone,  including the Security Council. Yugoslavia has never had and  does not have a single soldier on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and could not perpetrate any aggression  against that country. Furthermore, the Serbs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina could not possibly act as aggressors against  their own villages or towns. Civil wars are called civil  precisely because they are not wars of aggression. However,  certain countries, certain centers of power are trying to  complicate and further prolong that crisis and are inventing new  preconditions. This proves how little some desire the  reestablishment of peace and how much they hope to exploit the  situation in Yugoslavia in order to more deeply infiltrate with  their interests in this area and achieve their geostrategic  goals. There are no grounds, neither official nor political, to  link the sanctions to any other issue except the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any attempt to do otherwise would sabotage  the peace efforts to halt the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Popescu] Still, in the last few days Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic declared he was very optimistic. Would you  comment on that?    [Jovanovic] Despite all the complications and hardships we  are all experiencing as a consequence of the crisis in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, we have to be optimistic. First because there is  no such thing as a crisis or a problem that cannot be solved.  And second, because the current situation is more favorable to  achieving peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina than, let us say, the  situation six months or a year ago. The number of countries and  international entities involved in the solution of the crisis in  Bosnia- Herzegovina -- and that are interested in the  reestablishment of peace, stability, and prosperity in this part  of Europe -- has increased significantly, whereas the number of  countries interested in sabotaging peace is decreasing. The  latter are now making their interests known and finding it  increasingly difficult to achieve their goals. This is why they  are now resorting to camouflaged means, presenting themselves as  protectors of rights not related in any way to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  all three of them, are fed up with war, they do not want war  anymore. War is Now only desired by the fundamentalist  leadership of the Muslim people, and that is in contradiction of  the will and interests of their own Muslim people. They want  this war because they are not free to make their own decisions  and depend directly on the financial and political support they  receive from abroad.</p>

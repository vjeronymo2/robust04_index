			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CSSM FIRES TROUBLED CONTRACTOR; DELAY IN OPENING CAMPUS LIKELY  </P> <P> Louetto Construction has been fired from its work on the Cal State San Marcos  campus, a company official said Wednesday, just one day after the city of  Escondido took the firm off a park project for failure to pay subcontractors  and material suppliers.  </P> <P> "We expect to receive termination on the Cal State San Marcos project  tomorrow," said John Tiersma, project manager for Louetto, Wednesday.  </P> <P> Louetto's termination increases the chances that the opening of the campus will  be delayed. University officials had previously said that, if work did not  resume by the end of October the new campus, scheduled to be open by August,  1992, might open a semester late. And, according to workers on the campus  project, it will take two more weeks to resume work, on top of the time it  takes to hire a new contractor,  </P> <P> Work on the first phase of Cal State San Marcos site, a $9 million project, is  scheduled to be completed by Sept. 12, 1991. University officials worry that a  delay in the first phase will in turn slow following work. Construction on the  first phase stopped in September after Louetto missed two payments totaling  $1.3 million to the grading subcontractor, C.W. Poss.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the city of Escondido fired Louetto from the $1.4 million Mountain  View Park project. Fifteen subcontractors and suppliers on the project filed  "stop-notices," indicating that Louetto had not paid them, said Dale Mathre,  the city's park and open space superintendent.  </P> <P> The Escondido and Cal State San Marcos projects represent the second and third  times in less than a month that the Escondido-based construction company has  been fired by a public agency in North County.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the North County Transit District ordered Louetto off a  $6.7-million renovation of the Oceanside bus maintenance yard for purportedly  improper installation of underground fuel tanks.  </P> <P> Robin Hartnett, project manager for C.W. Poss, confirmed that Louetto has been  taken off the San Marcos project. Louetto's bonding company, Reliance Surety,  has informed C.W. Poss that it will not be working with Louetto on the project,  Hartnett said.  </P> <P> "They have basically told us that they are not going to have Louetto finish the  project," she said Wednesday. "We've been told that (Reliance is) talking to  other contractors this week."  </P> <P> Hartnett said that, once a new contractor is found, it will take at least two  weeks to resume work.  </P> <P> "We've already taken all our equipment off the site and left the project,"  Hartnett said.  </P> <P> University officials and spokesmen for the bonding company could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> Escondido officials had given Louetto until last Friday to come up with a plan  to pay subcontractors and suppliers the $270,000 that was owed on a park  project, said Mathre, the city's park superintendent.  </P> <P> "We had given them a deadline of Friday to provide a plan to clear the stop  notices, and we did not receive a response and therefore proceeded with  cancellation," Mathre said.  </P> <P> The park, which began in January and originally was to be constructed by the  end of July, is about 95% complete, Mathre said, and the city has asked the  subcontractors to complete the project without Louetto.  </P> <P> Louetto is now negotiating with the California State University system to  continue work on the site of Cal State San Marcos. Grading of the site came to  a halt earlier this month because a subcontractor claims Louetto owes it $1.4  million for work done on the project.  </P> <P> The 11-acre Mountain View Park in Escondido, at the corner of Glenn Ridge Road  and Citrus Avenue, would be the fifth community park in the city and have two  ball fields, tennis courts, a playground and open turf areas, Mathre said.  </P> <P> "We're authorizing the subcontractors that were already on the job to complete  the work," Mathre said.  </P> <P> The most important of the unfinished tasks at the park is the seeding of the  ball fields, Mathre said.  </P> <P> "This is a park that we're wanting to use in the spring for the Little League  program, and if we want turf in the spring, we need to get seeds on the ground  as quickly as possible," said Mathre, who hopes the project will be completed  within a few weeks.  </P> <P> Tiersma, Louetto's project manager, acknowledged that the firm has missed  payments to the subcontractors on the project.  </P> <P> "We've been around for 38 years, and the past few years have just been tough,"  Tiersma said. "It's partly due to the economy, and who knows what else."  </P> <P> Anthony Fox, co-owner of Acme Iron Works, was one of the subcontractors that  filed a stop-notice against Louetto. Fox said he recently reached a settlement  with Louetto on payment for two other jobs and work on Mountain View Park.  </P> <P> "I've been doing business with this guy for 33 years, and it's only recently  that he's gotten into trouble," Fox said. "(Louetto's) reputation now is worse  than a used-car salesman's."  </P> <P> Ray Brody, president of Creative Lighting in San Diego, is still owed $10,000  by Louetto for work on the Escondido project, and he is skeptical that Louetto  will be able to recover from its financial problems.  </P> <P> "He has debts everywhere right now," Brody said of Lou Pauletto, owner of  Louetto Construction. "I don't think that anybody at this point that has any  sense wants to walk into that fire."  </P></p>

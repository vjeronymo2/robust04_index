			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Ethnic carve-up a backward step, insists Izetbegovic HOPES are receding that the dream of a tolerant, multi-ethnic Bosnia can be maintained in the face of intensified fighting and the apparent willingness of the international community to countenance the ethnic carve-up of the country at the Geneva peace talks. Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday publicly acknowledged the defeat of a multi-ethnic Bosnia, and reluctantly admitted that a tripartite division of Bosnia is inevitable, 'because it will give Moslems a Bosnian state. For the moment the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia is dead. Future generations can hope for such a state. But only after they have sobered up from their state of drunkeness,' he told Radio Sarajevo. 'While other countries are moving towards multi-ethnicity we have taken a step backwards.' Events this week have highlighted the fears of Bosnian Moslems, Croats and Serbs that what remains of the multi-ethnic fabric of the country is fast disappearing. The current Moslem offensive on Croat-held towns in central Bosnia has followed an earlier land grab by Serb forces, and Croat troops to tighten their stranglehold over what remains of Bosnia. The fighting prompted Croat members of the Bosnian presidency, whose true allegiances may be with Croat nationalists, to withdraw from the ten-member body in protest against the attacks by Moslem forces on Croat troops and civilians. Mr Miro Lasic, a Croat member of the presidency, said that 'even in Sarajevo, Croats literally disappear from the streets. Serbs, too, as well as urban Moslems.' Mr Miro Lazovic, a Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, warns that in the event of tbe republic's partition over one million people will cross ethnic lines, fearing for their fate after 16 months of war. Mr Lazovic, a member of Bosnia's wartime presidency which includes representatives of the republic's three main ethnic groups, is struggling to preserve a state which has been mostly anihilated by Serb and Croat territorial ambitions. Serb leaders of the self-styled Srpska Republika have already created their ethnic state, by killing or expelling hundreds of thousands of Moslems from about 70 per cent of Bosnia. Croat nationalists have also hammered out the borders of their own mini-state, which over the last week has shrunk during the Moslem offensive. The ethnic division of Bosnia will effectively punish non-nationalist Serbs and Croats, who will be left without a country. They are now wondering what will happen to their families. Mr Nijaz Durakovic, a Moslem opposition deputy who is married to a Serb, says: 'The international community's goal was to stop the war, not to divide up Bosnia.'</p>

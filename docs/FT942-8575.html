			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Europe threatens clash with US over aircraft subsidies European aerospace manufacturers are threatening to call on the European Union to tear up its two-year-old agreement with the US on civil aircraft subsidies unless Washington accepts tighter curbs on support to the US industry. The threat follows extensive consultation between the European industry and the European Commission ahead of today's resumed negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on international rules covering aircraft subsidies. If the EU renounced the bilateral agreement, it could trigger a serious transatlantic trade dispute. US manufacturers say they would respond by renewing complaints in the Gatt that government support to the four-nation European Airbus programme is illegal. In that event, European manufacturers say they would consider invoking Gatt dispute procedures and pressing for action against US aircraft sales under hitherto unused EU rules designed to punish subsidised foreign exports. The EU-US agreement can be abrogated by either side at one year's notice. If the EU renounced it, the grace period could allow further attempts to negotiate a settlement. The European manufacturers' threat reflects growing frustration with the workings of the bilateral accord and what they consider US refusal to negotiate seriously on a wider and more comprehensive Gatt agreement. The main stumbling block is Washington's reluctance to accept tighter curbs on 'indirect' support for purposes such as research and development. The European manufacturers - Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Dasa of Germany - claim the US has not fulfilled obligations to limit such support under the bilateral agreement. They say Washington is balking at a Gatt agreement because that could limit extensive US government support for aero-engine manufacturers and call into question large commercial aircraft research programmes funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Gatt talks were adjourned in December after the US rejected a draft agreement acceptable to the 21 other governments. Gap widens in aircraft subsidy talks, Page 5</p>

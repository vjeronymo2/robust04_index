			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CINCINNATI PANEL GETS VERBAL LOOK AT PHOTOS;  </P> <P> OBSCENITY: DEFENSE ATTORNEY GAUGES THE REACTION OF POTENTIAL JURORS TO  MAPPLETHORPE'S WORK.  </P> <P> A defense attorney described Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photos in  detail to gauge the reactions of prospective jurors at the nation's first  obscenity trial of an art gallery and its director.  </P> <P> The Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie are charged with  obscenity and displaying nude photos of children at a Mapplethorpe exhibit.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers today rejected a prospective juror as jury selection moved into  the third day. Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, used a peremptory challenge  to remove a retiree, who he said was not adequately familiar with the  community's contemporary social standards.  </P> <P> Eight jurors and two alternates are being sought.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, prosecutors used one of their peremptory challenges to dismiss a  prospective juror who viewed the Mapplethorpe photo exhibit.  </P> <P> Seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit are the basis for the criminal  charges. One photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Others show  anal penetration with objects and other homosexual or sadomasochistic images.  </P> <P> After describing the seven photographs in detail, lawyer H. Louis Sirkin asked  several prospective jurors, "Are you willing to see those photographs before  making a decision as to whether any of them is obscene?"  </P> <P> All answered that they were willing.  </P> <P> Sirkin said later that he didn't describe the photographs for shock value,  although he was interested in seeing the potential jurors' reaction.  </P> <P> He did not say what he believed the reactions were.  </P> <P> "The jury is entitled to know what the photographs show," Sirkin said. "If  they're going to see them, they have a right to know what's in them."  </P></p>

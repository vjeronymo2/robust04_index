			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Banker whose wink is as good as his nod CENTRAL bankers are supposed to indicate their thoughts by barely perceptible movements of their eyebrows. With Mr Andrew Crockett - appointed yesterday as the new general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, it is the eyelids that are important. Mr Crockett, international director at the Bank of England, has the appearance of a self-effacing though well-dressed don. And he likes to give a sly wink when communicating economic policy asides to people who are outside the generally closed circle of international monetary officials. Mr Crockett, 50, takes over at the Basle-based bank at the beginning of next year at a time when the future of the 63-year-old bank is clouded, partly by a number of impending changes at the top of the organisation, and by to what degree the BIS will shed its somewhat introverted image to take on a bigger role in influencing international economic policy. Mr Crockett will also have to carve out a relationship with the new European Monetary Institute, due to be set up next year in Frankfurt as a precursor to the proposed EC central bank, where his predecessor, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, will be the new head. Born in Glasgow, Mr Crockett joined the Bank of England in 1966 after studying economics at Cambridge and Yale. He did a 17-year stint with the International Monetary Fund before returning to the Bank in 1989 as international director - one of the top four positions in Threadneedle Street after governor and deputy governor. He is the first Briton to head an important international monetary organisation. At the IMF, Mr Crockett's most important job was preparing the Fund's twice-yearly world economic outlook. Here he built up a reputation for careful analysis. Mr Flemming Larsen, the Fund's assistant research director, says of Mr Crockett: 'He has an amazing ability to convince people of points he wants to convey even when they are controversial.' This skill should come in useful when Mr Crockett takes over the job of writing the BIS's highly regarded annual review of the world economy which next comes out in June. In the debate about how Europe will move forward in monetary integration after the currency crises of the past 18 months, Mr Crockett has suggested that different countries could try to build economic convergence by keeping inflation within targets which are set domestically but are broadly compatible. Mr Crockett takes over the chairmanship in Paris today of working party three, a secretive group of central bank and treasury officials which meets under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As for the future style of the BIS under Mr Crockett, much depends on who is chosen to replace the three top officials - assistant general manager, Mr Remi Gros, head of administration, Mr Giampietro Morelli, and chief economist, Mr Horst Bockelmann - who are due to retire over the next two years. According to one view, Mr Crockett is likely to start by beefing up the economics department which, some observers feel, could build on its good international reputation by specialising more on specific issues such as banking behaviour and currency flows.</p>

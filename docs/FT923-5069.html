			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Els Joglars - Edinburgh International Festival a work of theatre that seems wild but proves tightly organised, which is funny and painful at the same time, which operates on three separate planes at once. The company is the Catalan troupe Els Joglars. Its Edinburgh performances are also part of the European Arts Festival. Yo Tengo un Tio en America (I Have an Uncle in America) is deeply humane, bizarre and a triumph of imagination and craftsmanship. The scene is a psychiatric institution. Six therapists give their eight patients drama therapy and have them re-enact the conquest of America by the Spanish. The therapy and the conquest also include the inculcation of flamenco dance. Does this sound strange? What makes it stranger is that everything is presented from the point of view of the patients. They are a pathetic bunch, and Yo Tengo makes no attempt to give them dignity or beauty. But each is a vivid individual, strongly characterised from from the first. The plain, ugly individuality of the patients (or native Americans) is contrasted with the glamorous conformism of the therapists (or conquistadors). Espasa, with his encyclopaedic mind; Paqui, a nymphomaniac obsessed with pregnancy and giving birth; Manolo the visionary; Conde the pyromaniac; the autistic Jordi, who communicates only through music. They make a pretty daft kind of New World, but they lose themselves in it so entirely that we do too - and when the therapists suddenly order them to snap out of it or back into it, they and we are stunned. The therapists participate in the fantasy, and this heightens the derangment. They dance flamenco - isn't dancing therapeutic? - but flamenco is also a disciplined, Spanish form, which becomes a symbol of invading authoritarianism. One patient comments 'The Spanish are folkloric even when they conquer.' Eventually the patients dance flamenco too - it's a necessary step towards conformism. The patients throw themselves into the fantasy, and each brings his or her own obsessions into visualising Old America. Paqui cries out, of the Spanish, 'They are coming in their ships] They are coming faster than I can give birth]' She becomes the mother of the tribe - the Paqui tribe. Later, deep in the forest, at the end of a long scene when all the patients are immersed, Conde uses his lighter to help them. In marches a therapist in a white coat, and confiscates the lighter. Resignedly, he says, 'Now I know I am mad.' (Speech is in Spanish; there are a few, helpful surtitles.) One could analyse the meanings of Yo Tengo un Tio en America at length - its implications about Catalonia and Spain are unmistakable - but what makes it so exceptional is its detailed inner life. Els Joglars are wonderful, rare performers. They catch all the absurdity of the patients, and never tug at your heartstrings. The ironic result is that we are far more moved by their plight than if they had played for sympathy. This isn't one of those shows that claims to celebrate the human spirit with a load of monotonous over-acting. In Yo Tengo you see the human spirit the way it is - as a living mass of peculiar and interacting details - and you are amused, pained and enthralled. At the Royal Lyceum Theatre until September 5</p>

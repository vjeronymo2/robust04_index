			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, March 25 (CNS) -- According to Sichuan's  Bureau of Religious Affairs, 98 percent of property rightfully  belonging to the religious sector has been returned and hundreds  of unjust, false and erroneous cases involving people within  this sector have been redressed. More than 1,000 religious  leaders in the province have been elected deputies to the  People's Congress or members of the People's Political  Consultative Conference at various levels in the province.    Sichuan has various nationalities and a number of religions,  but for historic reasons there have been many disputes over  property and other things involving the various religions. Now  after more than ten years of implementation of policies  regarding religion, the province has handed back more than one  million sq. metres of property to the religious sector including  many monasteries. Some RMB 9.8 million from removal and  reconstruction of such property as well as rents have also been  paid back.    The province has made redress of 675 unjust, false and  erroneous cases and reinstated more than 1,000 religious  figures, electing them to such bodies as the People's Congress  and the People's Political Consultative Conference at various  levels in the province. Eleven religious leaders were appointed  vice-prefectural or county heads or vice-chairmen of prefecture  or county-level People's Congresses or the PPCC.    The province has now set up 150 religious patriotic bodies  and opened 1,370 religious sites.</p>

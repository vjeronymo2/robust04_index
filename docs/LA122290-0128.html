			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FURNISHINGS;  </P> <P> YULE TREE DECORATOR HAS SEEN THE LIGHT  </P> <P> I actually kept a New Year's resolution this year and I'm sorry I bothered.  </P> <P> The promise was made last December just after I had spent almost two hours  untangling Christmas tree lights from the year before, the ones I had  unceremoniously yanked from the tree and hurled into a box.  </P> <P> "Nevermore, nevermore," quoth I as I removed the tinsel, labored over the knots  and replaced the bulbs broken by careless handling.  </P> <P> So, when Christmas '89 was officially over, I oh-so-gingerly removed the lights  from the tree, picked off tinsel and pine needles, and laid the strings out in  a large, sturdy box.  </P> <P> And it worked. This past weekend, after I had installed my tree, preparing the  lights was a snap. They came out of their place of repose with ease and I lined  them on the floor without a snag -- or a knot, either.  </P> <P> The problem came when I tested them. One whole string of 140 lights was dark.  (Forget that the box says, "If one goes out, the rest remain lit.")  </P> <P> I tested the wire by plugging one end into the wall and the other into another  string of lights I knew worked. The latter jumped to life, proving that  electric current was indeed passing through.  </P> <P> Off to the store for replacement bulbs, then the laborious task of finding the  defective bulb. Starting with light No. 1 (of the 140), I patiently took each  old one out and inserted a new bulb, then removed the new bulb and reinstalled  the old. Light after light it went that way until I reached No. 74 and stopped  to run out for Chinese, carefully marking the spot with a loop in the wire.  </P> <P> After dinner, for no particular reason, I resumed the task at No. 140 and  worked my way back to the tell-tale loop. As luck (my luck, anyway) would have  it, the bad light was No. 75. There was a tiny piece of tinsel in the socket,  which was apparently shorting out the entire string. I would, of course, have  found it immediately after dinner had I simply picked up where I had left off.  </P> <P> But that's OK, I told myself, because had I picked up at No. 75, the bad bulb  would have been No. 140.  </P> <P> No matter, there was light! All 140 bulbs shone brightly and I was sore  pleased.  </P> <P> Up the stepladder and round and round the tree I went, carefully planting each  light for the best effect, some tucked inside close to the trunk, others  dancing lightly on the ends of the limbs.  </P> <P> I plugged them in and suddenly the travails of the day just didn't matter. They  were perfect -- no gaps, symmetrically wonderful.  </P> <P> For about two minutes.  </P> <P> Then the whole top of the tree went dark.  </P> <P> "To hell with this," I said, and dragged the string out to the trash can.  </P> <P> I drove to the closest drugstore, selected a box containing a string of 200 new  lights clearly marked, "If one goes out, the rest remain lit," paid the $14.99,  plus tax, took them home and installed them.  </P> <P> I should have read the entire box. That oversight was noted by my older son  when he appeared much later in the evening. "Hey, tree looks good," he said,  "but I thought you hated blinking lights."  </P> <P> "I do," I said, "but I thought we'd try them this one year."  </P> <P> And that's the truth. When the trash man picks up that tree after Christmas,  it's still going to have those lights on it. Next year too -- and the year  after that.  </P> <P> Where else can you buy peace of mind for $14.99?  </P></p>

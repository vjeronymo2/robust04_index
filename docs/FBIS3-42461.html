			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text] In 1976 Harvard Chemist W.N. Lipscomb had already  predicted  the possibility of the similarity of the structures of a  B[.sup]32[/]H[.sub]32[/] molecule and a multi-atom carbon  molecule with the Formula C[.sup]60[/]. The shape of the  20-sided B[.sup]32[/]H[.sub]32[/] molecule is similar to  the ball-shaped C[.sup]60[/] molecule [the buckyball].    Lipscomb and his colleague L. Massa (New York's Hunter  College) conducted a systematic study of the possible  correspondence between boron compounds and fullerenes--the new  class of carbon molecules that include C[.sup]60[/].    In the boron hydrides, the boron atoms bond to each other to  form a particular shape and the hydrogen atoms radiate from the  cages formed by the boron atoms. Superimposing the two  molecules, the 60 carbon atoms on the boron hydride molecules  match up with the hydride molecule's 60 faces, while each of the  32 boron atoms would fall smack in the middle of the faces  formed by the carbon atoms.    You can calculate the number of matches using the  Descartes-Euler formula, which describes the fit between the two  types of molecules by summing the number of faces and the number  of atoms in the vertices (less two). In closed geometrical  structures, contacts represent the connecting lines between  vertices; in molecules--they represent the shortest distances  between neighboring atoms.    Like fullerenes, hollow boron molecules should have new  useful properties. Lipscomb and Massa suggest chemists try to  make closed boron hydrides using laser beams to vaporize a  calcium boron compound in the presence of hydrogen.

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Objective about BS5750 I have been intrigued by the recent interest in BS5750 in your pages, and I would like to offer the following advice. Those considering BS5750 should be aware of any benefit likely to accrue to their customers. If the customer is not going to perceive any noticeable difference, then don't bother - there will undoubtedly be other more deserving challenges. If you believe the customer is going to benefit, you must decide 'by how much' and fix a means of measurement, to determine what you intend to achieve and so you will know when you have got there. At this point, you can identify a positive impact upon the bottom line - all well and good - and you certainly should think about the cost of developing, implementing and maintaining the system. All too often BS5750 fails or disappoints because 'the business' doesn't approach the task objectively. Remember, BS5750 is not a quality system: you can have one of those without the standard. If you are employing a consultancy 'worth its salt', it will ensure that you understand the standard before taking a fee. It can then help you to decide whether or not it is worth going for.

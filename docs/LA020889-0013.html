			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WITH KITI OUT, VALHALLA NO MATCH FOR MONTE VISTA  </P> <P> Rafid Kiti used to play basketball. Very well. When he sat on the bench, it was  for a brief rest. Or maybe a few minutes at the end of a blowout.  </P> <P> Now he sits in the second row.  </P> <P> Kiti, a 6-foot-5 1/2 guard/forward, was greatly missed Tuesday by his Valhalla  teammates, who were little match for host Monte Vista in a showdown of the  cream of the Grossmont 2-A and 3-A boys' leagues. Monte Vista jumped out  quickly in the first half en route to a 93-73 victory.  </P> <P> And Kiti, dressed in street clothes, sat and watched. He worked on a Tootsie  Pop and wondered: What if?  </P> <P> Last week, while sitting in class, he began having trouble breathing. He went  home. By the time he got there, he could hardly breath at all.  </P> <P> Kiti's older brother, Steve, asked him what was wrong and decided to take Kiti  to the hospital. There, he sat in the emergency room for 4 hours and breathed  with help from an oxygen tank. The doctor diagnosed it as a collapsed lung and  operated. Twenty minutes. The most pain Kiti had ever experienced. He spent  nearly a week in the hospital. And now, in the middle of a senior season in  which he is ranked fifth in the county in scoring, he has to sit and hope he'll  be able to come back for the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it happened," Kiti said.  </P> <P> So what now?  </P> <P> "I sit there watching, thinking (the team) could have done this, they could  have done that."  </P> <P> Tuesday, Valhalla (14-8) could have done a lot more with Kiti's services. No  question about it. And Monte Vista (14-4) took full advantage. As if Kiti's  absence wasn't enough, Valhalla's other senior starter, Jon Scurlock, missed  the game with the flu.  </P> <P> So Monte Vista played a two-three defense, designed to stop Valhalla's Tony  Clark. He still managed to score a team-high 28 points. Clark's performance was  offset by Joe McNaull, Monte Vista's center, who scored a season-high 34  points.  </P> <P> Monte Vista led by 20 at halftime and never again was challenged. With Kiti  earlier this season, Valhalla beat Monte Vista by 12.  </P> <P> So what if Kiti were healthy?  </P> <P> What if nothing, says Valhalla Coach Manny Silva.  </P> <P> "We can't think about Rafid," he said. "We've just got to go out there and  play."  </P> <P> Zach Peck, Monte Vista's coach, realizes things would have been different if  Kiti, who averages 24.3 points a game, were on the court.  </P> <P> "Sure," he said. "If Kiti had been in there it would have been a lot different.  Although some of the other kids are blossoming now that he's gone."  </P> <P> Bren Jacobsen scored 20 for Monte Vista, and Jeff Polinsky added 19. Tony Lee  had 20 for Valhalla, including three three-pointers.  </P></p>

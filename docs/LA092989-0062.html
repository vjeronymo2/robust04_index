			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Newspaper Ownership to Change: The Sacramento Union will change owners on Nov.  30 when its publishing company dissolves and a new firm headed by two local  developers assumes control. A spokesman said 300 employees will be laid off,  and it will be up to the new publisher to decide whether to rehire them. The  paper, which now is owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir of the wealthy  Mellon banking family in Pennsylvania, will continue to be published during the  ownership transfer.  </P></p>

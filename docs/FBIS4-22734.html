			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Zaslavskaya, senior scientific </F> associate, Institute of Legislation and Comparative Legal  Sciences, under the RF [Russian Federation] Government,  candidate of legal sciences, RF honored jurist, under rubric  "Legislation on Mineral Resources": "Survey of Laws on Mineral  Resources of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation"]    [Text] In accordance with the delimitation of the subjects  of jurisdiction and powers between the federal agencies of state  authority of the Russian Federation and the agencies of  authority in the republics that make up the Russian Federation,  legislation on mineral resources is included in the joint  jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the  Russian Federation and the agencies of state authority in the  republics that make up the Russian the Russian Federation.    With regard to these questions the federal agencies of state  authority of the Russian Federation publish the Principles of  Legislation, in conformity with which the agencies of authority  of the republics that make up the Russian Federation carry out  their own legal regulation, including the enacting of laws and  other legal acts.    On 21 February 1992 Russian Federation Law "Mineral  Resources" was signed. In Article 1 of this law it is indicated  that the law is in effect on the entire territory of the Russian  Federation. The legislative and normative acts of the republics  that make up the Russian Federation must not contradict this law.    An analysis was made of seven laws on the mineral resources  of the republics that make up the Russian Federation, one code,  and two decrees: Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources," 12 February  1992; Udmurt Republic Law on Mineral Resources, 13 February  1992; North Ossetian Republic Law, "Use of Mineral Resources in  North Ossetian SSR," 27 October 1992; Republic of Buryatia Law,  "Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral  Resources," 28 October 1992; Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law,  "Mineral Resources," 22 December 1992; Republic of Tatarstan  Law, "Mineral Resources," 18 February 1993; Republic of  Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources, 28 October 1992;  Mordvinian SSR Supreme Council decree, 9 April 1993, "Procedure  for Application of RSFSR Law, Entitled `Mineral Resources,' on  the Territory of Mordvinian SSR"; and decree of the Government  of the Republic of Tuva, 28 January 1993, No. 41, "Measures to  Regulate the Relations in Use of the Mineral Resources of the  Republic of Tuva."    Only two laws were enacted several days prior to the signing  of the "Mineral Resources" Law; the others were enacted later.  Therefore they must not contradict the "Mineral Resources" Law.  At the same time, study has indicated that the republics that  make up the Russian Federation are not taking into consideration  the fact that the territory of the Russian Federation includes  within itself territories of subjects of the Federation and  those republics view themselves as independent sovereign states  that are not subordinate to the Federation's central authority.    Certain republics that make up the Russian Federation, in  laws on mineral resources, do not always mention the Russian  Federation's "Mineral Resources" Law as the basis for  promulgating their own act on mineral resources.    For example, in the Republic of Buryatia Law, "Mineral  Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources"  (Article 1), it is stipulated that the Republic of Buryatia  legislation on mineral resources is based on the corresponding  principles enunciated in the Republic of Buryatia Constitution  and the Federative Treaty, in accordance with which the mineral  resources of Buryatia are the property of the peoples living on  its territory.    In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law (Article 1) it is  stipulated that the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) legislation on  mineral resources is based on the corresponding principles  enunciated in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Constitution and  the Russian Federation (Russian) Constitution. Similar  formulations exist in the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on  Mineral Resources and the laws of certain other republics.    The Republic of Tuva Government has limited in time the  application of the RF Law "Mineral Resources." In a decree dated  28 January 1993, entitled "Measures to Regulate the Relations in  the Use of the Mineral Resources of the Republic of Tuva," it is  indicated that, pending the enactment of the Republic of Tuva  Law, "Mineral Resources," state regulation of the relations in  the use of mineral resources on the territory of the Republic of  Tuva is carried out on the basis of RF Law "Mineral Resources";  the statute governing the granting of licenses for the use of  mineral resources, which was approved by RF Supreme Soviet  decree, dated 15 July 1992, No. 3314-1; and the Statute  governing the rules and conditions for collecting payments for  the right to use the mineral resources, which was approved by RF  Government decree dated 289 October 1992, No. 828.    The Udmurt Republic, in its Law "Mineral Resources" (Article  4), has stated that the Russian Federation's legislation on  mineral resources is in effect on the territory of the Udmurt  Republic so far as it does not contradict the Udmurt Republic  Law on mineral resources. According to Article 7 of that law,  questions that have not been included in the competency of the  Udmurt Republic and the local soviets of people's deputies are  under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation with regard to  the regulation of mining relations.    Despite the fact that Russian Federation Law "Mineral  Resources" failed to mention the question of the ownership of  the mineral resources, and also failed to divide the state's  mineral resources fund into any component parts, the republics  that make up the Russian Federation have expressed their own  point of view with regard to these questions.    In Komi SSR (Article 2) the mineral resources on the  territory of Komi SSR are considered to be the republic property  of Komi SSR; and in Udmurt Republic (Article) the mineral  resources are the state property of the Udmurt Republic, and the  use of the republic's mineral resources can be carried out for  the benefit of the peoples living on its territory.    In North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), Republic of Buryatia  (Article 2), Republic of Bashkortostan (Article 2), Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) (Article 2), and Republic of Karelia (Article  2), stipulation is made for republic mineral resources funds.    In accordance with Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree,  dated 27 December 1991, entitled "Delimitation of State Property  in the Russian Federation Into Federal Property, State Property  of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation, Krays,  Oblasts, Autonomous Oblast Autonomous Okrugs, the Cities of  Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Municipal Property," the  resources of the continental shelf pertain exclusively to  federal property. Despite this fact, the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia), in Law "Mineral Resources," stated that the republic  fund is made up of the parts of the mineral resources that are  being used and that are not being used, as well as the  continental shelf of the territory of the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia). The disposition of the republic mineral resources  fund in the interests of the peoples in the Republic is carried  out by the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).    In Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 2) it  is stipulated that the disposition of the state mineral  resources fund is carried out in the interests of the peoples  living on the corresponding territories, and all the peoples of  the Russian Federation. Meanwhile the Udmurt Republic (Article  2) and North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia) (Article 2), and the Republic of Karelia (Article 2)  stipulated the disposition of the republic mineral resources  fund only for the benefit of the peoples residing on the  territory.    In a number of acts the competency of the Russian Federation  in the sphere of regulating the relations in the use of mineral  resources is not mentioned at all, or is defined in abbreviated  form. According to the Law of the North Ossetian SSR (Article  2), sectors can be allocated from the republic mineral resources  fund for the purpose of guaranteeing state security and the  protection of the environment. The borders of those sectors and  the procedure for using the mineral resources on them are  established by the enacting of joint decisions by the agencies  of authority of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian  SSR.    This proviso does not guarantee the subject of the  jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the  Russian Federation, which already include the federal energy  systems, nuclear power engineering, splitting materials, federal  transportation, railroads, and activities in space.    All of these areas require mineral resources.    According to the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral  Resources (Article 1), individual powers with regard to  promulgating acts of legislation concerning the mineral  resources of the Republic of Bashkortostan can be transferred to  the Russian Federation in accordance with the Treaty on the  principles of international relations between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Bashkortostan. Legislative acts  of the Russian Federation concerning mineral resources with  regard to questions transferred by the Republic of Bashkortostan  to the Russian Federation are mandatory on the territory of the  Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Article 3 of this Code it is  stated that the Republic of Bashkortostan can transfer  individual powers with regard to regulating the use of mineral  resources both to the Russian Federation, and to the republic's  rayons and cities.    Thus, the interrelations between the agencies for  administering the Republic of Bashkortostan state mineral  resources fund and the agency for administering the Russian  Federation state mineral resources fund in questions of the  functioning of the Russia-wide methodological and normative base  for the use of mineral resources and the single base for  geological information about mineral resources, as well as in  other questions of use of mineral resources, are defined by  bilateral agreements between them.    According to Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 5,  paragraph 2), the interests of the Russian Federation in the  area of the efficient placement and use of the mineral  fuel-and-energy base are reinforced by treaty and other  agreements with the Russian Federation. The Republic of Karelia,  in its Law "Mineral Resources," states in detail the competency  of the Russian Federation in the sphere of regulating the use of  mineral resources.    In our opinion, it would be desirable to prepare, instead of  the Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources," Principles of  the Russian Federation Legislation on Mineral Resources, to  define the owner of the mineral resources, to give a more  clear-cut formulation of the concept of the mineral resources  fund, and, to the extent possible, to reduce the competency of  the Russian Federation in the sphere of the relations for  regulating the use of mineral resources. Then there will be the  possibility of enacting laws on the mineral resources of the  republics that make up the Russian Federation in a new wording.    The Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" provides a definition  of  the concept of mineral resources. It is the surface of the land  and the space under it, excluding the agricultural stratum, with  rocks, minerals, and containers. This definition omits the  bottom of bodies of water, which is not the surface of the  earth, and also the lower limit of the mineral resources to  depths that are accessible for geological study and assimilation.    The Udmurt Republic also provides a definition of the  concept  of mineral resources. According to Article 1 of Law "Mineral  Resources," the mineral resources of Udmurt Republic include  that part of the natural environment within the confines of the  republic's territory that lies below the soil stratum and the  bottom of bodies of water to depths that are accessible for  assimilation. This definition omits depths that are accessible  for study.    The Republic of Udmurtia provides a definition of the fund,  calling it not a mineral resources fund, but the Udmurt Republic  state mining fund. According to Article 1 of its law, the  mineral formations contained in the mineral resources, as well  as other objects there that represent interest for study and  industrial assimilation, constitute the state mining fund of the  Udmurt Republic.    It is not completely clear what is meant by objects  representing interest for study and industrial assimilation. One  wonders whether these objects include a subway or an underground  airfield.    According to Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources"  (Article 1), the mineral resources of the Republic of Tatarstan  constitute that part of its natural environment that is situated  under the soil and vegetation stratum, and under the bottom of  lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, with the minerals contained in  them, from their outcroppings to the daylight surface to depths  that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. In  our opinion, the definition of the concept of mineral resources  is most precise in the Republic of Tatarstan law.    The same Tatarstan law contains Article 3, concerning mining  relations. According to that article: 1) relations arising  during the possession, disposition, and use of the mineral  resources constitute mining relations; 2) the owner of the  mineral resources, and the user of the mineral resources, are  the subjects of mining relations; 3) the agencies of state  authority and state administration of the Republic of Tatarstan,  as well as the local administration, cannot be the user of the  mineral resources; 4) the sector of the mineral resources  (mining claim) that was granted to the user in the procedure  established by this law is the object of the mining relations;  5) the license and the mining-claim document which are issued in  conformity with this law are acts that result in the arising of  mining relations; 6) the license is a document that certifies  the right to use the mineral resources within the confines of  granted sector within a period of time established by the  license, with the observance of the terms stipulated by it; 7)  the mining-claim document is a document that grants the user of  the mineral resources the right to carry out his activities  within the confines of the mining claim in conformity with the  purposes indicated in the license; 8) state administration of  the use of mineral resources is carried out by the Government of  Tatarstan or through agencies empowered for that purpose.    The overwhelming content of the article is nonnormative. It  consists of definitions of concepts (of mining relations; of  subjects and objects of mining relations;of acts that result in  mining relations; of the license; and of the mining-claim  document). In several laws this is usually stated at the  beginning of the law, under the title "Terms Used in the Law."    As for the substantive content of the article, in our view  the concept of mining relations does not encompass the  protection of the mineral resources. This is an independent  element of mining relations, and it must be pointed out.    Something that is not completely precise is the absolute ban  preventing agencies of the state authority and state  administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as the  local administration, from using the mineral resources. It would  scarcely be desirable to deprive them even of the right to carry  out the mining of generally widespread minerals, which right is  granted to owners of sectors of land in accordance with Article  5 of the law.    An article that is of definite interest is Article 4 of  Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources," which is devoted  to objects of the right of ownership. According to this article,  the property of the Republic of Tatarstan includes: 1) the  mineral resources and the deposits of minerals that are located  in them; 2) deposits situated on the territory of Tatarstan and  contiguous territories in that part in which they are located in  the Republic of Tatarstan; 3) deposits of minerals and sectors  of mineral resources that were acquired by the republic within  the confines of other territorial-administrative and  national-state formations of the CIS and abroad; 4) information  concerning the geological structure and mineral and  raw-materials potential of the mineral resources that is  received at the expense of funds from the state budget; 5)  tailings of removed, surrounding, and side-recovery rocks, and  storage facilities for other waste products, which form  technologically exploitable resources of mineral raw materials  that accumulate during the extraction, dressing, and processing  of natural minerals.    From the text of the article on objects of the right of  ownership it is evident that the republic is attempting to  define as precisely as possible the limits of everything  valuable that is its property. Unfortunately, it has not  revealed in the law the methods by which the republic acquires  deposits of minerals within the confines of other  territorial-administrative and national-state formations of the  CIS and abroad.    In the preamble to the Republic of Buryatia Law "Mineral  Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources," there  is a statute concerning the use of mineral resources in the  drainage area of Lake Baykal, which is regulated by conditions  governing special use of the natural environment, which are  aimed at the unconditional preservation of Lake Baykal as  national property of the Russian Federation.    The section of the law that is devoted to the efficient use  and protection of the mineral resources contains Article 32,  "Special Rules For Use of the Mineral Resources in the Drainage  Area of Lake Baykal." According to this article, the use of the  mineral resources in the water-protection zone of Lake Baykal is  allowed only with the application and observance of  technological schemes that preclude any runoffs or emissions  that are capable of harming Lake Baykal or its ecosystem. The  use of the mineral resources in the shore zone of Lake Baykal,  with the exception of the study of the mineral resources without  the carrying out of mining operations, the extraction of  generally widespread minerals, and the construction of  underground and water-intake structures with a depth of up to 10  meters for their own needs by the owners and leasers of sectors  of land, is prohibited.    In Article 19 of the Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources  it is emphasized that users of the mineral resources to whom  they are granted for purposes that are not linked with the  abstraction of minerals, in the event that minerals are detected  or appear on the sector that has been allocated to those users,  must immediately report that fact to the agency that issued the  license.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Kleinwort taps a new seam - Potential for profits KLEINWORT Benson's new Endowment Policy Trust has brought the possibilities of secondhand endowments to public notice. So what advantages does the investment trust route have over buying your own endowment directly from a market maker or at auction? Well, the scheme is closed-ended, which means you just need to purchase shares in the trust, which has been designed to wind up after 11 years, with the proceeds divided among the shareholders - this investment is for capital growth only. Using an investment trust avoids double taxation problems - the trust pays no tax and the investor is subject to Capital Gains Tax on cash-in. Unlike direct investment, investors in this trust will not have further cash calls made to meet the premiums due on the endowments in the portfolio. Although the trust will invest mainly in endowments, which mature on or before the wind-up of the trust, it will hold shorter-dated endowments where the maturity proceeds will provide the cash to pay these premiums. Investors wishing to cash in before the trust is wound up must sell their shares. The trust will have an issued share capital of 30m shares of which one-quarter will be available to the public, the remainder having been placed. The offer price is 100p a share, with a minimum application of 1,000 shares and thereafter in multiples of 1,000 shares. Investment can also be made through regular savings - minimum Pounds 25 a month. The illustrative annual return, assuming life company bonus rates - both reversionary and terminal - does not change and is 12.7 per cent gross, compared with a yield of around 14 per cent on individual second hand endowments maturing in 11 years. The difference reflects charges incurred setting up the trust and getting fully invested - expected to take a year - and the conservative method used by KB in discounting future premium payments in valuing endowments. For investors wanting to enter or get out of the trust in the interim period they will have to buy or sell shares - which may not be so simple. The trust, which has two actuaries on the board, will regularly calculate the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares, with independent checks on the basic parameters used. This NAV will be published and form the basis for the share price. But share prices of investment trusts are affected by other factors - the general market movement and the supply and demand of a particular share. Share prices could stand at a discount to NAV if investors try to sell their shares because the stock market has fallen or life companies have cut bonus rates. A rush of investors wanting to cash in early will not force the trust to sell endowments, but it could result in the share price falling below NAV. So anyone buying into the trust needs to consider the implications of getting out before the trust is wound up. The launch of this trust could herald the start of other collective schemes, greatly increasing the demand for second hand endowments without any corresponding increase in supply. That could have implications for the market in second hand endowments. Some commentators believe that the growth in the secondhand endowment market has an inbuilt self-destruct mechanism. It is argued that as far as the life company is concerned, it loses the profit made on surrender when an endowment is sold to a third party and therefore kept in force. So the growth in the market will lead to lower profits and therefore lower bonuses. And those investors in the policies, either directly or through a collective scheme, will receive lower returns than anticipated and become disillusioned. But this argument only covers one profit source of traditional life companies, not the complete trading pattern. The main source of profit for traditional with-profit business arises from the excess yield on investments on the underlying funds compared with the return assumed in the premium calculations. This investment profit accelerates over the lifetime of the contract as the funds build up on a compound basis. The profit which life offices take on surrender is generally only part of the investment profit that could have been earned had the contract been kept in force until maturity. The secondhand endowment market will hit problems when the supply of endowments fails to meet demand. This will happen when existing policyholders cease selling their contracts to third parties, which in turn would only occur if policyholders stopped wanting to cash-in their contracts before maturity, or life companies improved their surrender pay-outs to such an extent that market makers could not match those pay-outs. The latter is already happening. Bad publicity has made many life companies substantially improve surrender values. They are almost as concerned with their position in the surrender value league tables as they are with the maturity tables. If surrender values continue to improve, market makers may find that the price they are prepared to pay for endowments cannot match them. That would be bad for the market, but possibly good for consumers.</p>

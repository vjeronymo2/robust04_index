			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ansett turnround lifts TNT A strong contribution from its 50 per cent interest in Ansett Airlines and continued improvements in core operations helped TNT, the large Australian transportation and package delivery group, to an equity-accounted profit after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 105.1m (USDollars 78m) in the year to end-June. Group revenues were ADollars 5.69bn, up from ADollars 5.52bn previously. The result compares with a loss of ADollars 256.7m a year earlier, when TNT faced some heavy one-off charges. In the latest period, abnormal items contributed an after-tax surplus of ADollars 57m, partly due to gains on both asset sales and foreign currency movements at Ansett, in contrast to the 1992-93 charge of ADollars 212.1m. However, even at the trading level, there was an improvement. Operating profit before tax rose to ADollars 127.5m from ADollars 14.8m on an equity-consolidated basis, and edged up to ADollars 45.8m from ADollars 44.3m on a statutory consolidated basis. TNT said the advance was largely due to the turnround at Ansett, and reduced losses in its GD Express Worldwide business, its express delivery joint venture. The company said that full-year results at GD Express were still below expectations, having been hindered by aggressive competition, although the fourth quarter was in line with estimates. It said that the better economic outlook in main markets, coupled with cost reduction measures, should 'bring substantial financial improvement in the current year'. The core Australian business saw operating earnings improve 'significantly', while Canada also showed 'an exceptional turnround'. The UK business earned record profits, and Germany improved. There is no dividend.</p>

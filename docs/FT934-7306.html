			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Life houses open attack on SIB plan THE LIFE INSURANCE ind-ustry has begun preparing opposition to the draft rules on commission disclosure issued this week by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. Allied Dunbar, the life subsidiary of BAT Industries, has written to regulators, politicians and chief executives in the industry warning that it sees no basis on which disclosing commission can be made fair and informative in terms of disclosing the potential for bias in giving advice. Mr George Greener, BAT financial services chief executive, argued in the letter that there was a risk that the plans would be manipulated, with offices turning towards salaried rather than commission-based payments to their staff in order to look more competitive. He added that any disclosure regime which had to cover a range of sales forces, from independent financial advisers working on a commission basis to the salaried company representative who received bonuses, could not present a clear picture of the equivalent incentive to sell. Another of the largest life offices, Legal &amp; General, said yesterday that it was 'still to be convinced that the proposals were the best way of achieving' the aims of providing customers with the information they needed. There is also concern among some life companies at the SIB's recommendation that commission disclosure should apply to term assurance policies, which are taken out for protection rather than for investment. They fear that this could lead to a requirement for sales agents to reveal the incentive to make a sale on other types of insurance as well.</p>

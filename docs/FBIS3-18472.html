			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on Skopjean press reports that a truck  crossed the Greek border yesterday carrying industrial material,  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the embargo  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] is being implemented faithfully. He said the  measures have not been eased, adding that food and medicines as  part of humanitarian aid are the only exception.    Venizelos described the delay in the United States  establishing diplomatic relations with Skopje as a positive  element. Asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher urging all the countries  in the region to show an interest in Macedonia, as he referred  to Skopje, the spokesman said: Greece is the friendliest  country toward Skopje and is interested in its viability and  development. But [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's continuing  intransigence does not help it.    Referring to an interview with Gligorov in an Athens  newspaper [paper not identified] today, Venizelos said he saw  some calm, moderate statements. He added that despite the  carefully expressed views, the Skopjean president does not  deviate from his basic position. Venizelos said: With careful  political dialogue, Gligorov appears as a victim. But the  international community must also realize that Greece took the  counter measures because of Skopje's provocative and  untrustworthy behavior.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Turbulence at GPA GPA is at last having to realise that survival depends on more than cramming a first class cabin with classy non-executive directors such as Lord Lawson and Sir John Harvey-Jones. These failed to prevent its financial crisis. But the looming payments on GPA's bond issues leave little time for recriminations. After its failure to sell new equity even at Dollars 1 a share, a deal with bond holders, if one can be agreed, is only part of the solution. The size of GPA's bank debt means it must still find a new source of equity. Otherwise it will be difficult to scale down its business in an orderly way. Lending to GPA will go down as another error of judgment by international banks who were initially attracted by the security it offered. This was important after the developing country debt crisis of the early 1980s. But the banks fell into two traps akin to those that snared them in property lending. They vastly overestimated the demand for new aircraft and their obsession with security led them to pay too little attention to GPA's cash flow. GPA is now, however, so big that it needs to be kept going to prevent havoc in the aircraft market. The pain of collapse would be felt not only by manufacturers who have already seen their orders slashed. The forced sale of GPA's fleet would erode still further the value of the banks' security. Then there is the additional problem of the partnership leases which depend on GPA continuing as a going concern. Whatever the solution, it would be preferable to find a way of ensuring that GPA's existing managers can continue to run the day-to-day leasing operation. They have acquitted themselves well in this regard - which cannot be said about the board's involvement with grander strategy.</p>

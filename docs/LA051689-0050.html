			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERONISTS NOW MUST FACE ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC ILLS  </P> <P> The party created by Juan D. Peron in the mid-1940s, which won every Argentine  election it was allowed to contest until its drubbing in 1983, has put to rest  doubts that Peronism would be able to outlive its charismatic founder.  </P> <P> Invoking the memory of Peron and his famous wife Evita, populist Carlos Saul  Menem stormed to a stunning victory in the presidential election Sunday. He  thus capitalized on disgust with the failure of the ruling Radical Civil Union  to arrest Argentina's economic decline.  </P> <P> Menem now must prove that the Peronist party, which originally won over the  working class with doses of state largess more than four decades ago, can cope  with an economic crisis that frustrated the century-old Radicals of President  Raul Alfonsin.  </P> <P> Menem, a 58-year-old attorney and the governor of La Rioja province, received  47.4% of the vote Sunday compared with 37% for Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of the  Radical party, the Interior Ministry reported. That margin gave Menem 310 of  the 600 presidential electors, nine more than necessary for election. The  balance of the vote was split among the conservative Center Alliance and minor  candidates.  </P> <P> The Justicialist Party, as the Peronists are formally known, also swept into  control of the lower house of Congress. The party already holds the Senate, so  Menem will have a supporting Congress when he takes office Dec. 10.  </P> <P> Many saw the result of Sunday's election less as a vote for Menem than as a  vote against the Radicals.  </P> <P> "It's a withering indictment of the Radicals' economic performance," a Western  diplomat said. "I think most people weren't happy with the choices, but a lot  of people decided to vote Peronist on the basis that the Radicals were doing  nothing. They just shrugged their shoulders and said, 'It can't get any worse.'  "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soaring Inflation  </P> <P> Inflation soared to 40% for the month of April -- an annual rate projected at  up to 3,000%. The currency, the austral, has lost 80% of its value against the  dollar since February.  </P> <P> When Alfonsin defeated the divided, disorganized Peronists in 1983 in the first  open election since Peron's death nearly a decade earlier, many Argentines  thought Peronism was fading. Many saw the party's earlier allure as a matter of  forbidden fruit: Military governments had banned Peronism for a total of 18  years after 1955.  </P> <P> But Alfonsin's win over Peronist presidential candidate Italo Luder brought to  the forefront of the Peronists a group of so-called renovadores (renewers),  including Menem, who successfully fought for democratic reforms within the  party. This paid off with impressive Peronist victories in provincial and  congressional elections in 1987.  </P> <P> Menem won the Peronists' presidential nomination in the party's first open  primary, although some critics have said that he did so with the help of  remnants of the old Peronist order who had lost out in the reorganization.  </P> <P> Menem insists he owes no political debts, not even to the powerful General  Confederation of Labor which unleashed its machine on his behalf. The union's  leaders, including Secretary General Saul Ubaldini, have said they do not  expect Menem to produce miracles overnight.  </P> <P> Some analysts suggest that Menem's strong ties with organized labor will help  him win its cooperation for potentially painful measures, such as cutbacks in  the public work force to trim a huge deficit. Alfonsin was plagued by 13  general strikes, and he met labor intransigence when he tried to privatize  state enterprises.  </P></p>

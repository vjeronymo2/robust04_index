			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Privatisation pioneers find it tough at the bottom: Local experience cries out for co-ordinated reform throughout the Soviet Union WHEN Sub-Lieutenant Vladislav Gerasimov left the navy and returned to his native Leningrad, he decided he had nothing to lose by trying his hand at business. One year on, aged 29, he is the proud proprietor of one of the first shops 'privatised' as part of Leningrad city council's market reforms. Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, in charge of Leningrad's city council privatisation programme, says he aims to sell 80 per cent of the city's 4,000 shops, as well as most of its restaurants and housing. He has sold 40 shops so far but he cannot say how long the whole process will take as this depends on what he calls the 'political situation'. One problem is that he still faces resistance from Communist-controlled districts and the state organisations which run most of the retail network. But the pioneering initiative of radical city councils and of entrepreneurs such as Mr Gerasimov also reveals the limitations of economic reform in isolation. Their experience cries out for a co-ordinated reform programme at all levels of government and the economy. After giving up attempts to repair the ailing socialist system, the Soviet leadership has come round to the view that privatisation and other capitalist evils are essential to economic recovery. Although the union government has not yet begun privatisatsia of factories on any significant scale, republican and local authorities have made a start in taking small businesses and agricultural land out of state hands. The government's latest anti-crisis programme seeks to privatise two-thirds of small business by the end of 1992. One of the programme's contradictions however is that it sets no precise targets for its proclaimed goal of breaking up monopolies and privatising state industry. Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, said in an interview this week that one of his government's most important tasks was to de-monopolise and privatise industry. He said the government was drawing up detailed plans to achieve this together with the privatisation of the wholesale trade network. If this is so, then the government will be helping those at the grassroots level who have taken the initiative on this difficult route. For the time being, what Leningrad's Mr Vasiliev is doing falls short of privatisation in the traditional sense - in so far as the businesses are long-leased, rather than sold outright. He says that the main reason for this is because the council is afraid of being short-changed by selling in a market where prices are still artificially low in the absence of market mechanisms. Politically, he adds, there is a danger of a backlash if he goes too far too fast. This is why for instance the council reserves the right to require that new owners continue to sell basic commodities they sold under state ownership. 'If a bread shop starts selling jeans (and stops selling bread), this could be the end for us,' says Mr Vasiliev, referring to the already fragile supplies of basic commodities. 'But nothing stops a shop from expanding its selection.' However, Mr Vasiliev, whose great-grandmother owned a chain of hairdressers before the Bolsheviks abolished private property, has no time for socialist ideals of worker-management. Although employees are given a first option on leasing businesses, he says 'they make bad managers'. From the outside, Mr Gerasimov's shop, in an industrial suburb with an impersonal sign saying 'Haberdashery', looks like any other grubby state institution in the Soviet Union. Inside however, it sells a far wider range of goods than you would expect in a haberdashery shop, including items such as wall-paper and swim-suits. Mr Gerasimov claims turnover has quadrupled since he took over in March. For Mr Gerasimov, minimum requirements for what he should sell and not having outright ownership are the least of his worries. He paid Rbs15,000 for the shop's contents, and signed a 15-year lease giving him first option for outright purchase. The lease has been set at Rbs30,000 a year. He was chosen to take over the shop after a laborious selection process by the city council. This has since been replaced by an auction system. Nor does this Communist party member have any problems with his staff. He told the three women who worked in the shop that they were welcome to stay on, providing they shed the bad habits of state employees: 'I told them they were not allowed to shout at the customers any more.' He also doubled their pay. His main headache is more fundamental - finding goods to sell in a shortage economy where supplies are largely controlled by the state. He says some enterprises want to do business with him but are already committed to selling their output to the state through the system of state orders. Others will only dispose of their surplus production in return for other goods or in hard currency. 'We spend a lot of time looking for goods to sell because even though there are private shops, there are no private factories,' he said. 'All the letters we write have to start with the words 'I ask you', but I am fed up with asking.'</p>

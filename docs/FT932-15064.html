			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins help Golden Vale rise 13.5% GOLDEN VALE, the Irish dairy group, yesterday reported a 13.5 per cent increase to IPounds 16.7m in 1992 pre-tax profits on turnover marginally ahead at IPounds 298m, writes Tim Coone. The company said the increase was due to increases in volume and margins in the consumer products and food ingredients markets and reduced volume in the lower-margin primary dairy products markets. Strong cash flow and working capital management reduced net borrowings to IPounds 7.5m (IPounds 20.6m), leaving gearing at 8.8 per cent (27.9 per cent). Mr Liam Irvine, finance director, said that allowed the company to spend 'another IPounds 30-40m on acquisitions without having to go to the market'. The Cork-based company is the largest milk processor in Ireland, processing 700m litres annually - or 11 per cent of the national quota. Furthermore, through its 74.9 per cent stake in DPP in Northern Ireland, it is also the fourth largest processed cheese producer in the EC. It intends to exercise an option to acquire the outstanding stake in 1993. Last month it made a recommended Pounds 21.7m bid for Leckpatrick, a dairy processor. Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, anticipated significant growth in 1993 'based on achieving further development of new products in the consumer products and food ingredients markets and the expansion of operations in the UK and Europe'. A final dividend of 1.13p makes a 1.63p (1.36p) total.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 Aprio, President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand  Aristide denounced in an official letter the agreement signed  with the United States in 1981 on refugees. He did so to protest  the systematic return by the United States to Haiti of those who  want to leave the country. This agreement constitutes the legal  basis of U.S. Coast Guard efforts to systematically return  Haitian refugees who attempt to enter the United States.    Mr. Michael Barnes added that President-in-exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide also gave notice of his refusal of the  latest plan for a settlement to the crisis in Haiti. U.S. Vice  President Al Gore presented the plan to the president last  month. Father Aristide considers unacceptable the American  proposal to lift the sanctions before his return to Haiti as  head of state.    The American policy is a perversion of democracy, says the  letter to President Bill Clinton from the Haitian president, who  has lived in exile since 1991. The letter points out that in  any case the 1981 convention concerning the refugees expires in  six months.    It should be recalled that the American policy regarding the  Haitian refugees is based on the presumption that the refugees  are not fleeing persecution, which is unbelievable, writes  President Aristide. He reproaches Mr. Bill Clinton for having  taken on the responsibility for the policy of his Republican  predecessor George Bush, who began to send back Haitian refugees  in 1992.</p>

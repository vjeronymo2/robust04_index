			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Major to study report on top pay THE CONTROVERSIAL report on pay rises for senior civil servants, military personnel and judges was received by Downing Street yesterday and will be considered today by Mr John Major, the prime minister, on his return from the European Council summit in Lisbon. The recommendations by the Top Salaries Review Body follow the first thorough reappraisal of the salaries of those groups of public servants for seven years, and is said to recommend substantial increases. Originally the aim had been to take the report at cabinet next Thursday, but it has been agreed that the Treasury should have longer to prepare an analysis of the implications, not least for the present round of negotiations on public-sector pay. The report is now expected to be discussed at cabinet the following week. It cannot be delayed until the cabinet discusses public spending - as is expected in mid July - because the government's decision must be announced to MPs before parliament is dissolved for the summer. Although by convention the decision is announced in a written statement, there has to be a parliamentary debate to approve the consequential change to the Lord Chancellor's salary, which is linked to that of the Lord Chief Justice. In 1985, the last time there was a thorough review, increases of up to 46 per cent were recommended, and in the debate that followed the government's majority of more than 100 was slashed to just 17. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, has been among the Conservative MPs who have already made clear their concern that the pay rises should not be substantial when the economy has yet to come out of recession. Opposition MPs have tabled a Commons motion rejecting the idea of comparability between senior posts in the public and private sectors because of the job security enjoyed by public servants. MPs have also made clear that they would resent any attempt to link the handling of the report with the separate review body study which proposes an increase in MPs' allowances for office costs.</p>

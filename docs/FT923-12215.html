			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Housing the Inland Revenue LAING MANAGEMENT has been awarded the management contract for the Pounds 50m construction project for the Inland Revenue's new centre at Castle Meadow, Nottingham. The project comprises 40,000 sq metres of office accommodation in six buildings arranged along radiating bands of streets focused on Nottingham Castle to the north. The design of the buildings incorporates load-bearing brickwork and fair-faced structural concrete members. A restaurant, social and sports facilities and a nursery are to be based in a separate amenity block at the centre of the development. Enabling works throughout the site (which was previously used as railway sidings) are due to begin in the autumn and will involve the demolition of buildings and the diversion of numerous services. The project is scheduled to be completed and the buildings ready for occupation by the end of 1994.</p>

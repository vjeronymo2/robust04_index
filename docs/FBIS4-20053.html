			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Blanca Riemer, special Washington correspondent: </F> "Alphandery Vaunts French Economic Situation to G-7"]    [Excerpt] The finance ministers of the seven most highly  industrialized countries (G-7), accompanied by the governors of  their respective central banks, met late yesterday in Washington  on the eve of the traditional spring meetings of the IMF and  World Bank. Three main subjects were discussed: the problem of  the increase in long-term interest rates in the wake of the  gradual increase in interest rates in the United States; the  question of how to follow up support to Russia following the  IMF's financing worth 10 billion francs; and the functioning of  the international capital markets. On his journey to  Washington, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery once again  expressed satisfaction at the French economic picture, which he  was preparing to explain in detail to his interlocutors.    All the economic indicators in France "are moving in the  right direction," Edmond Alphandery stressed, and the recovery  is all the stronger because it is being led by all components of  demand: better export performance, investment spending, the  construction of houses, and household consumption. The economy  minister thinks that the official growth forecasts of 1.4  percent "now look rather cautious" to several economic bodies.  "Some think that we should exceed that figure," he pointed out.  To achieve that, three factors would have to be present: an  increase in the rate of exports thanks to an improvement in the  international environment; a stronger resumption of investment;  and a rebuilding of stocks.

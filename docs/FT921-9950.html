			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Ford to cut 2,100 jobs from UK operations FORD, the US carmaker, is to cut about 2,100 jobs at its UK operations by the end of the year. The move is part of its drastic efforts to close the large productivity gap between its British and continental European plants. The latest round of cuts at Ford follows a year in which employment at British vehicle makers, components suppliers and motor dealers has been hit hard by the recession. The steep fall in UK new vehicle sales has compounded job cuts already being made as the European industry is forced to restructure in the face of mounting competition from Japanese carmakers in Europe. The Ford announcement was immediately picked up by British politicians in the pre-election propaganda war. Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, called the job losses a 'hammer blow' to the British economy. 'It underlines once again the need for government ministers to wake up out of their complacency, cease their false optimism about the recovery that has not yet happened and take Britain out of recession.' he said. Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, said the cuts were part of a 'process of making the British car industry more competitive and more effective in the market place'. In a further round of job-shedding in the industry, Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, announced yesterday that it was planning to cut 300 hourly-paid jobs from the 750-strong workforce at its Luton parts warehouse. The cuts will come in the 12 months from September 1992 following a Pounds 20m investment to automate the operation. BMW, the German carmaker, said it was aiming to cut 3,000 jobs by the end of the year. Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector company, announced plans earlier this week for 10,300 redundancies. Ford, which incurred heavy losses in the UK last year, said it planned to reduce its British workforce by 2,100 by voluntary means by the end of the year. It plans to complete most of the cuts by the end of April. It is cutting 500 jobs at its Dagenham plant (where the Fiesta model and engines are produced), 600 at Halewood (Escort/Orion and transmissions), 450 at Southampton (Transit van) and 300 at its South Wales engine and components plants. The cuts will cover 1,500 hourly-paid and 600 salaried employees. The salaried staff cuts are part of the three-year restructuring programme announced last year for Ford's white-collar staff across Europe. The company warned about the looming job cuts at the Southampton plant last month. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain, insisted the cuts were not a short-term response to recessionary pressures but part of a long-term efficiency programme. 'The domestic UK vehicle industry faces significant challenges over the remainder of the decade as production from Japanese car plants adds to vehicle overcapacity in Europe.' He said productivity at Ford's UK plants had improved by nearly 40 per cent in the last six years. But the company admitted this week its European operations were still 'up to 50 per cent less efficient than leading Japanese manufacturers'. Union leaders expressed scepticism about the company's claim that the job losses were part of a 'long-term efficiency programme', rather than a response to recessionary pressures. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEU engineering union, said the Ford statement was 'political rather than economic' and was 'designed to gloss over a very depressing situation' for the British car industry. 'The company should have been more honest about the real reasons.' Government policies were 'eating like a cancer into the British motor industry', he said. Ford's UK workforce has fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500 by late last year, an average reduction of 3,600 a year. Despite this, Ford produced 451,996 vehicles in the UK last year against 481,140 in 1980.

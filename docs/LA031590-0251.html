			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHOWS TARGET YOUNG, CBS TELLS ADVERTISERS  </P> <P> CBS told its advertisers and their agencies Wednesday that it was taking aim on  the young crowd with prime shows in development for the 1990-91 season that  were animated, musical and featured stand-up comics.  </P> <P> Jeff Sagansky, new president of CBS Entertainment, and Peter Tortorici, senior  vice president of program planning, outlined the third-place network's "game  plan" for the coming season, describing 23 pilots under consideration.  </P> <P> There is no guarantee which of them will actually appear on the schedule when  it is announced later this spring.  </P> <P> The CBS executive pointed to two series that will be different -- "The Pink  Panther," a mixture of live-action and animation that proved successful in the  film "Roger Rabbit," and "Shangri La Plaza," described as "a musical half-hour  which is scored and sung from beginning to end."  </P> <P> Speaking of the network's effort to broaden its demographic base, Sagansky  said:  </P> <P> "We have to program younger. The oldest baby boomers are still only 43, and if  we're not programming to them -- which we do in shows like 'Murphy Brown' and  'Designing Women' -- then we ought to be programming for their kids and  teen-agers."  </P> <P> Among other shows under consideration for the 8 p.m. period are:  </P> <P> "Big," based on the hit movie, starring Bruce Norris, Darin McGavin and Alison  LaPlaca.  </P> <P> "Uncle Buck," with comic Kevin Meany as an uncouth, ill-mannered and totally  unprepared head of an unlikely household.  </P> <P> "Broken Badges," a Cajun cop who works with a group of fellow police officers,  all on psychiatric leave with various mental problems.  </P> <P> "Lenny," developed around the stand-up comic Lenny Clarke, a blue-collar hero  with a strong middle-American point of view.  </P> <P> Also "The Flash," based on the DC Comics character; "NYPD Mounted," about an  odd-couple pair of New York cops on horseback and "The Rock," starring comic  Joy Behar.  </P> <P> Drama development for the 9 p.m. slot includes "Over My Dead Body," starring  Edward Woodward as a retired cop turned mystery writer; "Shore Patrol," with  Rick Schroder in an action series; "WIOU," an ensemble show set in a Midwestern  television station newsroom (from Grant Tinker's new company), and "Sporting  Chance," about a one-time star athlete who, after being caught in a betting  scandal, returns as a sports world private eye.  </P> <P> There are three shows with law environments -- "Bar Girls" about two women  attorneys; "The Antagonists," about a defense lawyer and a prosecutor who  compete in solving crimes, and "Hanging Judge," in which a once-idealistic  judge, after having been slightly disfigured, fights for justice with an array  of high-tech weapons.  </P> <P> In comedy development for the new season is "Sunday Dinner," a family comedy  from Norman Lear.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> VONS PRESIDENT DAVILA TO RETIRE IN '92; ECK TO JOIN FIRM  </P> <P> Vons Cos. President William S. Davila, who is featured in the supermarket  company's television commercials, has revealed plans to take early retirement.  </P> <P> Some of his duties will be assumed by a new vice chairman hired away from a  rival company.  </P> <P> Dennis K. Eck, vice chairman at American Stores, which owns Alpha-Beta and  Lucky's supermarkets, will join Vons as part of a newly created, three-man  office of the chief executive that will be headed by current Chairman Roger E.  Strangeland.  </P> <P> The office will include Davila, who will retire in April, 1992. Davila, whose  duties as chief operating officer will be assumed by Eck, will oversee Vons'  internal growth, retail development and all marketing and advertising  functions.  </P> <P> Neither Eck nor Davila was available for comment.  </P> <P> Davila, 58, joined the company in 1948 and worked his way up from sweeping  floors. He was named president in 1984. A company spokesman said Davila's  decision to retire was believed to be triggered by his desire to perform more  community work.  </P> <P> After his retirement, Davila will retain his seat on Vons' board and remain the  company's media spokesman indefinitely.  </P> <P> Eck, 47, who served on American's board and as chairman of its American Food  and Drug subsidiary, will oversee retail operations, merchandising, procurement  and support services as chief operating officer for the 328-store chain.  Besides Vons, the El Monte-based company also operates Pavilions, Pavilions  Place and Tianguis markets.  </P> <P> The management changes set the stage for a line of new top management, says  Sarah Stack, who follows the supermarket industry for the brokerage firm  Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.  </P> <P> "It puts in place what appears to be a plan for a succession," said Stack.

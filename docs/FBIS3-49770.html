			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk and Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Will the </F> SLD Split and How?"]    [Text] After two months of Waldemar Pawlak Cabinet's  term, after the draft budget has been presented and the  parliament has worked intensively, one can try to assess the  direction in which the present Cabinet's actions are heading.  Will this be a government that will manage to stop the run of  misfortunes by surviving the parliament's entire term of office  for the first time since 1989, or will it end up like the  previous governments? Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski has  been saying that changes will be introduced to the extent  possible. Will these changes be sufficient?    Apart from an unshaken belief in the current Cabinet's  success expressed by Zbigniew Siematkowski of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD], other politicians have been having many  fears, and these fears are not always accompanied by the  malicious hope that the current coalition may be just another  example of failure.  <H5>  Winners' Optimism </H5>   Zbigniew Siemiatkowski thinks that the coalition is heading  in the right direction: "One can have doubts about whether the  rate at which we are going is appropriate, or about whether  everything contained in the SLD election program was  implemented. In that regard, everyone, of course, has a right to  his own opinion," he says. "We regard the 19 September elections  as entering into a contract with society for four years. In the  contract, there are some priority goals, and there are also some  less important ones that will be implemented at a later stage.  The year 1994 is a time of fundamental reorganization of the  process of managing the state and also of macroeconomic  processes aimed at eliminating the biggest irregularities in the  economic policy. We are aware that society, while agreeing to  the direction of the transformations, spoke against the social  policy implemented thus far. We will try to coordinate the two  processes, but it is not possible to do that within a few  months. But some mechanisms were included even in the current  budget draft, which will bring improvement for households as  quickly as in two to three years."    According to Siemiatkowski, the main danger facing the  current Cabinet comes from the impatience of those who expect  quick successes, whereas the Cabinet's main chance is that it is  in the comfortable position of being able to plan its policy.  The previous cabinets did not have that comfort.    "The failure of our Cabinet and of our ideas would be a  failure of the entire system," Siemiatkowski says. "The failure  of the reforms carried through by the left-wing government would  not automatically mean that society will put its faith in  someone else from the left wing."    "The Union of Labor [UP] is further removed from the  governing coalition today than at any time in the past," says UP  leader Ryszard Bugaj. "Those who have a dominating position in  the coalition--I do not think the entire coalition speaks with  one voice--seem to have a preference for a strategy of  adaptation that will leave the country's powerful centers  intact." The moods and aspirations of big social groups play a  minor role from the standpoint of that strategy. According to  Bugaj, an attempt at a radical shift in the economic policy  would be massively opposed by the press (that is, mostly the  liberal press) and by the president, even if big social groups  expected the policy to be implemented. Under the circumstances,  the coalition's leadership decided in favor of trying to gain  the support of small but strong pressure groups. Such a policy  is dangerous because it can lead to a conviction in society that  no matter how one votes on election day, the result is always  the same, and big frustrations always result from such  convictions. Part of the SLD is clearly heading toward a  liberalization of the economy. Influential SLD activists think  that the party will manage to achieve what the Democratic Union  [UD] failed to achieve along with the liberals because the SLD  has the left-wing label. That is not very likely to happen.    "Some of my colleagues have been watching that with  satisfaction, thinking that UP will remain as the only credible  political party that does not change its views," Bugaj says.  "The trouble is that, during the next elections (it is not a  certain thing at all that they must take place in four years  because they might as well happen sooner), many people will  decide that mistakes and failures are to be attributed to the  so-called left wing, and we are included in that label."  <H5>  "A Moment of Truth Will Come Soon" </H5>   ...prophesies Bugaj. "A major danger to the coalition's  coherency will come from radical social problems. They do exist  even now anyway, but they will not be a danger to the coalition  until they are articulated and transformed into specific action.  That is because then the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement  [OPZZ], which is very dependent on social moods, will have its  room for maneuvering radically curtailed."    According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL], the next presidential elections are a prospect for  the governing coalition (unless there is social unrest). With  the current configuration of forces in parliament determined by  the voters, presidential rules are the only alternative left at  the coalition's disposal. So the coalition's stability is a  guarantee for maintaining the parliamentary-Cabinet rules. The  political calendar is advantageous to the governing coalition.  We have both self-governmental and presidential elections coming  up. Both Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski have already  begun their presidential campaigns. So the coalition has a very  good chance of surviving till the time of the presidential  election. But the coalition's weakest spot is in the individual  parties that make it up. The government does not have to be  afraid of losing 30 or 50 votes in the parliament because the  margin of safety it enjoys is substantial. So the party leaders'  biggest problems will concern what happens inside their  individual parties. Aleksander Kwasniewski wants to change his  electorate by courting those who up to now were UD voters, and  by showing that the SLD is a modern type of party that cares  about the country's stability. On the other hand, if Kwasniewski  loses the votes of those who up to now were his electorate, he  may lose the presidential election. That contradiction has been  manifesting itself more and more though because Kwasniewski  publicly admits to being a social-liberal, and that is primarily  because he does not like poverty. But he has not yet decided to  make such bold statements within the party itself, and this is  the way it is going to be for a long time.    Besides, there are different trends within the SLD, and  different aspirations as well. According to Piechocinski, coming  into alliance with the Polish Socialist Party was a big mistake  because it strengthened the extreme left-wing and orthodox wing  within the SLD. The OPZZ is another problem because its leaders  have big political ambitions, and, apart from that, an internal  fight among various leaders is going on within it. Kwasniewski  may face enormous problems with coming to grips with this  phenomenon. In addition, the situation is being complicated by  the position taken by UP, which remonstrates with the electorate  upon...  <H5>  The SLD Having Betrayed Left-Wing Ideals </H5>   That causes a certain gap because the SLD's rank and file,  who have been watching this, are asking themselves the question:  "Apart from Kwasniewski's personal satisfaction, what is the use  of a victory at all?" That may lead the SLD to transform itself  into a federation of clubs that will not vote the same way in  the Sejm.    The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] also faces a difficult  situation because there have occurred big differentiations in  the countryside, and there have emerged many groups there whose  interests are completely different. It is impossible to satisfy  all of them. That is how the big debate in the PSL concerning  its program came about: What kind of a party is the PSL supposed  to be, and what are its ideas concerning the state? If the PSL  decides to meet the demands of all of its electorate groups on  an immediate basis, that could create serious problems for the  governing coalition. But the biggest danger comes from the  possible lack of economic achievements.    "Unless there are such achievements, the current political  elite will be thrown out with a bang because the voters will  push them aside for their inefficiency," Piechocinski says.    Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland  [KPN] predicts that a Belweder-peasant government will be formed  in a few months. "The most likely scenario for the current  governing coalition to split up is for a...  <H5>  Conflict Between the SLD and the President </H5>   ...to occur during the presidential election campaigns of  Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski," says Krol, who, under  this scenario, also predicts the dismissal of the "postcommunist  ministers" from the government, who had been recommended by the  SLD. According to the KPN leader, the SLD will then be in the  opposition, and we could see early elections. The current  governing coalition could also be divided through evolutions of  both parties, which today are bound by power and a similar past.  "The PSL wants to become a centrist and a traditional kind of  party, whereas the SLD wants to be social-democratic in order to  replace UD," Krol says.    But Zbigniew Janas of UD thinks that the fate of the current  coalition depends on what happens to the SLD itself: "There is  an enormous external [as published] differentiation within the  SLD, which is similar to the one present in the Citizens  Parliamentary Club [OKP] after the elections of June 1989. It  would be a worthwhile effort to examine the course of events  leading up to the OKP's disintegration. Most probably a split  within the SLD will take place at the same rate. For the moment,  there is still the euphoria in the aftermath of the elections  and the satisfaction after having taken over power, but disputes  will begin when the government encounters its first problems,"  Janas says. According to the Sejm deputy for UD, internal  opposition will increase its strength also within the PSL, which  may pose a danger for the entire coalition. This is even more so  because there will not be as much money devoted to agriculture  as some would like to see. Janas thinks it would be a miracle if  the coalition supporting Pawlak's Cabinet survived until the end  of the four-year term.</p>

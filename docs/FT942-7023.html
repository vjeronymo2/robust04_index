			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Lecturers to alter stance on dispute The annual conference of the Natfhe lecturers' union, which starts tomorrow, could signal a turning point in the union's long and disruptive dispute over new contracts. Earlier this week the union announced that members had voted decisively against re-electing the general secretary, Mr Geoff Woolf, in a result which was widely interpreted as a rejection of his handling of the contracts dispute. In the first round of voting Mr Woolf received 2,709 votes compared with 4,879 for the eventual winner, Mr John Akker. Mr Woolf eventually finished fourth. Mr Akker is deputy general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, which last year formed a confederation with Natfhe. He built his campaign around opposition to what he regarded as poor handling of the dispute. He will move to Natfhe next month. He said he wanted to emphasise that the union would make a 'new start' in the contract negotiations under his leadership. Natfhe gave up national bargaining earlier this year after the High Court ruled that its ballot of members over a national strike had been unlawful. It is now attempting to bargain locally. The contracts, which employers have been trying to introduce for more than 12 months to allow greater flexibility after the removal of further education colleges from local authority control last year, are fiercely opposed by lecturers. They would cut annual holiday entitlement by half and add an hour to the working day. However, two smaller unions in the sector, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, and the Association of College Management, have signed national agreements over the contracts. The conference takes place in Southport, Merseyside, and ends on Monday.</p>

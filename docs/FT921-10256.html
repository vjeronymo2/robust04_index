			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: La Bete - Lyric, Hammersmith The first half of this thoroughly unusual piece, which has the financial backing of Andrew Lloyd Webber, absolutely glitters with promise and performance; the second half is considerably less good, so one cannot yet feel certain that it will achieve the transfer from Hammersmith to the West End. La Bete is a first play by a young American, David Herson. It had a short run on Broadway last year, but failed to catch on. Lloyd Webber backed it then and is sticking to it now. One can see why. The piece is full of pretty rhymes and pretty devices. It is allusive to this, that and the other, just like Lloyd Webber's music. The title is misleading, for there is nothing stupid about it. La Bete is set in the 17th century France of Louis XIV: the playwrights and actors are quarrelling about who should provide the court entertainment, and thus receive the royal subsidy. Chief among them is Elomire (an anagram of Moliere), who is challenged by the remarkably fluent performer and versifier, Valere. The play is really a challenge about who can produce and speak the best rhyming couplets. That is why the first act is so good. Valere, superbly played by Alan Cumming, wins hands down. He can not only produce the couplets; he can also act. This is a very camp performance. Note a piece of mime where he imitates a star, presumably in Naples, receiving the applause and the bouquets at the end of the show. See, too, his response to Elomire's very fierce 'Don't call me darling, ever:' 'Oh sorry, dear.' Valere is so fluent with his words that he has to invent new ones of his own. 'My word for 'words' is 'verbobos',' he says. His word for table is 'carabumba' and for chair 'Francesca'. The delight at this virtuoso performance is abounding. The trouble is that the rest of the play can't quite keep up. Valere is challenging for Elomire's place at court. Prince Conti, the patron of the arts, arrives to judge. What happens is a contest that does not come off. It is never really clear that Valere's style is substantially different from Elomire's. What we do get, however, is a stunning display of how flexible and effective English rhyming couplets can be. Those who saw Ranjit Bolt's translations from Corneille at the Old Vic a year or so ago will know exactly what I mean. The verse positively flows and, within the discipline, is remarkably varied. As Valere comments, 'daunting is the ease with which you weave linguistic tapestries', whereas 'pentameters, though pleasing on the page, are so monotonous upon the stage.' There are other delights. The Prince, played by Timothy Walker, has the most magnificently long train. Sarah Crowden as Dorine speaks her part in teasing rhyming monosyllables. It is just that Elomire, certainly as played by Jeremy Northam, never quite develops as a character and the second act needs more work on it. The production comes from the Really Useful Theatre Company directed by Richard Jones.</p>

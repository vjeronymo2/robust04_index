			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the 39th founding anniversary of the Lao  People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP] on 22 March, on behalf of  the Communist Party and people of Vietnam, we would like to  extend our fraternal and intimate goodwill and best wishes to  you, comrades, and multiethnic people.    Under the clear-sighted and talented leadership of the LPRP,  for the past 39 years, the multiethnic Lao people have held  aloft the spirit of patriotism, overcome numerous difficulties  and trials, and scored successive and important achievements in  national liberation, national defense, and national construction  and comprehensive restructuring. Laos' economic foundations  have made impressive advancement, while the living conditions of  the multiethnic people have improved. The political  stability of the country has been steadily maintained and the  national defense and public security maintenance work has been  further consolidated. As a result, the influence of the Lao  People's Democratic Republic has been further elevated in this  region and the world over. These successes have made noble  contributions to the common struggle for peace, independence,  democracy, and social progress of the world's people. The  Communist Party and people of Vietnam would like to extend our  wholehearted congratulations to the Lao people for having won  such glorious victories. For this exuberant celebration, we  hope that the Lao people will further expand their glorious  revolutionary traditions by uniting with one another to carry  out the comprehensive restructuring in accordance with the  resolution adopted at the Fifth LPRP Congress, thereby  fulfilling the task of building Laos with peace, independence,  democracy, unification, and prosperity. The Communist Party and  people of Vietnam are very proud and grateful to the LPRP and  multiethnic people for you, our intimate comrades, have always  stood side by side and wholeheartedly supported the Vietnamese  revolution.    May the relations of friendship, special solidarity, and  comprehensive cooperation between our two parties and peoples be  continuously and more effectively developed to conform to the  realities and capabilities of each country in the interests of  peace and development of our two countries and other countries  in the region and the world.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Dresdner, Daimler dividends highlight German contrasts Stark contrasts in the state of health of Germany's financial and industrial sectors were highlighted yesterday with the announcement of a 38 per cent cut in Daimler-Benz's dividend and a 12.5 per cent increase at Dresdner Bank. Daimler, the country's largest industrial concern, and parent to Mercedes-Benz, AEG and Deutsche Aerospace, blamed difficult business conditions and heavy restructuring costs for a decision to slash its pay-out from DM13 to DM8 (Dollars 4.66). The first reduction since the second world war was approved at a meeting of the management and supervisory boards yesterday, which also agreed to go ahead with a rights issue later this year to support growth plans. Details of 1993 earnings are due at a press conference next Tuesday. Dresdner Bank, second in size only to Deutsche Bank, will give details today on profits and its decision to raise its dividend from DM12 to DM13.50. Markets had been well-primed for Daimler's reduced payment since last autumn, when executives, hitherto optimistic about dividend prospects, had a change of heart. The change followed employee unrest caused by warnings that the job cutting programme was to be extended and Deutsche Aerospace was to close at least six German sites. Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, said at the time the company would try to avoid 'bitter disappointments' for shareholders, but added that employees could not be expected to be the only people to make sacrifices. Many analysts suggested a payment of DM10 would have been appropriate. Dresdner's dividend matched most expectations, which had hardened after Deutsche Bank last week reported a 16 per cent increase in operating profits after provisions for bad debts of more than DM3bn. Earnings rose despite what chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper described as 'quite a bad year' for the domestic business. Deutsche is the effective house bank to thousands of small and medium-sized companies which have been badly squeezed by recession. Dresdner, smaller, but less exposed to the industrial slump, is expected to show a relatively better result.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Drexel Blasts Regulators: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. accused thrift regulators  of inventing and exaggerating some of the government's $6.8 billion in damage  claims against the collapsed Wall Street firm.  </P> <P> In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, Drexel also accused the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp. and Resolution Trust Corp. of seeking to blame the  former junk-bond pioneer for the savings and loan industry collapse. The  agencies contended last month that Drexel contributed to the failure of more  than 40 thrifts by fraudulent sales of risky high-yield bonds. Drexel said the  regulators' actions were threatening to derail its bankruptcy reorganization  and jeopardize its negotiations with creditors.  </P></p>

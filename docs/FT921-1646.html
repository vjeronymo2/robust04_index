			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Clucas and the consumer SOME four years after the UK's Financial Services Act came fully into force, Sir Kenneth Clucas has recommended radical changes in the regulation of retail investment. His report suggests the merger of Fimbra and Lautro, the self-regulatory organisations representing independent advisers and company representatives, and comes only a week after the publication of the Securities and Investments Board's (SIB) own controversial plan to force life assurance companies to disclose more details of their costs to prospective buyers. The resignation of Mr Tim Miller from the board of Lautro is a reminder of the continuing tensions. Mr Miller, who is marketing director of the unit trust giant M &amp; G, was protesting at the loss of a battle over whether life companies should be able to project future returns on the basis of their actual own costs or of industry average costs. The SIB is content that life offices will have to disclose their own costs in a slightly different form. Haphazard historical development has given life companies big advantages over unit trust groups in terms of the ability to use high-pressure sales methods and to hide their true product costs. Endless complications have developed over the attempts to devise equivalent regulation of the two distinct sales channels used by life companies, direct sales forces and independent financial advisers (IFAs). Power balance IFAs have demanded equivalent privileges to avoid full or 'hard' commission disclosure, despite their claimed role as independent advisers to their clients. They were given their own regulatory body, but it has proved not to be financially viable. In deciding that it should be rolled up with Lautro, Sir Kenneth Clucas has added a proposal for maintaining an elaborate balance of power within the new agency to ensure that both salesmen and IFAs are fairly treated. But even so there is obvious scope for bitter internal arguments. The story of retail investment regulation is one of slow progress. The issue of independence has never been properly grasped: truly independent advisers who took their clients fully into their confidence would not need, or even want, to be treated like salesmen. But of course the latter have been greatly assisted by the opaque nature of most life products and marketing techniques. Now the SIB is at last insisting that a measure of disclosure of company-specific costs must be given to the client at the point of sale. This should ensure an eventual end to the scandal that some life products are successfully sold by sales forces even though the costs are up to three times the average; such policies represent very poor value to the consumer. Disclosure of high penalties for early surrender should also reduce the notorious tendency for life salesmen to oversell unsuitable products to clients who are unlikely to keep up the payments. Public interest But why is it all taking so long? The decision to rely mainly on practitioners to operate the regulatory system under the Financial Services Act always posed the problem of how the public interest could be properly represented. The SIB has chosen to seek some kind of a consensus, and has therefore found it hard to cope when heavy lobbying has been conducted by investment industry interests and the consumers' point of view has been less forcefully put. In wholesale markets, where the various interests tend to be better balanced, the problems do not appear to have been so deep-rooted, although again the general public interest may not get a proper hearing. With political change in the air there is again discussion of whether the UK needs a US-style SEC. This may be a red herring, and even the Labour party has stopped talking about purely statutory solutions. Yet over time, as the regulators gain in experience and self-confidence, it would be natural to expect the influence of the practitioners to fade away and the public interest, rather than convenient compromises, to be more consistently pursued.</p>

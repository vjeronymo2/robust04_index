			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Back to the Fifties for gilt-edged yardstick ONE of the oldest yardsticks of the gilt-edged market is on the threshold of a level not seen for nearly 40 years. The FT Government Securities Index, a basket of UK government bonds of various maturities, closed yesterday at 99.8, reflecting the recent strong rally in the gilt market. The index last touched 100 on April 15 1955, when Sir Anthony Eden was prime minister and Mr Rab Butler was chancellor. Based at 100 in 1926, it reached a high of 127.4 in January 1935 and plummeted to a low of 49.18 in January 1975, in an era when inflation exceeded 20 per cent. The fall in inflation and the decline in UK interest rates in the 1990s have prompted a strong rally in gilt prices. Base rates have fallen from 10 per cent to 6 per cent in the past year. Since the shake-up of the ERM, further cuts are expected, with Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, predicting that base rates could fall below 4 per cent by the end of the year. With the development of more specific gilt market indices, the Government Securities Index appears to have lost some of its following. The FT Actuaries All-Stocks index has become a more popular measure. One gilt-edged market-maker pointed out that the pension and life funds tend to measure the performance of their portfolios against gilt indices with specific maturity dates. Bonds, Page 24</p>

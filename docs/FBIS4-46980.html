			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch: "Chernobyl AES </F> Has to be Closed"]    [Text]Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, chairman of the last  session of parliament and a candidate for Ukrainian presidency,  met with various journalists, including Mykhaylo Prylutskyy,  editor-in-chief of ZELENYY SVIT.    The questions covered the entire gamut of problems in  Ukraine: politics, economics, state-building, industry,  agriculture, energy, market finances, banking, taxes, mafia, and  corruption. Obviously, the upcoming presidential elections  were also addressed.    ZELENYY SVIT, however, concentrated on Plyusch's response to  the following question:    The previous session of the parliament--under your  leadership--declared a moratorium on the construction of new  nuclear power reactors and passed a resolution advocating the  closing of the Chernobyl AES (CAES). A year later, still under  your leadership, the moratorium was lifted, the resolution  rescinded, and ongoing operation of CAES was allowed. The  "Greens" feel that this reversal was in response to pressure  from the nuclear lobby. How do you really feel about this  painful problem in view of the worldwide trend to curtail  expansion of nuclear power?    I would like to be better understood on this point and will  go somewhat back in history.    In 1975 I had just started working in the Kiev Obkom as  deputy of the Agricultural Department and was sent to Chernobyl  to attend a rayon party conference. Prypyat did not yet exist.  However, graphite components were already being installed at the  first reactor. By a circuitous route--since I was not on the  `approved' list--I managed to get inside and view the huge  constructions taking place.    Later I met Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov when he assumed  presidency of the USSR Academy of Sciences. I was charged with  escorting him by the first secretary when he visited Tarashcha  and Fastiv--the sites of his youth. He attempted to convince me  that other fuels will soon be obsolete and science will provide  us with such small reactors that you could use them for home  heating. Ten years later, ironically enough, ovens in villages  contaminated by radiation were called reactors.    At that time the Kharkiv and Odesa ATETs were in the  planning  stages: these were to be nuclear thermoelectric centers from  which hot water would be pumped directly to heat homes. What  could be more efficient?    And then the CAES accident! I was there on the first day and  rode in the same car with academician Valeriy Legasov, now  deceased, Mykola Shcherbyna, head of the Government Commission,  and Mykola Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the USSR Council of  Ministers.    We arrived in Chernobyl at five and the commission met at  seven. Legasov was one of the few nuclear experts who even at  that time--April 26--clearly said "I don't know how the ruined  reactor will behave tomorrow. Water is being discharged. Where  does it flow? I recommend immediate evacuation..."    Whatever you may hear, believe only this: evacuation was to  be implemented not to protect people from contamination with  radionuclides, but from the possibility of something far worse,  a nuclear explosion!    But who would approve an evacuation? It was Saturday and the  highest government official that Shcherbyna managed to reach was  Dolgikh. Gorbachev called back after ten from his car on his way  home from a theater. We left the room and Shcherbyna talked with  him one-on-one...    The Ukrainian government and Central Committee--objects of  so  much vituperation--had by this time sent 1200 buses to  Chernobyl, even though permission to evacuate had not been  granted. At eleven at night Shcherbyna informed us that a  decision would be made tomorrow at ten in the morning, April 27.    The commission was to meet at ten. I, as head of the Kiev  Executive Committee, met with the local officials at nine.  Shcherbyna learned that we discussed evacuation, ordered me to  appear before him and said: "Ivan, I alone am the head of the  commission and the rest of you are mere members." I had a lot of  explaining to do.    It was then that I began to understand the atom.    In Niagara Falls there is a gallery of the painter Vasyl  Kurylyk, a Canadian of Ukrainian descent. He was born to a farm  family who emigrated to Canada long before the Soviet revolution  and had nothing to do with bourgeois Ukrainian nationalism which  has been used to frighten us for such a long time. It took him a  long time to become an artist and the road was difficult. After  a serious illness he had a vision and began to create paintings  on religious themes and works on saving the earth from a nuclear  catastrophe.    As a villager I was struck by one of his paintings of a  cabbage patch in which the heads did not have a solitary leaf.  They looked like human skulls. In the distance on the left you  could discern the dome of a church, and on the right a rising  dome of a nuclear explosion.    When I asked the tour guide when it was painted I was  shocked  by the answer: 1971. That's when construction of CAES began!    Thinking about this painting convinced me that nuclear  energy  is a satanic force and humanity would be much better off without  it. But it is here ... it happened ...    Now we must deal with nuclear safety and energy needs. Many  economists hold that every country possesses enough energy  resources its needs. However, Ukrainian gas and oil were very  quickly expended on supplying the rest of the huge USSR. For  example, the Dashavskyy gas fields heated all of Leningrad. The  same happened with our oil which was wasted, although it could  have been used for production of goods much more valuable than  fuel. The operating philosophy was: Let's use up what you have  and then everyone for himself!    Ukraine still has large reserves of nuclear fuel and this,  unfortunately, provides a strong temptation to build more  nuclear reactors. Besides nuclear, Ukraine still has enough  other energy resources to meet fifty percent of its energy  needs. There are countries that can only meet four percent of  their needs from their own energy resources, but they haven't  gone nuclear.    Many energy experts don't seem to understand that nuclear  power is not cost effective, contrary to popular assertions.    One of the few that understood this reality was Vitaliy  Sklyarov, the former--regrettably--Ukrainian Minister of Energy.  While not in charge of CAES, he spent many of the most dangerous  days there and wrote "Chernobyl Tomorrow", an excellent book.  His economic analysis should cool off the fervent advocates of  the plutonium industry and nuclear weapons. He did not emigrate  nor acquire millions as his detractors asserted to undermine his  credibility.    If we want to put our nuclear house in order we must  immediately reinstate Sklyarov as Minister of Energy. He has an  extraordinary grasp of energy problems. If, on the contrary, we  create a closed loop of nuclear reactors Ukraine will be faced  with a tremendous economic burden.    We have to proceed on a parallel course: use nuclear energy  for the time being and develop alternative energy sources.    What is my attitude to the CAES? I spent 78 days there when  we needed to close it down and then restart it. I know many of  the staff and understand their collective psychology. CAES must  be closed down, but in a sensible manner that takes our current  energy situation into account.    CAES has to be shut down in cooperation with the European  community and all governmental bureaus have to be involved,  including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have to turn to  our neighbors for help. Chernobyl is a global catastrophe that  has to be managed jointly.    I addressed this issue at the UN conference on the  environment in Rio-de-Janeiro in 1992. The conference was  attended by representatives of 118 countries including such  figures as Bush, Mitterand, and Majors ... the best presentation  was given by Castro. Only Cuba, itself in dire straits, rendered  assistance in the health care of our children. No wonder we have  a saying "The poorer, the kinder!"    The European community forgot about Chernobyl very quickly.  But, as I told Mr. Marshall [sic], an English  parliamentarian--he is in charge of Chernobyl and had visited  there--you don't seem to realize that, as Sklyarov wrote,  Chernobyl "is and will be tomorrow's problem."    Mr. Marshall has recently become active in trying to  interest  the world community in our common problems.    I would prefer to avoid recriminations, but it needs to be  said that the attitude of MAGATE to Chernobyl and its  consequences lacks objectivity. They attempt to convince the  world that nothing very terrible happened at Chernobyl. At the  meeting in Strassbourg when the "Children of Chernobyl" program  was being reviewed, the MAGATE representative tried to convince  everyone that there is no medical evidence that it is dangerous  for children to live in Kiev. When I rose and said "There are 70  of you here. Who of you would like to live in Kiev with your  grandchildren?" everyone laughed but not a single hand went up.    Chernobyl, along with Donbas and Kryvbas, are like a yoke  around our neck and take up forty percent of the Ukrainian  budget. Even a rich country could not manage that, and yet we  are alone with our burden.    ZELENYY SVIT and I share many views, including the need to  shut down Chernobyl. But we must hurry at a rational, deliberate  pace and enlist international cooperation. Some of the so-called  Chernobyl social organizations--by their irresponsible  actions--have compromised the very idea of helping the victims  of the greatest nuclear disaster ever.    Chernobyl and pollution in Ukraine have moral and spiritual  connotations in addition to ecological ramifications. To the  extent that we are pure, healthy and strong in our national  spirit, the sooner we will overcome our trials.</p>

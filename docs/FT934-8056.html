			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marshalls rises 59% to top Pounds 10m THE SHARE price of Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group, jumped by more than 8 per cent to 118p yesterday, after the company announced better than expected half year profits. Pre-tax profits during the six months to the end of September rose by 59 per cent from Pounds 6.41m to Pounds 10.2m. Analysts forecasts had ranged from Pounds 7m to Pounds 9.5m. The rise in the share price was helped by optimistic comments from Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, about the trading outlook for building material sales. He said the latest 'results had been achieved within an economic climate that was gradually improving, particularly in housing.' This had been partially counterbalanced by a further decline in commercial construction.' The improvement in the housing market had enabled the company to raise prices for some of its bricks and concrete products. Group turnover in the first half rose by 10 per cent from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds 102.2m. The profits rise was also assisted by a reduction in interest charges from Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.09m. Earnings per share grew to 3.87p (1.85p) leaving an unchanged interim dividend of 1.25p, covered more than three times. The number of bricks sold by the group in the first half rose from 77m to 87m. This was due, said Mr Marshall, to the housing market improvement as well as the elimination of the surplus capacity in the brick industry. Prices of specialist engineering bricks had risen by about a fifth. The fall in the price of facing bricks had been stemmed and in one or two cases had even seen a small increase, he said. Operating profits in the brick division had risen from Pounds 515,000 to Pounds 1.3m. The concrete products division increased profits by 17.5 per cent from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8.9m. Prices for concrete products had become a little firmer over the summer, while volume sales had increased, particularly for concrete block paving which was winning market share from rival building materials. Costs across the group had also been reduced to improve profitability, said Mr Marshall. Analysts said yesterday that they were expecting pre-tax profits for the full year to rise to about Pounds 16m compared with Pounds 12.4m the previous year.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Meticulous journalist who scorned small minds: Obituary - Wolfgang Luetkenshd WOLFGANG LUETKENS, who died suddenly in London on Thursday night aged 69, was known to generations of colleagues on the Financial Times as a meticulous and learned journalist and a kind-hearted mentor and companion. German-born, but mostly English-educated, Wolf, as he was known to everyone, had an international background which served him well on a newspaper rapidly branching out into the European market. Appointed the paper's first full-time Bonn correspondent in 1958, after several years with Reuters news agency in the German capital, the objectivity and thoroughness which were the hallmarks of his German coverage are still remembered in both countries today. After more than 10 years as the FT's Bonn correspondent, he became in turn Foreign News Editor, Deputy Features Editor and Foreign Leader Writer, but he was always happiest reporting on foreign affairs. His Reuter training made him suspicious of articles which mixed reporting with comment, and he was the scourge of writers who split infinitives or took liberties with the precise meaning of words. No one was more rigorous than Wolf, who became the paper's foremost authority on grammar and spelling. How many times did the sight of the approaching dapper figure in a bow tie send his colleagues scampering for their dictionaries and encyclopaedias. Wolf was usually right and any touch of pedantry easily forgiven because it was never malicious. In the years following his retirement in 1987, Wolf was still writing letters to news editors on spelling and headline errors and was regularly asked his advice on the FT's style-book. His most admirable quality, however, was that he abhorred flannel and pretentiousness. Wolf was always particularly scathing about judgments based on a lack of knowledge or conventional wisdom, such as blanket condemnations of Germany, long after the end of the Second World War. Discussions at leader conferences sometimes left him sighing heavily at some of the things he heard. 'One must never forget that small minds also think alike,' was one typical and memorable comment. His intellectual rigour and moral rectitude were inherited from his parents and his impish, and sometimes eccentric humour, one suspects, from his English upbringing. Mr Luetkens senior was a German diplomat based in Bucharest, married to a German Jewish sociologist, when Hitler came to power in 1933. Showing unusual courage, Luetkens senior retired from the foreign service in protest shortly afterwards and brought his wife and son to England. The teenage Wolf, after having gone to the German school in Milan and being taught privately in Latvia and Romania, was then sent first to the Leys school in Cambridge and later to Brasenose College, Oxford. He certainly had a warm, if critical, affection for England and for Wimbledon, where he and his wife Martina made their home. He also developed a close relationship with three other countries - Austria, his wife's birthplace, Canada and Switzerland - on which he became the newspaper's principal expert in the last years of his career and where he frequently went to write surveys. His greatest loyalty, however, apart from his deep attachment to his family, was undoubtedly to the Financial Times, as illustrated by his insistence that he should write a leader on Austria after suffering a heart attack in Canada. The editorial was written while Wolf was waiting for a by-pass operation in a hospital bed and duly published. Wolf Luetkens was born in Berlin on June 9, 1922 and died in Wimbledon on January 23, 1992. He was awarded the Verdienstkreuz first class by the German Federal Republic and the Knight's Cross first class by the Austrian Republic. He is survived by his wife, Martina, and daughters, Jane and Iris.</p>

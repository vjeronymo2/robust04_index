			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A JUST CAUSE IS NOT ENOUGH;  </P> <P> TIBETANS LACK KEY ADVANTAGES OF THE INTIFADA  </P> <P> During past years when Tibetans were imprudent enough to hurl themselves  against their Chinese occupiers, generating little notice abroad and even less  support, I was sure that an important lesson for us all lay buried in their  futile efforts. Yet it was only last month when the Tibetans began to once  again challenge the Chinese -- using, as they had before, simple stones -- that  I finally realized just what that lesson is. It is that, in this world, not all  intifadas are created equal.  </P> <P> It was, of course, the Palestinian intifada aimed at Israel that made this  realization possible. I suppose I should have had a hint of it a year ago  March, when the Tibetan intifada last flared up and the Palestinian one was  already 10 weeks old. But at the time the Palestinian uprising hadn't yet  achieved the success that it subsequently did, a success that enables it, a  year later, to teach us so much about the Tibetan intifada in particular and  all intifadas in general.  </P> <P> And what a success the Palestinian intifada has been. In just 16 months it has  reset the geopolitics of the Middle East. It has overturned diplomatic agendas  in every world capital. It has mobilized public opinion, in the United States  and elsewhere, in favor of its goals. It has thrown the Israeli people into  spasms of existential dread and agonies of moral turmoil. It has turned the  once-fearsome Israeli army into a frustrated and ineffective police force. And  it has revived the hopes of Palestinians, both those under Israeli occupation  and those living in other places, that they will some day realize part, or even  all, of their decades-old national dream.  </P> <P> This enormous success can be attributed primarily to three reasons. Most of all  it's due to the powerful images of violent resistance and military response  that burned themselves nightly and relentlessly into the consciousness and  memories of television-watchers everywhere, both ordinary citizens and  government officials. These images, captured by battalions of cameramen and  described by legions of reporters, were displayed in excruciating and  compelling detail -- detail that, in its repetitive, exquisite, prolonged and  ferocious focus, turned individual instances of wounding and killing, and  occasional episodes of brutality, into an endless landscape of large-scale  murder and crushed bones.  </P> <P> Another reason for the success of the Palestinian intifada was the widespread  support it received, not only from fellow Palestinians outside the occupied  territories and fellow Arabs, but also from nations long sympathetic to the  Palestinian cause (notably the East Bloc and the Third World) as well as those  (Japan and Western Europe) whose economic needs in the Middle East have long  influenced their diplomatic preferences.  </P> <P> Finally, the Palestinian intifada has been successful because the power against  which it has focused itself operates under self-imposed restraints. Israel has  not been prepared to do what other powers have done in response to similar  challenges. Israel, however imperfectly, has engaged in riot-control, not war  and extermination. The Palestinians know that they face a nation that is  affected by its own traditions of justice and compassion. Or consider the case  of the British in India. Had Gandhi attempted to wrest independence from, say,  the Soviet Union or China, or even from many of the other European powers, he  would have had to suffer a far larger number of deaths in his intifada and  struggle many more years.  </P> <P> None of these characteristics that have made the Palestinian intifada a success  have been present in the Tibetan intifada. The Chinese have made sure there  would be few witnesses to the uprising, or their response to it. They banished  not only reporters and cameras, but also tourists. The Tibetans have no outside  supporters who count; the U.S. State Department, for its part, reacted to the  news of the latest riots by reassuring the Chinese that it saw Tibet as forever  belonging to China and by stressing the importance of addressing "the  legitimate concerns of the inhabitants of Tibet," not the legitimate rights of  the Tibetan people. And the Chinese, for their part, have exercised few  restraints in their responses to Tibetan rioters. For them the strategic value  of Tibet is, by itself, more than enough justification for the total absorption  of that country and for China's settling of its own population there.  </P> <P> For the Chinese, therefore, calls for Tibetan independence are treasonous acts  of insurrection, and street riots justify all the mass killings that may be  necessary to end them. It's not hard to understand why the Tibetan intifada has  failed so consistently and why it will no doubt continue to fail.  </P> <P> But the Tibetan intifada isn't the only one doomed to fail. Others, too, lack  several or all of the qualities necessary for success. The several intifadas  now simmering in the Soviet Union -- the Armenian one, the Estonian one, the  Latvian one, the Lithuanian one, the Georgian one, the burgeoning Ukrainian one  -- may have greater access to cameras and reporters than they would have had in  the decades before glasnost. But that access is still a limited one. Should  these areas erupt, outside support would be even weaker than it was for the  East German, Polish, Hungarian and Czech intifadas that took place during the  1950s and '60s. And they would be suppressed no less brutally, quickly,  efficiently.  </P> <P> And in many corners of the world, there are other intifadas that are likely,  for various combinations of the same reasons, to fail just as surely -- the  Tamils in Sri Lanka, for example, the Sikhs in the Punjab, and that oldest and  bloodiest intifada of them all, the Kurds, whose unhappy fate it is to attempt  in obscurity, and without any reliable supporters, to wrest a homeland not from  one brutal power but from three or four.  </P> <P> All of these failed and failing intifadas -- like the many that have failed in  history, including our own American Indian intifada, are unable to achieve  success, but not because they are carried out in the name of a cause that is  any less just than that of a successful intifada. They fail because of the  nature of the circumstances in which they are pursued and the nature of their  occupying enemy.  </P> <P> Clearly, any people that feels its land is occupied by another people or power  would be wise to refrain from launching an intifada unless it can use the mass  media to transmit and magnify its message, unless it can be sure to have  outside friends ready to express their support in diplomatic if not military  terms and unless it is occupied by an enemy that, like Israel, lacks the  stomach to respond to it totally and ruthlessly. Unfortunately for Tibet, a  just cause is never enough.  </P></p>

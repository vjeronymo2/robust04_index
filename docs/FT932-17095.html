			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row erupts over further 5,000 Navy job losses A POLITICAL row erupted at Westminster last night over the disclosure that the Royal Navy will be cut by 5,000 more personnel than originally planned in the Options for Change defence review. Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, said in a written reply that the further cut of 5,000 would be partly achieved through redundancies of about 2,300 next yearbut precise numbers and details had yet to be determined. 'We will be encouraging the maximum number of volunteers, although some compulsory measures may be needed in order to achieve the proper balance of manpower within the Royal Navy,' he said. The Ministry of Defence said last night that the further cuts were now 'unavoidable' as part of a continuing review of numbers beyond the review, which is due to be completed by the middle of the 1990s. Opposition politicians reacted angrily to the announcement. Dr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, said: 'It is disgraceful that the government has sneaked out these figures in the fag-end of parliament. 'This form of crisis management actually threatens our defence capability. What we really need is not a salami-cut approach to defence but a full-scale defence review so we can see what is needed to defend British interests and we can make provisions for that.' Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: 'The defence policies of this government are now in tatters. 'Cuts are being made without rhyme or reason. The only motive is to save money to meet Treasury targets.' He called for a full-scale defence review 'before Britain becomes a defence laughing stock'. The MoD said Options for Change, announced in 1991, envisaged two or three phases of redundancy to reduce total numbers from 63,000 to 55,000 by the mid-1990s. Mr Hamilton said that the third phase of redundancies had been 'foreshadowed' last year and he was simply confirming it. The MoD added that the 2,300 redundancies announced last night were needed because the cut to 50,000 could not be achieved wholly through natural wastage, reduced recruitment and other measures to control numbers.</p>

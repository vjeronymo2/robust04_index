			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Coming to Grips With Challenges"] </F>   [Text] The prime minister's remarks to Egyptian media  representatives, in Amman to report on the proceedings of the  Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee, is significant in  more ways than one. The prime minister's statements addressed  his Egyptian counterpart's visit to Jordan and the higher  committee's work. Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali also noted the  high regard in which Jordan holds its political relations and  coordination with Egypt at this sensitive stage.    Jordan has consistently exerted itself on behalf of  revitalizing Arab solidarity and common Arab action. Hence the  prime minister's observation that while the Arab world is going  through a delicate stage and a rapid succession of developments,  certain Arab parties handle their differences as if they do not  appreciate the gravity of the situation. There has been an  absence of real attempts to smooth over Arab differences so as  to take account of global changes from a pan-Arab outlook and  tackle the challenges facing the Arab nation.    Unless they get their act together and iron out their  differences, the Arabs will be made to stomach a regional order  under the new world order that will shape their lives for many  years to come. In order for the Arabs to avert such a  likelihood, the prime minister suggested that they approach  their differences as if they were debts to be rescheduled over,  say, a 10-year period with a three-year grace period, during  which time the parties pause to think over these differences.    Jordan appreciates the critical circumstances the Arab world  is experiencing and is equally aware of the political and  economic implications of these circumstances. Jordan knows full  well that if the Arabs intend to advance their interests and  ward off dangers, they have to close ranks and revert to  effective action based on new and clear rules that respond to  ongoing and rapid changes sweeping the world. To quote the  prime minister, there is no place for spectators under the new  world order, in which the Arabs have to play an active and  effectual role.</p>

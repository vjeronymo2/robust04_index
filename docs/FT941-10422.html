			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Non-defence business grows at Lockheed Lockheed, the US aerospace group, said its non-defence businesses grew to 36 per cent of its total sales in 1993, up from 33 per cent in 1992, Reuter reports. Sales to foreign countries for the year ended December 26 1993 rose to 13 per cent of the total, against 8 per cent a year earlier. In the fourth quarter, the defence industry group earned Dollars 135m, or Dollars 2.13 share, on sales of Dollars 3.7bn, compared with net income of Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.95 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.9bn. Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive, said: '1993 was an outstanding year for Lockheed. We had a solid increase in earnings, generated substantial cash flow and significantly reduced outstanding debt.' He added: 'Our strong cash flow and rapidly improving debt position give us the flexibility to explore other means to enhance shareholder value, including strategically and financially attractive acquisitions.' He said the company reduced its outstanding debt in 1993 by Dollars 400m and by the year-end, its net debt to capital ratio was 42 per cent, against 46 per cent in the first quarter. In 1993, Lockheed acquired Lockheed Forth Worth to heighten its position in the military aircraft market. The acquisition was a primary factor in year-over-year sales and earnings growth, Lockheed said. 'With a firm backlog of nearly 600 F-16 tactical fighter aircraft, the Forth Worth company will continue to have a very positive influence on our future earnings and cash flow,' Mr Tellep said. At the year-end, total order backlog was Dollars 28.9bn, nearly 50 per cent over the Dollars 19.4bn backlog at the end of 1992. In the full-year, the group recorded net profit of Dollars 422m, or Dollars 6.70 a share. This compares with a loss of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 4.58, for 1992 after a one-time accounting charge. Excluding the charge, there would have been a net profit of Dollars 348m, or Dollars 5.65 a share, for 1992.</p>

According to the BELINFORM  information, the results of the voting may be announced at  03.30, local time. Three candidates are on the list: Myachyslaw  Hryb, Mikhail Marynych and Viktar Hanchar.    Myachyslaw Hryb, 57, a professional lawyer, from a peasant  family. His father was killed during the war. Hryb finished the  Interior Ministry school and later reached the rank of general  and the post of head of the Interior Ministry department at the  executive committee of the regional council (soviet) of the  Vitebsk region. He has been a deputy of the Belarusian  parliament since 1990. Hryb is heading the Permanent Commission  for National Security, Defence and Anti-Crime Struggle. He is  the supporter of strong power, of the introduction of executive  Presidency in Belarus and of the ratification of the collective  security treaty. He maintains that, when discharging his duties  in parliament, he tries not to be guided by political likes and  dislikes, but to be businesslike and objective. "We have all  come from the past, but we should look forward," he said.    Mikhail Marynych, 53, was born in the Gomel region,  graduated  from the Belarusian Polytechnical Institute. He worked his way  up from the job of a plumber to the post of Minsk mayor. At  present he is deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign  Economic Relations. He is a centrist by his political views.  Marynych favours the consolidation of forces for getting the  national economy out of the crisis and for reforming it.    Viktor Hanchar, 36, is the youngest of the candidates. He is  a professional lawyer and an assistant professor. He worked for  a long time at the Institute of National Economy (now it is the  Belarusian Economic Academy) and became popular thanks to his  active stand in parliament, brief and clear statements. He is  often called Belarusian Sobchak. Hanchar is an active supporter  of a market-based economy, of attracting a new generation of  leaders for managing the state and the national economy, who are  not burdened with the stereotyped notions typical of the past.  During the past several years he has been a deputy mayor of the  city of Molodechno. Many specialists, including foreign ones,  believe that Molodechno has made an impressive headway in the  creation of a market-based economy.</p>

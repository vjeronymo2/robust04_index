			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "G.B.": "Bundesbank Against Short-Term Public </F> Borrowing"]    [Text] In its recent meeting, the German Bundesbank's  Central Bank Council agreed to continue to reject short-term  public borrowing. If the state were to incur sizable short-term  debts, it would make the Bundesbank's policy of stability more  difficult, Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said  in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Conversely, many  large commercial banks in Germany would like to see the Federal  Government issue short-term securities.    Legally, the Bundesbank is not able to prohibit the Federal  Government or other public entities borrowing short-term money  by issuing tradable securities. Nevertheless, it can be  expected that the Bundesbank's voice is heard in Bonn. So far,  the Federal Government borrows money mainly through the emission  of medium- and long-term securities and bonds quoted on the  stock exchange. Federal one- or two-year financing treasury  bonds have existed for many years, but these papers have not  been quoted on the stock exchange and, compared with the major  bonds, they are rather insignificant.    Yet, in many other countries the state borrows money also  through the emission of short-term securities, for example in  the United States, France, or Italy. Particularly popular  instruments are standardized, and thus tradable, Treasury bills  with maturities between three and twelve months. In the past  few years, this form of federal financing, for mere cost  reasons, did not constitute an alternative, since short-term  interests were quite often significantly superior to long-term  rates (inverse interest structure). Yet, this is currently  changing, which is why issuing short-term securities might soon  become more attractive. Some time ago, the Federal Government  created the legal conditions for major short-term borrowing, but  has not issued such papers so far.    The Bundesbank's reservations have to be seen from the angle  of monetary policy. If one were to use the money market for  financing state spending, one would narrow the Bundesbank's room  to maneuver on the money market, Gaddum said. Yet, the  Bundesbank must continue to be able to operate more or less  freely on the money market. The Bundesbank obviously suspects  that it might be maneuvered into situations in which it might no  longer be able to decide on a major increase of the prime rate  at the time it wants to, because this would conflict with the  emission of short-term state papers intended for the same time  or temporarily mess up an existing market for short-term papers.  Such cases were reported from other countries in the past.    In Gaddum's view, short-term borrowing is not only a  disadvantage, but even unnecessary. The old principle that  long-term investment spending should also be financed with  long-term money is, after all, not wrong. Moreover, Gaddum  regards it as evidence for the confidence in the stability of a  currency when long-term spending can be financed through  long-term borrowing.    Should the Federal Government respect the Bundesbank's wish  and do without issuing short-term securities, banking circles  believe that this would be a severe blow for the new three-month  interest rate future (Fibor-Future) at the German Options and  Financial Futures Exchange. At the moment, there are only few  short-term tradable financial products that might serve as the  basis for three-month futures. These include short-term  Bundesbank papers (Bulis) and the so-called "Commercial Papers"  (CP), which are mainly emitted by private enterprises. The  hopes of many bank managers have so far been based on the  federal authorities, which were expected to issue short-term  Treasury bills in large amounts. These Treasury bills should  constitute the most important basis for transactions with the  Fibor-Future.    If the state were to do without the emission of short-term  papers, it would, in the future, probably also affect  transactions with money market funds. These are funds that  invest their money mainly in shorts. While money market funds  are quite popular in some countries, the Bundesbank's opposition  has so far stopped the Federal Government from admitting German  mark monetary funds in Germany.    At the moment there are, however, efforts made in Brussels  to  permit money market funds in all European Union member  countries. It may well be that the German law-makers will one  day submit to this desire. In other countries, these funds are  usually investing strongly in short-term state papers. Should  these not be available in Germany, the investment possibilities  of the money market funds would then no longer be legally,  although economically, limited. One can assume that such a  situation would quite suit the Bundesbank.</p>

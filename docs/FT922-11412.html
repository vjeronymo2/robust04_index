			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why widows need watchdogs - Casebook BUILDING societies are still getting away with the old trick of cutting interest rates on their accounts without telling customers - in spite of a welter of bad publicity last year, including a judgment by the building societies ombudsman against the Nationwide Anglia. But when money has been left in an account in trust, often for a widow, the trick is easy to accomplish and rates of interest paid can be very low. Solicitors administering these trusts need to look for income, so they prefer accounts which pay interest monthly. This restricts choice. Even though money deposited in this form must be very much a 'safe earner' for the societies, they still do not rush to make sure that their elderly clients are receiving the best interest available for their requirements. For example, one solicitor conducted a review of the trust funds he administered, and found the following rates of interest were being offered: 1.69 per cent on Pounds 3,000, by Abbey National; 1.73 per cent on Pounds 2,000, by Alliance &amp; Leicester; 2.475 per cent on Pounds 3,000 by Birminham Midshires; 2.25 per cent on Pounds 500 by Halifax; 2.25 per cent on Pounds 3,000 by Portman; 2.63 per cent on Pounds 5,000 by Woolwich; 3.75 per cent on Pounds 500 by Nationwide Anglia; and 4.43 per cent on Pounds 5,000 by Bristol &amp; West. When prompted, the societies were able to offer some improvement. The solicitor said: 'In every case, the society was able to recommend another of their accounts giving better rates of interest but usually these provided for annual income only - which I feel is not appropriate for trusts where there is a life tenant entitled to the income - or periods of notice of two or three months unless minimum balances of Pounds 5,000 or Pounds 10,000 were maintained.' The best compromise seems to be the 'High 30' account offered by Bristol &amp; West, which currently pays a gross 8.51 per cent annual rate on balances of more than Pounds 500, but requires 30-day notice. Market Harborough offers a similar account with interest of 8.05 per cent. This is apparently the most suitable account for widows holding trust funds at present. Otherwise, building societies dislike the costs of administration for such small sums, and most of the options available come in the form of 'current accounts' which are not suitable for saving. According to Blay's Guides, the top rates for monthly interest with immediate access are 7.95 per cent from Woolwich, 7.72 per cent from Bristol &amp; West, 7.44 per cent from Swansea, and 5.85 per cent from Coventry. It might not seem that difficult for a society to provide extra flexibility for elderly widows, who often find the income from these small accounts invaluable. But perhaps they are more interested in an easy way of making a profit . . .</p>

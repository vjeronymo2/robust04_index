			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. REINVENTS THE DELI;  </P> <P> NEW YORK'S CARNEGIE MARCHES INTO TOWN IN WHAT IS BECOMING A BIG PARADE  </P> <P> "I'm running out of product," said manager Steve Romick, standing at the door  looking miserable as he turned people away. "We're going to have to close  early."  </P> <P> Thus ended the first night of the first day of the most hyped deli in history.  They were low on food, low on drinks, low on energy.  </P> <P> Nobody had quite expected it to be like that. When the management opened the  doors at 7 a.m. there were people waiting; at 7 p.m. there were still people  waiting. By that time 2,000 people had walked through the door and the  management had stopped counting heads.  </P> <P> "I've opened a lot of restaurants," designer Pat Kuleto had said at the gala  star-studded official opening a week earlier (the restaurant remained closed to  the public), "but I've never seen anything like this. It's the Batman of  Delis."  </P> <P> The analogy is apt; the Carnegie opened  </P> <P> as if it were a movie, not a restaurant. The opening party had lights, carpets,  columnists (Army Archerd was there from Variety, officially "chatting" with the  incoming celebrities -- of which there were dozens). The pre-opening hoopla was  even more intense: Two years before the actual opening the columns were filled  with items about the coming of New York's most famous deli to Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> It's no more than you'd expect when Hollywood's richest man decides that deli  is his dish. And deli is definitely Marvin Davis' dish: he had a standing order  at Century City's Stage Deli for half a pound of Nova Scotia salmon, 6 bagels,  a pint of cream cheese and 4 bags of potato chips to be delivered to his office  every morning at 7 a.m. The order was canceled the day that the Carnegie  opened, for Davis had only been making do. His real love was New York's  Carnegie, where he was known to spend a thousand dollars at one crack. Davis  finally got tired of schlepping deli from New York and decided it was time for  the deli to come to him. He struck a deal with the Carnegie, insisting that all  he wanted was the best deli in the West. What he ended up with, however, was  something more.  </P> <P> "It's like a new breed of restaurant," said Kuleto, "an upscale deli." The  hiring of Kuleto is a case in point: he is one of the world's most famous  restaurant designers. He's done dozens of restaurants (including Postrio and  Fog City Diner in San Francisco), and is now designing restaurants in Paris,  Tokyo and Washington, D.C. But here he is designing a deli.  </P> <P> Delis, by their very nature, don't get designed. Delis are the people's  restaurant, an all-American invention where the portions are big, the prices  are fair and nobody cares what you're wearing. The late Leo Steiner, the man  who made New York's Carnegie famous, thought that the deli had become the  quintessential American restaurant. "It's not ethnic anymore," he said, "who  doesn't know chopped liver?"  </P> <P> Delis are supposed to be loud. Delis are supposed to be grubby. Delis are  supposed to have stand-up comics sitting  </P> <P> at a table in the corner and stand-up comics standing by your table, bringing  you food and making your life miserable. Delis are supposed to leave you  staggeringly full. But Delis are not supposed to have designers.  </P> <P> Take New York's Carnegie. It is an unpretty places where you sit jowl to elbow  with a neighboring stranger and wait for your plate to come and improve the  view. Katz's on the Lower East Side has all the charm of an Army commissary,  where you come in, take a ticket and listen to rude countermen bark if they  don't think you're ordering with sufficient speed. Even their slogan -- "Send a  salami to your boy in the Army" is military. While West Coast delis may have  softer edges, even at their spiffiest they have all the charm of oversized  coffee shops.  </P> <P> But the Beverly Hills Carnegie is different. "This," said Kuleto, "is supposed  to be reminiscent of what all delis should have been." So Kuleto created a  fantasy. He pointed around the front room, with its hanging Deco lights and  wooden booths.  </P> <P> "Imagine that this front room was the original deli that was built in the  '20s."  </P> <P> It's easier to imagine that this was a set for a movie about a deli built in  the '20s by somebody who had never been outside the State of California. "The  second room was built after Prohibition in the '40s." This room, you  understand, is the one with the bar. The bar? "And the last room was added  later because the deli was so popular." Here you'll find cozy padded booths,  which is enough to make any Deli maven immediately suspicious. Delis aren't  supposed to be comfortable. "The idea," Kuleto concluded, "was to make the  place feel real."  </P> <P> As real as anything in Hollywood. This, after all, is a deli where the comics  sit not at the tables but on the board of directors. George Burns is chairman  of the board. Milton Berle, who admits that he is "not a big deli man," owns a  piece of the action (2%).  </P> <P> And where but Hollywood would you find a deli with a bar? A deli with valets  waiting to whisk your car away? A  </P> <P> deli whose rent is a reported $27,000 a month? A deli with waiters who look  like they are trying out for parts as Rob Lowe's understudy? A deli that  proudly offers pastrami on white with lettuce, tomato and mayo? A deli that  lets you -- God forbid -- make your own egg creams at the table? And what's  that on the table -- Dijon mustard? Leo Steiner would not have approved. There  is much here, however, that Steiner would be proud of. The size of the  portions, for example. It was Steiner who said, "We got so much here in this  country. Why should we give a person a little bit of food? Are we a starving  Third World nation?"  </P> <P> Rest in peace, Leo. Each sandwich at the new Carnegie is a minor mountain and a  monument to excess. The pastrami comes from New York (most of it from the  Carnegie itself, with back up from Brooklyn Provisions). The cheesecake comes  from the Carnegie (although not, regretably, the Ruglach cheesecake variation).  The novi (deli parlance for smoked Nova Scotia salmon) and the sable are smooth  and soft; the cole slaw is wonderful.  </P> <P> And why not, with Bobbie Trager in charge? Trager, who had been general manager  of New York's Carnegie for seven years, grew up in delis. His grandfather owned  New York's legendary Murray's Sturgeon Shop. He's come to California ("there  are more New Yorkers here than in New York anyway") to manage the new Carnegie,  and he probably knows as much about what a deli should be as anybody around.  </P> <P> Trager defends the pastrami on white. "I called it the Mia Farrow because I  remembered that's what she used to order when she came in. What can I say?"  What Trager can say -- is that he finds some other California tastes very  strange. "People here are very health conscious. I've never sold so many egg  whites; Matzo brei with egg white really blew me away. And I hope there are  enough turkeys in America for us to cook. This is different."  </P> <P> This deli may be different -- but it is only the beginning. Malibu is about to  have a new deli of its own. Like the Beverly Hills Carnegie, it is the  brainchild of a rich man, Paul Zimmerman, who "just wanted to have good deli  food in my own neighborhood." What's on the menu? According to the press  release, the Malibu Deli in the Cross Creek Center will feature, in addition to  your usual pastrami and egg creams, "a California-style gourmet deli menu."  This will include "a large array of salads and light dishes recommended by the  Heart Association and Pritikin Longevity Center." A deli for dieters? Only in  L.A.  </P> <P> But wait, there's more to come. Next March Citrus' Michel Richard, Bruce Marder  of West Beach Cafe, DC 3 and Rebecca's and investor Marvin Zeidler will open  yet another deli -- one that promises to redefine L.A. deli for all time. It  will be a vast architect-designed space (larger than the Carnegie), where they  will cure their own corned beef, smoke their own pastrami, pickle their own  vegetables. They plan to bake their own bread -- in a wood burning oven, no  less -- and have chickens and turkeys turning on a rosticceria. And that's not  all.  </P> <P> There will be a soda fountain and a wine store. There will be outdoor seating.  The bar will serve cappuccino and croissants in the morning, beer and sausages  at lunch, hard stuff in the evening. The kitchen will be open, the cases filled  with salads. And wait until you taste the cheesecake.  </P> <P> But there is even more on the local deli horizon. When the Eureka Brewery opens  at the end of the year it will have a restaurant designed by Barbara Lazaroff.  And what will it be serving? International deli food by Wolfgang Puck (who is  already making his own salami in anticipation).  </P> <P> The deli may have been born in New York, but right now it's being bred in Los  Angeles. It may never be the same. This American institution is replacing the  cafe, for Los Angeles is reinventing the deli and claiming it as its own.  </P> <P>  The Carnegie Deli, 300 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 276-DELI. Open  daily. Hours at the moment are 7 a.m.-8 p.m. No alcohol (liquor license is  pending). Valet parking in the evening. All major credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

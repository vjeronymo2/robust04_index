"Unfortunately, neither the strategy nor the tactics of the  Ukrainian military leadership are changing. Russia is being  systematically squeezed from the Black Sea region. Now Kiev has  waited for the Ashgabat agreements to be adopted and `gone on  the attack' on engineering establishments of the Black Sea Fleet.    "This action itself had no significance -- either militarily  or politically. The installations would have been voluntarily  transferred to Ukraine by the Black Sea Fleet in January 1994.  Someone in the Ukrainian military evidently wanted to assert  his own personal importance and to prove his 'devotion' to the  republic's political leadership.    "Russian sailors have no intention of `taking' their  installations back from the Ukrainian military. Let them use  them. But I believe that these will `count against' Ukraine  when the new documents on the Black Sea Fleet are signed."</p>

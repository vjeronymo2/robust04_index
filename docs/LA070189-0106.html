			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS TRY TO SAVE COFFEE PRICES PACT  </P> <P> An international agreement that stabilizes world coffee prices could fall apart  at last ditch talks Monday, leaving the commodity at the mercy of a free market  in which prices are likely to tumble.  </P> <P> Low prices would squeeze debt-laden Third World producers but might eventually  mean a cut in supermarket prices for coffee drinkers, traders said.  </P> <P> More than a year of negotiations have failed to bridge a wide gulf between  Brazil, the biggest producer, and the United States, the largest consumer, over  how to continue a price support pact that regulates 90% of world coffee trade.  </P> <P> At the heart of the dispute is how to stop producers from dumping coffee at  cheap prices in countries outside the 74-nation pact.  </P> <P> Talks Monday at the International Coffee Organization, or ICO, in London  represent a last-ditch attempt to rescue the accord, which expires in  September. The last round of talks collapsed earlier in June.  </P></p>

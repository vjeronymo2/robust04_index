			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: A slice of faith in the Chinese bureaucracy - The first state enterprise in which Beijing has allowed foreigners to own shares FOR the past decade, China has had its door open to foreign investors. Last month, that door opened a little wider when, for the first time since the communists took power in 1949, the authorities allowed foreigners to own and trade shares in a Chinese company. That company, Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company, makes television tubes for the domestic television industry. Shanghai Vacuum is not a company in the way a westerner might use or understand the term. Its origins date back to 1917, but the company today is the result of a six-way merger in 1987, which brought together much of Shanghai's TV tube-making capacity. The closest analogy might be with British Coal in the heyday of nationalisation, but that, too, fails to capture the company/state relationship that still exists in China today. Although foreign investors have bought a slice of a 'company' called Shanghai Vacuum, what they have really acquired is a slice of faith in China's bureaucrats. The management of TV production in Shanghai is split between those who operate the company's factories and the Shanghai Instrumentation and Electronic Industry Bureau. It is responsible for determining production capacities, output and marketing strategies of the companies it supervises, one of which is Shanghai Vacuum. Administratively, the bureau is a division of the Shanghai Economic Commission, which in turn reports to the city's municipal government. The bureau also has a direct report ing relationship with the Ministry of Electronics Industry in Beijing on technical matters and receives market information from the ministry. China is the country which invented and refined bureaucratic government. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that a by-product of this today is intense competition between bureaucrats. Selling TVs in China is a curious mixture of co-operation and competition between regional governments, which Beijing presides over with either apparent detachment or just plain impotence. Mr Rolf Gerber, managing director of SBCI Finance Asia, who wrote the company's prospectus, found out about the bureau's existence through a conversation with executives of Shanghai Vacuum. At a five- hour dinner at the end of last year he met the bureau's director who told him how the system worked. The bureau consists of 10 industry sectors and supervises 176 state enterprises and eight research institutes. It competes with other regional bureaux in China and the companies under their supervision in terms of products, turnover, market share and quality. The Shanghai bureau ranks first in China in terms of sales and production. Last year, its companies turned over Yn7bn (Dollars 1.27bn) and produced output with a value of Yn8.5bn. The bureau keeps in close touch with the products its companies make. It has an in-house research capacity, meets regularly with whole-salers and retailers, and has access to its companies' market research departments. The bureau not only knows a great deal about the TV market but it also knows how to sell TVs, which it does throughout China. Its sales force is supported by a computer-linked system with wholesalers and significant retailers. It also operates a nation-wide service network. While the bureau practices free trade in China it is decidedly mercantilist in Shanghai. It claims 100 per cent of the Shanghai market for itself by virtue of a municipal regulation which requires all TVs in Shanghai to contain Shanghai Vacuum's tubes and be built by Shanghai-based assemblers. This makes Shanghai Vacuum the closest thing to a one-way bet on just about any stock exchange in the world. It has guaranteed customers for its output at prices over which it has a fair degree of control. But what does Shanghai Vacuum look like to a western accountant? Arthur Andersen, the US firm of accountants, had to wade through acres of Chinese financial statements and attempt to reconcile their data with accepted western accounting standards. For example, mainland Chinese companies do not consolidate their accounts; they do not make provisions for bad or doubtful debts; they do not account for exchange rate fluctuations; and use depreciation schedules ranging from 30 to 50 years for plant and machinery. The accountants were unable to provide a source and application of funds statement because, as the Shanghai government accountant said: 'Normal banking practices in China are that many of the company's borrowings do not have fixed maturities or repayment schedules.' Mainland companies' business practices would send most western companies into receivership. Shanghai Vacuum's standard terms of sale provide for payment within three to nine months after delivery. Even then, retailer are loathe to pay their bills. At the end of September, the company's accounts receivable stood at Yn137m. As the prospectus observes: 'This has been caused by state-owned retailers, which are under the direct control of the Bureau of Commerce, are delaying payment to the TV set manufacturers, using the cash-flow to expand their own businesses.' By taking foreign capital Shanghai Vacuum is able to redefine itself as a 'joint venture' company for Chinese tax purposes. It is also relocating its corporate headquarters to the Pudong district of the city which has been designated for special treatment. The upshot of these developments is that the company's tax rate will fall from 55 per cent to 15 per cent. The change in status will also allow the company to pay its employees more and change the basis upon which it employs them from the current cradle-to-grave terms and conditions to fixed-term contracts. Theoretically, the move should allow it to shed surplus labour and improve productivity. There is a need for rationalisation. With a workforce of more than 15,000, Shanghai Vacuum made an estimated loss of Yn89m last year. But the jewel in its crown, a joint venture company known as Novel, which produces colour television tubes, made an estimated profit of Yn168.8m with a workforce of 1,900. The new joint venture status just might give the managers of Shanghai Vacuum's factories the justification they need to make the hard, and so far avoided, decision about shedding labour. It can now fairly claim that its ability to raise capital from in the future will depend not on its novelty of being the first Chinese company in the international equity market, but on its results.</p>

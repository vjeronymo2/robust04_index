			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vanda Celia: "Government Spends $4 Billion </F> Illegally"]    [Text] President Itamar Franco and 16 ministers of state  spent a total of $3.9 trillion cruzeiros -- the equivalent of  approximately $4 billion -- illegally in January, February, and  March of this year. The Congressional Joint Commission on the  Budget, working through its technical staff, is conducting a  study of the irregular expenditures that the government is  making with no legal basis whatever.    Federal Deputy Paulo Bernardo (PT [Workers Party], Parana),  who made the initial calculations regarding those expenditures,  will address the Chamber of Deputies today to denounce Itamar  and the ministers for exceeding the appropriations in the  General Budget of the Union. The deputy also intends to send an  official letter requesting explanations by the ministers and  President Itamar Franco.    The president and the ministers responsible for irregular  budget spending can be punished for crimes of responsibility.  Such crimes are covered by the Constitution and by two other  laws dealing with public administration. But Deputy Bernardo  does not believe that Congress has the political will to demand  enforcement of the law. "The budget issue is a policing issue  because the administration thinks the legislative branch is `the  house of Mother Joan' [meaning not known]," he said.    According to the law -- Provisional Measure No. 396 -- the  government is to spend one-twelfth of the budget appropriations.  Excepted from that rule are budgeted expenditures for personnel,  social security contributions, welfare benefits, debt service,  and scholarships, teaching manuals, and benefits for government  employees, including medical and dental care, as well as  expenditures financed by funds originating in external credit  operations and their respective counterpart funds. Any other  expenditures, excluding subprojects and subactivities that were  not already under way in 1993, must not exceed one-twelfth of  the amount provided in the budget.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Illegal Spending (in real cruzeiros)                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ministry or department                |Cruzeiros                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Agriculture                   |15.3 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Education                     |24.9 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Social Security               |97.9 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Justice                       |1.8 million                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Transport                     |362 million                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Industry, Commerce, Tourism   |3.9 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Health                        |1.2 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Finance                       |3.7 trillion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Army                          |3.7 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Navy                          |9.2 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Aeronautics                   |1.1 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Science and Technology        |5.7 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Mines and Energy              |277 million                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Regional Integration          |255.9 million                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Min. of Environment                   |122.3 million                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Secretariat of Strategic Affairs      |3.0 billion                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Federal Senate                        |938,000                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Office of the President               |549 million                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grand total                           |3.9 trillion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Even Planalto Palace Ignores Law </H5>   The current budget law, for which President Itamar Franco is  responsible, is being ignored even by Planalto Palace, according  to the study conducted by the Federal Integrated Financial  Management System (Siafi). In addition to what was allowed, the  Office of the President of the Republic spent $549 million  cruzeiros on the Armed Forces General Staff and the Brazilian  Communication Company.    "The government issued a provisional measure to regulate  those expenditures, but even it is not capable of obeying that  measure," Deputy Bernardo complained. The congressman feels that  President Itamar Franco has an obligation to see to it that the  ministers explain themselves to the National Congress.    Responding to a request from another PT deputy, Jose Paulo  Pires (Minas Gerais), the Budget Commission's technical staff is  also investigating the reasons why the administration  overstepped the amounts established in the provisional measure  on the budget. "We still do not know how much was spent in  total, but we are asking the ministries to supply us with data  on that subject," said the chief of the Budget and Financial  Oversight Staff, Francisco de Paulo Schettini. Some ministries  are reporting that they did not overspend, but spent only what  was appropriated -- although that explanation is not being  accepted in Congress -- on the grounds that "appropriation"  means that public money has already been committed, according to  the Budget Commission.</p>

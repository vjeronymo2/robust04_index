[passage omitted]    Following Friday prayers, the brother Presidential Council  chairman spoke to the worshipers at the mosque and congratulated  them for their blessed prayers, and reviewed the developments in  the national arena in light of the signing of the document of  accord and the current preparations for implementing and  translating it on the ground.    He referred to the steps covered since the signing of the  document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and the regrettable  ramifications that took place later. He especially emphasized  the military field, and the measures adopted to stop these  military ramifications, and the success realized by the joint  military committee in this field.    He said that following the signing of the document, there  was  great hope that the crisis was over and that the beginning of a  new stage was at hand, that the document would be implemented  and that all parties would adhere to it. Regrettably, what  happened showed the determination of certain people not to  reunite the constitutional establishments to enable these  establishments to carry out their duties in implementing the  document.    The brother president said: In this address to you, I want  to assure you and all the masses of our people that we will make  every effort, alongside all unionists and good people, to  contain the crisis. Let our people be sure that we will not  allow discord and fighting among the sons of our people, we will  not allow one drop of Yemeni blood to be shed for the sake of  narrow interests, and we will not allow anyone to encroach on  the homeland's security and stability.    He said that no one individual, party, or group has the  right  to maintain a mandate on unity or people, or any part of this  people, adding that unity is a safeguard that will never be  relinquished whatever the price might be. He said heroic Sanaa,  the historical and political capital of the unified Yemeni  homeland is a city for all unionists, and is the home for all  Yemenis in all parts of the homeland.    He stressed that our people will stand firmly with unity,  with democracy, and with the document of accord, and will  confront those who sow strife and incite sectarian, racist, or  tribal problems. The people will also confront all forces of  renegades and secession.    The brother president said: We are concerned that Yemeni  blood be spared and that our people be spared the difficulties  and our country be spared the destruction. We will seek with  all the power we have to build Yemen and avoid all the gloomy  pictures it witnessed in the past. With the unity, we closed  the files of the past. We will not permit the occurrence of new  tragedies in the history of our people and homeland.    Those who speak in a loud voice about a state where law and  order prevail should offer us the model they followed for 25  years, in the economic, administrative, and development spheres  to find the basic structure for development, and building the  state. We do not need to speak more about the model they had  offered to the citizens over that period of time. This model is  well known to our people, part of whom still suffer from its  tragic consequences. We regret to say that such people now seek  the recurrence of this model throughout the entire homeland so  that our entire Yemeni people will suffer, after already  attaining their unity on 22 May 1990. Our people have hoped  that this unity will be the dividing line between these dark  ages and a new era based on freedom, democracy, justice, respect  for human rights, and on real development from which the  homeland benefits. We aspire to build a modern Yemeni state, a  state where blood, honor, and property will be safeguarded, a  state based on law and order, on free economic activities, and  on fair competition for achieving what is better. We will not  allow any force whatsoever to tamper with the security of the  homeland and the tranquility of the citizen.    The brother president added: We want the specter of fear to  end and the crisis to disappear for good from the minds of our  people. We want our people to live a quiet and safe life far  from the crises which some insist on repeating in the homeland's  life and which poison the lives of the people. Some appear to  have forgotten how to live without these crisis, something to  which they have become accustomed during their lives. Our  steadfast people in one part of the homeland have paid a  prohibitive price for this. They now want all the people  throughout the entire homeland to pay the price of this crisis  which has been going on for over six months. Our people have  suffered from tribulations and have sustained hardships as a  result of this crisis.    The brother Presidential Council chairman added: We and all  the good people hope to welcome 'Id al-Fir with happiness and  joy and with a sense of safety. We are confident that our  people, who overcame many challenges through their history, will  also pass this test and will maintain their determination to  achieve unity, democracy, peace, and progress.

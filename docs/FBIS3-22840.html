The reactor, operated by the governmental Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., will soon reach criticality, the  stage when a nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining.    It will then produce 280,000 kilowatts of electricity.    Four large-scale trucks packed with 21 fuel assemblies set  out Thursday afternoon from the factory in Tokai, Ibaraki  Prefecture, where the mixture of plutonium and enriched uranium  is produced.    Although the government tried to keep the transport route  secret, as with previous plutonium deliveries, antinuclear  groups tracked its progress along roads across Honshu to the Sea  of Japan coast.    Since the first controversial plutonium shipment to Monju in  July 1992, a total of 200 fuel assemblies have been delivered,  including five for experimental purposes.    Monju was originally scheduled to reach criticality last  October but its start-up had to be postponed due to a technical  mishap in fuel production last July.</p>

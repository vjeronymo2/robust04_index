			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Skopbank may need more help Skopbank, the state-controlled Finnish bank, has warned that it might need further government support before the year end, in spite of a 49 per cent reduction in net operating losses in the first eight months. The bank said its results could deteriorate in the final four months of 1994 if it has to make provisions to cover possible losses from restructuring. The bank has been the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis, receiving more than FM17bn (Dollars 3.62bn) in government assistance since it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991. The drop in the bank's net operating loss to FM448m in the first eight months followed a 58 per cent fall in credit losses to FM371m. The improvement would have been greater but for a 47 per cent decline in income from financial operations to FM176m. The fall reflects a significant reduction in lending volumes and a FM55m loss on bonds. Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has changed following the restructuring of the Savings Bank of Finland in late 1993. The bank continues to service domestic corporate customers and also represents the savings banks in wholesale markets.</p>

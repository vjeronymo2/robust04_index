			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not on a ballot paper Sir, In common with many shareholders who bought shares in the privatisation of the water industry, I have just received from Yorkshire Water the annual report, notice of the annual general meeting and the form of proxy. I was extremely concerned that, on the form of proxy, the company had authorised the words 'Not recommended by the directors' against the side of item 7, 'Election of Mrs D Scott'. In common with Mrs Scott, who made a statement advocating her election, the directors of the company have had an ample opportunity to make a statement of their reasons for opposing the resolution, in the notice of the annual general meeting. In my opinion, to add such a statement to a ballot paper is an abuse of the traditions of the ballot procedures in all elections held in the UK. If such practices are to become common place within public company elections, I trust that other small shareholders will join with me in pressing parliament to amend the Company's Act to outlaw such statements on the ballot paper. John A Newbould, Tapton House, 30 Moorlands, Wickersley, Rotherham S66 0AT</p>

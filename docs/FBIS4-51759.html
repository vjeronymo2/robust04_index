			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] sent another letter to North Korea Monday  urging the communist state to let IAEA experts undertake  inspections when it changes fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor  in Yongbyon, sources close to the agency said. Such inspections  are necessary under the nuclear safeguards agreement, the IAEA  has reportedly pointed out.    The agency sent a second letter after determining that North  Korea's reply on April 29 to its first letter was  unsatisfactory. Monday's letter was sent to ascertain North  Korea's true intentions, the sources said Tuesday.    In its reply, Pyongyang told the nuclear watchdog that the  fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor must be changed soon and  requested an early dispatch of IAEA inspectors. It made no  commitment, however, on IAEA requests laid down as conditions  for the presence of its inspectors at the refueling. North Korea  only agreed to allow the inspectors to be present when it  removes spent fuel rods from the reactor.    It gave no clear reply to "the IAEA's flexible technical and  compromising plans" on taking samples in order to determine the  extent of plutonium extraction and the reactor's operating  condition.    The IAEA, in its initial letter sent early last week, told  North Korea it was willing to compromise and take random samples  of the spent rods, seal them and analyze them later.    Although the North Koreans themselves suggested that the  IAEA  be present during the refueling of the five-megawatt reactor,  they have failed to make an offer that would allow satisfactory  inspection activities, the sources said. As a result, the IAEA  sent the second letter seeking to confirm North Korea's exact  intentions, they added.</p>

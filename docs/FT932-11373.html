			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Four new ministers in Italian cabinet Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday named four new ministers in his cabinet, writes Robert Graham. They replace ministers withdrawn by their parties in protest at the blocking by parliament of attempts to have Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, answer corruption charges. The environment portfolio, vacated by the Greens, was given to Mr Valdo Spini, a Socialist deputy who briefly held the same post in the outgoing Amato government. The posts of finance, science and relations with parliament, held by members of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), went respectively to Prof Franco Gallo, an economist, Prof Umberto Colombo, a distinguished scientist and head of the research institute Enea, and Prof Paolo Barile, who has switched from minister without portfolio. Mr Livio Paladin, a judge and former minister of regional affairs, is to be put in charge of relations with the European Community.</p>

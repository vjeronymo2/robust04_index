			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK GIVE FANS THE THRILL OF PUPPY LOVE  </P> <P> "Little girl" isn't always just a figure of speech in pop music.  </P> <P> Few audiences at any kind of concert are as homogenous as the one that showed  up to shriek along with the New Kids on the Block, currently riding high with a  No. 1 hit, in the first of two shows Sunday at the Celebrity Theatre in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Talk about narrowcasting: A good 80% of the full house was made up of screaming  girls under the age of 16, caught up in a frenzied kind of puppy love largely  unwitnessed since Donny Osmond was retired from lunch pails and book covers.  </P> <P> Though the wholesomely insipid New Kids have made their reputation as a white  vocal group that sounds black, it seems safe to assume from the predominance of  white faces at the Celebrity that black kids don't think the New Kids sound all  that black.  </P> <P> The supposed blackness of the sound has more to do with the insistent dance  beat than with any vocal soulfulness. The high-pitched, castrato-like whine of  Joe McIntyre recalls a pre-teen Donny or Jimmy Osmond much more than pre-teen  Michael Jackson, and none of the more grown-up tones of his four fellow singing  'n' dancing Kids is going to make anyone forget Bobby Brown, much less James  Brown.  </P> <P> (Incidentally, though it was not always easy to tell what might have been on  tape at Sunday's matinee and what wasn't, it seemed almost certain that the  lead vocals of McIntyre -- at 16, the youngest member of the troupe -- were  more Memorex than live. Could it be that the poor Kid has to lip-sync those  high parts because, shudder, his voice has changed?)  </P> <P> Musical attributes were of small concern to the gals on hand. It had more to do  with hope -- the hope that one of the Kids might look your way, or much better  yet might point your way, or most dreamily of all would actually touch your  hand, which you would then be compelled to refrain from washing for days.  </P> <P> The ultimate dream, of course, was to be kissed by a Kid, but only one little  gal of about 5 in the front row had that honor. Later on, the Kids brought her  up on stage for a moment, provoking one older girl, jealous with rage, to  mutter, "That little girl's gotten kissed and everything." That little girl  might have been dead meat if she had wandered out unaccompanied among her  fellow fans after the show.  </P> <P> The Kids' ingenuous pre-teen appeal was enhanced by the in-the-round staging of  the Celebrity Theatre. With the band hidden in a pit, the five lads were free  to skip in concentric circles around the revolving stage, and even when they  faced off in one direction for some choreography at their mike stands, the lead  singer on that particular number would roam around and play to the other side  of the crowd.  </P> <P> To their credit, the Kids -- who currently range in age from 16 to 19 -- don't  yet seem like cynical, street-wise show-biz youths. Their smiles seem genuine  (who wouldn't smile getting that kind of adoration that early in life?), and  when they dance they look at each other with slightly goofy grins, like  real-live teen boys do.  </P> <P> But they are old enough to have learned how to patronize, and the  not-so-tightly scripted between-song shtick grew increasingly belabored and  unbearable.  </P> <P> Introducing the title song of the current "Hangin' Tough" album, Donny Wahlberg  (apparently the bohemian of the group with his beret, his itsy-bitsy ponytail  and his peace symbols) exhorted, "This is our personal anthem. What we want to  do is make this your personal anthem too. Therefore, the result would be our  national anthem."  </P> <P> The tune, of course, is just another mindless dance ditty, with the group's  moniker thrown in for extra name recognition. Thanks, Donny, but we'll stick  with F. Scott Key for now.  </P> <P> The inevitable defense for any of this pabulum is that it's kids' stuff and,  therefore, beneath criticism. To which the inevitable reply would be: There's  no law -- written, natural or otherwise -- that says kids can't have taste too.  </P> <P> The New Kids on the Block return to town June 25, when they'll open for Tiffany  at the Universal Amphitheatre.  </P></p>

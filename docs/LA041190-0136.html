The Soviet Union was criticized for its  delay in notifying other countries of the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which was  detected by Western monitors long before any Soviet announcement. The agreement  came during talks in Moscow between British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P></p>

Objectives. The purpose of this standard is to facilitate the planning, design, and installation of telecommunications grounding systems within a Federal government building with or without prior knowledge of the telecommunications systems that will subsequently be installed. This telecommunications grounding and bonding infrastructure supports a multivendor, multiproduct environment as well as the grounding practices for various systems that may be installed on customer premises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicability. This standard shall be used by all departments and agencies of the Federal Government in the design, maintenance, renovation, or retrofit of telecommunications grounding systems within new or existing Federal buildings. Existing building wiring systems, especially those installed prior to the emergence of digital communications and voice/data integration, may not readily accept application of this standard. Modernization of the existing pathway, space, and wiring systems to meet the FIPS 174, FIPS 175, FIPS 176, and FIPS 187 infrastructure standards may require a significant monetary expenditure. Agencies should conduct a thorough facility analysis of existing and renovated buildings to determine the cost of applying the standards, and develop a migration plan where cost savings can be achieved. This plan will help to ensure timely and efficient completion of the conversion process. The result of following this standard will be a telecommunications infrastructure that supports advanced technology and is compatible with modern telecommunications equipment. This standard is not intended to hasten the obsolescence of telecommunications grounding systems currently in use in Federal facilities; nor is it intended to provide systems engineering or applications guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

A survey conducted by the Regional Health Administration  between 1989 and 1993 indicates that 32 percent of ward  admissions are due to malaria infection while the Out-Patient  Department (OPD) admissions account for 52.3 percent.    This was made known by Dr. Sylvester Anemana, acting  Regional  Director of Health Services at the launching of the Regional  Malaria Control Programme at Tamale yesterday.    He said inadequate medical staff is a major constraint in  the  control of malaria.    He explained that the cash and carry system is also making  some districts not to sustain regular drug supply while there is  irrational drug prescription resulting in drug abuse by chemical  sellers.    Dr. Anemana said a regional plan of action to address the  situation would include in-service training for staff towards  proper diagnosis and treatment of malaria, provision of  equipment and raising of the capital base of districts for more  effective drug supply.    Dr. Anemana said public health education is to be  intensified  and under a pilot project, impregnated bed-nets are to be used  as a measure to protect the individual from mosquito bites. If  it proves successful, it would be extended to other districts.    Mr. Gilbert Iddi, Deputy Regional Minister of Agriculture  who  was the guest speaker expressed regret that health care delivery  only reaches about 30 percent of the population in the Northern  Region.    Mr. Baba Ibrahima, Tamale Municipal Secretary, urged the  health staff to devote time and energy in educating the people  to adopt preventive measures against malaria attacks.</p>

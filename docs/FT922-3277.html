			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Sumi Jo &amp; Raul Gimenez/Andrew Constantine - London concerts The London Opera Festival - no longer 'International' in the umbrella title, though still notably and imaginatively international in its concerns - is again unfolding before the city's eyes and ears. It lasts until July 4, and offers 25 different events in 12 different venues. Many of these comprise adventurously out-of-the-way small-ensemble events in theatres like The Place and the Riverside. Tuesday's opening concert had, however, a distinctly old-fashioned air. It was a Grand Vocal Concert by two leading singers, who offered a succession of items from the bel canto repertory on the large stage and in the un-intimate acoustics of the Barbican Hall. The hamfisted ineptitude of their pianist, who regularly fell behind the beat as she struggled to turn the pages of her music, transported one in a time-capsule back to the days when Voice Was All and laughably unmusical accompaniments could be tolerated as being meant to go unnoticed. Was such a display mounted for educational reasons, a sort of enacted tableau of historical authenticity? If so it was a particular slight to the tenor, Raul Gimenez, who (as he has shown in Royal Opera revivals of Rossini and Donizetti operas) is a marvellously graceful and elegant singer of this music, a stylist of the first order deserving of matchingly stylish support. Even through the pianist's wrack and fog one could enjoy and admire his softly moulded, sweetly coloured tones, the pliant delicacy of his phrasing, his readiness to spin out both recitative and aria in such numbers as the beautifully tender tenor romance from Rossini's Pietra del paragone. The soprano - who came together with the tenor only in a single duet, from Lucia, at concert's end - was 'historical' in a slightly less fastidious fashion. Sumi Jo, recently Offenbach's Olympia, Donizetti's Adina and Bellini's Elvira at Covent Garden, has a deliciously pearly instrument, light and pure (though on this occasion a touch of edge marred its highest notes). But she sounded here more like a teacher's best pupil than an independent, fully formed artist; a feeling of carefully - mechanically? - learned routine made itself felt in number after number, song or aria as may be. Her pert singing of 'Una voce poco fa' added to the effect at once comical and faintly depressing of the whole concert. As winner of the 1991 Donatella Flick Conducting Competition, young Constantine got to conduct the London Philharmonic on Tuesday. He has been studying in St. Petersburg, and chose an all-Russian programme - to which was added, late in the day, a Verdi scena for Montserrat Caballe. If the quality of her mature soprano now rarely suggests a Desdemona, she made her own mark by stately authority and grandly sculpted phrasing. Constantine treated Verdi's extraordinary wind-writing in the Otello music with loving care. For the pianist Nikolai Demidenko he honed Rakhmaninov's orchestra in the 'Paganini' Rhapsody to a bright gleam, and made an alert partner to his dazzling soloist. Not only is Demidenko a phenomenal technician, but in this work he graded his attack to the music of the moment with faultless instinct: here chords like axe-blows, there the pearliest filigree - and everywhere, an exact grasp of the various relations in which Rakhmaninov's piano here stands to the band. About Tchaikovsky's Fantasy-Overture 'Romeo and Juliet' and Prokofiev's Symphony no. 5, Constantine had his own definite ideas: never eccentric, once in a while too overtly insistent. His platform-manner was assured and direct. 'Romeo and Juliet' had been prepared with passionate care, as if to rescue it from routine pop-status; indeed, he forced us to listen with unusual attention, but achieved no great illusion of spontaneous flow. In that piece, with its many repetitions, dwelling with unwonted, drawn-out fervour on ultra-familiar passages was bound to sound self-conscious. Something like that happened with the first movement of the Prokofiev too, much of it taken (arguably) just under tempo: the result was magniloquent and heavy, with none of the lithe spring that should carry it forward. The rackety scherzo and the Adagio, convincingly quicker than usual, were much better judged, and the Finale drove to a fine whooping close. In all the main works there were small problems of balance. A grossly prominent tuba regularly threatened to swallow its colleagues; over-eager horns and light drums distracted the ear from the main musical burden; the upper strings' pizzicati had too little Prokofievian sting to make themselves felt. But definiteness of intention is a great thing, and Constantine's shaping of the music was never short of it: this intelligent, well-schooled conductor should mature fast.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: THE JOKER'S WILD ON 'BATMAN'  </P> <P> The Joker plans to laugh all the way to the bank -- well, actually the Federal  Depository -- on "Batman" (Sunday at 2 p.m. on KTTV).  </P> <P> Blowing open the depository and cleaning the place out is a big job.  </P> <P> It'll take two villains-the Joker (Cesar Romero) and Catwoman (Eartha Kitt)-to  pull it off in "The Funny Feline Felonies." The pair return in the second part,  called "The Joke's on the Catwoman" (2:30 p.m.)  </P> <P> Catwoman didn't get involved just because the Joker needed a hand; at the time,  the show itself did too. During the series' third and final season, villains  were teamed in episodes to try to boost the sagging ratings of the once-wildly  popular show.  </P> <P> But no matter how many villains are on the same team, they can't keep a good  Batman down. The Caped Crusader (Adam West) and his colleagues, Robin (Burt  Ward) and Batgirl (Yvonne Craig), triumph as always with their wits, moral  strength-and enough gadgets to put Ronco out of business.  </P> <P> Watch for a mistake in the episode: The Joker is surprised to learn that the  heroes are alive, but the scene that shows how he tried to kill them was cut  out.  </P> <P> Later in the week, there is no pairing of guest villains in "The Impractical  Joker/The Joker's Provokers" (Saturday at 2 p.m. on KTTV), which is from the  second season. The Joker does his dirty work with only a couple of thugs and  his girlfriend, Cornelia (played by Kathy Kersh, who at the time was Ward's  wife).  </P></p>

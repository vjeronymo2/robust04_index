			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO KEYS ON STONE, BEATS THOUSAND OAKS TO ADVANCE IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> It's not often a coach will attack one of the opposing team's best players. But  that's exactly what El Toro assistant coach Kim Jagd suggested the Chargers do  to Thousand Oaks' Aimee Stone.  </P> <P> And it worked like a charm.  </P> <P> El Toro (18-3) overcame an opening-game loss to the Lancers (18-4) and rallied  to win 12-15, 15-5, 15-7, 15-10 and advance to the Southern Section 5A  semifinals.  </P> <P> "We were picking up what they did offensively and my wife (assistant coach Kim  Jagd) figured out that No. 4 (Stone) had a lot of offensive responsibility," El  Toro head coach Mike Jagd said. "So we served at her hoping making the passes  and still hitting would put pressure on her.'  </P> <P> It worked as Stone had trouble handling the serves, forced bad passes, and had  trouble with kills as well.  </P> <P> "It really takes me time to adjust to things," said Stone, who finished the  game with 14 kills and five digs. "I'll hit 20 kills the same way before I  adjust. I've got to, or should have learned that."  </P> <P> The Chargers, ranked second in the final section poll, were led by Michelle  Mauney, who had 14 kills, 10 blocks, 13 digs and four aces.

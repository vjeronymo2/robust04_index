			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Official results of the election for Belarusian  Supreme Soviet chairman were announced about two hours ago.  Myechyslaw Hryb received 183 votes in his favor and 65 votes  against his candidacy. Here is a brief outline of his personal  history:    Myechyslaw Hryb is a lawyer. He was born into a peasant  family 57 years ago. His father died in World War II. He  graduated from a college in the Ministry of Interior Affairs.  In his military service, he rose to the rank of general and was  head of the Interior Affairs Administration of the Vitebsk  Oblast Executive Committee. In 1990, he was elected to the  Belarusian Supreme Soviet and named head of the legislative  commission for national security, defense, and combating crime.  He supports a strong power base and presidency in the  Belarusian Republic. Myechyslaw Hryb supports ratification of  the [CIS] Treaty on Collective Security. In his own words, he  has always fulfilled his parliamentary obligations based on the  substance of problems rather than personal preferences or  animosities. Although all of us were involved in the old  system, we must look ahead, he said. Here is what Myechyslaw  Hryb told the people's deputies after he was elected Supreme  Soviet chairman.    [Begin Hryb recording] Esteemed People's Deputies and  Journalists! Let me express my sincere appreciation for the  trust you displayed in me through this vote. I have always  said, and will say it again now, that this post is extremely  responsible and complex. I will try to perform my duties as my  conscience dictates, and will do my best in this post. I hope  that all of you will join me and actively help me in my duties.  Because I will do nothing without you. [applause] [end  recording]</p>

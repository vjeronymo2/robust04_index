			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIL SYSTEM GETS HEAD START ON SECURITY;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: NEARLY 300 ARRESTS ALREADY HAVE BEEN MADE WITH USE OF  SOPHISTICATED NETWORK. LINE LINKING LONG BEACH TO DOWNTOWN L.A. DOESN'T OPEN  FOR THREE WEEKS.  </P> <P> The opening of the $877-million Blue Line light-rail system linking Long Beach  and downtown Los Angeles is still three weeks away, but a sophisticated  security network designed to protect passengers and prevent vandalism has  already led to the arrest of nearly 300 people.  </P> <P> The electronic surveillance equipment and a 118-member rail security force are  being deployed because of concerns by law enforcement and transportation  officials about gang activity along the 22-mile line.  </P> <P> "We've got about 15,000, or 22%, of all the gang members in Los Angeles County,  residing within a mile of either side of the . . . line," said Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro, who commands security for the Blue Line.  "If I were bent on criminal behavior along this line, I would look at our  enforcement record first."  </P> <P> The arrests were made by the rail security force since the system was begun in  March and provided an early test for the network of roving patrol cars,  plainclothes officers, closed-circuit televisions and telephone hot lines that  feed into a command post in Willowbrook.  </P> <P> Suspects taken into custody along the rail line's vacant platforms, stations  and train tracks have been charged with crimes ranging from possession of  narcotics and vandalism to malicious mischief and theft.  </P> <P> "Of course, the gangs will view this system as part of their turf," said  Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department oversees the rail line's security  force. "We intend to keep that from translating into vandalism, assault,  graffiti and anything else against passengers."  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department won the job of policing the rail system in March when  Rapid Transit District directors, under pressure from county supervisors and  Mayor Tom Bradley, voted to have deputies -- instead of the RTD's own police  force -- protect the line. The sheriff's involvement will cost the county  Transportation Commission $9.9 million a year.  </P> <P> A spokesman for RTD officers has expressed reservations about the Sheriff  Department's ability to handle crimes along the rail line. Transit officers  said their greatest worry is a stretch between Slauson Avenue and Martin Luther  King Jr. Boulevard. During the mid-1980s, buses were boarded by armed gangs who  robbed passengers in incidents that became known as "stage coach robberies,"  said Kyle Ramsey, president of the Southern California Transit Police Officers'  Assn.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials downplay these concerns, saying a recent study showed that  their force and equipment were adequate.  </P> <P> RTD and sheriff's officials will direct the security system from a high-tech  nerve center that they call the "USS Enterprise," housed in a two-story  concrete-and-glass structure guarded by a six-foot-high fence.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the command post is a 30-foot-long color coded map that  shows stations, platforms and the exact location of every train on the line.  The map faces an array of computer terminals manned by RTD personnel.  Emergencies will show up on the screen as blinking red or yellow lights --  depending on the severity of the problem.  </P> <P> On an adjacent wall are 64 television screens linked to video surveillance  cameras installed at each of the transit system's 22 station platforms. In the  trains, passengers will be able to press an intercom button and forward  emergency calls to train operators. The operators, safe behind locked doors and  shatter-proof windows, can radio deputies at the command post.  </P> <P> Deputies can even be shuttled to an emergency aboard a special maintenance car  capable of catching up to a passenger train still in motion.  </P> <P> Response time, said Dan Ibarra, RTD superintendent of light rail operations,  "will be immediate."  </P> <P> Uniformed deputies and plainclothes officers will ride trains and roam  stations, platforms and six park-and-ride locations along the route. "Our  deployment strategy calls for increased presence during peak hours, but I won't  say there will be an officer on every train," Vadurro said.  </P> <P> "But the chances are great that there will be a deputy riding with you,"  Vadurro said, "and the chances are also great that there will be a plainclothes  officer on board that you will never know about."  </P> <P> These officers also will be in charge of ensuring that passengers have paid to  ride the line. Those caught on board without tickets will be subject to fines.  </P> <P> When the trains begin running, some Guardian Angels may be along for the ride.  A spokesman for the volunteer anti-crime organization said the group hopes to  put as many as 100 members aboard the trains.  </P> <P> "The Guardian Angels are as welcome as any other citizen to ride these trains,"  said Sheriff's Administrative Sgt. Joe Anda. "In the public's eye, I'm sure  they will enhance a sense of security."  </P></p>

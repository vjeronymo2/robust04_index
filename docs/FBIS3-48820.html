Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Saturday such a  clarification was in the interest of good relations between the  two countries.    Speaking to reporters here, he said the claims were very  serious for if they were true then Australia had interfered in  Malaysia's political affairs.    This is not in order and should be corrected.....We are not  interfering in Australian politics as it is the right of  Australians, our politics is our right and others cannot  interfere, he said.    If it had really happened then Malaysia could not just keep  quiet and Australia should inform the Malaysian Government as to  who were the recepients -- were they individuals or political  parties, he said.    He said it was not correct for opposition parties in  Malaysia  to look for funds outside of the country to finance their  political activities.    In the interest of good relations between the two countries  and to erase any doubt on the issue, the Government of Australia  should state its stand on it, he said.    He said he did not think it was necessary to set up a  commission of inquiry to investigate the matter.    Those involved should be frank and admit it, as it was a  question of honour and dignity, Mohamed Rahmat said.</p>

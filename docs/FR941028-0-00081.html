			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM agrees that documents submitted in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or in support of a challenge to the status or the existence of a violation should normally be considered part of the public record. The public has a legitimate interest in knowing and understanding the basis for a regulatory authority's decisions in these matters. In a democracy, it is unreasonable for a governmental agency to make such decisions based upon secret information. Further, the credibility of the regulatory authority and the integrity of its decisionmaking process require that its decisions be supported by an adequate record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, OSM also recognizes that there may be valid competitive reasons why industry operators believe that certain information needs to be kept confidential. For instance, a person may not wish to reveal the price which he or she has paid for the coal extracted by a mine contractor for fear that other contractors or competitors will learn of this information and change their prices or bids to the disadvantage of the person revealing the information. A person concerned about such disclosure may be reluctant to submit a copy of the relevant contract because it contains the agreed price. OSM disagrees, however, that these industry concerns require special provisions in the rules to seal documents or to otherwise protect confidentiality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In balancing the concerns of the public and the coal industry with respect to public access to the submitted documents, OSM will be guided by the principles of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), and the Departmental regulations implementing FOIA. See 43 CFR 2.11&hyph;2.22. Upon request by a member of the public, OSM will ordinarily make available to the requestor documents provided by challengers of ownership or control links, the status of violations, and the existence of violations. To the extent that a person submitting information to OSM asserts that the materials should be kept confidential, OSM will evaluate that request in accordance with the applicable provisions of FOIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the above analysis, OSM has determined that the interests of the commenters can be addressed under current law and that the rule does not need to be modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has determined to adopt a final version of the proposed rule. The final rule has been renumbered as &sect;773.25 to reflect the withdrawal of proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. As indicated above, OSM has modified the provisions of the proposal to allow for the submission of an opinion of counsel based upon evidence developed through counsel's personal investigation or based upon facts which have been supplied to counsel in support of a challenge of an ownership or control presumption. As further discussed above, OSM has inserted language in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) to clarify that a permittee may challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited within the context of improvident permit issuance as provided by &sect;&sect;773.20 and 773.21. OSM has also withdrawn paragraph (d) of the proposed rule, required proof for the rebuttal of ownership or control presumptions, described above. The final rule contains no other substantive changes from proposed rule &sect;773.26. The final rule contains certain other non-substantive modifications as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of final &sect;773.25 provides that provisions of &sect;773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning an ownership or control link or the status of a violation when such challenge is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); &sect;&sect;773.23 (the regulatory authority's review of ownership or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS); or under 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of the final rule differs from the proposed rule in that references to proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. A further change in this paragraph from the proposed rule provides that the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to challenges of an ownership or control ``link to any person'' rather than only to a ``link to any person in a violation notice.'' The purpose of this change is to clarify that the provisions of the section apply to challenges of ownership or control links including those which do not generate a current link to an outstanding violation. OSM's experience has demonstrated that members of the regulated community have, in many cases, sought proactively to challenge ownership or control links to other persons, without regard to whether there were outstanding violations. Such challenges have been asserted, among other reasons, to avoid the risk of being linked to future violations through such ownership or control relationships. OSM recognizes that this is a legitimate concern. Accordingly, the change in the final rule allows the challenge of ownership or control links without regard to whether there are outstanding violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

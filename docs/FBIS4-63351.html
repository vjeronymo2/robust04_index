			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Palariya] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- "Russia is interested in a  more serious and substantial format of relations with NATO than  the Partnership for Peace program envisions," Russian Defence  Minister, Army General Pavel Grachev announced today.    "This approach, in our view, rules out surprises and  unilateral measures, especially of military character, in the  fields in which we must cooperate as closely as possible,"  General Grachev said after his meeting with French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe.    "We will put forth another plan for partnership, which has  already been approved by the president of Russia," Grachev  indicated. Its basic principles consist in Russia's joining the  program with account being taken of its significant role and  place in the European security system and the United Nations.  In addition, Russia cannot limit itself to the signing of the  standard framework document, the minister said. "We shall work  to prepare a larger-scale program of cooperation between Russia  and NATO, based on parameters of practical participation in its  implementation," the Russian minister stressed.    These parameters are political partnership, partnership in  the military and other fields. On their basis, "we shall  propose drawing up a large-scale program for Russia's  cooperation with Partnership for Peace. Only if they are  approved, Russia will be able to sign the NATO program," Grachev  said.    The minister said he would also set out in his report at  NATO  headquarters in Brussels on May 24 Russia's views on prospects  for the development of the European security system. The accent  will be placed on the need to ensure the leading role of the  Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the  process of forming a regional security system for the  Commonwealth member-states within the collective security  treaty, as well as on Russia's vision of the main parameters of  cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance.    Grachev reiterated that his main objective was to tell NATO  about the main provisions of the Russian military doctrine.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Domestic and foreign enthusiasm greets UK's Dollars 3bn Euro-issue THE UK government accelerated the pricing on its Dollars 3bn 10-year Eurobond after what joint bookrunners Credit Suisse First Boston and S. G. Warburg Securities described as a textbook distribution. Demand was reported to be evenly spread across the far east, middle east, continental Europe and the UK, where there was slightly higher than expected interest from domestic institutions. Some of the UK investors are thought to have switched out of US Treasuries to buy the bonds. The issue, the biggest international dollar bond yet, was priced yesterday, a day ahead of schedule, to yield 22 basis points over US Treasuries. This is at the bottom end of the indicated range, and is said to represent the tightest pricing yet for a sovereign 10-year borrowing, other than on tax-related deals. The coupon was set at 7 1/4 per cent. The government was widely commended for the size and the pricing of the issue, which neatly rounds off the Ecu10bn foreign currency borrowing programme announced on September 3. Earlier market chatter, which some bankers dismissed contemptuously, had suggested the amount might be as much as Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn, with pricing in the 18 to 20 basis points range. There was never any contemplation of an increase, said the bookrunners, despite the warm reception. There will be no further borrowing under the programme unless an unmissable opportunity presents itself to refinance the Ecu5bn revolving credit facility. The only reported signs of disappointment came from houses who said their tickets were too small and from New York investors disappointed that the borrower did not opt for the global issue structure. Traders reported that good two-way activity in early trading after the issue broke syndicate confirmed its popularity and liquidity. 'We're naturally very pleased with the outcome and feel that these fine terms reflect very well on the credit standing of the UK govern-ment,' said Mr Ian Plenderleith, associate director of the Bank of England responsible for market operations. Other deals in an exceptionally busy day were overshadowed by the UK's borrowing. The volume of equity warrant bonds from Japanese issuers caused some concern among lead managers. They noted, however, that the issues were helped by being relatively small and, in the case of three out of four of the dollar issues, being guaranteed by banks. The guarantees helped cut the coupons slightly on these deals from otherwise prevailing levels. KfW International's Pounds 150m 5 1/2 -year bond was described as a touch demanding in comparison with existing paper. KfW is understood to have swapped the proceeds of the BZW-led transaction into floating rate dollars at between 20 to 25 basis points under the London interbank offered rate. The rash of collared floater issues continued with a Dollars 150m 10-year deal for Eurofima, the Basel-based rolling stock company, through Goldman Sachs. The issue's slightly long payment date is thought to be its one drawback, although Goldman Sachs reported it had been well received, particularly in Switzerland. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reopened the collared FRN it launched earlier for Electricite de France, in response to existing demand. The amount was increased to Dollars 150m from the original Dollars 100m. Belgacom, the 100 per cent Belgian state-owned telephone monopoly, has become the first Belgian corporate borrower to be awarded a long-term triple-A rating for its debt, albeit only for debt denominated in Belgian francs. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned the rating to a BFr15bn, eight-year 8.2 per cent bond which was launched yesterday through Generale de Banque and Banque Paribas. This marks the utility's first public borrowing in its new name and without an explicit state guarantee, although S&amp;P notes that the government will have 'economic and political incentives to assure timely support'. Belgacom was previously called Regie des Telephones et Telegraphes. Partly thanks to the size of the borrowing, the largest ever public issue in Belgium, international investors might be approached, particularly those in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p>

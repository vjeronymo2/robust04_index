			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Businesses report cost-cutting on company cars A DRIVE by businesses to cut the costs of company cars is identified in a study of 200 companies operating a total of 115,000 cars. The annual study, published yesterday by the Monks Partnership consultancy group, found that nearly a quarter of companies surveyed require employees to cover more than 70,000 miles before their cars are replaced - compared with 8 per cent the year before - while 31 per cent are keeping their cars for four years or more, up from 19 per cent in the previous year. The survey found 85 per cent of surveyed companies were seeking to change their company car policies in order to cut costs. The figures help explain the sharp fall in new-car sales which has hit vehicle makers and importers. They also offer the industry some prospect of an upturn in sales this year as fleet operators find themselves unable to postpone replacement further. Three out of four companies surveyed said they were keen to introduce cash alternatives to company cars. Meanwhile, in a Home Office survey of car crime published yesterday, 88 per cent of drivers said they believed manufacturers could do more to improve car security and 56 per cent admitted they could be doing more themselves. One in 10 motorists also admitted regularly leaving their cars unlocked, usually outside shops and homes during the day. Company Car Policy UK 1992.

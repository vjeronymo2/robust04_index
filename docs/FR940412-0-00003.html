			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Red onions, like yellow onions and white onions, are varieties of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allium cepa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and are therefore covered by the same U.S. standards referenced in &sect;959.322(h). Because of this, the regulatory requirements set forth in &sect;959.322 applicable to yellow and white varieties of onions are appropriate for red varieties also. The committee believes that by regulating red onions in the same fashion as yellow and white onions, consumers can be assured of buying better quality red onions. Thus, increased consumer confidence should result in improved returns to growers. In addition to grade and size requirements, the committee also recommended that red varieties be subject to the same pack, container, inspection, assessment, and safeguard requirements as yellow and white varieties. In this way, red, yellow, and white onions will be regulated to the same extent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second recommendation concerns the length of the regulatory period for shipments of onions from the regulated area. Previously, order regulations were in effect from March 1 through May 20 each year. District 2 (Laredo-Winter Garden) is in the northern part of the production area and has a shipping season that extends from May to well into June. This district is comprised of the Counties of Zapata, Webb, Jim Hogg, DeWitt, Wilson, Atascosa, Karnes, Val Verde, Frio, Kinney, Uvalde, Medina, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit and LaSalle. In the 1980's, District 2 production was declining and industry members asked to be relieved from the marketing order requirements after May 20 each season, instead of the June 15 date in effect at that time. By May 20, shipments from District No. 1 in the southern part of the production area usually are finished. Thus, effective for the 1989 and subsequent seasons, the termination date for the regulatory period was advanced for the entire production area from June 15 to May 20 (54 FR 8519, March 1, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, committee records indicate an increase in onion shipments from District 2 during the past three years. The committee members from District 2 who attended the November meeting stated that shipments during the May 20 through June 15 period should once again be regulated so that funds could be assessed to fund the committee's production research and market development efforts as well as assure the consumer a quality pack of onions from their district. Shipments from this district typically account for 10 to 12 percent of the production area total, and the committee believes that grade, size, container, and other order requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of South Texas onions that receivers and consumers have become accustomed to. Extension of the regulatory period will not affect District 1 handlers as shipments from that district normally are completed by mid-May.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, handlers may not package or load onions on Sunday during the period March 1 through May 20 of each season. The committee recommended not changing this requirement. After May 20, District 2 handlers compete with unregulated shipments from other areas such as California. Permitting District 2 handlers to package and ship whenever they can find buyers will help to reduce the competitive advantage of handlers shipping from outside the regulated area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of this final rule was published in the March 9, 1994, issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 11008). Interested persons were invited to file written comments with respect to the proposal until March 24, 1994. Ten comments were received. One was from Mr. Greg Nelson, of the Cargil Produce Company, Uvalde, Texas, which is located in District 2. Mr. Nelson opposed the extension of the regulatory period. He stated that non-regulated areas such as California, the Vidalia area of Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Trans-Pecos area of Texas ship large quantities of new crop onions. These onions compete with regulated onions from District 2 (Laredo-Winter Garden). Mr. Nelson stated that the other shipping areas, being unregulated, have a significant competitive advantage over District 2 growers and handlers because those onions do not have to meet grade requirements and the handlers do not have to pay inspection costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six other comments also opposed the proposed extension of the regulation period. These comments were received from Mr. Kenneth Spence, Mr. Robert Willoughby, and Mr. Lee Toombs, all of Batesville; and from Mr. C.W. Cargil, Mr. Steve Cargil, and Mr. Steve Rambie, from Uvalde, Texas. All stated that regulating District 2 onions after May 20 would cause a hardship on District 2 growers by giving non-regulated producing areas a competitive advantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the November 9, 1993, meeting during which this change in regulatory period was recommended, 11 members were present; the full committee is composed of 17 members. The committee unanimously recommended this action, including two members from District 2. For District 1, one position was not represented by either a member or alternate; for District 2, two members out of seven were in attendance. None of the opponents were in attendance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

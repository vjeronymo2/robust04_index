			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] The purpose of THE WASHINGTON POST article was to  discredit us in the eyes of the Russians, who are our number-one  partner in special equipment trade, Cenzin [arms trading  company] Chairman Tadeusz Bednarek has told Panorama. On Monday  THE WASHINGTON POST reported that 10 years ago Poland used to  sell high-class Soviet military equipment to the United States.    [Begin recording] [Rajmund Szwonder, Democratic Left  Alliance  senator] This case concerns a story that is about 10 years old,  isn't it? In my home town of Laskarzew, they say that reheated  pancakes are indigestible even when eaten with Russian caviar.    [Tadeusz Bednarek, Cenzin chairman] Cenzin sold weapons to  the United States, but they were museum pieces and weapons items  for collectors.    [Correspondent] What about reexports from what was then the  Soviet Union?    [Bednarek] There were instances of this kind, but these  exports, these shipments from Poland, went to credible, verified  end users in the recipient country.    [Correspondent] So what happened after that was up to the  recipient?    [Bednarek] Well, the supplier cannot check on this for a  long  time. A credible end user is necessary for the issue of an  export permit. Then you check whether the goods have reached  their destination. But we are unable to check what some  countries went on to do with the purchased weapons.    I would also like to emphasise that these were not  components, as the WASHINGTON POST suggests, of strategic  weapons, nor were they the latest technologies.    [Szwonder] The gun scandal [Polish officials found not  guilty  of alleged arms trade offenses by a U.S. court], of which to a  degree I was a hero, the Burmese scandal [U.S. ban on sale of  Polish helicopters to Burma], and the current scandal amazingly  coincide with our export successes, even if only minor ones.    [Bednarek] I believe that the publication in the WASHINGTON  POST and the whole press campaign around this subject is  unambiguously aimed at discrediting us in the eyes of our  Russian partner, who is Poland's number-one partner in special  equipment trade.

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRAFT TODAY STILL A MYSTERY FOR CHARGERS  </P> <P> About all the Chargers know for sure regarding their position in today's NFL  supplemental draft is that they will have one of the first nine picks. The rest  is speculation.  </P> <P> The guessing concerns the three top players available -- running back Bobby  Humphrey of Alabama and quarterbacks Timm Rosenbach of Washington State and  Steve Walsh of Miami.  </P> <P> Those three are easily the best known of the 12 players the NFL has said are  eligible to be selected. All could be taken in the first round, possibly before  the Chargers have an opportunity to select.  </P> <P> The Chargers will not learn where they will pick until sometime shortly before  the draft begins in New York at 10 a.m. PDT. Order will be determined by a  weighted lottery.  </P> <P> The NFL has placed its 28 teams into three groups to determine the order. The  Chargers, as one of nine teams with six or fewer victories last season, are in  the first group of teams and assured of picking no later than ninth.  </P> <P> The second group is made up of the nine remaining non-playoff teams and will  have the 10th through 18th selections. The final group consists of the 10 teams  that made the playoffs and will be assigned the 19th through 28th picks.  </P> <P> Each team will, within its group, be assigned a number of lottery chances based  on its finish. The team with the worst record, Dallas, will have 28 chances.  Green Bay will receive 27, Detroit 26 and so on until Super Bowl champion San  Francisco, which has one chance.  </P> <P> The Chargers, with the eighth worst record, will have 21 lottery chances.  Because there will be 216 markers among the first nine teams, the Chargers odds  of gaining the first pick in the draft are roughly one in 10.  </P> <P> The supplemental draft is used to disperse players not available during the  regular draft April 23-24. Most are players who elected to give up their final  year of college eligibility.  </P> <P> Much of the interest for the Chargers centers on Rosenbach and Walsh.  Quarterback has been a weakness since the retirement of Dan Fouts, but the  question is whether the Chargers, who traded with the New York Giants for an  extra second-round pick to take Billy Joe Tolliver of Texas Tech in the regular  draft, will want to spend another pick on that position.  </P> <P> A team choosing a player in the supplemental draft will forfeit its  corresponding choice in the 1990 regular draft.  </P> <P> The Chargers also could trade their position in the draft -- but any trade must  be made before the lottery -- or they could draft one of the top available  players and trade him after the draft. Or they could simply pass.  </P> <P> Rosenbach is considered by scouts the best available player. At 6-feet-2 and  210 pounds, he led the nation in passing efficiency last season. In two years  as a starter, he passed for 5,995 yards in Washington State's quick-drop  offense.  </P> <P> Walsh, 6-3, 195 pounds, is not considered to have as strong an arm, but he  passed for 5,364 career yards and a school-record 48 touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Chargers, who have an abundance of running backs, might have less interest  in Humphrey. He was expected to be one of the leading running backs in the  country last season, but he played only two games before breaking a bone in his  foot.  </P> <P> He rushed for 2,726 yards and 26 touchdowns in the previous two seasons.  </P></p>

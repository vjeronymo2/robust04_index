			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / BT links with BSkyB to beat cable challenge British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, yesterday announced a marketing tie-up with British Telecommunications to offer discount telephone services to satellite television subscribers. The deal comes three days before BSkyB launches its flotation prospectus, expected to value the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn, and days after TeleWest, the largest UK cable company, revealed its flotation plans. BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a 17.5 per cent stake - insisted yesterday that the agreement was designed only to 'constantly improve the proposition we offer our customers'. The move will be seen, however, as an attempt to undermine the competitiveness of cable, which offers discounts of about 15 per cent on telephone services as well as television channels. For the past year BT has sold its own branded satellite dishes in a marketing drive with BSkyB. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Communications Association, the cable trade organisation, last night said the deal would have no effect on the TeleWest flotation. 'We have discovered that BT can't sell satellite dishes. We will now see that BSkyB can't sell telephone services,' he predicted. For one year, BSkyB is offering BT discount services at an additional discount to subscribers. BT PremierLine, which usually costs Pounds 24 a year in advance for a 15 per cent discount on calls, will be available for a monthly fee of Pounds 1.50 to Sky subscribers. BT said yesterday that someone with a Pounds 100 quarterly telephone bill would save about Pounds 42 a year through the Sky offer. BT's Option 15 discount scheme, which gives 10 per cent off direct-dialled calls for Pounds 4 a quarter, will cost Pounds 1 a month through Sky. BSkyB is the first organisation to join BT's discount schemes. BT said yesterday it was providing the service to BSkyB at its normal price and the satellite company was absorbing the cost of the extra discount.</p>

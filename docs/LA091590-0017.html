			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK COLLECTING  </P> <P> As a lifelong bibliophile, I'm delighted to see that news about books is making  the front page ("The Binding Attraction of Books" by Terry Pristin, Aug. 30).  </P> <P> It is impressive to read all about the prominent people who have taken up book  collecting as a hobby but there is one element about books that seems to be  overlooked: It's fun. You don't have to be rich and famous to enjoy books. And  now that it has become a status symbol to be surrounded by books, I've been  appalled to see expensive homes decorated with wallpaper with books sketched  in, instead of real shelves overflowing with books. That's where the fun is!  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

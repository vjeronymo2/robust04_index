			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Usher-Walker at Pounds 9,000 after exceptional Usher-Walker, the manufacturer of printing inks and rollers, saw pre-tax profits almost wiped out at the interim stage following a sizeable exceptional charge and 'predatory pricing' by a competitor in the black newspaper ink market. After an exceptional debit of Pounds 143,000 for reorganisation and redundancies in the group's inks and rollers divisions, pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 amounted to just Pounds 9,000, against Pounds 217,000 last time. Profits at the operating level emerged at Pounds 270,000 (Pounds 416,000) from turnover of Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.14m). Earnings per share fell from 3.23p to 0.04p but the interim dividend is being maintained at 2p.</p>

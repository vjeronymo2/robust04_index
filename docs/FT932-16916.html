			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Pak Suzuki reduces loss PAK Suzuki Motors, the Karachi-based car maker in which Suzuki Motor of Japan holds 40 per cent, has reported a reduced net loss of Rs71m (Dollars 2.68m) for the first half to the end of December, from Rs170m a year earlier, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The result is the first since the company was privatised last summer. Pre-tax losses fell to Rs78m from Rs159m on turnover 14 per cent lower at Rs2.48bn compared with Rs2.14bn. Suzuki produces Pakistan's smallest and most popular car. The business received a boost last year when Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan prime minister, ordered a nationwide loan scheme to help the unemployed buy Suzuki taxis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, Nov 20 (KCNA) -- The DPRK State  Environmental Committee issued a statement today denouncing  Russia and Japan for continuously dumping nuclear waste  massively to destroy the sea environment and seriously threaten  the existence of the population in the littoral areas.    The statement urged that the incumbent authorities of Japan  and Russia should promptly stop the criminal acts of dumping  nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean  and, at the same time, remove the already dumped nuclear waste  from the sea without delay and punish those responsible for it.    ``If Russia and Japan continue with their illegal nuclear  waste dumping in disregard of the aspiration of mankind for  environmental protection of the earth, they would be held wholly  responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom,'' warned  the statement.    Recalling that Russia and Japan have annually dumped a large  amount of nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the  Pacific Ocean illegally, it says:    ``Such acts of Russia and Japan are a breach of the  international conventions on protection and conservation of the  sea environment; they are criminal acts of polluting and  wrecking the sea environment and jeopardizing the lives of the  population in the littoral countries.''    ``To protect and conserve the sea environment is a unanimous  demand of the peoples in the littoral areas. And it is already  stipulated under international agreement that radioactive waste,  even less activated one, can never be dumped into the sea.''    ``Moreover, Russia and Japan, as signatories to the London  conventions, are obligated to strive for the prevention of sea  pollution.''    ``This notwithstanding, they are not only vyingly dumping  nuclear waste but also releasing at random even liquid  radioactive pollutants. We cannot but take a serious note of  it.''    ``Such acts of Russia and Japan destroying the earth  environment now are causing deep apprehensions and protests from  the peoples in Asia and the rest of the world and environmental  organizations.''    ``It is ridiculous, indeed, of Russia and Japan to  vociferously urge us to `comply with the Nuclear Safeguards  Agreement', while openly violating the international  conventions, an act reminding us of a thief crying `stop  thief!'''    ``Japan must not try impudently to cover up its wicked acts  in quickening its pace toward nuclear armament by taking issue  with others, but give up the nuclear armament. And Russia, too,  had better control its own nuclear weapons properly, instead of  joining force in slinging mud at other countries, only bringing  disgrace on itself.''    ``The DPRK State Environmental Committee expresses the hope  that the international organisations concerned and the  governments of all countries will pay due attention to it and  exercise their influence so that nobody ever can destroy the  ecological environment of the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific  Ocean.''</p>

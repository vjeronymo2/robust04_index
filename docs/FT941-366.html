			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bemrose earnings are upgraded by analysts Analysts have upgraded their earnings forecasts for Bemrose, the Derby-based security and promotional printer, following the group's Dollars 27m year-end acquisition of McCleery-Cumming, the second largest US publisher of advertising calendars. On Monday Bemrose, which has become the largest supplier to the US advertising specialty market following a series of acquisitions, announced a 73 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.8m and a 37 per cent increase in earnings per share to 30.47p. The McLeery-Cumming acquisition became effective on December 31 so its results were not included in the 1993 accounts. Mr Rodger Booth, chief exceutive, said earlier this week that it was too early for meaningful results, but noted that Bemrose has already achieved significant cost savings at McCleery-Cumming as a result of senior managers retiring, a review of purchasing policy and through better capacity utilisation. Analysts now expect the expanded Bemrose group to report pre-tax profits of around Pounds 15.5m this year, generating earnings per share of about 31p. Yesterday Bemrose's shares closed 6p lower at 447p, reflecting the weak market and theyare trading on a prospective multiple of 14.4.</p>

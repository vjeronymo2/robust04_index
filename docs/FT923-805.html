			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Meet Gabriel and Sebastian IF YOU ask me, the wrong man jumped this week. David Mellor, Britain's tousled Minister for Fun, resigned on Thursday - victim of the smutty and vindictive malcontents who run the tabloid press - whereas John Major and Norman Lamont, who have created a black hole where economic policy used to be, did not. Mellor's behaviour - adultery and whatnot - was a tad simple-minded. But it was definitely none of our business: not yours, mine, or the smutties'. He should have stayed at his desk. His hounding diminishes all of us. Conversely, Major and Lamont, whose insouciance seems to soar the faster they steer their craft into the heart of the black hole, are still in business, still making totally useless decisions as they squirm from one debacle to the next. It's a funny old world. But help is close at hand. Their lives are being remodelled. I was on holiday last week. Majorca, as it happens. In a villa above Pollensa. Swimming pool. Gardens. A maid who called in daily. Among Pollensa's attractions is the Restaurant Clivia on Avinguda Pollentia (proprietors: Domingo y Joaquin) which I love like life itself. I was there on Sunday evening, dining with Miss Lee, my executive assistant, when who should sweep up to us but my good friend Wayne Talent. He was wearing an aubergine suit with a carnation in each buttonhole, while his startling array of caps (Harley Street: Pounds 18,000) caused glints of polar light to flicker around our table in dramatic and eerie fashion. 'Thought I'd find you here,' said this aubergine apparition. 'Street guy like you, knows where it's buttered.' He barely glanced at Miss Lee. Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent, the Notting Hill racketeer of Martin Amis's London Fields. Keith is still in prison. Wayne, for his part, claims never to have heard of Amis or his novels - 'sounds like a plonker' - though he keeps in touch with Keith. Wayne is a friend of Dorothy's: 28-ish, gaunt, street-wise - rich. Quite extravagantly rich. Money just sticks to him. Like most of the rich I know, including numerous sheikhs, Wayne is using the present hiatus in the global economy to buy assets at bargain prices, mainly property and art. 'Goya, Luti, Clave, Hockney, Borofsky, porcelain, carpets, jewellery - anything at all, Mike - Rollers, racehorses, stud farms, watermills. Stands to reason, dunnit? Rock-bottom prices. Time to make a killing. You can't beat basic assets.' 'Is that why you're in Majorca?' 'Only briefly, Mike. I own a few farms here. Also three hotels. I could let you have a farm, Mike, rustic on the outside, gold taps inside. The sort of thing you like, Mike, street guy like you, wasn't born in a stationery cupboard. The peseta's ducking and diving. Time to plunge in, Mike. Call it fifty thou.' 'Fifty thousand sterling?' 'Sterling would be all right.' 'But the markets are quaking and heaving.' 'Don't worry about the markets. All you have to do is watch your basic asset prices indexed in Swiss francs. I'll give you a ready reckoner. It's how the rich stay rich.' 'But what about John and Norman? Won't they be the ruin of us?' 'Remember what I told you, Mike, just before the election. I asked you what the difference was between Tories, Labour, Liberals. I said: 'The only difference between them, Mike, is 175 Footsie points, maybe 200 - peanuts, cashew nuts.' On the other hand, Major and Lamont have clearly got to go. That's what I've been fixing, me and various sheikhs, plus the Palma authorities. 'Here's how the deal looks. We'll give you a farmhouse here, though we'll show it on the books as a sale at fifty thou. We'll include some Goya etchings, plus a Hockney and a Roller. And we'll throw in a couple of staff  -a gardener and a handyman. They'll have authentic Spanish passports, fresh sets of fingerprints - completely new identities. 'They'll live in a little cottage by the side of your farmhouse and will work from morn to night. They'll be called Gabriel and Sebastian. Gabriel wears glasses and likes to watch cricket. Sebastian has funny hair. You will keep an eye on them. If they try to run away, shoot them with a shotgun. But we're not expecting trouble. From what we all know of them, they'll be happy to hoe and plough until there is nothing left but dust.'</p>

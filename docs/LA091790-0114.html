			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LAND REFORM VOTE URGED BY GORBACHEV  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, assailed for indecision on overhauling the  economy, called today for a national referendum on whether to end the  collectivization of farmland and return it to individuals.  </P> <P> It apparently would be the first national referendum ever in the Soviet Union,  and Gorbachev's proposal reflects the deep split in opinion about how to rescue  the economy.  </P> <P> He spoke a day after 50,000 protesters marched to the Kremlin and demanded the  resignation of Gorbachev and his prime minister over the state of the economy,  which is plagued by under-productivity and worsening consumer shortages.  </P> <P> In a 30-minute address to the national Parliament today, Gorbachev said the  fate of farmland "is too big a decision, comrades, to be made in offices,  auditoriums or meeting halls -- even as important as the one in which we are  working today."  </P> <P> Gorbachev stopped short of advocating any specific proposals.  </P></p>

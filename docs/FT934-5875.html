			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc allotments scaled down Strong demand for shares in the privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, has prompted the government to scale down allocations for individual investors, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday. Individual investors will receive a minimum of 16 shares in the company, the second to be privatised as part of the government's programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. Investors who applied for a separate allocation, to be paid for with Balladur bonds - a government debt issue launched last summer - will be entitled to a further 15 shares. Individuals were originally offered 60 shares in Rhone Poulenc, and a further 60 if they paid with Balladur bonds. The issue, however, was three times oversubscribed, prompting the reduced allocations and a clawback of 15 per cent of the shares allocated to institutional investors. Mr Alphandery described yesterday's allocations as the 'very minimum'. 'The remainder will be shared out in the next few days' he said. The price set for individual investors was FFr135 per share, compared with the FFr146 paid by institutional investors. Yesterday, Rhone Poulenc's shares fell by FFr3.8 to FFr150.1.</p>

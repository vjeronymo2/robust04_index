			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kong Lingtong (1313 0109 6894): "Experts' Vision </F> Sharp in the Final Analysis"]    [Text] The so-called "Desert Sword" ground warfare in the  Gulf War ended abruptly leaving many non-participants with a  sense of unfulfillment. Chinese weapons experts, who had hoped  to sift some useful information from the give and take of real  battle and fighting at close quarters between the two sides,  were particularly disappointed. They were very much dissatisfied  with CNN's constant transmission of pictures showing laser  guided devices locking on and hitting targets. They felt that  this was scare tactics to a certain extent, and might even be  showing off or bravado.    Finally, they obtained some relatively firsthand material in  the form of a stack of photographs taken on the spot by the  Chinese observers that the UN had sent to the Iraq border to  supervise the cease fire. When the war first ended, the scorched  earth and the wreckage of tanks and armored personnel carriers  as far as the eye could see conveyed the feeling of an enormous  graveyard. Naturally, the Chinese observers' cameras focused  mostly on Iraqi T-72 tanks inasmuch as these tanks were closest  to China's own equipment in terms of historical background and  performance. Thus, they were of greater interest to them.    The scene in one photograph was rather sorrowful. The  wreckage of a T-72 tank lay twisted in a destroyed desert  revetment, its tracks buried in the desert sand, its large  caliber gun wrenched to the side, but its anti-aircraft gun  facing straight ahead. In the middle of the armor on the front  of the tank was a large shell hole torn by the steel core of a  low-grade uranium armor piercing shell from an American M1A1  tank. From a cursory glance, this seemed to confirm that the  T-72 tank was not the equal of the M1A1. It had been hit  straight on. However, our tank experts are not simpletons who  parrot the views of others. After scrutinizing the photograph,  they found the real reason this tank had been destroyed.    "Look. Here's a clue," said one research institute tank  expert explaining a detail he had found. "In the photograph, the  T-72's gun barrel is not facing in the direction of fire of the  American tank like the muzzle of the machine gun, but 45 degrees  to the right.... What does this show? It shows that before it  was hit by the M1A1 shell, the crew had run away. One feature  of the T-72 is that the tank driver entry hatch is located under  the gun barrel, so unless the turret is moved a certain amount,  the personnel inside the tank cannot raise the hatch to get out.  Clearly, the destroyed tank was not in combat mode at the time.  It had been abandoned. How would you judge this kind of  destruction? Should you blame the personnel or blame the tank?"  This expert made a conclusion: "I do not feel this was a real  tank war inasmuch as the morale of one side was undermined and  it abandoned its equipment. They did not resist."    The American M1A1 is one of the world's most advanced land  warfare weapons. Of this, there is no doubt. However, the  difference between it and the T-72 is by no means the difference  between heaven and earth. For psychological warfare reasons,  long before the ground warfare began, the American army  conducted a lot of propaganda through the news media, claiming  that it had "an effective range twice that of Iraq's best T-72  tank."    Was it really all that wonderful? Our experts had  reservations from the very beginning. They believed real data  more. The fire control systems of the two tanks are on a par;  they both use smooth-bore guns, and the T-72's gun diameter is  125 mm while the M1A1's is 120 mm. The T-72's armor piercing  shells have an muzzle velocity of 1,800 meters per second; the  M1A1's 1,650 mm per second. What is more, the T-72's trajectory  is flatter; thus, it has a very high hit rate without using its  complex fire control system. Therefore, our exports were  anxious to find out whether these two weapons really battled  each other in a true sense. Was the overnight collapse of the  Iraqi armored corps, which was equipped with more than 1,000  T-72 tanks, because its personnel did not stand the test or  because the tanks did not stand the test?    The experts had sharp eyes. The above problems could not be  approached solely from the angle of a confrontation between  weapons. The Iraqi high command robbed the tank corps of its  assault and maneuverability advantages by placing in defensive  fortifications, where it became a target, a fine weapon that  might have been able to fight off the enemy. Even when the enemy  moved several hundred kilometers westward, leaving his flanks  exposed, it did not organize a powerful counterattack. The  soldiers carrying out the combat mission had also not recovered  from the suffering and exhaustion of the war between Iraq and  Iran before being sent into battle again. They also had a  muddled idea about the goals of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and  about this war. In addition, after the war broke out, command  was paralyzed, supplies were cut off, and many soldiers were  semi-starved or had no fresh water to drink, so how could their  morale be good? Consequently, during 100 hours of ground  warfare, the multi-national forces captured 2,100 Iraqi soldiers  for every man they lost. For every tank they lost, they  destroyed 1,878 tanks and armored personnel carriers. Certainly,  this was unique in the annals of modern warfare. Nevertheless,  anyone who knows anything at all about warfare also realizes  that surrender without fighting, and abandonment of vehicles was  also a very large factor.    The detail that our tank experts revealed should not be  belittled. It sets to rights the ballyhoo of some press media as  well as the acceptance of this ballyhoo as true by some people.  One should take the evaluation of the victors with a grain of  salt! This is because the "one-sidedness" of this war did not  stem completely from the too great technical backwardness of one  of the contestants. The personnel were not tough enough. Even  though the T-72 is slightly inferior to the M1A1, both can  inflict severe damage on each other. The cost of manufacturing  each M1A1 is $2 million, but a T-72 costs much less. Even a  "gold dollar empire" cannot afford this expense except for a  death-defying struggle. To regress at bit, the Iraqi army  relied on the laying of more than 20 million land mines  (including some high technology smart mines) in a defense zone,  and the use of T-72s to organize several pretty good battles to  oppose their removal (unfortunately they did not!). Naturally,  in considering the above, the experts subconsciously thought  something they did not say and that is not nice to say, namely:  "No question about it; things would have been different had it  been our troops in the same T-72s."    Having said this, the writer feels a statement that Mao  Zedong made some years ago in "On Protracted War" would be most  appropriate: "Soldiers are the foundation of an army. Unless the  armed forces are infused with political spirit, and unless  progressive political work is done to make this infusion, the  will to resist cannot be aroused to the maximum in officers and  men, and the best technical and tactical foundation cannot be  obtained for making the most of their effectiveness."  (Selected Works of Mao Zedong).    Truth may sometimes fade from people's memories, but it can  never be eradicated.</p>

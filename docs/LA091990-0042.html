			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> RACERS STOP SHORT WHEN POLICE STEP IN  </P> <P> For two elderly runners in a special foot race Tuesday, the red traffic light  was annoying enough. But the men came to a screeching halt when a policeman  ticketed them for disobeying the light.  </P> <P> The 3.1-mile race was the opening event of the Sixth Annual Gold Coast Regional  Senior Olympics of Ventura County. The games draw about 400 men and women 55  and older for events scheduled over the next three weeks.  </P> <P> After the opening ceremonies, 20 runners left the starting line at the county  Government Center in Ventura. The two men were leading the pack when they were  ticketed for going through a red light at Lark Street and Telephone Road.  </P> <P> "They were pretty upset," said Carol Gillespie, a member of the Olympic  planning committee who helped during the race. Not only that, she said, "The  policeman held up a whole bunch of runners for 10 minutes."  </P> <P> But Ventura police said the patrolman acted correctly in issuing the tickets.  </P> <P> Traffic Sgt. Carl Handy said the two men crossed Lark Street against a red  light and both were nearly hit by cars. He declined to release the names of the  men.  </P> <P> "The officer felt they were deserving of a citation, and he did exactly what he  was supposed to do."  </P> <P> He said the Police Department is usually involved when groups stage races on  city streets so traffic can be stopped for runners. But he said he did not know  whether the Olympic organization had notified the department of the race.  Gillespie didn't know either, and other race officials couldn't be reached. But  a volunteer was stationed at the Lark Street intersection make sure runners  didn't dart out into oncoming traffic.  </P> <P> The ticketing might have put a damper on the race for some, but not Maxine  Culp. The 67-year-old Ventura woman picked up a silver medal for her 44-minute  race time.  </P> <P> It was her fourth Ventura County Olympic competition, and she's brought home  medals from them all. She's foremost a walker, but she trained for the race by  running through her neighborhood.  </P> <P> "I got hooked on walking about five years ago," the retired registered nurse  said after the race. She walks three times a week at the Buenaventura Plaza  mall with the Walk for Life program.  </P> <P> Culp was by no means the oldest competitor in the race. One contestant put down  her age as 78 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The games include golf, eight-ball pool, shuffleboard, bicycling, basketball  free throw, bowling, horseshoes, lawn bowling, slow-pitch softball, table  tennis, chess and swimming. The games will be held at recreation centers  throughout the county over the next three weeks.  </P> <P> The games, open to residents in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo  counties, will end with the closing ceremonies at the county Government Center  on Oct. 9.

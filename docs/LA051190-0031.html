			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENCEMENT 1990  </P> <P> The University of Southern California conferred degrees on 7,397 graduates  Thursday, with 1,717 receiving B.A. degrees, 1,837 B.S. degrees, 1,206 M.A.  degrees, 1,582 M.S. degrees, 474 doctor of philosophy degrees and 581  professional doctorate degrees. Robert F. Erburu (USC, 1952), chairman of the  board and chief executive officer of Times Mirror Co., delivered the keynote  address.  </P> <P> From his prepared text:  </P> <P>  "The great myth of our age is that our problems are too enormous, and our  institutions too cumbersome, and that nothing matters. The truth is that  everything matters; there is no big solution to any of our national problems,  only 240 million small ones. Those who seek solutions in the sacrificial and  honorable living of their own lives are beginning aright."  </P> <P>  Honorary degrees were awarded to Erburu; Kenneth O. Emery, marine geologist  and professor emeritus at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Cecil H. Green,  exploration geophysicist and founding member of Texas Instruments, and Jean  Rouch, professor of anthropology, University of Paris. Carlyn Renee Taylor of  Whittier, a dual-degree honors major in economics, was class valedictorian.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova </F> at Havel's country house in Hradecek; date not given:  "Conversations at Lany"--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Hulkova] One of the topics  affecting the whole world and each of us is the situation in  Sarajevo, which is now coming to a head. Although we have no  idea today what will happen at midnight this Sunday [20  February], could we discuss some aspects of what might ensue  from this situation? For example, how was this situation  reflected in our political scene? That's not an uninteresting  subject.    [Havel] It was not a simple decision. Many wise men, both  politicians and military leaders, eventually arrived at this  decision. It is quite natural that there are some in our  country who present it as a problem and who highlight some  related dangers or risks.    I think that we should not forget the main thing, which is  that this might be a real turning point in this situation.  [passage omitted]    I firmly believe that there will be no need to start bombing  artillery positions around Sarajevo. I firmly believe that this  threat will result in the genuine pullout of Serb units. I  firmly believe that this might amount to the beginning of a  process in which they stop mocking the whole world, when not  only the Serbs but also the other sides realize that the world  is genuinely interested in this matter, and when the process of  searching for a solution to this situation can perhaps begin.    I believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina should be preserved as a  state under the international auspices of the United Nations.  After all, Bosnia-Herzegovina has been internationally  recognized. We should concentrate on looking for some form of  regionalization and federalization of the state. We should  slowly but, at the same time, with all our might, look for ways  of renewing the coexistence between these ethnic groups and  communities in a single society.    [Hulkova] Mr. President, spokesmen of the Czechs living in  Kazakhstan turned to you with the issue of resettling some 160  families to our Republic because of difficult conditions of life  in Kazakhstan. Regardless of how this matter is resolved, I  would like to ask whether there are differences in our approach  to wealthy and not very wealthy foreigners who are somehow  linked to our country.    [Havel] I would not suspect the Czech Republic of this. The  case of the Kazakhs is very complicated, and I have been  following it with considerable attention. Indeed, these people  find themselves in a dangerous situation. In my view, our  Republic should accommodate their request. But they are wrong  to think that it is the president who decides about these  matters. The president is not the chief executive in our  country. I responded to their appeals by writing a letter to  the prime minister asking that the government take a position on  this matter and decide whether resettling them could be  considered. It appears that at issue is a resettlement of  individual people. Nevertheless, the decision is up to the  government. It is a matter that should not be treated with  indifference.    Although our state cannot be built along purely ethnic lines  and although we cannot elevate the feelings of Czech national  identity above everything else, I still think that, regardless  of these people being rich or poor, we should have and we should  demonstrate stronger feelings for those who originate from this  country, who speak this language, and who feel some bond with  this country.    [Hulkova] But, according to the man on the street, we are  not  very generous to those who are of little use, as it were...    [Havel, interrupting] We should discriminate against no one,  I think. By saying this I think that we should not discriminate  against the poor, who arrive here with nothing, with neither a  roof over their head nor money. But I think we should not  discriminate against the rich either. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] And now about the parliamentary session dealing  with the bill on foreign trade in military material. Is it  really true that it will substantially change the image of our  country?    [Havel] I think it is a very good law, a very strict law. By  itself, a law is not sufficient to improve the image of our  country. What is important is the practice and the application  of the law. However, the law is an important precondition. It  seems to me that this whole area will become more transparent  now. It will become clear what the state did allow and what it  did not allow, why it allowed it and why it did not allow it.  Of course, there is no law that cannot be bypassed by inventive  people. It will be important that the law is really functional  and not bypassed. That will be fundamental in securing a good  image of our state.    [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Let us return now to the  parliament. Mr. President, what adjective would you use to  describe what happened there last Friday [18 February]?    [Havel] I would rather not use any adjective. However, I  will simply say that I am very, very disappointed, even almost  outraged. The return of property to the Jewish communities is  being dragged out for too long. It is undignified, and it is  beginning to be offensive. I am very alarmed by it because an  impression is being created that we do not want to see justice  done, and it even harms our reputation abroad. It is generally  known why this law failed to be passed. An amendment was  adopted, and it must be said that it was in accordance with the  government's standpoint, that local authorities would not be  so-called legal persons, which would mean that local authorities  would decide whether these properties should be returned to the  Jewish communities or not. In case they do not return it, the  Jewish communities should be financially compensated by the  state. The reason behind this amendment was an argument that  such a thing would be a de facto expropriation serving as a  precedent for appeal by other legal persons in other restitution  claims. I think this argument does not hold water and is weak.  I understand the reasons that led to part of the Civic  Democratic Party [ODS] and the opposition being reluctant to  make the issue of local property ownership more problematic. I  understand it from the legal and economic point of view and  because of possible precedents. However, these are insufficient  reasons for postponing this matter again, for not being resolved  once again. I absolutely understand those deputies who then  left the chamber to make it impossible for the law in this form  to be passed. Next week, I plan to invite several deputies  involved in this, talk to them more thoroughly, to understand  their attitudes and arguments and find out if there is a chance  to finally solve this matter and, if so, what kind of chance.    [Hulkova] Do you think that the way we are dealing with this  matter is being observed from abroad?    [Havel] They are observing it with great attention, and I am  not sure if these legal or concrete arguments that are being  used will be understood as sufficient and legitimate arguments  by the international community. I rather doubt it. It is  likely to be understood as unwillingness of the state to release  this property, although I am convinced that our state is willing  to release this property to the Jewish communities.    [Hulkova] Let's talk about the visit of Andrey Kozyrev to  Hradecek. Can you tell us what was the main idea around which  your talks revolved?    [Havel] It was the future security setup in Europe. I  explained our position. I even drew a chart for him that he  regarded as a starting point for the debate. He himself used it  to demonstrate what his own view was. I explained to him the  reasons for our striving for future membership of NATO, my idea  of relations between NATO and Russia, and the reasons the  position of small Central European countries differed altogether  from that of Russia. I also explained to him the specific  features of Russia's position as a major nuclear power in Europe  and Asia, a power that has to have a firm partnership with NATO.  I explained to him that the (?eulogistical) nature of these  relations will always be totally different from those between  NATO and small Central European or European countries. I  explained to him that even a possible enlargement of NATO was  plausible only if solid relations with Russia existed. These  relations could also be based on the Partnership for Peace  program because this program provides for various types of  relations.    On the other hand, he explained Russia's way of thinking to  me--the reasons that Russia fears the further enlargement of  NATO, which would eventually encompass various European  countries without incorporating Russia itself. Russian society  perceives this as some kind of discrimination and alienation.    What is important, I think, is that I had a chance to look  deeper into the political ideas and the thinking behind Russian  diplomacy. I also regard as important the fact that the  minister told me that, following my explanation, his  understanding of our position is far better. He understood why  it was unsuitable to use the expression "sphere of interests"  and why we showed such displeasure at Russia using this  expression.    It was a very friendly and informal discussion and i was  also  a result of being in a home environment, but it was, in my view,  a very useful discussion. [passage omitted]</p>

I have set my course and I  will not be diverted from it. My goal is that after two years  here in the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], France  should be doing better. The record of this first year shows  many improvements."    Edouard Balladur has published the record of his first year  in government a few days ahead of schedule -- he was asked to  form the government on 29 March 1993. It is a document of  around 100 pages which, with the help of graphs, reviews in  detail all the issues tackled during this first year of change  and takes stock of the results obtained. It is a generally  positive record and one which is very encouraging for the  majority and the head of government.    Its publication on the eve of the second round of the  cantonal elections is no accident. Although the Matignon denies  turning this election, which is expected to reinforce the  majority, into a test of approval of the government's policies,  this early presentation will certainly prompt some gnashing of  teeth within the majority and criticisms from the opposition.  But the Matignon is calm. According to the prime minister's  entourage, he has never tried to turn the cantonal elections  into a test of his popularity. "It is not he who has said that  this election would make it possible to assess the popularity of  Balladur's policy. But since it has been turned into a test, it  must be admitted that it is not bad for him. He will not  complain!"    He is complaining still less because the situation in France  after the initial 12 months of his term of office is improving.  Although the economic indicators are still flashing dangerously,  they show real progress and make it possible to predict a  resumption of growth for the end of the year. The institutes  are unanimous in forecasting growth of 2 percent in December  compared with negative growth (minus 1 percent) in March 1993.    "When we came to power," the prime minister points out, "we  found a situation characterized by recession, unemployment, an  increased deficit in the budget and social security fund, a lack  of growth, and a moral crisis" which had plunged the country  into deep pessimism. The government has set to work in a  five-year timeframe, and deliberately ignored the presidential  election. Indeed, Balladur notes, the main problems which the  government encountered involved the stagnation of society and  the upcoming presidential election rather than with  cohabitation. Moreover, this cohabitation has always gone well  and has in no way hampered the government's work.    Balladur's main concern was therefore to extricate himself  as  much as possible from the stranglehold of the preparations for  the presidential election, although the Matignon points out that  history contains many prime ministers who crossed the Seine  [from the Matignon to the Elysee presidential office]. His  second concern was of a pedagogical kind: Not imposing reforms  on the French people but explaining them in advance to ensure  their acceptance. Was that the right method? "I wonder," he  said, "whether I was wrong or right to place the emphasis on the  difficulty of carrying out reforms." Because, by raising the  question, you generate debate and raise problems which go beyond  the issue at hand.    The prime minister is nonetheless categorical: The  government could not move more rapidly. The situation was worse  than expected. "We found a fragile and worried society. We had  to do things gradually, with as much consultation as possible,"  which led to "some criticisms" about lack of government action.  Remembering the past 12 months, Edouard Balladur remarked  without bitterness: "I have sometimes felt loneliness."    But the preliminary results are in. They are encouraging  with regard to the main parameters of government action --  unemployment, budget control, the restoration of the social  security fund, foreign trade, and security.    -- Unemployment: The increase in the number of people  seeking work is slowing down. It was 20,000 in the last three  months of 1993 compared with 80,000 registered in the last three  months of the Beregovoy government. It is a slowing down which  is full of promise and reflects the first effects of the  government measures. The prime minister, who refuses to engage  in a quarrel over statistics, refutes the criticisms which blame  him for the increase in unemployment from March to September  1993. "The measures which we took as soon as we came to office  could not have had an effect before September." It was from  then that an improvement was recorded. "I do not see how we  could be held responsible" for the continued rise in  unemployment between April and September "when the measures  taken could not have immediate effects."    -- Control of the state budget: The situation was not  hopeful when the transition [of government] took place. The  "budget deficit" was estimated at 343 billion francs [Fr]. The  five-year law adopted by the new government were expected to  reduce the deficit to Fr317.6 billion. The austerity measures  which were taken made it possible to improve that forecast. The  settlement of the budget resulted in a deficit of Fr315.7  billion. The government, whose objective is to reduce this  deficit to Fr200 billion in 1997 (2.5 percent of GDP), notes  with satisfaction that this initial result exceeds expectations.    -- Social security: The balance has been maintained even if  it meant increasing the CSG [General Social Contribution] by 1  percent. Edouard Balladur makes no secret of the fact that the  problem of social security funding remains worrying. By the end  of the century, the whole system of the organization and funding  will have to be reviewed in accordance with the world economic  situation. He is categorical: "We will not accept a leveling  down."    -- Foreign trade: As soon as it came to office, the  government was faced with the GATT negotiations. It faced  American demands and European hesitations with great  determination and imposed a fair compromise.    -- Security: The functioning of justice has been improved,  the fight against crime has been given new resources. Together  with a more stringent limitation of immigration, this issue was  one of the French people's priorities.    "We were elected to ensure that the state regained full  control. We have done a great deal, but a great deal remains to  be done," Edouard Balladur reaffirmed. Without dwelling too  much on his positive record, he lists the main stages of 1994 in  terms of a continuation of reforms which will take up all of  Parliament's work: new measures for employment; reform of family  allowances; reorganization of social security; the police;  justice; the overseas departments; fiscal reform; the military  programming law; the law on decentralization and regional  development. "We are tackling all the major issues which  concern France between now and the end of the century." With  the desire to develop and increase solidarity "to ensure that  nobody is left out."    One subject concerns the prime minister particularly. He  does not understand the obstinacy of high school and university  students in demonstrating against a so-called "youth minimum  wage" which "I would never accept." The provisions of the CIP  [job training contracts], although they were originally not well  drafted, are "not directed against young people. Our only  concern is to help young people find a first job, to find  something other than the ANPE [National Employment Agency] when  they leave the school system." It is not natural for us to beat  records for youth unemployment in Europe. Why should a system  that has proven its efficiency elsewhere not be feasible in  France? The prime minister's entourage, more incisive than him  on this point, referred to a degree of manipulation of young  people, a kind of protest organization to generate a social  explosion. "We have been predicting problems for a year.  Social explosion has become a fashionable subject. By talking  about it, you give people ideas."    For Edouard Balladur these demonstrations "reveal the deep  disquiet which affects young people," lost between a society  ruled by old regulations and technical progress which calls all  values into question. This disquiet also affects the whole of  society. "We must take more account of the world's development.  The (economic) emergence of the developing countries means that  the countries of Western Europe face a risk of being pushed to  the fringes." Reforms are therefore necessary to ensure that we  adapt and enter the new millennium in good condition. "It will  take us a good 10 years of adaptation." But, fortunately, if  growth picks up again, society will look to the future more  calmly.</p>

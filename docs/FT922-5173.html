			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Westland Westland's days as an independent company may be numbered. But there is still time for those analysts and institutions who wrote the group off as a basket case to have another look at the shares. Yesterday's 11 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits was an impressively solid performance and demonstrates that the bloated cost base has finally been brought under control. Margins improved in all divisions, but most notable was the way the fall in helicopter profits was kept to just 16 per cent, when turnover from this activity dropped 30 per cent. Helicopter deliveries are currently running at just 10 a year, a sixth of the level in the mid-1980s. The bull argument is that Westland is in the middle of a trough from which it will emerge triumphant in the middle of this decade. Its Sea King and Lynx will keep profits ticking over for the next couple of years. Thereafter the market for the EH101 could be enormous. The Ministry of Defence order is in the bag, but the Italians and Canadians, as well as North Sea operators, are among those expected to buy. Add in the possibility of a Black Hawk order from the Saudis and the huge civil order book on the aerospace side, and the shares more than justify their current year multiple of 13. The trouble with all this is the timing. The EH101 may occupy an attractive niche in one of the few defence sectors which is growing. But until the overseas orders start to materialise the market will doubtless treat the company's ambitious long-term forecasts with some scepticism.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News This Week: Crude oil price recovery should prevent slippage - British Petroleum First half results from British Petroleum, due tomorrow, are expected to show that the company remains on track to improve profitability and reduce debt. Analysts expect that the cost-cutting and restructuring which has been the dominant feature of the company over the past year or so will continue to underpin earnings. Second quarter earnings on a replacement cost basis are predicted to be in a range of Pounds 230m-Pounds 300m. Replacement cost net profits for the first quarter were Pounds 305m. BP should also benefit from the recovery in crude oil prices, which have risen from a low last February of around Dollars 12 a barrel for the benchmark Brent blend to the present level of more than Dollars 18 (Pounds 11.60p) a barrel. BP shares have been boosted in recent weeks by firming oil prices, as the company is one of the most highly leveraged among the oil majors to higher oil prices. There should also be signs of improved earnings from BP's chemical operations, as European demand increases in line with indications of economic recovery. NatWest Securities expects that higher crude profits will boost upstream profits by more than 20 per cent compared with the first quarter. These will be offset, however, by lower refining margins, which usually suffer when crude prices rise. Mr Simon Flowers, oil analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, said the results may also be affected by the recent weakness of the US dollar. Half of BP's oil production is in Alaska, and it has a large US dollar cost base. But most analysts are generally optimistic about the company's prospects. Mr Paul Spedding at London brokers Kleinwort Benson, which is forecasting second quarter earnings of Pounds 265m, notes that BP has surprised the market with better-than expected results for the past three quarters.</p>

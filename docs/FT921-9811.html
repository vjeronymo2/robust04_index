			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Euro-army plan attacked MR Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, yesterday attacked the Franco-German plan to create a combined European defence corps, warning that it could drive the US out of Nato, writes Quentin Peel in Munich. His sharp criticism, delivered at the Munich Security Conference, won the unlikely support of Sir Geoffrey Pattie, a former junior Tory defence minister and a leading backbench spokesman on the subject. It also reflected a bitter attack on French attitudes to Nato by Mr Richard Perle, former US under-secretary for defence.</p>

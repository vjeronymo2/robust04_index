			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST COUNTY SENIORS TO COMPARE WARES IN NORTH-SOUTH GAME  </P> <P> The Ventura County all-star baseball game, which will be played Sunday at 1  p.m. at Moorpark College, means something different to every player.  </P> <P> To pitcher John Boardman of Camarillo Christian, it's a chance to prove he can  retire hitters at a more competitive level. Boardman was 12-4 and struck out a  county-high 170 batters in the Small Schools Division.  </P> <P> To pitcher Brad Edmonds of Fillmore, it's a chance to replace the unpleasant  memory of his team's eight errors in a 10-7 loss to Beaumont in the 1-A  Division final Friday.  </P> <P> To outfielder Jason Jones of Royal, it's a chance to display the power that  produced a county-high nine home runs. Jones and other long-ball launchers will  compete in a home-run hitting contest before the game.  </P> <P> To catcher Danny Madsen of Newbury Park, it's a chance to test his arm against  fleet baserunners like Ty Hewitt of Buena and Chris Cole of Santa Paula.  </P> <P> To Mike Jenkins and Rick Langford of Marmonte League champion Simi Valley, it's  a chance to pitch against the top hitters of the Channel League.  </P> <P> To Matt Anderson of Channel League champion Buena, it's a chance to pitch  against the top hitters of the Marmonte League.  </P> <P> Anderson, who will play for the North team, is also looking forward to watching  Thousand Oaks' John Bushart pitch for the South team. Anderson and Bushart,  both hard-throwing left-handers, have scholarships to play for Cal State  Northridge next year. "I'm interested in watching Bushart throw," Anderson  said. "We're probably going to be teammates next year."  </P> <P> Anderson qualifies his comment because he could opt to sign with the Baltimore  Orioles, who selected him in the fifth round of the amateur draft Monday.  </P> <P> "This game ought to be great fun," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Thirty-nine of the county's top seniors have been invited to play in the  all-star game, which is sure to draw plenty of college and professional scouts.  </P> <P> Buena's Stan Hedegard and Santa Paula's Mark Magdaleno are co-coaches of the  North team. Fillmore's Tom Ecklund and Moorpark's Mario Porto are co-coaches of  the South team.  </P> <P> The South team will have no shortage of pitchers, according to Porto. "We have  nine guys who throw, so they'll each probably pitch one inning," he said.  </P> <P> The North team has only five pitchers. The North offense will be led by  power-hitting infielders John Johnson (.383, 5 home runs) of Channel Islands  and Tom Lunsford (.431, 6 home runs) of Buena.  </P> <P> In addition to Jones (.446) and Madsen (.369, 6 home runs), the South offense  features outfielders Geoff Black (.455, 6 home runs) of Newbury Park and Chris  Grodell (.468) of Thousand Oaks, and three infielders from Simi Valley -- Jesse  Anguiano (.405), Andy Hodgins (.442) and Terry Hill (.419).  </P> <P> </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY ALL-STARS  </P> <P> NORTH TEAM  </P> <P> Matt Anderson, Buena, p  </P> <P> Terry Armas, Oxnard, c  </P> <P> Pat Avila, Channel Islands, inf  </P> <P> Chris Castro, St. Bonaventure, p  </P> <P> Kasha Clemons, Santa Clara, inf  </P> <P> Chris Cole, Santa Paula, inf  </P> <P> Chris Gaston, St. Bonaventure, c  </P> <P> Ty Hewitt, Buena, of  </P> <P> Harvey Jones, Ventura, of  </P> <P> Tom Lunsford, Buena, inf  </P> <P> Rick Pearn, Ventura, p  </P> <P> Gary Myers, Ventura, p  </P> <P> John Rust, Rio Mesa, p  </P> <P> Steve Soliz, Rio Mesa, c  </P> <P> Shea Freeman, Rio Mesa, of  </P> <P> Reyno Ortega, Hueneme, inf  </P> <P> John Johnson, Chan Islands, inf  </P> <P> David Lucio, Channel Islands, of  </P> <P> Co-Coaches: Stan Hedegard,  </P> <P> Buena; Mark Magdaleno, Santa Paula  </P> <P> SOUTH TEAM  </P> <P> Jesse Anguiano, Simi Valley, inf  </P> <P> Steve Biggs, Camarillo, p  </P> <P> Geoff Black, Newbury Park, of  </P> <P> John Boardman, Camarill Ch., p  </P> <P> John Bushart, Thousand Oaks, p  </P> <P> Jeremy Dewey, Newbury Prk, p  </P> <P> Brad Edmonds, Fillmore, p  </P> <P> Chuck Foster, Westlake, inf  </P> <P> Dan Glassman, Calabasas, p  </P> <P> Chris Grodell, Thou Oaks, of  </P> <P> Terry Hill, Simi Valley, inf  </P> <P> Andy Hodgins, Simi Valley, inf  </P> <P> Mike Jenkins, Simi Valley, p  </P> <P> Jason Jones, Royal, of  </P> <P> Rick Langford, Simi Valley, p  </P> <P> Danny Madsen, Newbury Park, c  </P> <P> Zac Miller, Agoura, of  </P> <P> Keith Orford, Moorpark, p  </P> <P> Gary Silverman, Oak Park, inf  </P> <P> Derek Tamburro, Westlake, c  </P> <P> Nelson Townes, Agoura, inf  </P> <P> Co-Coaches: Tom Ecklund,  </P> <P> Fillmore; Mario Porto, Moorpark  </P></p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Currency contortions cast a cloud GILTS came under pressure as sterling found itself in the crossfire of turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. With a strong D-Mark continuing to put other EMS currencies under strain, the pound fell last week against the German currency, closing on Friday night within about 1 pfennig of its DM2.778 floor. The weaker sterling reduced demand for gilts, with prices slipping back along the yield curve. That corresponded to a rise in yields of about 20 basis points (0.2 percentage point) with the increase being most significant for shorter dated gilts. With currency markets tense during much of last week, the Bank of England found less than rapturous welcome among investors for its auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2017. This was oversubscribed by a factor of about 1.2, rather smaller than for earlier gilt auctions of this type. Also, the recent fall in gilt prices meant the Bank gained rather less funds from the exercise than it might have hoped for. The cash will enable the government to finance this year's public sector borrowing requirement, which is expected to add up to more than Pounds 30bn. One school of thought among gilts observers is that the Bank's large requirement to sell bonds to fund the PSBR will at some point almost certainly draw in large numbers of overseas buyers. Demand from these groups would help underpin sterling. However, a less optimistic gloss is that the weakness in sterling, assuming the currency remains fragile for the foreseeable future, may frighten away overseas buyers and cause them to purchase government bonds issued by other countries instead. Overshadowing events in the gilt market - and all the other main bond markets in Europe - has been indications that France might reject European economic and monetary union in its referendum on September 20. That could lead to large selling of gilts, as well as of bonds denominated in other currencies regarded as weak, while German government bonds would probably see higher demand. Since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in early June, yields for German bonds have come down slightly, while those for other countries' bonds have risen. While the difference between gilt yields and German bond yields has increased over this period by roughly 40 basis points, the comparable figure for French bonds has been about 70 basis points. In the case of Italian bonds, the yield spread has increased by 120 basis points. On the basis of these figures, the extra 'risk premium', in the form of higher interest rates, that investors demand for holding gilts compared with German bonds has been somewhat less than the additional premium demanded for French and Italian bonds. However, that is probably not all that comforting to gilt investors, given that the French franc and the Italian lira are two of the other extremely weak currencies in the EMS grid.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Wang Tonghui, deputy director </F> of the Jilin Provincial Restructuring Committee, on  standardizing and developing the shareholding system by  reporters Li Zhihua (2621 1807 5478) and Jiang Yunshan (1203  0061 3790)]    [Text] Question [Q]: Is it necessary to carry out the  shareholding system under the current situation of reforming the  enterprise property rights system?    Answer [A]: The reform in the preceding stage was only a  policy readjustment characterized by delegating power and  conceding benefits. The enthusiasm mobilized through this  reform was limited. Simultaneously, this reform also brought  about some short-term activities and some other problems.  Enterprises had no effective mechanisms for restriction of  property rights because state-owned assets lacked definite  personified representatives. The fundamental way for solving  these problems is to reform the enterprise property right system  and to set up a modern enterprise system. Carrying out the  shareholding system among state-owned enterprises is an  important form to set up the modern enterprise system as well as  a fundamental orientation for deepening the enterprise reform.  Through the implementation of the shareholding system, we can  not only collect funds for enterprises to make development but  also help change the enterprise managerial mechanism.    Q: What targets shall we attain by setting up the modern  enterprise system?    A: The targets that we will attain by setting up the modern  enterprise system are as follows: First, the relations of  property rights will be clear. The state-owned assets of  enterprises belong to the state. Enterprises possess the  property rights of the whole legal persons which are composed of  the investors, including the state. Second, enterprises with  the property owned by the whole legal persons will be  independent for management, assume sole responsibility for  profits or losses, pay taxes according to regulations, and hold  themselves responsible to the investors in guaranteeing and  increasing the assets. Investors enjoy the rights and interests  of owners according to the amounts of the investment they have  made. Third, the system of separating government functions from  enterprise management will be carried out. Fourth, an  enterprise leadership system and an organizational managerial  system will be set up. A managerial mechanism of linking  encouragement with restriction should take shape.    Q: What achievements and experiences has our province made  and gained in carrying out the shareholding system?    A: In 1993, our province had 535 shareholding enterprises  (excluding shareholding cooperative enterprises,) an increase of  640 percent over the figure in 1992; 135 limited companies, an  increase of 575 percent; and 400 limited liability companies, an  increase of 670 percent. The value of shares totaled 15.847  billion yuan, an increase of 487 percent over the figure in  1992. By carrying out the shareholding system, enterprises  collected more than four billion yuan of funds from society  (excluding the shareholders as legal persons.) Our province is  among the best in the whole country in terms of the number of  shareholding enterprises and the value of total shares.    The newly organized shareholding enterprises have high  enthusiasm and more flexible managerial mechanisms. These  enterprises are full of vitality and become more prosperous by  bringing into play the advantages of independent management and  sufficient capital. The investigations on 100 enterprises made  by a provincial-level organ last July showed that only 10  percent of the enterprises were full of vitality and three types  of foreign-funded enterprises, town and township enterprises,  and shareholding enterprises accounted for a larger proportion.  Practice showed that the shareholding system has advantages.  The shareholding system, as a kind of managerial mechanism,  has a long-standing history. However, it has been regarded as a  form of the modern enterprise system in China only for several  years. In a sense, the shareholding system is comparatively  strange to us in terms of theory and practice. Through the  practice over the past years, we have made some theoretical  breakthroughs, gained some experiences, grasped some things of  regularity, and created some new ways for changing the  managerial mechanism.    Q: Do you think any problems exist in the trial  implementation of the shareholding system?    A: First, the shareholding rights are set up in a plural and  complicated way. There are shares held by the state, legal  persons, the masses in society, and the staff and workers of  enterprises as well as A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares. But,  the shareholders with the same amounts of shares are not  guaranteed to enjoy the same rights, gain the same profits, run  the same risks, and assume the same responsibilities. All this  affects the normal operation of the stock markets and the  shareholding system. Second, speaking from a macroeconomic  point of view, we know that the stock markets throughout the  country have a limited capacity. Speaking from a microeconomic  point of view, we know that supply exceeds demand on the stock  markets. The stock markets are slump, and the stock price  levels fall. All this is not well coordinated with the national  economic development situation, enterprises' achievements, and  the price hike tendency.    The people ideologically pay more  attention speculation to the neglect of investment. Therefore,  speculation activities exist in the deals on stock markets.  But, we must regard the long- and medium-term investment as the  foundation and take the industrial policies into consideration.  3. We pay excessively more attention to the collection of funds  to the neglect of the change of managerial mechanisms. 4.  Viewing the overall situation, we know that the legislative  stagnation affects the sound development of the stock markets  and the shareholding system. 5. There are no sufficient  talented persons with the ability in standardizing the operation  of the shareholding system and publicly distributing stocks.    Q: What plans for the trial implementation of the  shareholding system does the province have in 1994?    A: In 1994, we should put the trial implementation of the  shareholding system in the overall situation of setting up the  modern enterprise system and the socialist market economic  system, standardize the system strictly according to the "law  governing companies," develop it in the course of  standardization, and standardize it in the course of development.    Specifically speaking, we should consolidate and improve  limited companies (including the companies whose shares are  listed,) positively develop limited liability companies, and  vigorously carry out the shareholding system.    1. We should conscientiously sum up the experiences in  carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis gained in  the preceding stage and conscientiously examine the situation in  the operation of the limited companies where reform has been  carried out so as to standardize these companies and set up  brand-new shareholding enterprise management and operation  mechanisms; with the focus on defining the limits of duties and  the work procedures for boards of directors, boards of  supervisors, shareholders congresses, general managers, party  committees, and trade unions; and to make the shareholding  enterprises be worthy of the name. 2. It is necessary to carry  out, on a trial basis, the system where enterprises' property is  "owned by the state and the property rights are wholly sold to  the enterprises themselves." We should start from balancing the  relations of property rights to establish main operators for the  management of state-owned assets. According to the forms of  "state ownership and commissioned management" and "state  ownership and enterprise management," we should establish  limited liability companies with the "rights to management of  state-owned property." 3. We should carry out the shareholding  cooperative management system. On the basis of checking up on  assets, evaluating assets, and defining property rights and  according to the standards for the shareholding system, we  should conduct reform among collective enterprises and some  small state-owned enterprises. The assets of former enterprises  are converted into stocks according to relevant regulations,  staff members and workers are allowed to be shareholders, and  new enterprise organizational system and new managerial entities  should be set up so that enterprises will become new managers  that assume responsibility for their own profits, run risks, and  undertake limited responsibilities. 4. The departments  concerned under the governments should positively attend to the  setup of intermediate organizations and provide high-quality  service for stock markets and the shareholding system. 5. We  should strengthen theoretical research and media propaganda on  stock markets and the shareholding system, cultivate skilled  persons, accurately give guidance, and ensure the smooth  development of stock markets and the shareholding system.</p>

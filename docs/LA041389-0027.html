			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USEFUL TIPS ON BANANAS  </P> <P> Here are some useful tips on bananas:  </P> <P>  -- Bananas will ripen more quickly if placed in a brown paper bag and held at  room temperature.  </P> <P>  -- Banana garnish: Run the prongs of a fork lengthwise down a peeled banana  then slice crosswise for dainty crinkly edged rounds.  </P> <P>  -- Coat sliced banana for salads with lemon juice to keep from browning.  Orange or pineapple juice is also good and adds a pleasant flavor.  </P> <P>  -- Toast thick banana bread slices and top with peanut butter and jelly for a  quick breakfast with a glass of milk.  </P> <P>  -- Freeze a banana in its peel. Thaw slightly, peel and slice into dessert  dish and drizzle with a teaspoon of maple syrup. A wonderful low-calorie  dessert.  </P> <P>  -- Bananas pack easily in brown-bag lunches. They come in their own wrapping  and need no further preparation.  </P></p>

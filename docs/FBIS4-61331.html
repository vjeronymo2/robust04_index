			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, 4 May -- A meeting on settling the  Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh opened today at  Kyrgyzstan's government house. President Askar Akayev addressed  those present:    The Karabakh conflict is a complex knot of problems that has  centuries old traditions. Generations of people of the two  fraternal republics should not be victims of historic mistakes  and contradictions. It is our belief that these problems should  be solved today on the basis of present day realities, on the  principles of tolerance and mutual concessions. The fact that  the Karabakh problem is being discussed within the framework of  the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which is led by the  Vladimir Shumeyko, allows us to believe that Legislative  Branches of power will find a safe mechanism for putting out the  flame of the fraternal war. There are no winners in this war.  Your efforts aimed at peaceful settlment of the Karabakh  conflict will be appreciated by future generations and by  history. I wish you success in your job, peace and well being  to your people.    [Signed] President Askar Akayev.</p>

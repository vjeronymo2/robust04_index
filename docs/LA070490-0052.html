			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRWINDALE TO PAY FORMER CONSULTANT $1.28  MILLION  </P> <P> The Irwindale City Council has agreed to pay former redevelopment consultant  Fred Lyte $1.28 million to end a lengthy legal battle stemming from his firing  in December, 1988.  </P> <P> Lyte was let go when city officials decided that his contract, which gave Lyte  3% of the building permit fees garnered from the city's redevelopment zone, was  too generous.  </P> <P> The city later sued Lyte for $2 million, claiming he had violated his contract  by recommending projects in which he had a financial interest.  </P> <P> Lyte denied that and countersued for $1.4 million in back pay. The decision to  settle out of court was, according to city council members, an attempt to save  legal fees, for which the city already had spent $500,000, not an admission of  guilt.  </P> <P> Lyte said that he was pleased and added: "They paid me what they owed me."  </P></p>

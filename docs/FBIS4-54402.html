			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- In 1993 state-controlled  agricultural enterprises sustained losses of 3.5 billion leva,  900 million leva more than 1992, Mrs. Lili Petrova, deputy head  of the Economic Management Department of the Ministry of  Agriculture, told a news conference today. According to figures  quoted by the ministry, 64 percent of the fixed assets of  agricultural enterprises are in machines and equipment, but a  considerable part of them have been mortgaged.    The worst loss-makers in 1993 were freshwater fish-farming  and pig-breeding, which account for more than 62 percent of the  aggregate losses of agriculture. The flour-milling and  animal-feed industries, seed production, and veterinary services  were the only profitable operations.    The total debt of agriculture is 14.6 billion leva; 8.6  billion of them are owed to banks, and the rest to suppliers.  As little as 524 million leva of the loans were spent on  investment. A shortage of current assets, impossibility to  service bank loans and lack of investors' interest were once  again the major problems of agriculture last year, Mrs. Petrova  said.    The Agricultural Ministry sees a way out of this situation  in  closing down the worst loss-makers and rehabilitating the rest.  Privatization of the enterprises is another alternative, but the  ministry is running into difficulties with that because of their  dire financial straits. In spite of the large debts incurred,  the banks have not filed for the bankruptcy of agricultural  enterprises so far, as they still expect that the public purse  will take over the nonperforming loans. In spite of all the  requests made by the Agricultural Ministry, the government has  not made a decision so far on a write-off of the non-performing  loans in the sector, Mrs. Petrova recalled.</p>

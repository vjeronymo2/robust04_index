			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort strong The rehabilitation of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, was taken a stage further yesterday after the bank announced its long awaited new senior management structure. Sir Nicholas Redmayne and Mr David Clementi will share the chief executive role at the merchant bank. The moves were greeted enthusiastically by the stock market, where Kleinwort Benson shares, savaged in the aftermath of the stock market crash of October 1987 and also by a disastrous bought deal in Premier Consolidated Oilfields, surged ahead 30 to 591p, their highest closing level since just before the 1987 crash. A banking specialist commented: 'After their half-year performance there was really no need for any major upheavals in Kleinwort's businesses; the news got a very receptive audience.' However, he also attributed part of yesterday's upsurge in Kleinwort shares to an ever tightening squeeze on marketmakers' short positions in the stock. SG Warburg also participated in the strong showing of the merchant banks sector, finishing 12 up at 942p. News that Lasmo is selling Pounds 123m of offshore North Sea assets, including part of its Liverpool Bay and Southern Gas Basin interests, came as a surprise to the market. The shares' failure to make progress after the move, generally greeted favourably by oil sector analysts, was attributed to hefty selling pressure by one of the leading US invest-ment banks involved in marketmaking in the UK. Lasmo shares closed a penny harder at 114p. Turnover was a hefty 5.2m shares. 'It is a good deal for Lasmo and they got a good price; it is gratifying that the Lasmo directors are aggressively managing the company's assets after the problems of the past year or so,' said an analyst. British Gas was the market's most heavily traded stock, with more than 23m shares changing hands. The stock price retreated 13 1/2 to 333 1/2 p, still burdened by the market's poor reception of the Department of Trade move to dismantle British Gas's monopoly in the domestic gas market. There was also evidence of large-scale switching out of British Gas and into British Petroleum. The latter improved to 358p following the switch moves, but attracted flurries of US selling late in the session and closed marginally easier at 355p. Reuters jumped 44 to 1816p on a stock shortage in the wake of a number of relatively large delayed trades which made up a large portion of the day's 1.2m share trading volume in the stock. The shares initially hit an all-time intraday high of 1822p. Earlier SG Warburg reaffirmed the share on an international asset allocation list which included nine other UK stocks. International publisher Reed International forged ahead 22 to 890p, with dealers focusing on a buy note from US house Goldman Sachs. Goldman was unavailable for comment. Chemicals concern ICI dipped 4 to 754p after BZW, the company's joint broker, reduced its forecast for the group's 1994 profits. The securities house said it had adjusted its forecast down by around 8 per cent but was still above Hoare Govett's Pounds 350m bottom of the range estimate. BZW added that it expected the shares to fall by between 5 and 10 per cent before they became a 'compelling buy'. Also in the chemicals sector, Courtaulds fell 10 1/2 to 455p as a result of a technical trade in the options market by one securities house left with too much stock on its hands. The trade offset the potentially beneficial effect of a Pounds 2.7m disposal by the company. Courtaulds sold its industrial paints business to Croda International, which eased a penny to 327p. A worsening stock shortage and some determined buying by one of the leading UK marketmaking houses was said to have driven the banks sharply better in early trading. Best levels were not always held, however, and TSB ended a net 1 1/2 off at 251 1/2 p, after climbing to 258p at the outset. Sun Alliance, 5 up at 378p, shrugged off suggestions of a Smith New Court downgrade. Construction group Costain attracted some heavy activity - 5.7m traded  - and closed 1 1/2 ahead at 28p, with institutions said to be chasing the stock as a strong recovery prospect. Food retailers came under renewed pressure as stories persisted of an imminent outbreak of price wars and continued fretting over margins. Hoare Govett added to concern in Argyll Group, arguing that the stock was particularly prone to eroding margins. The shares declined 4 1/2 to 275 1/2 p. In a mixed food manufacturing sector, Strauss Turnbull emerged as a strong buyer of Perkins Foods, the shares appreciating 4 1/2 to 67p. The broker argued that the stock had been oversold and that its yield was now double that of the base rate and three times the market's yield. There was another generally weak session in the drinks sector, with agency broker James Capel advising clients to take profits. Most of the falls were limited to the brewers, with Bass slipping 9 to 558p, Greenalls 5 to 450p, Boddington 7 to 282p and Whitbread 'A' 8 to 579p. Euro Disney slid 8 to 395p as auditors to the theme park operator said it may have to close if it failed in talks to restructure its financing with bankers and parent company Walt Disney by next spring. P&amp;O strengthened after announcing the Pounds 117.5m sale of a large part of its investment in a Hong Kong terminal. The company said the disposal would add profits of around Pounds 44m for 1993. The shares finished 7 higher at 646p. Positive comments from Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court were said to have helped British Aerospace move forward 7 to 413p. Other statistics, Page 18</p>

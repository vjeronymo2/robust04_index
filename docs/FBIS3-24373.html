As is the case throughout the North, the situation in Norilsk is  utterly desperate. Workers at the plants and mines are on the  brink of holding mass protests. They sent a representative  delegation to Moscow in hopes of seeing high-level officials  with the help of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade  Unions.

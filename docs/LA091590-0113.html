			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : FORGET SCHWAB'S, JAZZ PHENOM BROWN WAS DISCOVERED AT SCHOOL  ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Vernell Brown Jr. sat in at the piano one day last year for an absent friend  during a Hamilton High School assembly called "Grammys in the Schools." Brown  played so well that his talents were immediately recognized by the president  and CEO of A &amp; M Records, Jerry Moss, who was in the audience. And now  Brown has an album quickly making its way up the jazz charts.  </P> <P> Talk about your fairy tales.  </P> <P> "I wasn't even scheduled to perform that day," says Brown, 19, who is  represented by the William Morris Agency, has a contract with A &amp; M to  record two more albums, just returned from a European tour and plays "Rhapsody  in Blue" with the Southwest Community College Symphony Orchestra on Sunday as  part of the L.A. Festival.  </P> <P> Brown's album is "Total Eclipse," produced by jazz musician Stix Hooper of the  Crusaders. Brown composed all of the songs. The cut "August" was written in his  dreams, he says. "I woke up one morning, heard most of the melody in my head,  went to the piano and wrote it down."  </P> <P> Composing music and recording albums is quite an accomplishment for someone  who's only been playing the piano seriously for three years. Brown's fairy tale  had a real-life beginning that started at age 4 with lessons on the piano as  well as drums. The piano was not his favorite instrument so he concentrated on  the drums until he was introduced to the violin as an 8-year-old. His  instructor thought he was a natural violinist. He later became obsessed with  the piano while attending the Los Angeles County High School of Performing  Arts. From there, he transferred to Los Angeles' Hamilton High School Music  Academy, where he graduated in 1989.  </P> <P> Says Vernell: "I mainly concentrated on the drums until I was 16."

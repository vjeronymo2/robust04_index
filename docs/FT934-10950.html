			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Technology: A rebel among the copycats - A Japanese group's new printer may establish a trend Buy a laser printer and help save the world. Strange as it may seem, newspaper readers throughout Europe are being urged to do just that in a series of advertisements placed by Kyocera, the Japanese company with a turnover of Y420bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Kyocera's core business is ceramics but it also makes a laser printer which it claims is environmentally more sound than those of its competitors. The claims have caused scepticism among environmental campaigners and the electronics industry. The campaigners cite Japan's poor environmental record, especially its efforts to continue whaling and its high consumption of tropical timber. The trade thinks it is commercial suicide to try to sell products on their environmental credibility alone. But Kyocera's printer, called the Ecosys, looks set to be in the vanguard of a wave of greener products from Japan, such as industrial environmental protection products and energy-saving devices. Consumer products are expected soon. 'Japanese industry is particularly sensitive to environmental issues because Japan has suffered from bad pollution in the past. The Minamata mercury poisoning is just one example,' says Yasuo Nishiguchi, Kyocera's senior managing director. 'I can understand that Japan is perceived as different because of the whaling. But the Japanese attitude is changing.' It was Nishiguchi's decision to promote the Ecosys on environmental performance. He admits that some of his European distributors, especially those in Spain and Italy, think he is wrong. 'I was concerned in April 1992 when we started the promotion because everyone was saying that the printer's environmental performance was not enough to win market share. But our message to the market is now accepted and we have met our sales targets.' Kyocera is a minnow in the worldwide office printer market, which is dominated by Hewlett-Packard, with Canon providing the core technology for most printers. The Ecosys is comparatively slower, more expensive and does not produce the same density of print as the latest models from leading competitors. Kyocera decided that if it was to compete, it needed something to differentiate its product from the rest. Ecosys's design provided the unique selling point. Conventional printers use a replaceable cartridge that contains the toner and the printing drum. The whole cartridge is thrown away when the toner runs out. While this gives high-quality printing, the throw-away design is both profligate and environmentally unacceptable. Canon and H-P have responded with recycling initiatives, but these have been largely ineffective because dealers are not obligated to take back used cartridges. H-P is about to launch 're-engineered' cartridges and a take-back scheme for old printers, but its distributors are under no obligation to accept used products from customers. Kyocera's design has a longer-lasting drum (using its ceramics technology) which is separate from the toner cartridge. The only part of the machine that has to be replaced regularly is the toner. While marginally more expensive to buy, Kyocera claims the Ecosys is more economical to run. Each page produced costs two-thirds less than the industry average. By dispensing with the disposable cartridge the design holds the high environmental ground. 'Our printer differs from the rest because of its character that combines ecology with economy. Our competitors cannot address this,' says Nishiguchi. The competitors, understandably, do not want to be drawn on these arguments. But it is clear they are doing everything possible to improve the environmental profile of their products. New models are, for example, far more energy efficient, are partly made from recycled materials, are packed in recyclable materials and accept recycled paper. Pressure to improve environmental credibility comes from diverse directions. Certain government purchasing policies now insist on the best environmental option. Kyocera recently won a big order for 1,000 printers from the German Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees in Germany, a subsidiary of the labour ministry. The US's Energy Star labelling system, which promotes energy efficiency, has driven computer and printer makers to reduce the energy consumption of their products if they want to win federal government contracts. Some big companies are also beginning to demand environmentally better products from their suppliers. Kyocera's heavy promotion - paid for by corporate headquarters to support its marketing in other countries - has underlined the issue in the printer market. Nishiguchi says the Ecosys conforms with Kyocera's avowed commitment to make products that benefit society and 'make a positive contribution to planet Earth'. 'The Japanese have a desire to be leaders in everything they do and the environment is one such area. They are very sincere about it but they are also keen to extract competitive advantage,' says Alex Mayhook-Walker, a Japanese specialist with ERM, the international environmental consultancy. Japanese trade organisations, backed by government funds, have recently commissioned research into environmental reporting, waste recycling and disposal methods for used electronic equipment. Much of this work, according to Mayhook-Walker, is linked to finding new markets. Japanese companies clearly see opportunities to sell products into the emerging environmental markets in the west. Kyocera's stab at capturing a small part of the printer market by extolling its green credentials could be an early warning to western manufacturers who feel the heat has gone out of the environmental market. 'A lot of new green products will come out of Japan soon,' says Nishiguchi.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Major attacks Labour on Scotland and Europe Mr John Major last night put defence of the constitution and preservation of Britain's independence in Europe at the centre of his strategy to counter the electoral threat from Mr Tony Blair's Labour party. On the eve of the official opening of the Tory party conference, the prime minister accused the opposition of 'pandering' to Scottish separatism and adopting a 'craven' approach to the integrationist ambitions of Britain's European partners. His comments came as Mr Jeremy Hanley, the newly-appointed but already beleaguered Tory party chairman, predicted that this week's Bournemouth gathering would demonstrate the Conservatives' credentials as 'the party of government'. Facing evidence of deep unrest among the party's grass roots supporters over the economy and the government's record on law and order, Mr Hanley told an opening news conference: 'Our aim is to produce a permanently stronger United Kingdom and tax cuts will follow.' Mr Major's speech marked a further nod in the direction of the leading figures on the Tory right who see Europe as the defining issue of the 'clear blue water' which he has promised to keep between the Conservatives and Labour. But it will add to the concern of pro-European Tories and those on the centre-left who fear Mr Blair's move into the political centre ground will drive the government towards the right. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has warned against the Tories abandoning their chosen political territory for more 'extreme' policies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, echoed that sentiment yesterday when he said the government would not abandon its commitments to the key public services to pay for pre-election tax cuts. But speaking to the traditional pre-conference dinner of party agents, Mr Major said Labour's plans for a Scottish assembly were 'explosive'. By pandering to the Scottish Nationalists, Labour risked a breach similar to that between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Turning to Europe, Mr Major said that Labour had promised to accept anything proposed by Britain's partners. It meant they could abolish 'the pound sterling' just because others wanted them to. He added: 'I have never heard such a craven attitude from a serious political party.' He insisted the Tories would stick by their principles in the face of the Labour threat. They included: freedom of the individual, responsible citizenship, an economy built on enterprise, and allowing people to keep more of the money they earn.

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSCENDING REALISM;  </P> <P> YOUNG AND GIFTED, ARTIST MEGAN HART JONES LEFT HER MARK IN THE ABSTRACT AND THE  SPIRITUAL  </P> <P> In 1987, when Megan Hart Jones was 20 years old, she painted a portrait of  herself standing -- like a saint in a medieval altar painting -- against a  brilliant gold background. It was the last work she completed before she died  later that year, the victim of a rare form of cancer that invades the adrenal  glands in the kidneys.  </P> <P> In "Soul Portrait," she seems already to inhabit some unearthly realm, blessing  the viewer with her right hand and holding a sheaf of tightly budded roses in  the crook of her left arm.  </P> <P> By all accounts devout, private, intelligent, wryly humorous, hard-working and  dedicated to her art, Jones sounds almost too good to be true. She enjoyed the  plays of Shakespeare, the music of Mozart and Vivaldi, Tina Turner and the  Eurythmics. She loved Laura Ashley clothes, the color pink, carnations and  cherry Coke. She was a loyal friend and a devoted daughter. And she was a  strikingly gifted realist artist.  </P> <P> A selection of her paintings, drawings and the tiny ceramic sculptures she made  in her last year is on view at the Ettinger Gallery of the Art Institute of  Southern California in Laguna Beach through April 28.  </P> <P> The largest group of works in the exhibition are cloud studies, carefully  worked up in graphite, watercolor or colored pencil. Jones once wrote that  clouds were "among the least explored subjects (in art). . . . They can be  represented realistically, yet at the same time appear abstract. Clouds are a  paradox and an enigma."  </P> <P> But the most compelling pieces in the show are the portraits -- of herself, her  friends and her mother, Chadlyn Jones -- and the delicate, scrupulously  rendered still lifes that she conceived of in religious terms that she  apparently never discussed, even with her closest friends.  </P> <P> Only the tiniest hints of a flesh-and-blood person with problems and doubts and  rebellions seep through the immaculate picture offered by her mother, friends  and teachers. But the central fact about her personality seems to have been the  relentless perfectionism and fierce self-control that drove her to dedicate her  life to her work and keep its deepest meanings to herself.  </P> <P> A self-portrait as Lady Macbeth from 1985 brings the viewer up short: Why would  an even-tempered, good-natured young woman choose to portray herself as  Shakespeare's malevolent heroine, the woman whose ruthlessness drove her  husband to murder his host and who bloodied her own hands in the murder of  innocent castle guards?  </P> <P> In an earlier version of the graphite drawing (in which she wears a  lace-trimmed gown designed by Laura Ashley and a favorite necklace with a  single pearl), Jones drew a snake emerging from her sleeve. Her mother says she  asked why this image had been covered up in the final version, and her daughter  replied, "It's not necessary." But Chadlyn Jones found the passage in "Macbeth"  (Act I, Scene 5, Line 66) that might make the meaning clearer:  </P> <P> "Look like the innocent flower,/ But be the serpent under 't."  </P> <P> "Is that who you are?" Chadlyn Jones asked her daughter. "No," she replied. "It  is a dual portrait." The following year, the artist noted in one of her private  jottings that her idea of a dual portrait was "a representational image of a  person and the mood or psyche of a fictional character." Perhaps the tension  she intended to create in the portrait was meant to mirror the basic human  struggle between good and evil. Perhaps she recognized, even in her own  high-minded drive to make art, echoes of the relentless, darkly directed forces  that drove Lady Macbeth.  </P> <P> Or perhaps -- as some people close to her choose to think -- the portrait was  no more than a harmless costume drama. But the more one hears about Jones'  extraordinary introspection, religious devotion and intelligence, the harder  that is to believe.  </P> <P> "From the moment she was born, I knew why I was on earth," Chadlyn Jones says.  "She went everywhere with us -- parties, luncheons with me, places where you  don't take babies."  </P> <P> Her father is artist John Paul Jones, who teaches in the UC Irvine studio art  department. When their daughter was 9, the Joneses left their airy, ocean-view  house in Laguna Beach for a 10-month sojourn in Europe, mostly in Madrid, where  they often visited the Prado to look at the paintings of the Spanish masters.  Enrolled in a private school, Megan Jones began to write stories and poems for  her own amusement, which she would continue to do for the rest of her life.  </P> <P> Chadlyn Jones says the family was not religious at all and "didn't have a Bible  in the house," but when her daughter was 12 or 13, she went to a book fair and  purchased one. Soon thereafter, at Megan Jones request, she was baptized (along  with her mother) in the Episcopal Church.  </P> <P> A couple of years later, the Joneses separated. The experience must have been  traumatic to the adolescent girl, who loved both her parents but whose  personality -- according to friends -- most resembled her father's. Perhaps  this was the time that she became the "very private person" her acquaintances  describe.  </P> <P> Mia Di Sandro -- a former neighbor and peer who had known Megan Jones since she  was 5 -- agreed that the young woman was troubled by the divorce but refused to  discuss the matter further.  </P> <P> As a young woman, Di Sandro said, Megan Jones was "very calm and levelheaded  and very respectful and accepting of other people -- not the type to make a  judgment. She didn't let people get to her." Yet she was also "a very  controlled person. She told you what she wanted to tell you."  </P> <P> At 14, Megan Jones began to study drawing evenings and Saturdays at the Laguna  Beach College of Art (the former name of the Art Institute of Southern  California). Jonathan Burke, who still teaches there, remembers his "amazement"  at her "acute observation" and "accurate perception -- how well she could lock  into form at the beginning. It seemed that (her) style was very natural to her,  as if she had already made up her mind" about the direction her art would take.  </P> <P> In high school, she developed anorexia nervosa, a psychologically motivated  aversion to eating that tends to occur in young women. Perversely, she also  loved to cook; she specialized in desserts, including puff pastry, and also  liked to make ethnic dishes. To earn money for college, she baked white  chocolate chip cookies that she sold twice a week at the cafe adjacent to the  UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery.  </P> <P> At Smith College, she chose to do a paper on anorexia for her freshman English  composition class and turned out a beyond-the-call-of-duty 48-page thesis that  won the college's Maya Yates writing prize.  </P> <P> Hal Akins, her art teacher at Laguna Beach High School, says she was one of the  "top three or four" of the approximately 15,000 students he has taught in his  38-year career.  </P> <P> "She'd sit right at the very front desk, about 3 feet from me," he remembers.  "She was very quiet and introspective. We'd have quiet conversations. We'd  discuss the philosophical content of her work. She loved to do that. . . .  There'd be kids screwing around, and she would just work. But she had a fey  sense of humor. Once in a while, she'd (deliver) a W.C. Fields-style aside to  me or to her friends."  </P> <P> Normally, Akins gives a "fairly structured" class for students in their first  and second years of high school. But in Megan Jones' freshman year, he says, he  thought she was "grounded enough to put her in the studio and turn her loose."  </P> <P> Using colored pencils, she liked to draw images from her travels in a  meticulous style. One scene -- two women in a Spanish grocery store festooned  with fruits and vegetables -- took her 4 months to complete. She patiently  applied layer after layer of Prismacolor to create the fine tonal gradations in  the cloud drawings.  </P> <P> "Her work was very traditional in a lot of respects," Akins says. "It developed  so slowly that she didn't make many mistakes in proportion."  </P> <P> A mural that Laguna Beach High commissioned from her (it hangs in the  cafeteria) shows 15 life-size images of students posing with sports equipment,  musical instruments or books. She once explained that the students are all  painted in gray because "the shadows of the past should not overwhelm these  people."  </P> <P> Her remark was just one of many tantalizingly mysterious pronouncements that  she preferred not to explain. Perhaps she meant that the students should not  feel, in later years, as though their teen-age personalities were upstaging  them. By painting their teen-age selves in gray, the young artist gave them a  more muted quality.  </P> <P> While she was still in high school, Megan Jones began to show her work locally.  It was included in an "Up and Coming" show of young artists at TLK Gallery in  Costa Mesa and group exhibits at Mills House Art Gallery in Garden Grove, the  Laguna Beach Museum of Art (as it was then known) and the Irvine Fine Arts  Center.  </P> <P> It was her idea to go to Smith College in Northampton, Mass. She was intrigued  by the prospect of living in snow country. Perhaps she saw a relationship  between New England and the British Isles, where she felt very much at home.  </P> <P> Smith is one of the Seven Sister schools -- the female version of the Ivy  League -- and it has a reputation for solid academic standards. Megan Jones,  who also played the flute and continued to pursue her creative writing,  considered herself something of a Renaissance woman. In any case, her reserve  and serious interests were vastly different from the stereotype of the Southern  California girl.  </P> <P> At Smith, one of her closest friends was Shoba Mathew, a student from India  receiving her first taste of American life.  </P> <P> "Megan was my first American friend," Mathew says. "She helped me with culture  shock of all different kinds. . . . She was a very quiet sort of person for the  most part. She never spoke unless she had something to say, like her father.  She was extremely systematic about everything she did and never wasted any  time. Freshman year, during exams (which may be taken at any time during the  exam period) she had everything done by the first day. . . .  </P> <P> "Next to my sister, she was one of the most compulsively perfectionist people I  ever knew." But she could also be "a lot of fun," Mathew says. "She was very  good at mimicking people . . . and she could do a mean imitation of Tina Turner  in 'Private Dancer.' She definitely had a sense of humor."  </P> <P> A nature lover, Megan Jones often took long bike rides and walks by herself.  "She really enjoyed being alone," Mathew says. "It re-energized her. It was  what, in the end, gave her such strength."  </P> <P> According to Mathew, Megan Jones didn't date anyone in particular, but "she  always had a dry, deadpan attitude about it. 'Well, if it happens, it happens,'  she'd say, 'but I'm not going to waste my time over it.' " (Chadlyn Jones says  her daughter once told her about a boy who called her late at night and  couldn't understand why she would rather work on her art than go out with him.  "If you don't understand that, I can't see you," she told him.)  </P> <P> Her work was "her first priority." In "Portrait of a Story," a long essay that  the young artist kept private during her lifetime (her mother arranged to have  it published after her death in a private edition published at Smith College),  Megan Jones describes her work on a still life she called "Eternal Force" --  the most ambitious drawing she made.  </P> <P> Her still life consists of several carefully positioned images: three evenly  spaced paper sacks of wildflowers; 12 lustrous loose pearls, a slice of angel  food cake with a knife and fork arranged so their shadows form a cross; an egg  in a cup, a bar of Dove soap wrapped in a napkin and a half-filled Coke bottle.  The individual texture of each object is remarkably clearly defined, from the  gleam of the silverware to the transparency of the heavy glass bottle and the  dense sponginess of the cake.  </P> <P> She wrote that she had purchased the wildflowers, stuck them in Pepperidge Farm  cookie bags and noticed one day how nice they looked in a chance ray of winter  sun. The plan of the still life took shape during Christmas vacation, when she  devised a symbolic meaning for the composition.  </P> <P> "After all," she mused, with an acuity beyond her years, "in 1985, beauty,  pristine realism and integral clarity are not loud enough artistic  considerations to speak with (or against) the shrill, and sometimes raucous  voice of 'contemporary' art, which often confuses messages with propaganda and  energy with hype.  </P> <P> "Nor were these goals lofty enough to compete against the quiet side of  modernism, where mere bland and banal inference is masked to show instead a  false subtle profundity and meaningful shallowness."  </P> <P> She wrestled with the problem of the inaccessibility of most symbolism to the  average viewer but decided to imbue the work with specific Christian symbols  reinterpreted in a fresh, complex way -- and not without humor.  </P> <P> "The tone of the drawing should be peaceful, demure and reassuring but at the  same time it is comic and almost sarcastic," Megan Jones wrote.  </P> <P> The sunlit Coke bottle, representing the Incarnation, also stands for the blood  of Christ, "which will be drunk," she wrote, "as Cokes usually are." The bar of  Dove, a "symbol of cleanliness" that fits in with the Last Supper theme of the  cleansing of sins, also represents the Holy Spirit.  </P> <P> At Smith, in search of a place where the still life could remain intact for the  many weeks it would take to finish drawing it, she decided to make her own  studio in the attic of Parsons House, her dormitory. She crept upstairs from  her first-floor room 5 or 6 days a week to work on the piece for at least 4  hours at a stretch.  </P> <P> "That cake was lying there for months!" Megan's friend Mathew said, laughing.  "It would get fungus on it and Megan would just scrape it off."  </P> <P> When classes were finished in the spring, Megan Jones still wasn't finished.  She asked if she could stay in Parsons House through commencement and her  request was denied. But she stayed an extra 10 days anyway, sleeping a few  hours a night on the living-room couch, sneaking into the dining room for an  occasional meal and suffering the "100-degree microwave effect" of being cooped  up in an attic during the muggy Eastern summer.  </P> <P> Janis Theodore, an assistant professor in the art department at Smith,  supervised Megan Jones while she worked on "Eternal Force" as an independent  studies project in still life drawing -- a private tutorial of a kind normally  reserved for more advanced students.  </P> <P> "Megan was one of the few students I had that was so skilled, so formed as an  artist, as a draftsman," Theodore recalls, echoing the girl's other art  teachers.  </P> <P> "She was so clear in her conceptualization and what she wanted to do that there  was very little direction I actually offered her. She would work on major  projects that were so time-consuming -- they were something you would expect of  someone who had completed graduate school.  </P> <P> "It was hard to discuss her work with her because I think she felt it was so  precious and so personal, and she was so clear in her direction that she -- how  can I say? -- didn't really encourage constructive criticism. But I think  that's because she was very mature as an artist at that point."  </P> <P> Theodore says she did not mention many well-known artists she admired, but she  did like the work of James Valerio and William Beckman, both East Coast realist  painters.  </P> <P> "I'm sure she looked at Ingres and Vermeer," Theodore adds. "And I think her  father had a lot to do with her formation. That kind of work ethic is very  unusual."  </P> <P> John Paul Jones, whom friends say is still very distraught about his daughter's  death, did not attend the opening of the exhibition and was not available for  an interview.  </P> <P> Megan Jones spent the summer of 1985 visiting Wales with her father and his new  wife. She hadn't wanted to come home but her mother insisted, and she put the  finishing touches on "Eternal Force" in Laguna Beach before she returned to  Smith for her sophomore year.  </P> <P> That fall, her legs began to swell, and Mathew remembers she kept telling her  friend -- without success -- to go to the doctor. Eventually, Megan Jones was  obliged to wear bedroom slippers because she could no longer put on her shoes.  </P> <P> In October, when she finally went to the infirmary, a CAT scan revealed a tumor  as large as a football. She left immediately for California, telling Mathew  that there was a growth, but not saying whether or not it was malignant. She  said she hoped to be back in the spring.  </P> <P> "In the spring," Mathew said, "she said she'd be back in the fall (of 1986),  and in the fall -- that's when she realized she would not be able to come back  ever."  </P> <P> After her operation at the UCLA Medical Center in November, Megan Jones began a  course of treatment that included several experimental drugs. Her moods went up  and down but "when she felt well her face glowed and she started doing her art  again," her friend Mia Di Sandro recalls.  </P> <P> Among her last pieces were little clay sculptures of women with attached  haloes, "Eve I" and "Eve II." On the back of photographs of the pieces, she  wrote, "Eve II is stronger and more self-assured than Eve I. Her body is  painted to look like the marble at the UCLA hospital."  </P> <P> Toward the end, her parents rented a guest house in Los Angeles to be near her.  "I never believed she was going to die," Chadlyn Jones said. "We lived our  lives as naturally as though there was a tomorrow. We were going out to dinner,  going to the movies."  </P> <P> In May, on the last day Megan Jones was alive, her parents brought "Soul  Portrait" to the hospital room where she lay in a coma. Their daughter had  specified the size and color of the stones to be set in the frame, and the work  was now completed. Chadlyn took her daughter's hand and rubbed it across the  top of the frame.  </P> <P> "Eternal Force," an exhibition of paintings, drawings and small sculptures by  Megan Hart Jones, remains through April 28 at the Ettinger Gallery of the Art  Institute of Southern California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach.

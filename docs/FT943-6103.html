			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Royal Oak out of Lac running Royal Oak Mines, the Canadian gold producer, has withdrawn its offer for rival Lac Minerals, Reuter reports from Vancouver. Royal Oak started the bidding war for Lac on July 7 with a hostile takeover offer, subsequently increasing its bid to CDollars 5 and two of its shares for each Lac share. However, American Barrick, another Canadian gold producer, last week secured the support of the Lac board for its offer of CDollars 5 and 0.325 of its shares for each Lac share. Royal Oak will tender its 3.78m Lac shares, acquired before Royal Oak launched its bid, to the American Barrick offer.</p>

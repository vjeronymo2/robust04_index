			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Pensions review needs lay views Sir, As a response to the Maxwell pensions scandal and prompted by the highly critical report of the House of Commons select committee, the government has set up a committee under the chairmanship of Prof Roy Goode to review the law relating to occupational pension schemes. That the Maxwell scandal should have occurred is an indictment of the current system of law and voluntary regulation under which occupational pension schemes operate; a system about which most of the professionals involved in the pensions industry have been too complacent for far too long. The people who have suffered from the Maxwell and similar pension fund scandals are not the professionals who make their living from running, investing and advising pension schemes, but the ordinary members of those schemes who have contributed from their pay, until very recently on a compulsory basis, in the expectation that those contributions would provide them with a secure income in retirement. It is ironic therefore that the make-up of Prof Goode's committee, recently announced, should be heavy with pension professionals and advisers and light on lay representatives of pension scheme members and pensioners. The committee comprises two academics, a solicitor, an accountant, an actuary, an investment strategist, a life office chief executive, a retired investment manager, an industrialist, and a freelance journalist. While I have no doubt that all the individuals named are people of integrity and intelligence, they do seem, on the face of it, to be more representative of the hitherto complacent pensions establishment than the membership of pension schemes whose interests pensions law should protect. Noticeably absent is any representative from any trade union or pensioners' organisation who might be expected to have an understanding of the needs, requirements and expectations which ordinary members and pensioners have of the pensions schemes to which they belong but have no professional position to protect. What we cannot afford is for this review committee to close professional ranks and to come to the same conclusion as the Occupational Pensions Board did on its previous consideration of this subject in 1989. At that time the board, with the support of most of the pensions establishment, concluded that there was no case for reform. How wrong it was and how wrong will be the current committee if it comes to the same conclusion. Ralph Whiting, partner, Osborne Clarke, 30 Queen Charlotte Street, Bristol BS99 7QQ</p>

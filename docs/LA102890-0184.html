			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUBURN CAN'T KICK AFTER 17-16 VICTORY;  </P> <P> SEC: TIGERS BEAT MISSISSIPPI STATE WHEN CRAWFORD BLOCKS CONVERSION ATTEMPT.  </P> <P> Auburn Coach Pat Dye wasn't a bit surprised.  </P> <P> Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to  play, preserving Auburn's 17-16 Southeastern Conference victory over  Mississippi State Saturday.  </P> <P> "Mississippi State certainly didn't surprise me. I guess I am the only one who  thinks they have a good team," Dye said. "The game turned out exactly like I  expected, but I hoped it wouldn't be that close at the end."  </P> <P> Mississippi State, 3-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC, had a chance to tie the  Tigers (6-0-1, 3-0-1) after David Fair's two-yard run with 2:33 to play. But  Crawford, a junior linebacker, batted down Logan's kick to preserve Auburn's  unbeaten record.  </P> <P> Fair's touchdown, on his only carry of the game, capped an 80-yard, nine-play  drive keyed by a pass interference penalty on a third-and-10 play that gave the  Bulldogs a first down at the Tiger 45. Fair scored six plays later.  </P> <P> Auburn got what proved to be the margin of victory with 13:25 remaining in the  game when Jim Von Wyl kicked a 20-yard field goal after a drive was halted at  the Mississippi State three.  </P> <P> Auburn outgained Mississippi State, 405-292, in handing the Bulldogs their 10th  consecutive SEC defeat and ninth in a row against Dye.  </P> <P> "I don't see how you could expect any more from our players," State Coach  Rockey Felker said. "We came through and got the (final) touchdown when we  needed it, but I'm not sure what happened on the extra point."  </P> <P> Freshman quarterback Stan White directed two second-quarter scoring drives as  Auburn overcame a 3-0 Mississippi State lead.  </P> <P> "We moved the ball pretty well in the first half, we just couldn't quite get  over that hump," White said. "We've been in this situation all year. It always  seems to come down to one big play.  </P></p>

Russian and  Latvian State Delegations Have Initialed a Treaty Under Which  Russian Troops Will Quit Latvia Before 31 August 1994"]    [Text] Russia and Latvia have initialed a treaty on the  terms, dates, and procedure for the full withdrawal of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces from the territory of the  Latvian Republic and on their legal status during the withdrawal  period. It has been learned from the results of the talks in  Moscow that this will take place before 31 August 1994. Sergey  Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, called the initialing of  the troop withdrawal treaty a "victory for common sense."    Apart from the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Latvia, the sides also initialed three important agreements  concerning, in particular, the legal status of the radar station  at Skrunda, social protection for the Russian servicemen and  their family members temporarily stationed on and now leaving  the territory of the Latvian Republic, and also social  protection for the Russian military pensioners and their family  members remaining in Latvia.    Andrey Andreyev, the Russian delegation's executive  secretary, explained to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that  Russia will keep its radar station for four years, and an extra  18 months will be set aside to dismantle it. But the question  of rental for the radar station remained open.    In my view, the agreement on social protection for Russian  servicemen and their family members should particularly single  out aspects connected with housing. In particular, the Latvian  side confirms the right of servicemen to sell apartments, to  receive money for them, or to leave them to relatives or private  persons: citizens or inhabitants of the Latvian Republic.    As for the agreement on social protection for military  pensioners and their family members, the most important point in  it is undoubtedly that the Latvian side has found the political  will within itself and agreed to grant to all servicemen who  transferred to the reserve before 28 January 1992 (the date the  USSR Armed Forces stationed in Latvia passed to Russia's  jurisdiction) the right to reside in the Latvian Republic  without hindrance.    At the meeting which the two countries' delegations held it  was confirmed in principle that they are prepared to sign a  further eight interstate agreements. The sides will proceed  from the premise that they can be signed in the event of a  meeting between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the  Latvian Republic. This could take place in the very near future.</p>

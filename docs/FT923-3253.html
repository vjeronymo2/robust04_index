			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Warning over audit guidelines RELIANCE on the present guidelines for auditing housing associations is 'dangerous and unprofessional', Mr Arthur Merchant, a partner with Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, says in a letter to Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board. The guidelines were issued in 1984, and Mr Merchant argues that since then changing conditions including new legislation permitting the use of a wider mix of finance to fund housing associations have rendered the guide 'clearly out of date'.</p>

Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio), but not for Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais (Minasligas) or Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise subject to this investigation is ferrosilicon, a ferroalloy generally containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, more than eight percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than 10 percent chromium, not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorous, less than 2.75 percent magnesium, and not more than 10 percent calcium or any other element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi is a ferroalloy produced by combining silicon and iron through smelting in a submerged-arc furnace. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi is differentiated by size and by grade. The sizes express the maximum and minimum dimensions of the lumps of FeSi found in a given shipment. FeSi grades are defined by the percentages by weight of contained silicon and other minor elements. FeSi is most commonly sold to the iron and steel industries in standard grades of 75 percent and 50 percent FeSi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calcium silicon, ferrocalcium silicon, and magnesium ferrosilicon are specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation. Calcium silicon is an alloy containing, by weight, not more than five percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and 28 to 32 percent calcium. Ferrocalcium silicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and more than 10 percent calcium. Magnesium ferrosilicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, not more than 55 percent silicon, and not less than 2.75 percent magnesium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi is currently classifiable under the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS): 7202.21.1000, 7202.21.5000, 7202.21.7500, 7202.21.9000, 7202.29.0010, and 7202.29.0050. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi in the form of slag is included within the scope of this investigation if it meets, generally, the chemical content definition stated above and is capable of being used as FeSi. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. Parties that believe their importations of slag do not meet these definitions should contact the Department and request a scope determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the publication of the notice of preliminary determination on August 16, 1993 (58 FR 43323), the following events have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 20, 1993, respondent Italmagnesio notified the Department that it had decided to withdraw from participation in this investigation and requested the return of all documents that it submitted during the course of the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 25, 1993, we returned the proprietary versions of all documents submitted by Italmagnesio during the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 23, 24, and 25, 1993, CBCC, petitioners, and Minasligas, respectively, requested a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

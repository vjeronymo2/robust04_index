			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN LOSES $3,000 OF JEWELRY IN BURGLARY  </P> <P> After railing against crime on her many stops along the campaign trail,  Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein has received a very  personal reminder of the need for more law and order.  </P> <P> While she was crisscrossing the state during the last several weeks,  Feinstein's posh Century City rented condominium was burglarized, and about  $3,000 of her finest jewelry was stolen.  </P> <P> "They took only the best stuff," Feinstein said Thursday during a campaign stop  in Fresno.  </P> <P> Feinstein said the burglars apparently knew exactly what they were doing,  taking the valuable articles and leaving behind genuine-looking pieces of  costume jewelry.  </P> <P> According to Los Angeles police reports, Feinstein said she lost a jade  necklace, a multistrand ivory necklace, three gold chains, a pair of jade and  gold loop earrings and a pair of jade and pearl earrings.  </P> <P> The break-in in the 2100 block of Century Park Lane, just south of the Century  City business area, was reported Tuesday by Feinstein's millionaire investor  husband, Richard C. Blum, according to Detective Gary Fullerton.  </P> <P> The burglar or burglars broke in by prying open a sliding glass door at the  residence sometime between Oct. 24 at 10 a.m. and Oct. 27 at 10 p.m., according  to a police report. Feinstein's name was not mentioned in the report.  </P> <P> The burglary apparently was not noticed for several days because Blum thought  the door was broken, and because the condominium had not been ransacked or  damaged, said Fullerton, who heads the burglary unit in the Los Angeles Police  Department's West Los Angeles Division.  </P> <P> Feinstein and Blum live in San Francisco, but rented the condominium early in  the primary campaign to have a place to stay on their frequent trips to  Southern California.  </P></p>

Here is the  text of the interview which was made public by the government  press service.    "I regret what happened. Of course, Stanislav Stanislavovich  and I sometimes had certain differences over the ways to reform  society and to build a sovereign state. By the way let me note  that with the help of the press this fact was often exaggerated  and, I should say, somewhat overblown.    "However, on the whole Shushkevich and I managed to find a  common language. We agreed on strategical approaches to the  reform of Belarusian society, and we thought that our main goals  were to guarantee the transition to a market economy in the  republic without extremism or social disasters, to prevent a  sharp decline in the living standards of the population, to  gradually create necessary conditions for national revival and  to preserve stability, accord and civil peace on our land. We  did all we could to represent Belarus in the international  community as a dignified state and to make it a European  civilized power.    "In today's complex situation we should act thoughtfully and  carefully. Taking important political steps and decisions we  should remember that we are living not in an isolated world,  that our CIS neighbours and `far-away' foreign countries closely  monitor the developments in Belarus, and count on the continuity  of the policy pursued by the parliament and the government of  the republic.    "In recent years we spent too much time and effort on the  destruction and settlement of political accounts. Obviously,  it's time to stop that and to start a concrete creative work for  the economic restructuring, the privatization in the interests  of the people and the creation of adequate living conditions for  the people. Let me state with all responsibility that the  reform is irreversible. We will persistently continue the  planned reforms, strengthening our union with Russia and  developing friendship with other states.    "And the last thing I would like to say in this connection.  We should understand the current state of Shushkevich like  human beings and support him at this difficult time."    According to Shushkevich's press secretary Valeriy Vorobyov,  currently the ex-speaker is in his personal countryside house.  In the evening of the day he was dismissed the government  communication line with his house was disconnected, but it was  decided that a limited number of personal guards should stay  with him.</p>

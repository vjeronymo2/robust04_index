			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Observer: Bye-bye Robin There are two ways of looking at the news that Robert MacNeil - known as Robin - is retiring next year after two decades as co-anchor of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, US non-commercial television's admirable weekday fix on current affairs. Both are sad. Canadian-born MacNeil, long ago a BBC veteran, and his sidekick, Jim Lehrer, an affable Texan and spare-time thriller-writer, have been continuing voices of sanity amidst increasingly shrill news broadcasting. Their nightly audience - about 2m - is full of policy movers, shakers and wannabees who know that being interviewed by one or the other means recognition. MacNeil, who insists he always intended to retire on the programme's 20th anniversary, which is also close to his 65th birthday, will not be replaced. Lehrer, the safest pair of hands, will shoulder the whole burden, with help from sub-anchors. Behind the decision lies another sad fact about the parlous state of public TV's finances. The New York end of the programme, from which MacNeil operated, will be closed down next year, with production confined to Washington, Lehrer's base. This is a large blow to WNET, Channel 13, in New York. It also leaves Jim Lehrer with the problem of finding a new sign-off line, when 'Goodnight, Robin' becomes history.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Siemens earnings steady at DM1.98bn SIEMENS, one of Germany's most recession-proof industrial concerns, improved net earnings by 1 per cent to DM1.98bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in the year to the end of September, and will pay an unchanged dividend of DM13. Incoming orders fell by 2 per cent, the first fall for seven years, but deliveries of outstanding orders helped Siemens increase global sales by 4 per cent to DM81.7bn. Falling demand in Germany led to a drop of 6 per cent in domestic orders. Turnover in Germany rose 2 per cent to DM37.3bn. Foreign demand rose 2 per cent, while sales climbed 6 per cent to DM44.4bn. The effects of recession were felt most strongly in automation, drives, switching technology, and medical electronics, the company said. The results were adversely affected by heavy losses at the computer business, Siemens Nixdorf Informationssyteme (SNI). However, the deficit shrank to DM419m, from DM513m in 1992, on turnover down 9 per cent at DM11.9bn. No earnings details were available on semiconductors, although incoming orders rose 33 per cent during the year and sales increased 14 per cent to DM2.1bn. Telecommunications, the largest group of businesses within the group, recorded sales increases of 3 per cent in the public sector and 16 per cent in private networks. However, public orders dropped 7 per cent, reflecting the international squeeze on government spending, while the turnover from private telecommunications was bolstered by the first-time consolidation of the US Rolms business. Sales by the KWU power generation subsidiary jumped 32 per cent, although new orders rose by only 1 per cent. Siemens Verkehrstechnik, the railways arm, increased turnover 32 per cent to DM3.6bn and booked 33 per cent more new orders than in 1991-92. This was the only operating division not to reduce its workforce during the year.</p>

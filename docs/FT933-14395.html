			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bangladesh jute estimate cut BANGLADESH'S 1993-94 jute crop is expected to fall short of an earlier estimate of 4.5m bales (180kg each), which was itself 500,000 bales below 1992-93 output. The smaller crop is mainly the result of the diversion of land from jute to rice, which gives a better return to the farmers. According to Bangladesh trade officials, more than 10 per cent of the 525,000 hectares under jute last year has been diverted to rice. However, the use of certified Indian seeds on a large scale and adequate retting (softening) facilities will ensure that a high percentage of quality fibre is produced. At least 75 per cent of the crop will be tossa jute, a variety that is increasingly favoured by jute mills both inside and outside the country. The balance will be white jute. The average annual requirement of raw jute in Bangladesh is 4.8m bales, including 2.9m bales for consumption by mills, 1.5m bales for export and 400,000 bales for village use. The shortfall will be taken care of by this season's comfortable opening stocks at the start of this month of more than 1m bales. The 1994-95 jute season will, however, open with low stocks. Trade officials think a fairly large volume of jute from Bangladesh will find its way into India through unauthorised channels because prices of the commodity are 25-40 per cent higher in India, depending on grade. As in the past, the export-orientated jute mills in India will import some high quality raw jute from Bangladesh, and India is expected to harvest a lower crop of 6.5m bales in the current season. The low prices of jute in Bangladesh have been attributed to the government's decision to end price support. The new season crop has only just started coming on to the market in small lots but prices are already depressed. The principal importers of jute from Bangladesh are Pakistan, Russia and some European and African countries. Thailand, itself a producer of the fibre, also buys from Bangladesh. Jute and jute goods are Bangladesh's main foreign exchange earners.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "Why </F> the United States Readjusts its Peace-Keeping Policy"]    [Text] Last week, U.S. President Clinton signed a new  decree on U.S. peacekeeping policy, setting out strict  conditions for selective U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping  operations. It no longer advocates, as it did in the past, that  the United Nations send peacekeeping forces to act as a global  policeman in any region experiencing conflict.    This move by the United States is the result of protracted  research and extensive negotiations with Congress. Madeleine  Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said: This  decree "is not intended to expand UN peacekeeping operations,  but to help it get oriented." This policy readjustment conveys  a message, which is that the United States cannot resolve all  conflicts in the world and does not believe the United Nations  is capable of creating and maintaining peace, especially in  regions where wars have been continuing and enmity still exists.    The second message is that the readjustment of the U.S.  peacekeeping policy is based on the consideration of U.S.  interests. Albright gave footnotes to the decree, saying: The  objective of this decree is that "we are not going to ask the  United Nations to take up missions that are beyond its  capability, but to help it complete the missions we hope it can  complete and succeed in." The conditions provided for by this  policy are that it is necessary to consider promoting U.S.  interests, consider the ability to supply personnel and capital,  win support from the U.S. Congress, have clear objectives, and  not get bogged down for a long time in peacekeeping operations  that have no hope of success.    The third message is that the United States is striving to  reduce its budget for peacekeeping operations. At present, the  United States shoulders 31.7 percent of the peacekeeping  operations budget. The decree provides for reducing this  expenditure, as the United States hopes, to 25 percent. The  U.S. Congress obviously is indifferent to and hesitant about  increasing appropriations for this. In a report in May, the  U.S. Government pointed out that the United Nations is launching  or plans to launch 36 peacekeeping operations, whereas the  American people have long complained about missions that entail  huge amounts of funds and that do not involve the safeguarding  of national interests, yet require the sending of young  Americans.    The fourth message is that the United States does not  support  the United Nations in building up a permanent force, nor is it  sending troops to prepare for or support this force, and that  moreover, U.S. combat forces will not be placed under the direct  command of foreign servicemen. This obviously differs greatly  from the idea -- as put forward by Clinton in 1992 -- of  building up an international force and stationing it on the  borders of countries threatened by aggression.    Observers maintain that the readjustment of U.S.  peacekeeping  policy shows the decline of the U.S. status, that it takes the  strategy of retreating before advancing under the pressure of  Congress and public opinion, and that it is reducing the burdens  of capital and manpower so that the selective U.S. participation  in UN peacekeeping operations can be more effective. Moreover,  they maintain, the United States is doing its best to act as  leader in world affairs, influencing or swaying the missions of  the United Nations. It is foreseeable that this U.S. move  inevitably will have a huge influence in the scramble for  spheres of influence among the major Western powers.</p>

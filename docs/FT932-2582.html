			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK-Cuba ventures on cards PROSPECTS are good for joint ventures and other trade and investment deals between British companies and Cuba, Baroness Young, a former UK government minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Havana. She is heading a British business delegation to the island. 'We've had very positive meetings with ministers here. . . . and the very clear message that has come to us is that Cuba would like to make some joint ventures and joint arrangements,' she said. A dozen British business executives in the delegation, sponsored by Britain's Caribbean Trade Advisory Group, held three days of talks with Cuban officials about investment possibilities in tourism, the oil sector, agriculture, mining and the pharmaceuticals industry. The group advises the British Overseas Trade Board. Lade Young, who had a two-hour meeting with President Fidel Castro on Tuesday, said she had invited the Cuban government to send a delegation to Britain to discuss details of possible joint investment projects identified in Cuba. Her delegation was the biggest officially-backed British business mission to visit Cuba to date.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources said  that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah have moved  closer together recently. This process is important and  consequential for Israel as well. The sources said that the  rapprochement between the two organizations came against the  background of Hamas attempts to share control of the autonomy  institutions.    The understandings between the two organizations were  reached  in a bid to reduce internecine fighting during the sensitive  period when the Palestinians assume authority over the  autonomous areas. The sources attribute great importance to the  prevention of internecine fighting between the two organizations  and say that an agreement between them could lead to a reduction  in terrorism and violence in the Gaza Strip.</p>

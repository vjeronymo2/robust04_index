			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters stated that the termination notice period of 2 days was inadequate to allow a fair opportunity for elimination of jeopardy. These commenters and others mentioned that the 2-day notice period was inconsistent with the 23-day termination process outlined at &sect;488.410. One commenter proposed a termination notice of 60 days for cases not involving immediate jeopardy. The same commenter said the time period should start when the facility receives notice of the remedies being proposed. One commenter asked how the public was to be notified of a termination action and another felt a notice should be posted on the front door of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are not accepting these comments, although we believe that there may be some misunderstanding among commenters as to the workings of the fast track termination cycle and the notice provisions applicable to facilities facing adverse action. In describing these procedures in the proposed rule, we were stressing the paramount significance of protecting resident health or safety in cases where immediate jeopardy is identified during the survey process. In such cases, the overriding concern is the removal of the threat either through immediate correction by the facility or by the transfer of residents to other more qualified facilities following the termination of the deficient facility's provider agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We continue to believe that the 2-day prior notice provision of the proposed rule is necessary to protect these resident interests and we are retaining it for this reason in this final rule. Past experience with this notice provision in the case of Medicare SNFs has demonstrated to us that it is effective. Having said this, however, we want to dispel those fears about this provision that in all cases a provider will never have more than 2 days' notice before having its provider agreement terminated. As described in the proposed rule, we will have in place a 23-day termination cycle in immediate jeopardy cases. This time frame spans the maximum period of time between the last day of the survey that identified immediate jeopardy and the effective date of the termination. Thus, in many cases, providers, which will have been advised of the survey findings during the survey or at the exit conference, will often have ample time to remove the conditions that gave rise to the immediate jeopardy finding. The prior notice must be given early enough so that the termination date does not extend beyond the 23-day period should the facility fail to remove the immediate jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facilities facing adverse action in these cases will not be guaranteed the maximum amount of time provided by these regulations. For those facilities whose substandard conditions warrant the quickest possible response, it is entirely possible that the effective date of the termination action will occur sooner than the 23rd day after the survey; and it is these facilities that will likely receive notice of the impending action against them as quickly as administratively feasible following the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Extensive experience has demonstrated that it is possible to schedule revisits in a short time frame to verify that the immediate jeopardy has been removed. Because of our experience that the 23-day process works, we will continue to start the clock on the last day of the survey to ensure that jeopardy situations do not remain long uncorrected. We see no justification for facilities to receive additional time to correct instances of immediate jeopardy. In the same vein, we will continue to give a 15-day notice to the public and the facility in non- immediate jeopardy cases, and a maximum of 6 months from the last day of the survey to reach substantial compliance before termination is effective. A 15-day notice in nonimmediate jeopardy cases is a well established practice for all provider types. For both immediate jeopardy and non-immediate jeopardy situations, the public will be notified of terminations by a variety of means; in most instances, this will be accomplished by a newspaper notice, as is the predominant present practice. We believe that a public notice posted on the front door of the facility would be an unnecessary affront to the facility when Federal requirements stipulate that the survey results be made available to residents for examination in a place readily accessible to residents and a notice of their availability must be posted (see &sect;483.10(g)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

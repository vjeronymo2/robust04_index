			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Israeli budget passed after costly haggling MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, last night dug himself out of a government crisis which has beset him since New Year's Eve, winning parliamentary approval for his 1992 budget after concessions to right-wing and religious coalition factions which may yet have unwelcome political and economic consequences. Agreement between the National Religious Party and the Shas ultra-orthodox religious party on the distribution of funds to their client institutions removed the last obstacle to a Knesset majority for the budget, which should have been in effect by the beginning of the financial year on January 1. It was eventually passed by 60 votes to 53. The vote was a relief for Mr Shamir - virtually sealed into the parliament building with his fellow MPs by the heaviest snowfalls in Jerusalem for 30 years - after days of intensive haggling with the small government parties involving the handout of hundreds of millions of shekels in extra spending to their vested interests. However, commitments to two extreme right-wing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, to increase building and other development in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories will anger Washington at a time when Israel badly needs extra US financial assistance in the form of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) loan guarantees to help it absorb Jewish immigration. Officially, the government said the cost of the various last-minute deals would not inflate the projected budget deficit this year of 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product. There is some slack in the budget because of lower than expected rates of immigration. Officials said the final cost of concessions to the right-wing and religious parties would be Shk220m (Pounds 55m) which would be taken out of the budget reserves. Mr Shamir immediately faced another Knesset wrangle last night on a proposal to introduce direct elections for the office of prime minister. The reform is an attempt to end the influence of small parties by creating a stronger prime minister with powers close to those of an executive president. However, the publicly uninspiring Mr Shamir was bitterly opposed to the measure, which he believes would favour the opposition Labour party over his Likud party. Israel said last night it planned to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for alleged terrorist activities, reviving a policy of deportation strongly condemned by the US shortly before Middle East peace talks are due to resume in Washington on January 7. In reaction, PLO officials in Amman said they would instruct the Palestinian delegation not to go to Washington. However, Faisal Husseini, who heads the delegation's advisory committee, said a decision had not yet been taken. The expulsions are the first since four Palestinians were deported last April. To date, 66 people have been expelled since the start of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in December 1987. The practice has evoked international protests that it is illegal. The move, against which the 12 may appeal, followed the killing on Wednesday of a Jewish settler in Gaza. Alarmed settlers responded yesterday by establishing a new settlement at the site of the latest killing and calling for tougher army action against the uprising.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from certain other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not expressly apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of ERISA. Section 404 requires, in part, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. This exemption does not affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed exemption, if granted, will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(1)(F) of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Before this exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The proposed exemption, if granted will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If granted, the proposed exemption will be applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the class exemption are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Written Comments and Hearing Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All interested persons are invited to submit written comments or requests for a public hearing on the proposed exemption to the address above and within the time period set forth above.

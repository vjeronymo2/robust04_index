			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Kissing goodbye to a Christmas tradition - The problems of British apple growers are hitting supplies of home-grown mistletoe Will the kissing have to stop? And if it does, will this be the result of a machiavellian plot hatched by the European Union? Moreover, if every red-blooded Brit observed rules established over generations might the practice already be dying out? Not because of a punitive quota but simply because of market forces. I refer of course to the possibility of a crisis in the mistletoe business and to the tradition that dictates one berry should be removed from each sprig of the foliage for each kiss that takes place beneath it. Fortunately such rules are regularly ignored and the season of goodwill usually permits pursed lips to press against one another, according to custom, an unlimited number of times without berries being removed. Which is just as well, because were that not the case, I would be looking forward to a very dull Christmas. In the absence of any of the parasitic plants on our own apple trees, the other day my wife bought a small sprig of mistletoe in our local Norfolk town. It weighed between three and four ounces, complete with a dozen or so berries, and it cost her Pounds 1. Indeed, she refused to buy any more at such an extortionate price. Perhaps she was also trying to tell me something. But I had already established that at auction in Tenbury in Worcestershire (or 'the orchard', as Queen Victoria is said to have dubbed the town), the price was about 75p a pound last week. Somebody in the supply chain, which admittedly stretches from the West Midlands to East Anglia seems to be making a pretty good margin. Because of the association of mistletoe with apple trees it can only get dearer in the future. Although it will grow on poplar and occasionally on oak trees, its favourite 'host' is the apple. It establishes itself on the trees as a result of the beak-cleaning activities of songbirds, especially mistle thrushes. Having fed in mistletoe berries (which are poisonous to some species) the birds apparently, get seeds stuck in the crevices of their beaks  - like grape pips between our teeth. Not having tooth picks readily to hand, the birds scrape the seeds out of their beaks on to the rough bark of apple trees and 'plant' them where they grow. Mistletoe derives its nourishment from the sap of the trees. UK apple growers have had a rough time in recent years as fruit from other countries has displaced indigenous varieties. French Golden Delicious have been a particular problem, although one British apple grower suggested the French should be hauled up before the courts under the Trades Description Act for naming the variety delicious. They come in during our own season and, being a very high yielding variety, cost much less to grow than best British apples such as Cox. The disappearance of almost half of Britain's apple trees since the country joined the Common Market in 1973, is not the only cause of the mistletoe shortage; nor will the grant-aided grubbing out of a further 13 per cent of British orchards, as a result of a recent EU scheme to cut community production and attempt to raise the price of apples to economic levels, necessarily affect future supplies of mistletoe. For the EU rules state that the apple orchards to be grubbed must be composed of young trees, not more than 20 years old and capable of bearing a full crop of fruit. They must also be planted at a density of not more than 160 trees an acre. In other words, the orchards that will go will be modern, hedge-type plantings enabling easy picking from the ground. But parasitic mistletoe is only allowed to grow on big old trees in traditional orchards. Fifty-year-old or more cider and cooking apple trees are much the best  - the ones not covered by the EU scheme. One of the reasons for this is that most of those trees are uneconomic for fruit production, on their last legs and almost ready to fall down in any case. Many are only retained to provide shelter for sheep flocks that graze the orchards and for the side-line cutting of mistletoe. It may be, therefore, as these old trees disappear, that in future years, sales of traditional winter greenery held at Tenbury market on the four Tuesdays before Christmas each year will have fewer bunches of local mistletoe mixed among the holly and Christmas trees. Indeed these annual auctions have already begun to attract entries from northern France where mistletoe is plentiful especially on the ubiquitous poplars. But disparaging locals say the French stuff is not as good. For a start it is usually a different, less attractive variety. But worse than this is the way it is presented: dehydrated and squashed following the long journey across the channel. The French, you see, have no real appreciation of the plant nor of any tradition of kissing under the mistletoe in spite of their racy reputation. Only the British have revered mistletoe from the time of the ancient Druids and today its magical and licentious powers are exclusively enjoyed in the English-speaking world. And when you think of it, kissing in France is only a series of ritual pecks on the cheek  - perhaps because of the preponderence of garlic in the diet. The British are the deliverers and recipients of full frontal smackers and long may there be sufficient English mistletoe around to enable and enhance that excellent Christmas tradition.</p>

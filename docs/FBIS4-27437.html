			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report of roundtable discussion among Yoshiro Mori, general </F> secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); Wataru Kubo,  general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  (SDPJ); Kozo Watanabe, acting general secretary of Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party); Takenori Kanzaki, floor leader of  Komeito; Masuo Matsuoka, general secretary of the Japan New  Party; Takashi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP); and Hiroyuki Sonoda, general secretary of  Sakigake (Harbinger); place and date not given]    The SDPJ's Kubo said the Hata cabinet should resign en  masse before a no-confidence motion was submitted. This would  pave the way for the establishment of a third coalition  government.    Of the ruling party leaders, Komeito's Kanzaki agreed with  Kubo, while Shinseito's Watanabe said it was "one of several  choices," indicating he was sympathetic to the idea.    Asked about a possible tie-up with the LDP, Kubo said  discussion should be promoted on policy matters and tactics for  dealing with the political situation. The LDP's Mori indicated  he looked forward to holding joint party consultations.    Kubo said: "The coalition should dissolve the current  cabinet and consider how to form a new coalition government.  The current cabinet will have no choice once a no-confidence  motion against them has been adopted."    He added: "When a new coalition is formed, the leaders of  all parties joining the coalition are qualified to become new  prime minister. Mr. Hata is also qualified."    He stressed: "The SDPJ, on the assumption that it would be  very difficult for the party to rejoin the current coalition,  demands that a third coalition government be formed."    Shinseito's Watanabe said: "Prime Minister Hata also  considers Mr. Kubo's idea is one of several choices. In this  sense, I cannot say that it is beyond the bounds of possibility."    Komeito's Kanzaki backed Kubo's call for the Hata cabinet to  resignat and the formation of a third coalition government.    Sakigake's Sonoda said: "Since Sakigake chose Mr. Hata as  the new prime minister, and the Hata government has just been  inaugurated, our party will not be able to support the  no-confidence motion," indicating his party would nevertheless  keep a close watch on developments.    The LDP's Mori said that dissolution of the lower house and  general elections under the current electoral system were  inevitable.    He added, though that the formation of a caretaker  government  tasked with holding general elections under the new electoral  system was also one of the choices.    On the possibility of a tie-up between the LDP and the SDPJ,  Kubo said: "We want to positively promote discussions between  opposition parties in terms of maintaining parliamentary  democracy."    He added: "On such important matters as the presentation of  a no-confidence motion, I think we will be able to reach  agreement through the process of thorough discussion between the  two parties."    Mori said: "Even though the starting point is different,  there is possibility of consulting with each other in the end."</p>

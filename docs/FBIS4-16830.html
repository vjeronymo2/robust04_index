			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The renewed escalation of  bloodshed around Nagorno-Karabakh is causing serious concern,  deputy chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Department of  Information and Press Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today.    According to the official, the Russian Foreign Ministry,  acting as a mediator, rejects attempts made by the conflicting  sides, in the given case the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, to  extend and consolidify [as received] their positions when the  situation has long since taken a turn towards peace.    Recent attacks in the north of Nagorno-Karabakh are being  negatively reflected on the prospects of negotiations, Mikhail  Demurin noted.</p>

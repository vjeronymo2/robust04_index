			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] hinted on Thursday [28 April] it might not accept  the outcome of the election, which it said were not free and  fair.    At a news conference in Johannesburg, IFP Transvaal  political  director Themba Khoza said: "At the end of the day, we will  remember this election as embarrassing -- the most embarrassing  election this country has ever had."    He said there were feelings within the IFP that the party  should either withdraw from the election or declare it unfair  and not free. The IFP would do everything to avoid this. "Of  course, we want to save the situation, else there will be chaos."    Mr Khoza said the main problem was ballot papers which did  not include the IFP sticker. "Voters have their identity  checked and go through the process at the polling stations. But  at the last stage, when they want to make their cross they find  no IFP name. Many people went away without making a cross --  now they have ink on their hands and cannot vote."    Mr Khoza urged IFP supporters to go back to the polls "ink  or  no ink" and cast their votes. The Independent Electoral  Commission would have to accept this.    Asked how the IEC would be able to prevent voters who  supported parties other than the IFP from voting a second time,  Mr Khoza said: "We are open to suggestion."    In addition to the ballot paper problem, IFP supporters were  being threatened by ANC members at the polls and were  encountering a hostile attitude from IEC officials, Mr Khoza  claimed. "Our people are also being tricked into voting for the  National Party. Officials tell them if there is no IFP name they  should make the cross at the bottom -- the space reserved for  the NP."    The IEC should have heeded the IFP's request for a  postponement of the election -- not only to give the party a  chance to campaign, but to avoid the "inefficiency and chaos" at  the polls. "We wonder whether or not we should accept the  outcome of this election. While we have every reason to declare  this election null and void, we are trying to avoid this by  making other suggestions. The issue is sensitive and the  slightest mistake could cost the country dear."    While he was "very depressed" at the way the election was  being run, Mr Khoza said voters' attitude to the IFP was  impressive. "If the election was based on constituency instead  of proportional representation, we would be in Parliament  running the show."</p>

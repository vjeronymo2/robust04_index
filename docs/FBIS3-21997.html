			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fabio Lau] </F>   [Text] He is only eight years old, does not attend school,  and says he is proud that he can already earn his own money --  CR$7,000 [cruzeiros] a week. "C" "works" on a flight of steps on  a hillside in a shantytown in the Alemao Complex, in Penha as a  lookout for an indoor drug market [boca-de-fumo]. He  flies a kite that is no longer a toy; it has become a tool in  his "work," used to warn of the arrival of police or rival  bandits. "C" is one of the 5,000 minors who, according to Drug  Enforcement Division estimates, work for the traffickers. In  fact, children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 17 make  up 80 to 90 percent of the labor force marshalled by the drug  traffic.    The olheiro, or lookout, is the first step on this  "career ladder." Next, minors can be used as  vapozeiros (packagers of drugs) and "airplanes"  (distributors). Those two jobs pay weekly wages ranging from  CR$7,000 to CR$30,000. In some cases, however, the kids hold  more important "offices" such as managers, or even bosses, of  the indoor drug markets. This is the case in the Chale  shantytown in Mangueira, where the boss, "F," turned 14 on 4  January. His gang is composed of children, young men, and even  adults who follow his orders.    There are two factors behind the increasingly significant  presence of boys and adolescents in the indoor drug markets,  according to police: the fact that they are minors and so cannot  be given long sentences; and the type of relationship -- blind  loyalty -- they develop with the traffickers. Their youth gives  them an impulsiveness that makes them heedless of physical  safety in a way an adult would not be. "They are just the  wadding for the cannons," a policeman said.  <H5>  "B," Age 16 </H5>   "B" is confined at the Padre Severino Institute for the  third  time. The first time was for theft, then for robbery, now he is  there for trafficking. "I lived in the Fatima neighborhood, and  that was where I had my first contact with drugs. I was 12. I  started stealing things on my street. I got a reputation  [manjado] and started stealing things on buses,  working with four others. I bought a Browning 9 mm. Then I was  arrested and spent some time here. My parents began to hate me.  I got out and started school again. That didn't last long and I  went back to look for my buddies there in Querosene (a  shantytown in Catumbi). I used to guard the hillside in the  evenings (I was a `soldier') and I was paid in cocaine. I was  arrested trying to stick up a gas station. I came back here.  Almost a year later, I was back on the street. I got a lot of  money from a deal with the owner of the boca and set  up my own business there in Fatima. I used to buy 50 grams of  pura (pure cocaine) and stretch it into 500 grams. I  would invest $300 and turn it into $3,000 a week. I bought a  motorcycle, fulfilling my greatest dream. But then I got caught  and so I'm back here."  <H5>  "R," Age 17 </H5>   A soldier for trafficker Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka "Ue,"  in  one of the shantytowns in the Alemao Complex in Penha, "R" was  found standing with "C," age 8, on a flight of steps on the  hillside. Armed with a Glock 9mm pistol, he says he lives very  well on the CR$30,000 he gets every week. "In the days when I  helped a friend in construction, I didn't earn enough money to  go dancing on Saturday night. Now I have these Company tennis  shoes, brand new. As a laborer I could never buy anything like  these. I learned to shoot and the man (Ue) noticed that my hand  is steady. He gave me the Glock, the best pistol in the  shantytown."  <H5>  "D," Age 16 </H5>   He is one of the 196 inmates at the Padre Severino Institute  and this is his fourth stay there. Reason: drug trafficking. He  says that at first he resisted the call of the traffickers. "My  brothers are drug dealers for Jorge Luiz (boss of the traffic in  Acari, Coroado, and Conjunto Amarelinho). They wanted me to join  the group, but I was afraid. I was about 11. I started going to  Copacabana with my friends from the neighborhood. They went  there to rob the gringos and I started stealing, too -- and  sniffing cocaine. I bought it in Acari, where it was cheaper.  The guys pressured me to take drugs and sell them on the beach.  I agreed and I earned good money, but was arrested four times.  It was not an easy life, but it was a good life, because it paid  for clothes. My father, a factory worker, earns very little. My  mother, a servant in Copacabana -- same story."  <H5>  A Short Lifespan for the Little Bosses </H5>   Minors who reach the top die early. Brasileirinho, Maguinho,  and Pimentinha could bear witness to the fact that a childhood  spent in the world of drugs leads nowhere. They reached the top  of the hierarchy in the world of drugs in Rio's shantytowns at a  very early age. They were cut down even sooner. All three were  killed before their 16th birthdays.    Joel Oliveira de Souza, aka "Pimentinha," was killed in  September 1993 at the age of 15, after a shootout between the  police and the traffickers in Acari. After being arrested along  with a group of traffickers, he bled for more than four hours  and died of a hemorrhage.    Flavio da Conceicao Augusto, aka "Brasileirinho," did not  live as long -- only to age 14. As one of the bosses in the drug  traffic in the Rocinha shantytown, Brasileirinho was killed  after the police discovered the hideout used by a group of eight  people at a country house in Sao Goncalo. Among the dead were  Erik Melo Alves, 20, son of Judge Marilene Melo Alves, and two  pregnant girls.    Carlos Magno Barbosa, aka "Maguinho," died at 14, also the  victim of a confrontation with the police. He had gained  notoriety when, during an exchange of gunfire against his former  ally Ricardo Ferreira da Conceicao, aka "Cambarra," on a sunny  Sunday on Ipanema beach, Angela Lopes Machado, an engineer, was  hit by a stray bullet and died.  <H5>  Gangs Imitate Military Hierarchy </H5>   The investigative work done by Chief Maurilio Moreira when  he  headed the 19th police precinct (Tijuca) produced 11 volumes of  inquiries -- forwarded to the 26th Criminal Court -- listing 132  traffickers in Borel for whom arrest warrants had been issued.  On the basis of that information, the chief learned that the  traffickers attempt to imitate the military organizational  structure. The trafficker is portrayed to his underlings as the  commander of a military unit. Furthermore, the members of the  gang are promoted on the basis of merit, dedication, and  discipline.    "We have come to the conclusion that many young men in Borel  are encouraged by the drug traffickers to enter military service  as an apprenticeship. They stay long enough to learn how to  handle weapons and explosives, and they are assigned to take  weapons and grenades, which we often find in possession of the  criminals," the police chief said.    The top figure in the organizational structure of the drug  traffic, according to the police, is the matuto, the  supplier. Under him is the boss of the traffic for a given  shantytown. Attached to him is a group of "soldiers,"  (bodyguards), who go everywhere with him. Then come the  "managers" of the "white stuff" (cocaine), and the "black stuff"  (marijuana), and these people also have bodyguards. They share  their territory with "assistant managers" who distribute the  drugs among the bocas-de-fumo. Vapozeiros  prepare the narcotics for retail sale, make up the blends and  return them to the "managers." "Soldiers" at the "bocas" provide  protection and are partly responsible for the sales.    Sales are not restricted to the shantytowns. Some of the  drugs are taken by "airplanes" to places where addicts gather.  They are allowed to raise the price, provided they observe the  payment terms agreed to with the "managers." If the drugs are  seized by the police, the addict-dealer must still pay for them.  Debts to traffickers are neither forgiven nor negotiated. You  pay with your life.  <H5>  Ten Percent of Crimes Committed by Minors Are Drug-Related </H5>   During the first ten months of 1993, the Children and  Adolescents Protection Division (DPCA) recorded a total of 1,166  crimes committed by children and young people between the ages  of 7 and 18. Of this total, about 120 cases were related to  consumption or dealing in drugs.    In the opinion of Judge Siro Darlan, of the 2nd Juvenile  Court, the majority of the robbery or thefts committed by young  people are drug-related. "The adolescent steals something, sells  to a fence -- usually an adult -- and immediately goes out and  buys drugs," the judge said.    The pressures on minors who engage in the traffic are also  irresistible, according to the judge. "Those who are attracted  by the traffic receive the kind of wages that a legal activity  would almost never pay them. They start supporting their  families and, in some cases, even gain their parents' sympathy.  But in general, they are victims of a system in which you earn a  lot, but you don't live long."  <H5>  The Public Square by Day, Drug Market by Night </H5>   "S," age 13, is an example of the vicious circle the minors  involved with drugs are caught up in. Last Tuesday afternoon, he  was in Saenz Pena Square with three friends. "S" told O GLOBO  reporters that he is a compulsive user of cocaine. The money to  buy it comes from thefts. The "fence," he said, is a 19-year-old.    "I stopped sniffing for awhile because my nose was sore.  Now,  I'm in great shape. I spend the day on the square and at night I  go to Sa Viana," (the street that leads to one of the principal  bocas-de-fumo on the Andarai hillside).    The kids on Saenz Pena Square have been getting help for two  years from the 6th BPM [Military Police Battalion] (Tijuca). The  coordinator of the Special Crime Prevention Unit, Lieutenant  Marcelo Luiz Ribeiro de Almeida, has succeeded in cutting the  number of crimes on the square by 70 percent since he started a  project there. Many of the young people were taken to the BPM,  where they are learning a trade.    A defender of the Child and Adolescent Statute, the  lieutenant said that it was drafted with the Brazilian reality  in mind and should be enforced in its essence. "Every child can  be rehabilitated," he said.</p>

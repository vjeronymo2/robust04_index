			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PADRES HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF CANADA  </P> <P> Tim Wallach and Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd are two players the San Diego Padres are  glad they won't be seeing again until August.  </P> <P> The hot-hitting Wallach hit his 10th home run and Boyd pitched a five-hitter  Wednesday night at Montreal to lead the Expos to a 4-0 victory.  </P> <P> In his last three games against the Padres, Wallach, who has regained his home  run stroke after a two-year drought, is nine for 14. He has hit four home runs,  three of them three-run homers, and has driven in 13 runs.  </P> <P> Wallach, after hitting 26 home runs in 1987, hit only 25 total in 1988 and  1989. He has hit eight in the last 16 games.  </P> <P> Boyd (3-2) shut out the Padres for the second time in a row. He has given up  only two earned runs in 29 innings. He struck out eight batters and didn't walk  any.  </P> <P> Houston 7, Pittsburgh 3 -- Alex Trevino hit a two-run home run to break a 3-3  tie at Houston and cut the Pirates' lead in the East to one game over  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> It was Trevino's first home run of the season. The Astros scored two more runs  in the inning to hand the Pirates their seventh loss in the last 11 games. The  Astros stole eight bases.  </P> <P> San Francisco 6, St. Louis 1 -- The Giants, 5-16 at home, showed how happy they  were to escape Candlestick Park by routing the Cardinals in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Bob Knepper, who had a 6.05 earned-run average, held the Cardinals to seven  hits in 6 2/3 innings. He also doubled in a run. Will Clark hit his eighth  homer. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

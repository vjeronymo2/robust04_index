			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- A campaign to recruit  civil servants for the rightwing "Volksrepublic" [Afrikaner  people's republic] started on Tuesday [12 April], the  Volksrepublic's Transitional President Ferdi Hartzenberg  announced in Pretoria. He said each public servant would  receive a document enabling them to join the Volksrepublic's  civil service when it came into being shortly.    "Needless to say, such officials (who respond) will enjoy  preference when it comes to appointments in our civil service,"  Dr Hartzenberg said. It would be assumed public servants who  did not indicate they wanted to join the Volksrepublic's civil  service wanted to work for the so-called new South Africa, if  there were jobs left for them after affirmative action, Dr  Hartzenberg said.    Referring to public servants strikes elsewhere in the  country, especially in the homelands, he said no-one could blame  central government civil servants if they also demanded their  pensions now in order to get back some of their contributions.    Referring to the solvency of the central government pension  fund, he noted it was being further taxed by "MK (Umkhonto we  Sizwe) [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members who were  terrorists in the bush who are also suddenly becoming  pensioners".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emman Omari and Caleb Atemi] </F>   [Excerpts] General service unit [GSU] and regular policemen  fired into the air and sealed off the biggest polling station in  Lugari [western Kenya] for 30 minutes during by-election voting  yesterday. There was no explanation for the siege of Lumakanda  divisional headquarters but FORD [Forum for the Restoration of  Democracy]-Kenya officials claimed it was "psychological  warfare" intended to intimidate voters.    Even after the paramilitary unit had withdrawn, armed  policemen patrolled the periphery of the station. Reports from  around the constituency indicated little serious violence but  there were persistent reports of irregularities including the  expulsion of a cabinet minister from a polling station. [passage  omitted]    There were near-riots at Chekalini polling station when  voters hurled stones at KANU [Kenya African National Union]  candidate Apili Wawire when he arrived in a convoy of nine  vehicles packed with people singing party songs.    The by-election pitted the former Lugari member, Mr Wawire,  who defected from FORD-Asili, against Mr Burudi Nabwera, a KANU  defector to FORD-Kenya, and Mr Nathan Fedha (FORD-A).    Voting, at least in the early hours, appeared to be slow.    It was three P.M. when heavily armed security personnel in  combat and anti-riot gear blocked the entrance to the township  polling station and sealed off the Lumakanda headquarters. Six  shots were fired into the air but no reasons were given for the  action.    Opposition leaders held a 30-minute meeting with the  provincial police officer and at 3:30 P.M., the GSU lorry and  policemen who had blocked the entrance to the station were  withdrawn. [passage omitted]    There was a high turnout at the three newly-created and  controversial sub-stations of Savala, Mahanga and Lumani.  [passage omitted] By 1:30 P.M., only 800 people at the [Lugari]  township station -- the largest in Lugari with seven streams --  had cast their votes out of the registered 7,000.</p>

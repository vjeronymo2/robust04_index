			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Shifts in perception: The employers' view of the jobs market The government likes to claim that the UK labour market adjusts virtually simultaneously to changes in demand. Employers appear to agree - but they give scarcely any credit to the government for bringing about this state of affairs. The flexibility of the jobs market, they say, has little to do with reforms to labour legislation, and more to do with global competition, the recent recession and changing attitudes towards work. 'A shift in the perception of work, together with a shortage of work and the fact that businesses are open for much longer hours have combined to make the market very definitely more flexible than it was 10 years ago,' says Mr Keith Cameron, group personnel director at the Burton Group, the retail group. A reorganisation at Burton a year ago resulted in the shedding of 2,000 full-time jobs and their replacement with about 3,000 part-time positions. 'We spread the available work across more people,' says Mr Cameron. The move has also allowed Burton to respond more efficiently to busy and slow periods in its clothing stores, he maintains. Other employers say a change in union attitudes helps explain different work patterns. Describing the flexible approach to hours now adopted by Courtaulds Clothing, the clothing division of Courtaulds Textiles, Mr David Hunt, personnel executive, says: 'The trade unions would not have talked to us about such changes some years ago, because they were banned by union policy and conference mandates. Now they understand that, if there is going to be a recovery in the industry, which is much smaller than it was, they need to be well aware of what it takes to satisfy the customer.' His view is shared by Mr Geoff Armstrong, director-general of the Institute of Personnel Management. 'Government reforms were not the primary driver behind all the changes in working practices,' he says. 'These were things that would have happened anyway. More and more managers and employees have had to find innovative ways of working in order to compete, and many trade unions have been supportive of the process.' Some employers are more cynical, believing that the high number of unemployed people, unable to find full-time work, means that employers can save money by hiring part-time staff. 'I don't think there are massive structural differences between now and 10 years ago,' says Mr Paul Dowling, head of corporate affairs at Asda, the supermarket chain, which employs many part-time workers. 'The labour market just waxes and wanes with recession.' Mr Ian Handford, national policy chairman of the Federation of Small Business, agrees: 'The thing that makes life easiest for employers now is simply the number of full-timers looking for jobs, part-time or otherwise.' As far as he is concerned, the government continues to hinder the efficient functioning of the labour market, particularly through the structure of social security payments. 'It is simply not true to say that there is more flexibility in the marketplace as far as part-time work is concerned,' he says. 'Only this week I wanted to extend the hours of one of my members of staff, but she couldn't do it because of the losses to her social security benefits that the extra hours would have entailed.' Another test of a responsive labour market is the ease with which employers can hire and fire to cope with changes in demand. Until the mid-1980s, the bill for making redundancy payments was refunded through the National Insurance Fund. Now employers have to carry the burden themselves, and this appears to be restricting the flexibility of the jobs market. This is particularly so for small employers, for some of which the cost of redundancy is prohibitive.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Reality visits the race circuit Many may have shared my opinion of motor racing: a matter of getting the best car available and putting your foot down. Noisy, dirty, tedious, you have no idea who is winning. It is the one sport which is the opposite of healthy exercise. Indeed, it might even be disqualified as a sport if you accept the definition laid down by an editor with whom I once worked: 'Do you have to take your fag out of your mouth before you start?' If you can smoke while doing it, then it isn't a sport - so motor racing ranks, or did, alongside darts. Yet, the tragedies of last weekend at Imola made me at least think again. Motor racing is the only competitive sport in which those involved risk their lives as a matter of course. The deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna also demonstrated the role of the racing driver as a universal modern icon. No other sport produces figures who attract the same recognition, even awe, from a global public. The obituaries perpetuated the myth of the driver-as-hero. Reports and comment on the news also served to highlight contrasting national attitudes. Not towards motor racing but to the meaning of life and the significance of death as a spectacle. In serious British newspapers, the events were a matter for the news and obituary pages. But most main French dailies decided that the loss of Ayrton Senna was worthy of the highest editorial consideration. The communist Humanite drew an unsurprising Marxist conclusion: 'In spite of the intervention of the drivers, the sporting authorities did not deign to interrupt the spectacle when it was turning into a blood bath. Sponsors' contracts prevail.' For many, there was the problem of death-as-news. 'If, in itself, the death of two drivers on a Formula One grand prix circuit is not more tragic than the numerous daily victims counted in Bosnia, Rwanda or on our roads, the death of Ayrton Senna arouses more than a passing emotion,' said La Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest. It then went on to consider putting robots in cars, but concluded that no robot could replace the man in the cockpit because 'once a fortnight, the grand prix races bring to 1 1/2 bn viewers those heroes who bear their highest aspirations.' For France-Soir, the deaths provided yet another chance to contemplate the nature of human folly. Investing billions to gain a few seconds was only one facet of futility - less serious, perhaps, than the other news of massacres and civil war. Nonetheless, it provided a more serious moral: 'In adoring the Golden Calf - or, if you prefer, the Dollar Calf - men, tempting the devil, finish by enraging the gods.' Contrast this with Germany. One lone pontification, and that only from the Magdeburg Volksstimme: 'There will be a world-wide outcry against excess speed, first and rightly against unsafe circuits. In coming days, the chain of unfortunate events will be held responsible for the battlefield of Imola, but man himself is the cause.' This kind of thing might encourage even Anglo-Saxons to see virtues in French intellectual pretension. It was, however, the Italian sporting press which showed the greatest qualities. The Sunday edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport ran a huge headline: 'Tragedy at Imola,' and an editorial headed: 'No, it's not a video game.' One must repeat: that was on the Sunday, the day after Ratzenberger's death but before Senna's. Nobody else took much notice of Ratzenberger. Good journalism means, among other things, spotting the story first and La Gazzetta proved this in its editorial on Ratzenberger's crash: 'It had to happen sooner or later. And not only because of the iron law of statistics. For too long, Formula One has been considered a kind of video game where cars travel at the greatest speed and only occasionally crash. The driver walks from his box, enters another and entertains the public again. Death becomes virtual reality.' For its next issue, the headline proclaimed that Formula One had died with Senna. Its commentary described this category of race as 'a sort of 'citadel of madness' . . . .creating paragons of mystification from a better past, and a present flying towards perdition.' The Latin temperament communicates the symbolic significance of events which stolid northerners find hard to reconcile with their fixed hierarchy of values. The latter feel ashamed of agonising over the death of racing drivers, so trivial in a world of mass tragedy. For Latins, though, all tragedies are linked; Imola and Bosnia are part of the same reality. It is all beyond me but, certainly, I now see motor racing in a different light.

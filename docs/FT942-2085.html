			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Renewed doubt over housing recovery Fresh doubts about the recovery of the housing market were raised yesterday when figures for net new mortgage lending by building societies last month showed a sharp drop compared with the previous month. According to figures released by the Building Societies Association, societies' net new lending was Pounds 806m in May - a fall of 17 per cent from the Pounds 974m in April. In May last year it was Pounds 896m. However, in a more encouraging sign, there was a rise in last month's net new commitments undertaken by societies - loans approved but not actually taken up within the period covered. These rose by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 3.28bn, against Pounds 3.14bn in April. There was also better news on personal savings as societies received a net inflow of funds for the second consecutive month, after five months of net outflows as they struggled against competition. Net receipts totalled Pounds 370m in May, although they are still just over half the Pounds 700m recorded in May last year. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said the lending figures appeared 'to reflect some caution on the part of households, but provide no firm evidence of a downturn in housing market activity'. However, estate agents and housebuilders reported signs the upturn may be stalling. More than half of the 143 estate agents questioned in a survey published today said sales during the three months to the end of May had 'either flattened out or declined' compared with the previous three months. The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said agents blamed tax rises and higher interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages for the slowdown. The institution denied that prices had fallen. Nearly three-quarters of agents said prices remained stable, while 17 per cent said 'prices were still edging upwards'. Fewer than 10 per cent said prices had fallen compared with the previous three months. Housebuilders have also reported lower sales activity since the spring. Builders say weekly sales are currently little higher than during the corresponding period last year. Earlier this year, industry sales were 10-15 per cent higher than at the same stage of 1993. However, consumer confidence, which hit a four-year low in April, is showing signs of recovery, according to the latest Gallup survey. Asked how the financial position of their household would change over the next 12 months, 17 per cent of respondents said things would get better and 33 per cent said worse.

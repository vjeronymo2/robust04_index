			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: In praise of modern epics - David Murray admires recordings of Maxwell Davies and Birtwistle FINE individual performances come and go on records, whilst the music itself continues its serene existence in a timeless realm. But modern recording makes not only unique performances available to far-flung audiences, but new music itself, which in the old days you could discover only by being a good score-reader or travelling far. Two records this year offer landmark-works by British composers to the wider audience. On Collins 13902, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies conducts his own Worldes Blis with the Royal Philharmonic. Famously, its 1969 Prom audience loathed it and stalked out in droves; now it sounds - in its tortuous, Mahlerian way - like molten inspiration, squeezed out under extraordinary pressure. The CD includes two more recent Davies works, both appealing: the lucid ground-pieces for The Turn of the Tide, designed for expansion by school groups, and his grave, whimsical 'in memoriam' pavane for Sir Charles Groves. On Collins 13872 Elgar Howarth conducts the Philharmonia in both Harrison Birtwistle's grand, rhetorical Prom success of 1972, The Triumph of Time, and a grand orchestral suite, Gawain's Journey - well, more than a suite, but not quite a symphony - from his resplendent 1991 opera Gawain. It is not a musical reprise of the stage action, for it chops forward and back through the score; but every 'late' Birtwistle score has its own fierce consistency, and this re-ordered set of Gawain parts never sounds like a patchwork. On the contrary, the epic musical events suggest their own wordless, towering scenario. And anyhow, the disc gives intrepid listeners the chance to get deep into some magnificent new music - parts of which may be trimmed away from the lengthy opera when Covent Garden revives it.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: Auto-da famous Elias Canetti, the Bulgarian-born philosopher, novelist, critic and Nobel prize winner, who was buried yesterday in Zurich aged 89, recalled in 1973 the troubled publication of his major work, the novel Auto-da-Fe, published in 1935. When completed, Canetti sent 'the three heavy tomes in an enormous package to Thomas Mann . . . It is hard to believe, but I was of the opinion that my sending the book was an honour to him'. But within three days the tomes returned, unread. Mann 'apologised, saying he didn't have the strength'. For four years the manuscript languished, unable to find a publisher. When it finally appeared, said Canetti, 'Thomas Mann now read the book immediately. He wrote that of all the books of that year, this novel . . . occupied him the most.' Of course, four years is an awful long time in the high-minded world of letters.</p>

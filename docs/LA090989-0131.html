			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VILLA PARK POUNDS BOLSA GRANDE, 45-0  </P> <P> Sometimes everything goes right for a football player. Take Gary Bladow, for  example. Virtually every time Bladow carried the ball for Villa Park High  School Friday night against Bolsa Grande, something good happened for the  Spartans.  </P> <P> Bladow only rushed 11 times, but he gained 112 yards, and his two touchdowns  were a big reason for Villa Park's 45-0 victory.  </P> <P> The problem for Bolsa Grande was that the night was going well for the rest of  the Spartan backfield as well. Craig Moresco ran for 69 yards; Shane Norris ran  for 47 and Shawn Potter ran for 35 yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Jason  Martian completed three of his seven passes for 61 yards and a touchdown. You  get the picture.  </P> <P> "We'll take the points when we get them," said Villa Park coach Pat Mahoney.  "They were hard to come by last year."  </P> <P> This Spartan defense didn't allow Bolsa to come close to the end zone. Of  course, Bolsa didn't give itself much of a chance as it fumbled away its first  three possessions. And on the fourth, with Bolsa already behind 9-0, Villa  Park's Garrett Johnson tacked Bolsa punter Tim Desrosiers on the one-yard line  after Desrosiers ran down an errant snap.  </P> <P> Bladow followed with one of his touchdowns and the game was all but over with  the Spartans leading, 17-0.  </P></p>

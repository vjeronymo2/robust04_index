			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PRICE PLAYS, BUT LA JOLLA PLAYS BETTER IN 69-44 WIN  </P> <P> On Monday, Jerome Price was an ineligible standout guard for University City  High's boys' basketball team. He had participated in the Gus Macker  three-on-three basketball tournament Jan. 28-29.  </P> <P> To do so was a CIF no-no under Rule 600. Or was it?  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William C. Pate granted a temporary  restraining order against the CIF until a hearing could determine if there was  any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, La Jolla limited Price to 11 points and seven rebounds, and those  were team highs as the Vikings downed University City, 69-44.  </P> <P> The victory, coupled with Mission Bay's 57-51 loss to USDHS, gives La Jolla  (15-8 overall, 7-2 in league play) a one-game lead with one game to play in the  City Western League. Mission Bay (14-7, 6-3) is in second place. University  City (15-9, 5-4) is in third.  </P> <P> La Jolla, assured of at least a tie for the title, can win it outright with a  victory over last-place USDHS Friday.  </P> <P> In lieu of complaining about the Price situation, La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth  said before the game, "We hope to play U.C. at full strength."  </P> <P> They did, though it was the Vikings who were at full strength. All five  starters had good games, led by senior guard Adam Kleid's 27 points.  </P> <P> "He dictated the tempo," Eveleth said. "This is the finest game he's played all  the way around for us."  </P> <P> Erick Litch added 11 points and eight rebounds and David Berteaux 10 points.  Kyle Kupiec had nine points and eight rebounds and sophomore forward Craig  Woodall had eight points and a game-high 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> With Kleid scoring 15 points in the first half, La Jolla took a 30-23 lead.  Price, who made the first basket of the game on a 17-foot jump shot, had just  three points.  </P> <P> In their first meeting Jan. 24, La Jolla had led the Centurions by 13 in the  third quarter before losing in overtime. There would be no letdown Wednesday,  however, as La Jolla dominated the second half, 39-21.  </P> <P> After Price made two free throws with 3:04 left in the third quarter, La Jolla  led, 40-33. The Vikings then went on a 17-2 run, including 12 in a row, to  giving them a 57-35 lead.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the City Western League:  </P> <P> USDHS 57, Mission Bay 51 -- Anthony Massa scored nine of his team-leading 15  points in the fourth quarter as visiting USDHS (9-11, 2-7) rallied from a  five-point deficit and knocked Mission Bay out of a share of the league lead.  Brett Grebing scored 19 points and Keith Berkley added 14 for Mission Bay  (14-7, 6-3).  </P> <P> City Central League  </P> <P> San Diego 75, Crawford 68 -- Milton Miller scored 26 points and Andre Letchaw  added 14 to lead No. 5-ranked San Diego (16-4, 7-2) past host Crawford. San  Diego led by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter, but Crawford (15-8,  5-4) rallied to within 71-67 in the final minute. James Clark put the game away  with four free throws. Chris Johnson had 18 points and Tracy Halton added 17  for Crawford.  </P> <P> Lincoln 109, Christian 71 -- Lincoln's Joe Temple had 15 steals to break the  San Diego Section record for steals in a game (13) he set earlier this season.  Temple scored 35 points and had 17 rebounds, and Aaron Wilhite added 31 points  and led Lincoln (24-1, 9-0) with 27 rebounds. Christian is 12-10 and 4-5.  </P> <P> Hoover 64, St. Augustine 57 -- Alex Davis scored 18 points to lead host Hoover  (2-20, 1-8), which rallied from a 47-46 deficit after three quarters. Mike  Mossuto led St. Augustine (2-20, 1-8) with 19 points.  </P> <P> City Eastern League  </P> <P> Serra 63, Madison 61 -- Madison had the ball with 1 second left and the score  tied, 61-61, but Jermaine Jordan intercepted an inbounds pass and scored on a  bank shot from the top of the key for host Serra (13-9, 5-4).

But Johnson changed his mind before the game and  Rancho Buena Vista (11-13, 7-6) won. The only problem came early in the fourth  quarter when the lights in Escondido's gym went out for 15 minutes. Todd  Fellars, who scored a game-high 31 points, hit a three-pointer to snap a 47-47  tie just before the lights went out. Escondido, which never caught up after the  lights came back on, got 27 points from Brooks Barnhard, but fell to 11-11,  6-7.  </P> <P> Oceanside 70, San Marcos 47 -- Fred Dunn scored 24 points and Jerry Garrett  added 16 to lead visiting Oceanside (12-9, 10-3), which blew open a close game  by outscoring San Marcos, 29-6, in the third quarter.

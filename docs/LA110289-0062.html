			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> THOMAS FINED FOR FLOUTING COURT WITH FLYERS  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge has fined Ervin (Tony) Thomas $500 for violating a court  order that banned him from portraying himself as an incumbent during his  unsuccessful City Council campaign against Garland Hardeman.  </P> <P> Hardeman, who defeated Thomas last month and now sits on the council, said the  ruling "caps Thomas' political career."  </P> <P> The contempt of court ruling Monday comes after two years of political and  legal battles between the two men.  </P> <P> Thomas edged Hardeman out when they first met in a June, 1987, council  election, but a Superior Court annulled Thomas' victory, ordering a new  election after finding violations by Thomas' campaign workers in the absentee  balloting. Thomas appealed the decision, remaining on the council during the  two years of court appeals.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled in August that because Thomas' 1987  victory was annulled, he could not refer to himself as an incumbent councilman  during the campaign. The judge ruled that Thomas campaign brochures showing  Thomas sitting in the council chambers and referring to his time on the council  violated her order.  </P> <P> Thomas called the fine "a bit harsh" and said the ruling had limited his  freedom of expression. Calling the two-year legal fight "an agony," he said it  has left him in "deep financial debt."  </P> <P> The law firm that represented Hardeman without charge is seeking payment from  Thomas and the city of its approximately $230,000 in legal fees.  </P> <P> The City Council discussed the fees in executive session Tuesday, but declined  comment on the result. Hardeman did not attend that session. Marc Lacey  </P></p>

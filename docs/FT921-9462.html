			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Conrad Black interested in Maxwell newspapers MR CONRAD BLACK, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, fresh from his acquisition of the Fairfax group in Australia is interested in the New York Daily News. The future of the tabloid daily taken over by Mr Robert Maxwell in March is uncertain following the death of Mr Maxwell and the collapse of his empire. The loss-making newspaper, which was part of the private Maxwell businesses, filed for protection against bankruptcy in December. Mr Black confirmed yesterday that he had expressed a general interest in the Maxwell newspaper properties and added that it was 'conceivable' that he could become a serious contender for the Daily News. Mr Black, who owns 85 per cent of the Daily Telegraph group, said last night that the Daily News 'used to have a franchise. I'm not sure it still does.' The paper had been on strike for four months before Mr Maxwell was given Dollars 60m by its previous owners, the Tribune Group, to take it over. During the strike a non-union paper was produced, but circulation fell from 1m to about 300,000. Following the Fairfax deal, Mr Black is interested in looking at any significant newspaper property that comes on the market. Apart from Ma'ariv, the Israeli daily, Mr Black has registered a general interest in Mirror Group Newspapers. As the owner of a Conservative broadsheet newspaper, he does not regard himself as a likely or even particularly credible proprietor for a Labour-supporting tabloid. The Telegraph chairman's main interest lies in the Scottish titles of MGN, which include the Scottish Daily Record, the Sunday Mail and a chain of weeklies. A serious Black interest in the former Maxwell Scottish titles would also cause less monopoly problems. At the moment, however, Arthur Andersen, the administrators of the private Maxwell interests including a 51 per cent stake in MGN, are insisting that the shares are not for sale and that when they are sold, it will be a single group.</p>

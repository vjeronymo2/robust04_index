			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / German refusal to cut rates disappoints markets THE BUNDESBANK yesterday stood firmly by its monetary policy, refusing to cut its key interest rates in spite of expectations by the financial markets. In a renewed demonstration of its determination to take a long-term view of inflation prospects and the growth of money supply in the German economy, the central bank council declined to react to the latest slight easing in the inflation rate. It left its discount rate at 6.75 per cent, and the Lombard rate at 7.75 per cent. Economists in Paris said the decision could delay reductions in French interest rates. But they said France would still pursue its policy of step by step cuts in borrowing costs. 'There might be a tactical wait before the next move', said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, 'but French rates will continue to head downwards and the momentum of falling money market rates should be maintained.' Speculation about a cut in German rates centred on a statement by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the vice-president of the Bundesbank, that further appreciation of the D-Mark was 'undesirable', and on a reduction in the inflation rates for three of the largest federal states. However, the latest money supply figure showed a growth rate well above the upper limit of the bank's target range. The decision not to move on interest rates came as a disappointment to dealers in financial markets and to the German government, which is looking for a steady reduction to help revive the German economy. The French franc and other European currencies came under pressure after the Bundesbank meeting. The franc closed at FFr3.502 to the D-Mark, nearly 3 centimes down on the day, while the Belgian franc fell particularly sharply, undermined by a declaration from a group of Flemish economists earlier this week that the currency should break its long-standing link with the D-Mark. In New York, it ended the day marginally higher against the D-Mark at FFr3.496. The Bundesbank council meeting was the first since late July, when its refusal to cut its discount rate then precipitated currency turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result, EC finance ministers agreed to abandon the narrow fluctuation bands in the ERM on August 2. Editorial Comment, Page 13 Currencies, Page 23 See Lex</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Brazil candidates ignore fears of violence: A look at the big issue which is not being addressed Heavy machine guns and assault rifles are commonplace on the streets of Vigario Geral, a shanty town 20 minutes' drive from Rio de Janeiro's banking district. The town's drug den, at the end of the main street, is patrolled by heavily armed 'soldiers' working for the local trafficker, Flavio Negao. In most respects Vigario Geral is just another Brazilian shanty town, or favela. Its streets are unpaved and its sewage untreated. Although it was settled more than 30 years ago, there is still no road access and the only entrance is an elevated walkway over a railway line. The population of 25,000 has two telephones. But in August last year 21 residents of Vigario Geral were executed by about 30 masked gunmen alleged to have been police officers seeking revenge either for the murder of some colleagues or for an extortion attempt that had gone wrong. The 21 who died turned out to be ordinary workers and none was involved in the drug business. Thirty-three men are on trial for the murders. Violence is common in Brazil but the scale of the Vigario Geral massacre stunned the country. It prompted the setting up of the Viva Rio movement to tackle violence and improve the city's image. According to most national polls, people rank violence as their first or second concern but it is hardly addressed by the main candidates in presidential and congressional elections to be held next month. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the front-runner for president, says security is one of his five priorities. But in nightly TV broadcasts, which all candidates are allowed under elections rules, he has spent much more time discussing economic issues, health and even agriculture. Of the eight candidates for president, four have yet to mention violence in their broadcasts. Lula da Silva. According to their advisers, the main candidates are less concerned about violence because, outside big cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio, it is not a daily issue. But even in the big cities, violence is not receiving much attention. Mr Caio Ferraz, a sociologist living in Vigario Geral, says he invited candidates for the governorship of Rio state to debate violence and public security. None turned up, and two candidates did not even reply. Politicians blame rising violence on the Brazilian state which, in the last past 10 years of mounting economic and social problems, has steadily lost credibility as the police, justice system and prison service have been underfunded and overburdened. 'The police rarely come here,' says Mr Ferraz, 'and when they do, it is to kill people. The government does so little that we have become a kind of parallel state.' Sao Paulo's 70,000-strong police force is 17,000 less than the level required by state law. The state has one judge for every 20,000 people, compared with one for 5,000 in Europe. The justice system is slow and bureaucratic. 'If we arrested all known criminals there would not be room to lock them up,' says Colonel Hermes Bittencourt Cruz of the Sao Paulo police. It is probably worse in Rio, where the police force has been seriously undermined by corruption and involvement in drug trafficking. Mr Antonio Carlos Biscaia, attorney general, complains: 'Police go to drug traffickers with arrest warrants but instead of arresting them, they negotiate the price to let them go free. Mr Biscaia says 40 per cent of the murders committed in one region of Rio in the last three years are still unsolved. 'Crime is not unique to Brazil but our mechanisms to fight crime don't work. Yet the politicians say Brazil has lots of other social problems, and security is relegated down the list,' he says. Analysts agree that tackling violence will require many years of investment in education, reform of the judicial system and an economy able to create jobs. An end to Brazil's worsening income disparity and more equitable wealth distribution would also help, some argue. What is important, says Mr Ferraz, is the political will to change the way the state acts. He points to Vigario Geral's shortage of phones and unpaved roads. By comparison, the government this month opened a 21km stretch of dual carriageway road that runs right past the favela. 'The state has always excluded us in the favelas,' says Mr Ferraz. It is not doing anything here to help us, only we are.' Brazil's presidential hopefuls may ignore such complaints but dealing with these problems and tackling violence will be urgent priorities for whoever wins the elections.</p>

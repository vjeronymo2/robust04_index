			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: Novotna's day on court - Tennis THIS afternoon's 100th Ladies Singles final at Wimbledon could mark the beginning of a new era in women's tennis. If the 24-year-old Czech, Jana Novotna, seeded No 8, plays as well today as she did on Thursday to beat the nine-times champion Martina Navratilova 6-4 6-4, then she will beat the reigning champion, Steffi Graf. But will she be allowed to? This match is as fascinating as the one forecast by the seeding committee, Graf (1) v Navratilova (2), for Novotna is the logical successor to Navratilova as apostle of the serve and volley game. Like Martina, Jana was born in Czechoslovakia and for the past three and a half years has been coached by Martina's successor as that nation's No 1 player, Hana Mandlikova. Ever since I first saw Novotna in 1986 when she won the US Open junior doubles I knew that she had the potential for greatness. Already the fluent, well-timed ground strokes (albeit with too large a swing in those days) were well grooved, the keenness to advance to the net was apparent, the ability to move from low volleys to deep overheads with the fast, natural court coverage of a born athlete all marked her as one to watch. Still lacking was the self belief of a true champion. Young Jana was a shy, sensitive person, almost apologetic for the glorious winners she hit. Would this teenager who bounced around the court with the playful grace of a lion cub grow in to a fierce lioness capable of making a kill? Jana's rose steadily but unsensationally through the rankings, from 172 in 1986 to 49 in 1987, 11 in 1989 and 7 two years later. Yet still on the great occasions her belief died. There were two failures in 1991 that left a question mark over her. At the Australian Open she scored a magnificent 5-7 6-4 8-6 quarter-final victory over Graf but collapsed in the final against Monica Seles after taking the opening set. At the French Open, Jana was thrashing Gabriela Sabatini with some glorious all-court tennis. However, after letting two match points slip in the second set and then losing the tie-break, she again collapsed and lost the last set 6-0. Suddenly, here at Wimbledon, it has all come together. Three straight sets wins over inferior clay-court opposition were the prelude to a fine win in three sets against another with huge potential - Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands. There followed a 6-4 6-3 victory over Sabatini, which seemed to exorcise the demon of self-doubt. Certainly belief was still strong in the semi-final against Navratilova. The serve, slightly remodelled with less knee bend and a faster throwing action, was deadly. Six aces brought her tally for the tournament to 28 and many more deep penetrating deliveries paved the way for firm winning volleys. But it was Jana's tactical acumen that most impressed. Jana, encouraged by urgent nods of approval from Mandlikova in the players' box, stuck to her plan. Her blocked returns of serve, taken on the rise and projected down the lines past the advancing server, made every Navratilova service game a gamble. Three times in all Novotna broke the former champion who was made to look a yard slower than usual. Before the match Mandlikova had told me: 'Jana is now mature enough to win. She may have lost to Martina seven times, but she is not afraid to win today.' Jana herself said afterwards: 'I came into the match with a little disadvantage. Martina has won the tournament nine times. She feels she owns the Centre Court. I was the one who didn't play one match there . . . I had to overcome so many things. So I just said, don't worry about it. The court is the same like anywhere else so just play the ball. That's exactly what I did. I just think I've done it so well and played just the perfect match.' Jana was not boasting, simply being honest. She was right. She did play the perfect match. Hear Navratilova: 'That was the best she ever played. If she plays like that she can definitely win the final. There's no question about that.' No question? Well, Graf will have something to say about that as she she seeks to add to her four titles from five finals in the last six years. Now fully restored in spirit after the family traumas of 1990, the defending champion is playing as well as ever, in spite of a still suspect right ankle. Once she had wiped out a 1-4 deficit against Conchita Martinez, Graf's powerful serve and forehand, allied to her heavily sliced backhand and some enterprising volleys carried her to a comfortable 7-6 6-3 victory. Graf will be playing in her 20th Grand Slam final today, Novotna in her second. The champion will be aiming for a 13th success, her challenger for a first. In spite of her greater experience, Graf is aware of the danger. 'She's got the talent, she's got the game. I will have to have a very solid serve and I have to work on my return which hasn't been particularly good today.' This is the 20th meeting between the two best athletes in the game. Graf has lost only three. She won their only contest on grass - at Wimbledon in 1987, but six of their last seven have gone the distance. All the ingredients are there for a classic battle. The world's second best baseliner against the best serve-volleyer in women's tennis; experienced champion against talented tyro; German against Czech. Above all, though, it will be a battle of the mind. Graf is prone to moments when her forehand goes haywire; Novotna must prove that the solid belief she displayed against Navratilova will not melt when the game's greatest prize is at stake. It should be a fascinating afternoon. The men's final tomorrow is, appropriately on July 4, an all-American affair. It brings together the two men who head the world rankings, Pete Sampras (1) and Jim Courier (2). Sampras served magnificently yesterday to beat the three-time champion Boris Becker 7-6 6-4 6-4. The match turned on one volley Becker missed in the first set tie-break. His confidence broken, Becker's serve disintegrated. Three double faults of the 12 he served cost him the third game of the second set and his failure to break back with Sampras at 5-4, 15-40 virtually cost him the match. Courier, demoted behind Sweden's Stefan Edberg in the seedings, passed his verdict on that slight in the finest way possible. Once he had got used to the idea that Edberg's second serve is no longer a fearsome weapons, the issue was never in doubt. The realisation seemed to dawn on him midway through the second set. Trailing by one set and a break of serve in the second, Courier struck back with the pounding returns and passes that are his trademark. The third was all Courier as the Swede's confidence evaporated. Edberg was no longer prepared to follow all his second serves to the net. After just over two hours Courier was ahead by two sets to one. Eight games later man. Courier's 4-6 6-4 6-2 6-4 success on a surface which was supposed to be alien to him was a triumph of spirit over technique. If Sampras's suspect shoulder holds up I expect to see him add a first Wimbledon title to the only other Grand Slam title he holds - the 1990 US Open.</p>

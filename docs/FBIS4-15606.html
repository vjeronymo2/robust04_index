			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Commander of the Black Sea  Fleet Admiral Eduard Baltin has described as "actions of  uncontrollable gangs" the act of provocation which occurred in  Odessa on Sunday night, when some 120 Ukrainian commandoes  stormed the Black Sea Fleet's local conservation division.    According to Andrey Grachev, the chief of the Black Sea  Fleet  press centre, the storming was conducted from 21:00 to 23:00  [1700 to 1900 GMT] on [10] April. The Ukrainian storm troopers  arrested Russsian officers Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy Starikov and  Aleksandr Zelyonka. According to the source, the Russian naval  officers were handcuffed, although their only "offence" was that  they remained loyal to the oath of allegiance they gave once.  The other officers and midshipmen of the division were blocked  by Ukrainian commandoes inside the division base.    Grachev said the Ukrainian Navy commander Vladimir  Beskorovainy was aboard the commandship Slavutich in Odessa at  the time and his complicity in the action was, according to  Grachev, beyond doubt.</p>

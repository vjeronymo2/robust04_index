			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KNBC OFFERS TEMPERATE 'ROCK THE HOUSE'  </P> <P> Yo! NBC raps.  </P> <P> The network makes a hyperactive prime-time move into pop music's hottest corner  with a half-hour pilot airing tonight at 8 on KNBC Channel 4.  </P> <P> "Rock the House" is thin on actual live rap performances, but it has a winning  personality -- high-energy without seeming high-pressure. A segment of homemade  videos from high schools (and one preschool) around the country generates a  nice sense of community.  </P> <P> You get one song each from two legitimately happening rap acts, Kid N' Play and  Young M.C., and lots of routines by a pelvicentric troupe called the Dance  Possey, all of it jazzed up by some slow-motion and black-and-white effects. An  audience mills around and pumps its fists in a funky, warehouse-like set, and  D. J. Romeo presides over this hip-hop "Hullabaloo" with a proper enthusiasm.  </P> <P> The pilot gives no indication that "Rock the House" is ready to tackle the  touchier aspects of the dynamic and often controversial world of rap. Welcome  to the temperate zone. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

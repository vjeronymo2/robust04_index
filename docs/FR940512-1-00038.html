			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;&sect;364.54, 364.55, and 364.56 would keep important protections for consumers of IL services that exist in the current SILS regulations. In particular, the Secretary revised proposed &sect;364.56 to make it more consistent with the current SILS regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.57 also would permit the DSU to delegate its functions and responsibilities under proposed &sect;&sect;364.50, 364.51 (subject to proposed &sect;364.43(d)), 364.52, 364.53, and 364.56 to the service provider to which the DSU awards a grant or with which the DSU contracts to provide IL services in the State. Allowing the DSUs to delegate these functions and responsibilities permits the States greater flexibility in the operation of the SILS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added a new proposed &sect;364.58 that would require each service provider to establish appeals procedures and policies that an individual could use to obtain review of decisions made by the service provider concerning the individual's request for IL services or the provision of IL services to the individual. Proposed &sect;364.58 also would require the service provider to inform each individual who seeks or receives IL services about those appeals procedures and policies in formats that are accessible to individuals who seek or receive IL services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;364.59 would require a State to include in its State plan any financial needs test that would be used by a service provider to determine whether an individual with a significant disability could obtain IL services at no cost to the individual. Proposed &sect;364.59(d)(1) would require a service provider to maintain written policies covering the specific types of IL services for which a financial needs test could be applied and to maintain documentation of an individual's participation in the costs of any IL services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part 365  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed part 365 contains regulations for the SILS program authorized by part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. Pursuant to proposed &sect;365.11(c), if a State has designated a DSU to provide IL services for the general population of individuals with disabilities and a separate DSU to provide IL services for individuals who are blind, the State would have total discretion, without any interference from ED, to determine how it would divide the funds allotted to the State under part 365 between these two DSUs. The division of funds is a matter internal to the States, and the regulations would not exclude or mandate the involvement of the SILC in this decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;365.13 would impose requirements that a State would have to meet to satisfy its non-Federal share matching requirement under section 712(b) of the Act and proposed &sect;365.12. Proposed &sect;365.13(b) would prohibit a State from using cash contributions to satisfy its non-Federal share matching requirement if the contribution is for expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization with whom the donor shares a financial interest. Pursuant to proposed &sect;365.13(c), the receipt of a grant, subgrant, or contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act from the DSU would not be considered a benefit to the donor if the grant, subgrant, or contract was awarded under the State's regular competitive procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, proposed &sect;365.14(a) would prohibit a State from conditioning the award of a grant, subgrant, or contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act on a cash or in-kind contribution from an applicant. Proposed &sect;365.14(b) also would prohibit an individual, entity, or organization that is a grantee or subgrantee of the State, or has a contract with the State, from conditioning the award of a subgrant or subcontract on a cash or in-kind contribution to the State or to the grantee or contractor of the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;365.15 would impose the restrictions in &sect;365.14 on a State's use of in-kind contributions to meet the matching requirement in section 712(b) of the Act. The Secretary has not proposed to impose on in-kind contributions the restrictions in &sect;365.13 because fewer problems have arisen in the past as a result of the use of this type of contribution for matching purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would clarify the limitations in existing 34 CFR part 365. (See existing 34 CFR 361.76, which is incorporated by reference into the existing SILS program regulations by existing 34 CFR 365.15.) The proposed limitations would prevent States from making awards based on an applicant's ability to contribute the matching funds rather than on the programmatic merit of the applicant's proposal. The proposed limitations would not prohibit a State from accepting restricted contributions for providing services or benefits to a particular individual or group of individuals. The proposed limitations would prohibit a State only from using these restricted contributions to meet its matching share requirement if the donor of the cash contributions has restricted their use to expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization with whom the donor shares a financial interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

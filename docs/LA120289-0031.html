			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY FROM DELTA FACES NEW THREAT  </P> <P> In Southern California we cannot survive on water supplies available locally;  natural supplies meet less than one-third of our current needs. We must import  the rest from Northern California and from the Colorado River. Now, according  to your editorial, another element, a suspected cancer-causing agent,  trihalomethane, has been added to the controversy surrounding Southern  California's need for water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  </P> <P> Water demands in Southern California are expected to increase roughly 20% by  the year 2000. Our region still faces a highly undependable water supply in the  future even though we lead the state in efficient use of water, including water  conservation, water reclamation and ground-water management. Without a  reliable, high-quality water supply, Southern California cannot avoid the  adverse impact on our economy, our life styles, our very livelihood.  </P> <P> The latest report of potential contamination of one of Southern California's  important sources of water adds urgency to the cry that elected officials and  policy-makers address the management and optimum utilization of this most  precious resource. In providing us with the keys to the solutions, these  decision-makers can place emphasis on understanding and appreciating the water  needs of all regions and all sectors of the state, and build a bridge of  cooperation among them all.  </P> <P> A solution is out there. Everyone needs to be involved.  </P> <P> JOAN WILSON ANDERSON  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Southern California Water Committee Inc.  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Bond market's bull is gored All good things, including global bull markets in bonds, come to an end. The question is whether now is such a time. It might be - not because inflation is about to explode, but because there is little reason to expect it to fall much further either. By the beginning of this year, nominal long-term interest rates had fallen as far as economic fundamentals justified. Given that, any shock should be enough to generate a correction. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates in early February provided just such a change. The caution about base rate cuts expressed by Mr Kenneth Clarke's six 'wise men' this week may have added one for UK gilts. Realisation of just how cautiously the Bundesbank intends to lower interest rates may have had a similar effect on other European bond markets. Two points about the background to the bond market correction must be remembered: the first is that nominal long-term interest rates had fallen to remarkably low levels by the end of 1993 and the second is that falls in recent years have been hugely rewarding. In the US, for example, long bond yields bottomed out in October 1993 at 5.2 per cent, this being not only a sharp fall from the cyclical peak level of 9.3 per cent experienced in 1989, but also a level not seen since the early 1970s. Japanese long-term yields had fallen from 7.8 per cent in September 1990 to 3.1 per cent in January 1994, a level achieved once before, briefly, in 1987. Even in Germany, records have been struck. The long-term interest rate reached 5.5 per cent at the beginning of this year, down from around 9 per cent in 1990. In the last 25 years, long bond rates have been below 6 per cent only in 1978 and 1986-87. As for the UK, long-term bond rates peaked in 1990 at nearly 13 per cent, before declining to just above 6 per cent in early 1994, levels not seen since the first half of the 1960s. Speculators' fortunes After two miserable decades, during which long-term bond investors have been plucked like so many chickens, yields have plummeted to the levels of before the great inflation. In the process, speculators have made fortunes. The question is not so much why this may have stopped, but whether it made sense for the rally to go so far in the first place. Start with the fundamentals. The long-term rate of interest ought to reflect the real rate of interest, plus inflationary expectations. A good indication of the former is provided by the British government's index-linked gilt, whose yield fell to about 2 per cent in late 1993, down from a peak of 5 per cent at the time of sterling's expulsion from the ERM. There are two reasons for this sharp decline. One, which is UK-specific, is the disappearance, following sterling's depreciation, of the expectation that the currency would have to depreciate. The second is the realisation that the global demand for capital would remain sluggish for a fairly long period. Given the interconnection of the global capital markets and the absence of powerful expectations of further real exchange rate changes, the UK real rate of interest provides a global benchmark. If so, it suggests that long-term inflation expectations could have been as low as 1 per cent in Japan and about 3-4 per cent in Germany, the US and even the UK. Profitable business Bond yields could go much lower than they were, on a sustained basis, only if there were further downward revisions of inflationary expectations. How likely was this to happen? Rates of inflation in the US, for example, could average 2 per cent over the next decade, but they could easily average 4 per cent. Speculation also enters the picture. If short-term rates of interest are below long-term ones, there is no carrying cost to borrowing short term in order to invest long term. If bond yields are expected to fall, this looks a highly profitable business. So it has been for US banks. The expectation of short-term gain cannot continue forever. A rise in the cost of short-term borrowing is likely to achieve precisely this result, by increasing the cost of speculation on further increases in bond prices and driving speculators from the buying side of the market. The action of Mr Greenspan's Federal Reserve in early February simply pricked the speculative element in the US bond balloon. Nothing he said this week suggests he is particularly worried about inflation. Nor, for that matter, were Mr Clarke's wise men. Speculation on further declines in bond yields looks more costly. Since the real yield on index-linked gilts has itself risen by half a percentage point from its trough, the worldwide rise in bond yields can only be partly due to deteriorating inflationary expectations. Higher real rates of interest would reflect the end of speculation, but also the growing plausibility of recovery. Either way it is nothing to worry about, except, of course, for those who have been caught short.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / BZW to control Barclays loans BARCLAYS, the biggest UK bank, is to move control of large corporate lending in Europe to its BZW investment bank and curtail some lower-margin syndicated loans to raise earnings. Commercial banks are aiming to sell a wider range of services to big companies to make up for narrow lending margins. Barclays' move will be followed by a review of large corporate business in the UK next year. The bank said yesterday the review might lead to some large British customers being moved to the overall control of a BZW account executive rather than being handled by its retail and corporate banking division. The initiative follows the transfer of large corporate lending in the US to BZW at the start of this year. The bank is already transferring its Asian business to BZW, but retail banking in Europe will remain within the banking division. Mr David Band, BZW chief executive, said the division would review large corporate contracts in Europe and whittle away those in which it could not add services to lending. It expected to retain 300 customers. Mr Band said BZW hoped to sell corporate finance advice, securities underwriting, risk management, and pension fund management to European clients. Contracts were at risk where it was only part of a loan syndicate. The transfer follows a joint BZW/banking division review. Mr Band said it had decided against wholesale transfer of 'immensely more complex' relationships with large British companies. Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the banking division, said Barclays wanted to ensure that big UK companies could choose which part of the bank suited their needs. He did not anticipate a 'mammoth change'. National Westminster already handles relationships with large corporate clients under its NatWest Markets corporate and investment banking arm. Its branch banking division handles small and medium-sized companies. Mr Robinson said there was no disagreement between BZW and banking divisions over control of large corporate clients and the bank was evolving with the market. 'I do not see this as a battleground. It is a matter of logic,' he said. BZW announced the appointment of Mr Patrick O'Sullivan, currently general manager Europe for GE Capital's Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, to the new post of head of bank finance as a result of the moves.</p>

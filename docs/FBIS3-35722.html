			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Belarusian Premier  Vyacheslav Kebich regretted that the legislature expressed  no-confidence in speaker Stanislav Shushkevich and noted that  they were unanimous in the main approaches to reforming the  Belarusian state. He expressed opinion that the former  speaker's knowledge and prestige would serve Belarus for long  time in future.    The Belarusian government press service circulated here on  Friday the premier's replies to questions on how he appraises  parliament's vote against Shushkevich. Kebich said the  following:    "I regret what has happened. Sure, we had some differences  with Shushkevich on how to reform society and to build a  sovereign state. Incidentally, I'd like to note that the press  was often helpful in lending these differences unduly  exaggerated, I would say, hypertrophic importance.    "However, we used to find a common language with Shushkevich  on the main thing. We were at one on strategic approaches to  reforming Belarusian society and saw our main task in ensuring  the transition of the republican economy to market relations  without any extreme actions and social upheavals.    "We wanted to prevent a sharp drop in living standards, to  create gradually appropriate conditions and prerequisites for  national revival and to maintain stability, accord and civil  peace on Belarusian soil.    "We did our best for Belarus to become a full-fledged member  of the international community and to turn into a European and  civilised power."</p>

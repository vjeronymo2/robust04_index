			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BUSH GETS STAMP OF APPROVAL FOR KEEPING MAIL CARRIERS BUSY  </P> <P> Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank presented President Bush with a letter  carrier's cap and bag today as a tribute to Bush's prolific letter-writing,  then delivered a jesting notice about the bill to taxpayers for the postage.  </P> <P> "One of the traits for which you've become well-known is writing brief  congratulatory thank-you messages," Frank told Bush after the President gave  opening remarks to an international postal gathering.  </P> <P> "In fact, during your first year as the nation's chief executive, you've  generated more personal correspondence than many other Presidents during their  entire administrations," Frank added.  </P> <P> "I'd like to point out that every one of those has been franked," said the  postmaster general. A postal frank is free postage provided by the taxpayers  for the President and for members of Congress.  </P> <P> Bush, in his speech to the Universal Postal Union, noted that "every week, I  receive up to 60,000 letters from every state in the union and from nearly  every country in the world. You can get a lot of free advice in this job."  </P></p>

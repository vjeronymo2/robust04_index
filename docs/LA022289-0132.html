			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE'S SURVEILLANCE CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> CFTC CALLS SYSTEM FOR DETECTING ABUSES 'DEFICIENT,' SAYS INQUIRIES DELAYED  </P> <P> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Tuesday that the scandal-plagued  Chicago Board of Trade has a seriously "deficient" system for detecting trading  abuses. The agency charged that investigations are delayed too long and ordered  the Board of Trade to send its investigative logs to Washington on a monthly  basis.  </P> <P> The criticism focused on the effectiveness of the exchange's computerized trade  surveillance system.  </P> <P> Recent revelations of potentially massive scandals have focused public and  regulatory attention on the Chicago Board of Trade and on the city's other  major futures market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Federal investigations  at both exchanges reportedly have uncovered widespread patterns of fraud  involving rigged prices and phony bidding.  </P> <P> The investigations, which are being conducted by the FBI and the U.S.  attorney's office in Chicago, focus on futures trading in Treasury bills and in  foreign currencies. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a  specified quantity of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price  on a set date in the future.  </P> <P> Undercover FBI agents working as traders at the Chicago exchanges reportedly  found cases in which brokers completed transactions at prices above or below  true market levels and then pocketed the difference.  </P> <P> This type of abuse presumably should be detected by the board of trade  investigative system. But the Board of Trade procedures were found lacking in  speed and efficiency, according to the CFTC.  </P> <P> The board was very slow in its handling of investigations of potential trading  abuses, according to the CFTC study. These are carried out through a  computer-assisted operation known as a Trade Practice Investigation, or TPI.  The CFTC regulatory staff reviewed TPI cases and found "lengthy delays,"  according to its 145-page report.  </P> <P> There were 292 completed cases, taking from four months to 22 months to close.  However, 224 of the cases took more than one year from initial investigation to  final action.  </P> <P> "This represents an absence of control over the progress of TPIs and a lack of  attention to closing cases promptly once investigative work has been  completed," the CFTC report said.  </P> <P> In one case, involving alleged prearranged trading in options on corn, the  Board of Trade received a complaint on Oct. 6, 1986. But the two members  involved were not interviewed until the following August and September, when  the traders said essentially that they couldn't remember what had happened.  </P> <P> Responding to the CFTC report, the Board of Trade said Tuesday that it has  "always cooperated fully with the CFTC in their reviews of our enforcement  practices and we intend to do so with this review."  </P> <P> Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said: "It should be understood that most of the  material on which the report is based is more than 1 1/2 years old, and many of  the CFTC's recommendations have been implemented."  </P> <P> The board has increased the size of its audit office by 75% and "fully  computerized our audit trail surveillance systems," he said. In addition, board  committees have been "examining ways to enhance our audit trail, surveillance  and disciplinary action capabilities," according to Mahlmann.  </P> <P> The board has allocated $1 million to improve its computerized system, "which  will allow us to audit 100% of all trades daily," he said. "That is tantamount  to the Internal Revenue Service auditing 100% of all taxpayers in the country."  </P> <P> The CFTC's division of trading and markets conducted the study, which covered  the period from July, 1987, through April, 1988. CFTC staff met with Board of  Trade personnel from April, 1988, until October and then examined a sample of  investigative case files, market surveillance logs and audits.  </P></p>

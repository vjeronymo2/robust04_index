			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Air traffic stages a modest recovery UK AIR traffic staged a very modest recovery in the first quarter of this year after last year's slump caused by the Gulf war and the recession. Passenger traffic at airports in the south-east run by BAA, the airports operator, increased by 19 per cent to 13.6m passengers in the first quarter, against 11.4m in the same period last year at the height of the Gulf conflict. The BAA figures, published yesterday, show traffic increased by barely 1 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1990. Passenger traffic last month rose 12 per cent on March last year and was flat compared with March 1990. The small recovery compared with 1990 reflects the continuing impact of the recession. Traffic at London's Heathrow showed the strongest improvement, but Gatwick is still struggling to recover former passenger levels.</p>

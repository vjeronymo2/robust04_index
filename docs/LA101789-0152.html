			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRADE DEFICIT JUMPS 31%; DOW LOSES GROUND, OFF 18;  </P> <P> BLUE CHIPS HAD BEEN DOWN 63  </P> <P> Stocks retreated today following two of the wildest sessions on Wall Street  since the October, 1987, market crash.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 18.65 points to 2,638.73  after spiking down as much as 63 points around 11:30 a.m. Broader market  indicators also fell.  </P> <P> The Dow average had plummeted 190.58 points on Friday and bounced back with an  88.12-point gain on Monday, leaving investors groping for stable ground.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department handed the market some bad news today with its report  that the merchandise trade deficit rose nearly 31% in August to $10.77 billion  from a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.  </P> <P> But analysts did not all agree that the big trade deficit was a major factor in  today's stock decline. Some noted that bonds and the dollar -- which are most  sensitive to bad trade figures -- held up relatively well.  </P> <P> The dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade report, while  bonds were mixed -- an indication that investors were not seriously worried  about worsening inflation and higher interest rates.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve injected another $1.5 billion into the banking system today  after adding $2 billion in reserves on Monday. Banks will be able to use the  new reserves to make loans, including coming to the assistance of brokerage  firms caught in a cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices.  </P> <P> Stocks remain somewhat unstable after the drastic moves of the past two  sessions, some analysts said.  </P> <P> "There's much more going on in the stock market at the moment than the trade  numbers," said Lawrence A. Veit, international economist at Brown Brothers  Harriman &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "You'll tend to see somewhat accentuated volatility this week and next," said  Giulio Martini, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.  </P> <P> In the overall New York Stock Exchange today, declining issues outpaced  advances by almost 3 to 2. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled a  heavier-than-usual 224.07 million shares, with the heaviest action in the early  going.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index slid 0.87 to 188.89.  </P></p>

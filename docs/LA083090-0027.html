			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ELLIOTT-INGRAM LOOKS FOR SENSE OF IDENTITY  </P> <P> Big jazz bands are a rare breed these days, sustained for the most part by the  dedication of musicians willing to work free rehearsals and low-paying gigs.  Groups like the Elliott-Ingram Band, which appeared at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill  Monday night with saxophonist Gary Foster as guest soloist, illustrate both the  promises and the problems of this approach.  </P> <P> The ensemble has been in existence for about 2 1/2 years, led by saxophonist  Steve Elliott and trumpeter Roger Ingram. Typically, on this night Ingram was  absent, on the road with a different group. The other musicians were a mixture  of veterans and rookies, with a few former Woody Herman sidemen making up the  band's nucleus.  </P> <P> The collective playing was good, but not outstanding; the arrangements were  well crafted, but fairly predictable; and the solos ranged from fair to  excellent. Pieces like "Limehouse Blues," "My Foolish Heart" and "Gal in  Calico" peaked when soloists like Brian Scanlon on alto saxophone, Mark Lewis  on trumpet, Scott Tibbs on piano and Jerry Pinter on tenor saxophone made the  most of their relatively short solo space.  </P> <P> What was missing was a sense of identity -- a sound and substance to  distinguish the Elliott-Ingram band from the numerous other groups with  similarly limited opportunities to grow into unique musical entities. The  showcasing of Foster on a few numbers provided a much-needed infusion of  character. His playing, as always, included several superbly illuminating  readings of standards like "You Go to My Head" and "You Don't Know What Love  Is." Foster has taken the Lee Konitz-like mannerisms of his earliest work and  synthesized them into a genuinely original, always communicative  improvisational style.  </P> <P> But even with Foster's participation, the Elliott-Ingram congregation never  quite found a voice of its own. More rehearsals and better charts would make a  difference, but the most elusive missing element -- and one that is essential  to all successful big bands -- was a self-generating energy-driven inner  spirit.

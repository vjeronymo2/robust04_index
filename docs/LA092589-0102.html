			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> 'LANDSCAPE AS THOUGHT' IS A NON-TRADITIONAL VIEW  </P> <P> Gorgeous landscape photographs sell glossy calendars and whet the appetites of  armchair travelers. Beautiful vistas have motivated generations of landscape  painters. But many contemporary artists no longer want to treat landscape as  just another pretty face.  </P> <P> These artists find their inspiration in a specific environmental, metaphysical  or psychological approach to landscape. Their work is not necessarily "pretty"  -- although it can be -- and, like most significant contemporary art, it  requires the viewer to do more than passively stare and admire.  </P> <P> "Landscape as Thought," at Cal State Fullerton's Main Art Gallery (through Oct.  11), offers an introduction to such non-traditional treatments of landscape  with two distinctly different bodies of work by Lita Albuquerque and Richard  Misrach. Albuquerque creates quasi-mystical pieces in nature or gallery  settings; Misrach photographs evidence of the damage people have levied on  once-pristine tracts of desert. Both artists' work is superficially attractive  -- sometimes too attractive -- but it is meant as a serious treatment of the  complex relationship of human beings to the land they inhabit.  </P> <P> When Albuquerque works directly in nature, she usually makes cuts in the earth  -- geometric shapes or human silhouettes -- and fills them with powdered blue,  red and yellow pigment. On a Malibu cliff she has "drawn" a perpendicular blue  line that joins with the ocean. In other works, colored pigments locate the  shadows of such different objects as the moon and the tip of the Washington  Monument.  </P> <P> In another piece, she sprinkled pigment on a group of rocks in the Mojave  Desert that she had arranged like constellations. Still another piece involved  a group of white-clad people, dancing under her direction, who produced a huge  red-and-blue earth "drawing" of circles and a spiral.  </P> <P> Some viewers have found great poetry and presence in these pieces (represented  in the exhibit with color photographs). Albuquerque says they are "about the  place where inner and outer worlds meet." Linked in a general way to ancient  ritual practices, these activities also reflect the artist's eccentric  dream-images and speculative fancies.  </P> <P> Very much the New-Age mystic, she is fascinated by both astronomy and alchemy.  One habit of hers -- which she says she performs "at least 10 times a day" --  is to visualize the Earth from a great distance, as if traveling down through  the galaxies.  </P> <P> As Jan Butterfield's catalogue essay relates, Albuquerque was utterly  devastated after she had to move from an ocean-view studio to another one in  Los Angeles. Eventually she came to see that her obsession with the horizon  line was connected to her childhood in Tunisia. Fixed points of the earth were  the main constants in her life then, as her parents were pursuing their lives  at geographical and emotional removes.  </P> <P> There's no question that her art stems from genuine feelings. But for this  viewer, the hokey tone of her metaphysical beliefs and the materials she  chooses to use are major stumbling blocks. As someone who loathes the numbing  quality of New-Age music and edges away from people who start talking about  higher states of consciousness, I fail to find the meaning in her work. And  even if the colors of pigment she employs are historically associated with  alchemy, as Butterfield writes, that's not the connection a viewer is likely to  make in this era of seductive advertising and conspicuous consumption.  </P> <P> The color-dusted rocks -- which Albuquerque exhibited last year at a Los  Angeles gallery -- look too much like chichi window dressing; the earth  drawings don't (in photographs, at least) resonate with the authority and power  of earthworks by such artists as the late Ana Mendieta. Albuquerque's work  seems to be asking us to play make-believe against our wills, pretending things  we don't feel.  </P> <P> Her gallery installation at Cal State Fullerton, "Spheres of Influence/Sphere  of Influences," consists of nine tall, rectangular, carefully lit pieces of  corrugated cardboard covered with gold leaf that lean out from the walls. In  the center of the room is a pale, round, porous rock. Lined up with the rock  like a planet in orbit is a small gold ball.  </P> <P> These objects set up various shadow patterns that variously impinge on one  another. The title of the work seems to refer both to that visible fact and to  the unseen forces that objects in space exert on one another. But the whole  thing seems at once too pedantic and too glitzy to make a serious point about  anything, let alone the laws of the universe.  </P> <P> Misrach's early strobe-lit color work from the late '70s introduced lush  visions of tropical foliage glowing against the night sky. His work in this  exhibit is at once completely different in theme and oddly similar in its sense  of quiet, stillness and dislocation.  </P> <P> Believing that "there is no neutral landscape" -- as he says in the  audio-visual introduction to the exhibit -- Misrach has since turned his  attention to terrains in which the human presence has profoundly changed the  course of nature. Although we may think of the desert as a vast, empty tract of  land, Misrach brings us up to date with images of dirt-bike tracks, the  sand-covered carcasses of animals that apparently were victims of nuclear  testing, discarded beer bottles poking up like carbuncles, goof-offs pointing  guns at each other, graffiti and raging fires.  </P> <P> Some of these images are quite beautiful -- especially the fires, which drop  gauzy veils of smoke over the landscape and add flickering orange accents to  the desert's muted colors. Views of the Salton Sea -- an ancient dried-out lake  in California that was flooded by an ill-managed irrigation project -- have a  dreamy, bleached-out look, as if time had been suspended. Often, even the  derelict signs of an earlier human presence -- TV antennas, clotheslines, gas  pumps -- have an abstract beauty, like so many graceful vertical brush strokes  made by a master Chinese painter.  </P> <P> Without the images presenting out-and-out desecration -- such as the use of a  graffiti Crucifixion scene for target practice -- Misrach's message might be  too subtle for the average viewer. But the fascination of this work lies  precisely in the tension between the passive loveliness of certain of the  images and the artist passions about the environment. It is one thing to make  "political" art that shouts a message loud and clear. It is another to make art  that lures the viewer with a surface of odd, dreamy beauty and waits for pained  recognition to sink in. By the time you realize what you're looking at, your  guard is down and you've been charmed into attention.  </P> <P>  "Landscape as Thought" remains through Oct. 11 at Cal State Fullerton's Main  Art Gallery. Hours are noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday  (closed Saturday). Admission is free. Information: (714) 773-2037.  </P> <P> </P></p>

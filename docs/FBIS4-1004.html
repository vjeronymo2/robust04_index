			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Louise Marsland] </F>   [Excerpts] A barrage of television cameras and press  photographers from the world's media will greet politicians as  they roll up in their limos through the stately marble-and-glass  entrance to Gallagher Estate on the day or night on which South  Africa's final election results will be made known. The  surrounding 14th ha [hectares] of the estate's landscaped  gardens, with Koi ponds, gazebos and secret pathways, will form  a magnificent backdrop to the historic event unfolding over the  next two weeks.    It is in these tranquil surroundings that Independent  Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler  will have to decide whether all was free and fair and when to  release the final election results. [passage omitted]    A state-of-the-art media centre is being constructed in a  hall as big as an aircraft hangar. About 800 special pay phones  will be installed, 150 of which will have modem facilities to  plug into laptop computers. There will also be about 160  televisions, computers, fax machines and printing facilities.  Fastfood outlets and bars set up on the estate will operate  almost 24 hours.    A video wall in the media centre and closed-circuit  television, linked to IEC offices, will keep everyone informed.  [passage omitted]    The media centre will be operational from Wednesday, when  the  IEC will begin press briefings at the estate. The commission  has been provided with offices between the media centre and the  main auditorium which will be used for press briefings.    Election days -- April 26, 27 and 28 -- will see hourly  briefings to keep the world's press up to date with events at  the 9,000 polling stations and around the country.    After voting closes at 7 pm on April 28, the all-night  vigils  will begin for the results. Counting starts at the about 800 to  1,000 counting stations across the country at 6 am on Friday  April 19.    Votes will be counted in batches of 3,000 and the  information  relayed to the IEC head office in Johannesburg via computer.  The IEC will then release the information to the SABC, which  will simultaneously relay it to the huge screens at Gallagher  Estate and to viewers at home. The provisional "score" for each  political party in both the national and regional elections,  will be updated constantly by computer.    By law, the IEC has between two and 10 days to take a  decision on the election and release a final result. It is  expected that the result will be released sooner rather than  later, so as not to increase the political tension expected over  the election.    Once the IEC has taken a decision on when to release the  results, guests and the media will be given about four hours'  notice to assemble in Gallagher's main ballroom and the  adjoining media centre.    About 1,000 guests will be invited to be present in the  ballroom where the IEC will announce whether the elections were  free and fair and how many votes each party achieved in the  national and regional elections. Each political party will be  allowed a certain number of guests and the rest will be VIPs and  foreign dignatories.    The SABC, as host broadcaster, is in charge of producing the  show. It is hoped that the "political stars" such as Nelson  Mandela and F.W. de Klerk will attend the IEC ceremony to accept  the election "prizes" and address a press conference. [passage  omitted]</p>

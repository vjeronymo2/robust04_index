			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ten THLPSSC members favored the proposed changes (5 members did not vote). One of the members favoring the changes said it would make more sense to retain the existing regulation which operators have adhered to for years. In similar manner, two commenters and one pipeline-related organization agreed with the proposal. One commenter and two pipeline-related organizations disagreed and suggested that references to a depth of 15 feet in the rule be eliminated. RSPA proposed changes to &sect;&sect;195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) so these sections would conform with Public Law 101&hyph;599 (section 1, 104 Stat. 3038 (1990)) which requires burial of pipe where the subsurface is under 15 feet of water as measured from mean low water. Therefore, &sect;&sect;195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) are adopted as proposed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.262&blank;Pumping equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.262(d) regulates the location of pumping equipment. The rule prohibits the installation of pumping equipment on property not under the operator's control. It also prohibits installation less than 50 feet from the pump station boundary. RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.262(d) to clarify that these two restraints on location apply conjunctively not alternatively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment supported it in concept, but 5 members recommended further editing of the rule for clarity. Although three of the five persons who commented on the proposal supported it as proposed, the other two commenters thought further clarifying changes were needed. In view of these comments and THLPSSC views, we have modified the final rule based on identical wording suggested by five THLPSSC members and one commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.304&blank;Testing of components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.304(b) excludes from hydrostatic testing under part 195 any component that is the only item being replaced or added to a pipeline system if the component or a prototype was tested at the factory. RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.304(b) to clarify that the excluded components do not include pipe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The THLPSSC fully supported the proposed amendment. Of the six comments from the public on the proposal, a pipeline-related association and two operators agreed with it, while three operators suggested changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator suggested that instead of amending &sect;195.304(b), we should revise the definition of ``component'' to exclude pipe. We did not adopt this suggestion because the revision would affect every rule in part 195 that uses the term ``component.'' Editing suggested by another operator was not adopted because it concerned matters not addressed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

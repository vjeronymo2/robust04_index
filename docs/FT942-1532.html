			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (12): Island's charm is under threat / A look at the impact that market liberalisation may have on Cheju The beautiful volcanic island province of Cheju provides a good example of the challenges that South Korea is confronting in opening its domestic market to foreign competition. Its half-million citizens are debating whether the benefits offered by wider international access will outweigh the disruptive changes caused by market liberalisation. Cheju, which lies 100 kilometres south of the Korean mainland, will be one of regions most affected by the relaxation of restrictions on agricultural imports under the recent Uruguay round of Gatt. The threatened decline of the agricultural industry, which has supported the island for centuries, is accelerating a shift toward international tourism as the province's new economic mainstay. This is also forcing a change in attitudes on the island, which has traditionally displayed a fierce independence to the outside world. Cheju's tragic history has been marked by frequent revolts against the central government in Seoul. Its farmers were mostly freeholders, rather than tenants as in the rest of Korea, which contributed to a resentment against the heavy hand of the central government. The rebellious nature of the island was reinforced by its role as a place of banishment for political exiles until the expiration of the Korean monarchy in 1910. The island suffered a mini-civil war in 1948-49, which was a harbinger of the Korean War of the 1950-53, when the Seoul government adopted a tough policy in reasserting its authority over the island following Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. An estimated 30,000 persons, about 12 per cent of the island's population at the time, were killed during the insurrection. The island's bloody history has created ambivalent attitudes toward the vast changes being imposed on Cheju from the outside. The most significant development will be the decline of agriculture, which still accounts for 36 per cent of the island's economy. Cheju's agricultural industry is largely based on tangerines, which are grown on small, inefficient and heavily state-subsidised farms on the southern half of the island. The full opening of the Korean market to tangerine imports by 2004 is likely to lead to a consolidation of local farms. The government, however, hopes to take advantage of the lower trade barriers promised by the Uruguay round to increase tangerine and other agricultural exports to Japan, which are expected to triple within the next five years to Dollars 100m. Cheju is seeking to create a sales network for agricultural products in Japan and establish direct shipping routes there for the quick delivery of produce. But these measures are only meant to preserve some of island's agricultural industry and will do little to sustain Cheju's economic growth. Instead, the government is concentrating on inter- national tourism as the key instrument to revive the island's fortunes. The natural beauty of the island is well-suited to attract visitors. Its landscape bears more similarities to Europe than to Asia, combining the volcanoes of Iceland with the moors of Ireland and the coast of northern Italy. The push for tourism began in the 1970s, when Cheju was developed as a honey- moon resort for Korean couples. It enjoyed a captive market since overseas travelling by Koreans was severely restricted by the government until the late 1980s. Tourism in the past few years has become the island's biggest industry, accounting for 40 per cent of the economy. But the recent easing of travel restrictions has meant that Korean newly-weds are now visiting Guam, Saipan and Hawaii instead. Cheju has switched its tourism strategy to attracting more foreign visitors, particularly from Japan and Taiwan. A total of Won7,390bn will be invested in Cheju by 2001 to build a series of resort complexes in an attempt to increase tourism by 50 per cent to 5.3m visitors annually. The emphasis will no longer be on mass tourism, but on attracting prosperous individual travellers. 'We would like to build more hotels, sports facilities, aquariums, amusement parks, yacht marinas and casinoes in the hope of making Cheju the Las Vegas of Asia,' says Mr Chi Youn-tai, president of the Korean National Tourism Corporation. The KNTC has already established one resort complex at Chungman Beach and will participate in the construction of two others. The Hanjin conglomerate, which owns the country's main carrier Korean Air, is also planning to build a resort facility. The government estimates that increased tourism by high-spending visitors will quintuple the size of the island's economy to Won7,800bn by 2001. But the islanders have expressed resentment at the development plans. 'Cheju people are very independent- minded and don't like to be interfered with by outsiders,' admits Mr Chi. 'These people sometimes feel that the outsiders are reaping all the advantages of the development and they are left with little.' But the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and its impact on the island's agricultural sector are changing people's attitudes. 'They now realise that they have a beautiful place for tourism, which will mean their survival. They are beginning to understand that tourism is very important,' Mr Chi explained. Public opposition to the building of a second golf course on Cheju, for example, is receding. But the threat remains that extensive development will spoil the island's con- siderable natural charm and destroy the appeal that first attracted visitors to Cheju.</p>

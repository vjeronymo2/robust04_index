			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Demand continues for dollar-denominated FRNs LAST Friday's US interest rate cut gave further impetus yesterday to the stream of dollar-denominated floating rate notes with minimum coupons - although there were also reports in some quarters that the appetite for such instruments was finally drying up. 'The quarter point cut is really boosting demand for this product,' commented one syndicate manager yesterday as both Credit Fonciere and the Swedish National Housing Finance Corporation (SBAB) issued FRNs with minimum and maximum coupons. SBAB, a double-A credit, sought Dollars 100m with a minimum coupon of 5.25 per cent - two percentage points above current market rates. However, even at that level, members of the syndicate reported some difficulty in selling paper. This was put down in part to the fact that SBAB is a less well-known name than some others that have come to the retail-oriented FRN market in recent weeks. However, some said it was a sign that investor interest in FRNs was weakening. 'This market is hit and miss to some extent - you identify a pocket of interest, and then everyone tries to rush into it,' one observer said. Credit Fonciere, meanwhile, returned to the market to raise Dollars 200m with a minimum coupon of 5 per cent and maximum of 10 per cent. The deal, priced at 100.10, was reported to have sold reasonably well, although the long payment date was said to have dented some of the potential demand. In the third deal of the day, Deutsche Bank returned to reopen a Canadian dollar issue for the third time, taking the total amount issued up to CDollars 275m from CDollars 225m. Amid the flow of FRNs, the large fixed-rate dollar deal from LKB Baden-Wurtt-emberg, the German regional bank, due this week, will come as something of a novelty to the market. 'The market hasn't had a lot of fixed rate paper - if it's priced well, it should go all right,' one observer commented.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / MoD agrees to frigate extension THE Ministry of Defence has agreed a further fortnight's extension of work on the three Type 23 frigates being fitted out by Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder's receivers said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The extension, which runs until July 9, is the fourth since Swan Hunter went into receivership in mid-May after failing to win a crucial helicopter carrier order. Completing the frigates would give the company work until late next year and improve its chances of winning new orders and finding a buyer as a going concern. Price Waterhouse, the firm acting as receivers, said yesterday that it was 'very optimistic' that a long-term agreement would be reached with the MoD. The firm said it would be achieved during the coming fortnight. The complexity of the agreement, caused by Swan Hunter's receivership, is understood to have caused the delay. Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, met receiver Mr Ed James yesterday together with Swan Hunter shop stewards. Mr Brennan said the unions were bitterly disappointed that a final agreement to let the frigates be finished on the Tyne had still not been achieved with the MoD. He said: 'Rosyth has been given work for over a decade, yet they're making such heavy weather of giving an agreement for 12 months' work. 'It's totally astonishing that different rules apply in different places.' The latest agreement means that the shipbuilder's remaining 1,800 employees, in spite of having work for the next fortnight, continue to face morale-damaging uncertainty.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Israel reinforces troops in occupied Arab lands Israel has reinforced troops in occupied Arab lands to stem a rise in violence, but security sources said yesterday they doubted the move would help, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. 'There has been an increase in troop strength but it's nonsense,' an Israeli security source said. 'You know and I know that more troops don't prevent these kind of attacks.' On Wednesday, an Arab stabbed a soldier to death in the occupied Gaza Strip, bringing the death toll since the signing in September of the Israel-PLO peace deal to 12 Israelis and 20 Palestinians.</p>

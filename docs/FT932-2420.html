			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: New Daf truck companies see profitability this year BOTH the Dutch and UK truck-making companies formed out of DAF, which went into receivership earlier this year, yesterday asserted that they would be profitable this year with a combined production of 12,000-12,500 vehicles. Daf Trucks NV, formed on March 2 with Pounds 370m (Dollars 555m) in equity and loan backing from the Dutch and Flemish regional governments, banks and institutional investors, expected to capture around 7 per cent of the west European truck market, said Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the new Dutch-based company. Mr Baan, who acknowledged that 'some very hard lessons' had been learnt from the problems of the old Daf group, said his company faced a viable future as a producer of around 10,000 heavy trucks annually. He expected an annual turnover of some Pounds 740m a year, once normal trading had been re-established. This year it expected to sell 7,500-8,000 trucks, although about 1,000 of these would be from existing stocks. These output and sales projections are less than half the peaks achieved by Daf in the late 1980s. However, it now has only half its previous Dutch and Belgian workforce of 6,500. The projections exclude production from Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the new name for the former Leyland Daf truck-making subsidiary. The UK company was bought from the UK receivers last week by a management team led by chief executive Mr John Gilchrist. Mr Gilchrist, who refused yesterday to disclose either the price paid for the company or the structure of its shareholdings, said the new Leyland company expected to produce 5,500 trucks this year, rising to 8,000 a year in 1995. Most of these are expected to be the medium-weight 45 Series truck, of which up to 6,000 a year were being sold through Daf dealers on mainland Europe prior to the receiverships. Following last week's management buy-out, the Dutch and British companies said yesterday they had signed a long-term contract under which the Leyland-built trucks would continue to be sold through 'new' Daf's continental outlets. Mr Baan acknowledged that Daf had lost an undisclosed number of mainland dealers. However, he insisted that Daf had not been badly hit, and in any case needed fewer dealers because vans had been deleted from its product line-up. 'Only a minority have stepped over to other makes, especially Iveco and Renault,' Mr Baan said. The UK dealer network has fallen by only seven outlets - to 118 from 125 - despite 'transfer fees' being offered by rival manufacturers, according to Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf Trucks, the company which will control the UK sales and marketing of both manufacturers. This company was acquired by the Dutch group last week, and will market and sell both the Leyland and mainland-built trucks through the UK dealer network. The steep fall in UK truck demand in 1990 was held largely responsible for the collapse of the old Daf group, as the UK had been accounting for 40 per cent of all sales. Mr Gill forecast yesterday that the market would grow this year by between 5 per cent and 9 per cent from last year's 31,400 trucks. He said Leyland Daf's share would recover from its current 18 per cent level to nearer the more than 23 per cent it held last year.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / US NBER says recession ended in March 1991 The US National Bureau of Economic Research yesterday declared the recession ended in March 1991, eight months after it began in July 1990, Michael Prowse reports. It delayed its decision until yesterday's figures from the Commerce Department confirmed that the economy had surpassed its pre-recession peak. The figures showed real gross domestic product growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter compared with a previous estimate of 3.9 per cent.</p>

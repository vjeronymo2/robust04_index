			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3,000-ACRE BLAZE BATTLED ALONG THE ORTEGA HIGHWAY  </P> <P> Hundreds of firefighters, hampered by steep terrain and darkness, struggled  Tuesday night to halt the summer's first major brush fire, a 3,000-acre blaze  that raced through the Cleveland National Forest east of San Juan Capistrano  and threatened more than 100 homes.  </P> <P> The fire roared unchecked on both sides of Ortega Highway, the primary link  between south Orange County and Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The highway  was shut down shortly after the fire erupted about 4 p.m. near the Upper San  Juan campground, about 15 miles east of Interstate 5. What sparked the fire is  unknown, officials said.  </P> <P> By dusk, nearly 600 firefighters from half a dozen departments were battling  the blaze as it moved north and east. At least seven remote campgrounds and  clusters of homes tucked into the isolated canyons and mountain valleys were  threatened by the advancing flames.  </P> <P> "It's steep and rocky and there's an abundance of fuel," said California  Department of Forestry spokesman Bill Bruggema, referring to the dense  chaparral. "There's no expectation of containment. The fire is moving at a  pretty good clip. . . . No telling how big this might get."  </P> <P> Before darkness fell, firefighters were assisted by chemical and water drops  from nine airplanes and four helicopters. But the aerial assault failed to slow  the blaze, which forced officials to evacuate residents in El Cariso Village,  the Ortega campground, Morrell Canyon and those living along Long Canyon Road.  The fire also threatened the Convail Nudist Camp and moved within half a mile  of Los Pinos Rural Job Corps Center, a center for juvenile inmates, but the  camp was not evacuated.  </P> <P> Any chance of quickly encircling the blaze was foiled when it split into three  "heads" and fanned out in two directions on both sides of the Orange-Riverside  county line, Bruggema said. Mild temperatures and light winds seemed to favor  firefighters, but three years of below-average rainfall have created "tinder  dry" conditions in the area.  </P> <P> "It is extremely dry," said Bob Paul, another forestry spokesman, who added  that the vegetation in the area is 25 to 30 years old, and rainfall last year  was less than 50% of normal.  </P> <P> "You get those fires in those canyons, and they will create their own wind."  </P> <P> American Red Cross personnel had readied an evacuation center at Lake Elsinore  High School, but it was never opened because no one showed up in need of  assistance. Late Tuesday night, no homes had been lost and no one had been  reported injured.  </P> <P> Within minutes of the bulletins about the blaze, the California Highway Patrol  closed Ortega Highway, creating a rush-hour nightmare for commuters who travel  the 34-mile road between Orange County's job centers and a string of bedroom  communities around Lake Elsinore. A command post was set up at Caspers  Wilderness Park, and only those who lived in the fire area where allowed beyond  that point. The highway was officially closed all the way to Grand Avenue in  Lake Elsinore.  </P> <P> Many of the commuters were forced to turn around and either go south to San  Diego County or north to Santa Ana Canyon and then east to eventually reach the  Elsinore area.  </P> <P> "A lot of people were awfully mad," one CHP dispatcher said. "For some people,  it probably meant an extra two hours on the road."  </P> <P> Bill Winston, a restaurant manager in San Juan Capistrano who lives in the  Riverside County community of Corona, was one of the Ortega commuters forced to  take the long way home.  </P> <P> "Taking Ortega over the mountains saves me anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes on my  drive," said Winston as he was leaving work for the drive home. "Now, I've got  to go up the (Interstate) 5 into Orange County. That's a frightening concept."  </P> <P> Initially, the CHP said Ortega would be closed until midnight, but by nightfall  officials said the road would not reopen until this morning at the earliest.  </P> <P> Firefighters on the lines came from Orange and Riverside counties, as well as  the California Department of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service. At least  eight bulldozers were on the scene to clear fire breaks and trails along slopes  and ridgelines. Another 40 fire engines joined the battle.  </P> <P> Many of the homes in the area threatened by the fire were described as  "luxurious." Dave Struthers, manager of maintenance and operations for the Lake  Elsinore Unified School District, said many of those living in what he called  the "summit area" along the Ortega Highway had moved there seeking privacy. The  area is roughly 1,800 to 2,500 feet above sea level, with dense growth.  </P> <P> "People moved there because they wanted some land and space," Struthers said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ted Johnson contributed to this report.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY:  </P> <P> Part II, Page 1  </P></p>

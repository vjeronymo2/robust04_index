			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Books: The old spy kept his cloak on to the last - War and Peace (Fact and fiction) / Paul Greengrass on the trail of Kim Philby THE PHILBY FILES by Genrikh Borovic Little Brown Pounds 18.99, 382 pages I always hoped I would meet Kim Philby. Like most aspiring young hacks in the early 1980s I believed in secret histories. I dreamt of the phone call in some lonely Stalin era hotel, the midnight rendezvous on a Moscow street corner, and the familiar figure flanked by faceless KGB hoods stepping forward, shaking hands and telling me in his famous nervous stutter that he had decided, at last, to tell the whole truth . . . I even wrote to him in 1984, cheekily, care of the KGB, Dzerzhinsky Square, and asked for an interview. I never got a reply. Instead I took a flight to the other side of the world and met another old survivor from the 1930s with a drink problem, Peter Wright, who told me a different story on the same theme. He told me how he spent his life chasing Philby and his ilk, looking for the spoor that had metastasized throughout the Establishment until in the end it drove him nearly mad. Later, after Spycatcher was published, I visited Peter Wright once again in Tasmania. He went to his bookshelves and pulled out a thick, dusty red volume and gave it to me. It was A History of Labour by Gilbert Stone, sometime secretary to the Coal Industry Commission and deputy head of production at the coal mines department. I turned to the flyleaf and there in an instantly recognisable fine hand was the inscription: 'H R Philby. Trinity'. Wright explained that Philby had given the volume to Anthony Blunt at their last meeting in Beirut in 1963, just before he defected to Moscow. And Blunt had in turn given the book to Wright at their last meeting in 1972, at the conclusion of his M15 de-briefing. And now Wright wanted me to have it, perhaps realising that this too would be the last time we would meet. He told me Blunt had been given the book by Philby as a reminder of the philosophy that had guided them all those long years undercover. The book was full of cant about the masses, and their guiding scientific principles - a kind of sub-Marxian James Michener novel without any characters. Maybe I had had more than my bellyful of Philby, Burgess and Maclean. Or maybe I was too much an opportunist to be guided by any principles, scientific, political or otherwise. But somewhere over east Asia I realised what any women could have told me - and had - that none of this spying business mattered any more. I knew then I would never get that interview with Philby. Shortly afterwards the old rogue died and the Berlin Wall came down. Spy books have never been the same since. There have been good ones of course, even important ones, and, as ever, trashy ones by the publisher's list. But they have never sold as well. Somehow the heat has gone out of the subject. But now we have, at long last, the scoop all spy hacks, myself included, wanted all those years: Philby's last will and testament, a series of interviews conducted by Genrikh Borovic at the old spy's comfortably appointed dacha in the three years before his death. Borovic, a respected and independent minded Russian journalist of the old school, amassed 500 pages of transcripts of his conversations with Philby and has interwoven them with excerpts from Philby's KGB file and novelistic recreations of key incidents in his career. It makes for an interesting, if somewhat uneven, read, shot through with reminiscence and regret. But for all the claims ex-Insight journalist Philip Knightley (himself the only Western journalist to pass Philby's door) makes in his introduction, it is not a book to match with the classics of the genre: his own Philby - The Spy who Betrayed a Generation, or Philby's My Silent War, with its ironic, mocking detachment, or the broad sympathetic canvas of Andrew Boyle's Climate of Treason. These were books that changed the way we looked at spies and spying, and made their activities seem contemporary and relevant. Here we cover familiar ground, with only occasional flashes of revelation to catch our interest. The book is dense with detail, especially from the files, of the early years. An idealistic Philby emerges - refusing money, diligent, eager to create a career in espionage. There are moments of fascinating detail - young Philby spying on his domineering father, the noted Arabist adventurer St John Philby, against whom Kim struggled all his life in a painful love-hate relationship. But in the end Philby was never a man for self-analysis, or the psychiatrist's chair. And so Borovic, even after hundreds of hours of conversation, is left with the same enigma faced by previous authors. The man remains as elusive as he was that rain-swept night he took his one-way ticket to Moscow. Graham Greene is, not surprisingly, the only writer to have penetrated the shield, describing him once memorably as having the chilling certainty of a Catholic who, in the reign of Elizabeth, works for the victory of Spain and then endures the long days of Inquisition, believing implacably that although today brings Torquemada, tomorrow there will be a John XXIII. The principal interest here for spy buffs is the extent to which Philby, it now emerges, was mistrusted by the KGB during the war. This is genuinely new information - and hilarious too. Moscow became so alarmed at the sight of Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Blunt et al handing over suitcases of secret documents to their KGB controller in London that they concluded the whole operation was a fiendish British intelligence ploy and even recommended cutting off contact with the most successful spy ring in history. But the KGB files - fascinating though they are - diminish and disappear once Borovic's narrative reaches 1945. Thus the latter half of the book is less successful. Philby's account of the defection of Burgess and Maclean is partial. Borovic leans towards concluding that the whole affair was a colossal KGB cock-up, but shrinks from the fundamental conclusion that, in the end, protecting Maclean, who had handed over the Holy Grail of post war espionage - the secrets of the nuclear bomb - was always more important to the Soviets than protecting Philby. Perhaps that was why, when he finally got to Moscow, he stole Maclean's wife. Similarly, the account of Philby's career after his dismissal from MI6 in 1951 is also thin. Borovic tries to drum up interest in his Beirut interlude, and waxes lyrical about his homecoming to Moscow. But the truth is his work as an active spy ended long before his defection in 1963 and the last 25 years of his life were spent in alternate periods of drunken depression and a pleasurably idle existence as a KGB museum piece, making speeches and cultivating the mythology that had grown up around his name. But these are quibbles. I take my hat off to Borovic and Knightley. They succeeded where the rest of us failed. They got to meet the old fraud himself, shake his hand, hear his stutter. And I will put their book up on the shelf next to Philby's own Gilbert Stone - that is the Gilbert Stone who did not rise to become the greatest spy the world has ever seen, but got to be a minor functionary with the Coal Board instead. In his book Stone wrote 'I am no believer in a suddenly achieved Utopia; I see little in history that suggests that short cuts are the best roads to travel by; I see little gain in sharp upheavals. In the future, as in the past, it will be character and worth which will secure us sound advantages.' Maybe Kim the Cambridge undergraduate skipped that passage. Or maybe he was just busy meeting his controller for the first time.</p>

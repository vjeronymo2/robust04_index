			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROJECTED RAIL COSTS EXCEED FUNDS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: A COUNTY REPORT SAYS EVEN A SHORT LINE WOULD COST ALMOST TWICE  WHAT TRANSIT PLANNERS WILL HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT DECADE.  </P> <P> A long-awaited report on San Fernando Valley rail-route options released  Wednesday suggests that there would be enough riders to support the proposed  east-west line, but that even a shortened version of the line would cost almost  twice what transit planners will have available in the coming decade.  </P> <P> The steeper-than-expected cost estimates -- ranging from $500 million for a  bare-bones surface system that would run only from North Hollywood to the  Sepulveda Basin, to $3.5 billion for a cross-Valley subway -- led some county  transportation planners to predict that the proposed line will not be built  until well past the turn of the century, if ever.  </P> <P> On the other hand, leading proponents insisted that money could be found,  although they conceded that construction might not occur as soon as they had  hoped.  </P> <P> The $2.1-million environmental impact report was commissioned by the Los  Angeles County Transportation Commission, which plans to use it as a basis for  picking a Valley mass transit route to connect with the Metro Rail subway  between downtown and North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The commission, which is building a county-wide rail network using the extra  half-cent sales tax that voters authorized in 1980, is scheduled to pick a  Valley route in March.  </P> <P> Although the report studied 10 options along two routes, attention is expected  to center on a plan that would extend Metro Rail partly underground to the  Sepulveda Basin, where travelers bound for the West Valley would switch to  buses.  </P> <P> That plan -- which was offered several months ago as a compromise to draw  together warring factions and which has attracted widespread support -- would  cost $1.3 billion and would draw 49,000 riders daily by the year 2010, the  report said. Earlier predictions had been for 30,000 to 50,000 daily riders on  a longer cross-Valley line.  </P> <P> County rail planners say no more than $600 million to $800 million will be  available for a Valley line over the next decade.  </P> <P> This did not discourage state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who along with Los  Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude co-authored the compromise plan.  </P> <P> "I'm very encouraged," Robbins said. "I'm convinced that we will find the money  somewhere," he said, predicting funds will become available from another  increase in the sales tax or bond issues.  </P> <P> But Christine Reed, chairwoman of the County Transportation Commission, said  that if Valley leaders "continue to insist on subway, it's clear from this  report that nothing will be built for a long time, maybe 15 years."  </P> <P> Commissioners also are to choose between light-rail technology and Metro Rail  equipment, which has a higher capacity and is slightly more expensive. In  addition, the commission is scheduled to determine whether the system should be  at ground level, elevated or in a costly tunnel -- a key question that for  years has sharply divided homeowner leaders from business interests.  </P> <P> Homeowners say a ground-level or aerial line will ruin their neighborhoods with  noise and ground vibrations, while business leaders insist that a subway is too  expensive for the Valley.  </P> <P> The report appeared to buttress both sides.  </P> <P> Along the 15-mile Southern Pacific rail right of way that follows Chandler and  Victory boulevards across the Valley to Warner Center, a ground-level system  would cost $1 billion, while the same line as a subway would cost $2.9 billion,  the report said.  </P> <P> The least expensive option, at $500 million, would be a ground-level system on  this route from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> Along the Ventura Freeway, the report considered only aerial and subway  configurations, finding that trains could not be operated at ground level along  the freeway except for a short span in the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> Depending on how much of the freeway line is underground, the cost would be  between $2.2 billion and $3.5 billion, the report said.  </P> <P> Along the Chandler-Victory route, a ground-level system would disturb 38 homes  with noise and have a visual impact on 30 houses, while a subway would not  disturb any houses, the report said.  </P> <P> The report said a freeway line would displace up to 500 houses, as many as 133  businesses and up to 43 acres of parkland, while the Chandler-Victory route  would require condemnation of as many as 113 businesses and the loss of up to  29 acres of park but would not take any houses.  </P> <P> Reed, noting that 499 houses would be condemned for a freeway rail line, said:  "I don't think any elected official in his right mind would pick a route that  requires taking 500 houses, so the freeway route looks like it won't go."  </P> <P> Actually, the freeway route has never had many supporters and, in addition,  homeowners along the freeway are well-organized and vehemently opposed.  </P> <P> The Chandler-Victory route, though long favored by rail planners because the  right of way is available, was strongly opposed by most homeowner groups until  Robbins and Braude devised their North Hollywood-to-Sepulveda Basin plan.  </P> <P> Under the Robbins-Braude compromise, businesses gave up their goal of an  immediate rail link to fast-growing Warner Center while homeowner leaders  agreed to accept the dust and noise that would accompany tunneling through  single-family neighborhoods in North Hollywood and Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Encino homeowner leader Gerald A. Silver, who represents a dwindling group of  activists opposed to any rail plan, said the report released Wednesday shows  that "rail in the Valley would be a boondoggle" and would have a "horribly  devastating effect on the complexion and habitability of the Valley."  </P> <P> He predicted that ridership projections would not be met and that "cost  overruns would exceed our worst nightmares."

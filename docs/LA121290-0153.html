			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AT&amp;T AND MCI SETTLE THEFT, FALSE AD SUITS;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: THE TWO FIRMS ARE LOCKED IN A WAR FOR CUSTOMERS. THEY WANT THE  FCC TO SET UP GUIDELINES ON SWITCHING PHONE USERS.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp. said today  they had reached an out-of-court settlement on lawsuits and countersuits that  had alleged theft of customers and false advertising.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, the two companies agreed to propose adoption by the  Federal Communications Commission of industrywide standards to protect  consumers from being switched to other long-distance companies against their  will.  </P> <P> The proposed standards would permit long-distance carriers to switch a  customer's service only by one of the following means:  </P> <P> * A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to which the  customer is switching.  </P> <P> * Independent third-party confirmation.  </P> <P> * Signed letter of authorization.  </P> <P> * A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance telephone  company.  </P> <P> The two companies, along with US Sprint, have been locked in a fierce battle  for customers. AT&amp;T and MCI, or their agents, have been placing calls to  millions of phone users each month trying to get them to switch their  long-distance service.  </P> <P> State and federal authorities and local phone companies have received tens of  thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching.  </P> <P> Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T's share of the  long-distance market has eroded to below 70%. MCI, the nation's second-largest  long-distance carrier, now has about 15% of the market.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T, which had claimed that it was losing customers because of  unauthorized switching by MCI and its telemarketing agent, had asked the FCC to  require a customer's written authorization before a change could be made.  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark firm despite Emu vote CONTRARY to the market's expectations, the D-Mark remained firm against most European currencies yesterday as the Irish people issued a resounding 'Yes' in their referendum on European union, writes James Blitz. Ever since the Danes rejected European union in their referendum earlier this month, the German currency has made headway on fears that the Maastricht treaty would dissolve. Analysts had expected that the D-Mark would give up some of those gains if Ireland calmed nerves by supporting the treaty. But the early indications yesterday were otherwise. Sterling closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.9200; the Spanish peseta was only marginally stronger against the German currency at Pta62.81 from a previous close of Pta62.98; the Italian lira, which badly needed a boost after a week of solid intervention by the Bank of Italy on its behalf, made up only a little of the ground it has lost. It closed at 756.8 to the D-Mark from a previous close of 758.6. The question on many lips last night was: where does Europe go from here? The next headline event is the French referendum on Maastricht, due to take place in September. Until then, traders will ponder three possible outcomes: that Maastricht collapses, that eleven of the twelve EC states go ahead with Emu or that there will be a two-speed Europe in which some states unite their currencies and others do not. In any event, Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, is a D-Mark bull: 'You will have a background in which the German currency remains stable and nothing will change that over the next week or so.' Trading in the US dollar remained sluggish yesterday. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey was disappointing, showing a slower growth rate in manufacturing in June. The currency was also unable to keep any of its gains against the D-Mark, even though the Irish vote unwound a few long D-Mark positions. "Dollar sentiment is so sour that people automatically look to sell every rally," said a US bank trader. "And they're waiting less and less time before taking the profits as well.' The US currency ended marginally up, but still at the bottom of its ranges for the week, at DM1.5700 from a previous close of DM1.5650. The Japanese yen slipped fractionally against the D-Mark, still injured by the fall in the Japanese stock market the previous day. The 225-share Nikkei average showed signs of consolidating around the 16,000 level yesterday, but the D-Mark was still up at Y80.82 from a previous close of Y80.99. A big test of the yen's strength comes next week, when the latest Japanese money supply figures are due.</p>

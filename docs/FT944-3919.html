			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Finance Week BUSINESS Chancellor Kenneth Clarke turned to smokers, motorists and drinkers in a mini-Budget designed to plug the gap in the government's finances caused by the Commons' rejection of a further increase in VAT on domestic fuel. The government moved swiftly to hold the confidence of financial markets in the wake of its VAT defeat by pushing up interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25 per cent. Less than an hour after Clarke stood up to deliver his mini-Budget, Northern Rock became the first mortgage lender to announce a rise in its home loan rate. Companies could be forced to secure shareholder approval for executive salary awards under proposals to be considered by a cabinet committee next week. The Queen is to allow oil exploration in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Experts believe there could be up to 100m barrels, worth about Pounds 1bn, 300m below the castle. Fifty dissatisfied customers started court proceedings against Hoover, the electrical group, over the company's free flights offer. Demand for credit among UK consumers eased slightly in October although it continued to run at a high level.

COMPANIES SG Warburg, the largest UK investment bank, announced that it intended to give up its independence by merging with the US investment bank Morgan Stanley in an effort to create a stronger global bank. The news set alight trading in the merchant bank sector. Mercury Communications, British Telecommunications' largest competitor in the UK, will cut 2,500 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce, over the next 12 months and withdraw loss-making services - including its public payphones - in an attempt to return to profits. The Anglo-French company GEC Alsthom has beaten the Swedish/Swiss-owned ABB Transportation to win an Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m order for new trains on the London Underground. Morgan Grenfell Investment Management was fined Pounds 180,000 by Imro, the fund management self-regulatory body, in connection with losses from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. Brisk profits growth at Holiday Inn, the global hotel chain, allowed Bass to report a 9 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits despite a further fall in beer profits and sluggish performances from pubs and leisure. Graeme Bowler, chief executive of grocery discounter Kwik Save since July 1993, was paid a total of Pounds 586,000 in his first year - 72 per cent more than his predecessor, Graeme Seabrook, received in his final nine months with the company. Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, property and financial services group, is to hand Pounds 300m of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile back to shareholders in the form of a 30p a share special dividend. But with the special dividend payable only to those holding shares on Thursday, and lower than expected profits, GUS shares fell 35p to 496p. The acquisition of Scandinavian Leisure Group last April helped Airtours to boost profits by 66 per cent and sales by almost the same amount. A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain helped Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the beer and leisure group, report a 28 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 114m to Pounds 145m. Racal Electronics' share price fell 6 per cent on Thursday after the company revealed it would fall short of its stated target for profits from its data communications division this year. The administrators to Polly Peck International, part of the collapsed business empire of fugitive businessman Asil Nadir, announced a breakthrough in settling the claims of creditors. An interim payment is likely to be made to up to 1,500 creditors by early summer. Shares in NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, fell on Tuesday after it revealed a fall in full-year operating profits because of losses in European logistics and a declining contribution from removal services.

The decision surprised the City, which was confident both bids would be cleared, and VSEL's share price fell sharply. MARKETS The UK equity market on Wednesday successfully rode out what, potentially, was one of the most turbulent trading sessions in recent months. This was in spite of the serious defeat of the government over VAT in the House of Commons the night before, a rise of  1/2 percentage point in domestic interest rates, a Pounds 2bn gilts auction, and a warning of possible further US interest rate increases in the short term. Hong Kong closed at a 14-month low on Thursday as the spectre of rising US interest rates continued to undermine sentiment. Gilts were whipped around by political worries but they rallied sharply on the Bank of England's unexpectedly early announcement that it was raising its minimum lending rate. They were bolstered further by encouraging comments on inflation from Bank governor Eddie George. Oil prices weakened further on Monday as unseasonably warm weather persisted in many parts of Europe and the US. They recovered slightly later in the week. US share prices fell sharply late on Thursday afternoon amid renewed interest rate fears and uncertainty about what fall-out there would be from Orange County, California, filing for municipal bankruptcy. South Africa's first international bond offering since the end of apartheid, a Dollars 500m (Pounds 304.8m) issue, was over-subscribed. The issue was increased to Dollars 750m.</p>

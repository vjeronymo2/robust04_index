			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Digital slides back into the red DIGITAL Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, slipped back into the red in the first quarter of 1994 but cut its losses compared with the same period last year. The results were poorer than analysts had anticipated and the shares closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 1/8 in New York. Digital suffered a net loss of Dollars 83.18m, or 62 cents a share, for the quarter ended October 2, against Dollars 260.55m, or Dollars 2.04, a year ago. The loss included a one-time benefit of Dollars 20m, or 14 cents, relating to a change in accounting principles for taxes. The loss before tax was reduced to Dollars 99.7m, compared with Dollars 250.5m last year, which Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive, attributed to a focus on cost controls. Research and engineering spending has been cut by Dollars 90m or 22 per cent and selling, general and administrative costs fell by Dollars 259m or 23 per cent, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating revenues were Dollars 3.01bn, 9 per cent below the Dollars 3.3bn recorded last year. Mr Palmer said: 'We were disappointed by the revenue declines from last year.' He attributed much of the fall to weak markets in Europe, especially Germany and Italy. There was a slight decline in the US, but growth in Asia was not enough to compensate for the falls in other areas. Digital's latest loss comes immediately after its first quarterly profit in two years and follows a campaign to convince customers the company is committed to becoming a leader in 'client-server' systems. These are networks of small computers, which are rapidly replacing the minicomputers that have been Digital's main products. Revenues and profit margins are suffering with the move to cheaper products. Mr William Steul, chief financial officer, said Digital achieved double-digit growth in both dollars and units in personal computers and workstations, but product gross margins declined five points from last year.</p>

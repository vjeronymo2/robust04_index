			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AWAKENING MACARTHUR PARK'S 'SLEEPING BEAUTY'  </P> <P> Something is afoot in MacArthur Park this lazy August afternoon -- and it's got  nothing to do with drugs or gangs.  </P> <P> "One . . . two," a doe-eyed young woman commands from the band-shell stage, as  a retinue of aspiring ballerinas in tutus jete to boom-box Tchaikovsky.  </P> <P> Three boys skid their bikes to a standstill, leaning forward on the handlebars  to watch. Nearby, rows of wooden benches fill with sundry onlookers. A homeless  man perched on a nearby hill is transfixed; the businessmen at the picnic table  stop talking to eye the action.  </P> <P> Putting the women through their paces is Helena Ross, veteran of international  ballet competitions and best known to local balletomanes for her guest  appearances with the Long Beach Ballet.  </P> <P> Her dancers are preparing an excerpt from "Sleeping Beauty" to be performed on  Saturday as part of festivities designed as a show of strength by those who  want to reclaim MacArthur Park for the community.  </P> <P> Local girls and boys who are taking these free classes with Ross will  participate in the parades and performance; a few of the boys will portray the  evil Carabosse and his cohorts in the "Sleeping Beauty" selection.  </P> <P> Sponsored by a coalition of community groups known as L.A. C.R.U.S.A.D.E.R.S.,  the parades will begin around 10:30 a.m. at Belmont High School and St. Basil's  Catholic Church and converge upon the MacArthur Park band shell around  lunchtime for the dances and other presentations.  </P> <P> This event will be the second outing for Ross' Southern California Ballet of  the Sun, a descendant of legendary Ballet Russe "baby ballerina" Tatiana  Riabouchinska-Lichine's defunct Southern California companies. The group brings  together professional dancers and inner-city youths.  </P> <P> The first production of Ross' company was a fuller version of "Sleeping Beauty"  at El Centro Wilshire Family Center in June, 1988.  </P> <P> What's a nice classical dancer like Ross doing in an inner-city park like this  -- working for free, no less?  </P> <P> Giving something back to the community, as she sees it. Ross, who first took  lessons at 4 in Shatto Park, studied on scholarship at the Lichine Ballet  Academy and taught on the Westside before circling back to this part of town,  where she once again lives.  </P> <P> "I stumbled upon teaching in the inner city," Ross says, recalling her  experience with former El Centro Wishire director Carmelo Alvarez.  </P> <P> "They were working on a little performance (at El Centro)," she says. "I guess  I was too young and naive, but I said, 'Don't give up.' We had a crash course  in 'Nutcracker' and the boys did their break-dancing. We did so much with those  kids in two weeks."  </P> <P> It is, as she'll tell you, a far cry from the usual barre scene. "In Beverly  Hills there was much more of a sense that I was baby-sitting," Ross says. "Here  the family comes with the girls. They value the classes a lot more."  </P> <P> "The community people are so pleased to see it happening," says Maria Ross,  Helena's mother and company administrator. "There is nothing that would prevent  these children from being as good as products of the Bolshoi or the Royal  Ballet -- except funding."  </P> <P> "The teachers are here, but somebody has to care."  </P> <P> Alma Martinez, who sits beaming as her daughter runs and leaps on stage with a  line of little girls, agrees. She calls Helena Ross a "special" teacher, adding  that she hopes the classes will continue.  </P> <P> So far Ross, who says she was a little nervous when she first brought her  dancers to the band shell, hasn't had any problems in this unusual setting.  </P> <P> "Even the so-called hoodlums appreciate culture," she says. "We joke about it,  but there is a common bond. When we're up on that stage, they treat us  differently, with so much respect."  </P> <P> The only thing holding them back, Maria Ross says, is the lack of financing.  "We got a grant from cultural affairs to do the show on the 19th, but that's  it," she says.  </P> <P> "Why aren't they putting money into recreational or cultural programming for  the kids in the most densely populated part of the city?" she asks. "All there  is is a senior program.  </P> <P> "Some of those gang members are fantastic soccer players and dancers and they  sure as heck weren't getting into trouble when they were out there playing,"  she says, arguing that Los Angeles "might have less trouble with gangs later  on" if such alternatives were supported.  </P> <P> Helena Ross thinks so too: "The kids whose lives are shaken up need a program  that won't be here one month and gone the next."  </P> <P> "We should have a training system like they have at the Kirov, where you don't  have to be rich to be talented. There's so much talent that's going to waste  here," she says.  </P> <P> "I understand the odds these kids have against them. But if there's one thing  that L.A. could contribute, it'd be having a company where the faces you see on  the stage aren't all the same, aren't all WASPs. That to me is beauty."  </P></p>

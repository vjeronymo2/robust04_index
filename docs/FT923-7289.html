			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Management (Training on Trial): Divisions over uniting councils Training and Enterprise Councils will consider a broad range of options over the next few weeks on how to co-ordinate their operations on a national basis. A shortlist of options prepared by Sir Christopher Ball, an academic, has been presented to G10, the group of Tec chairmen who liase with the government, and they will put proposals to Tecs this week. The issue needs to be urgently resolved but because of the diversity of opinion it is likely to provoke divisions between the 82 Tecs in England and Wales. Indeed, discussion over a new intermediary body turned into a stormy debate at the recent national Tec conference. Advocates of a strong intermediary body, on the lines of Scottish Enterprise, claim it would give them more clout with government and greater operating freedom. The issue has risen to the top of Tecs' agendas because: The National Training Task Force, a committee made up of leading businessmen such as Sir Bryan Woolfson, chairman of Wembley Stadium, comes to the end of its remit this year. While its main role has been to advise government on setting up Tecs, it has taken on a number of other central responsibilities such as getting the Investors in People Initiative (IIP) off the ground. There is concern about G10, which is being asked to take on a greater workload and is becoming over-stretched. Agendas for meetings at national level have often contained too many topics with too little time for each. The new national training targets, drawn up by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and endorsed by many other organisations including the government, need to be monitored nationally and examples of best practice publicised. The performance of Tecs vary, and because they have been fiercely independent, there is a need for them to share best practice.</p>

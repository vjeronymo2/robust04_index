			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / More letters after their name CHARTERED accountants may soon have yet more letters after their names - after the existing 'ACA' or 'FCA' - to reflect their specialist skills, under proposals discussed yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. The council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales approved circulation of a document to its members suggesting additional qualifications to reflect members' expertise. The post-qualification working party, part of the education and training directorate, recommended the introduction of a framework of flexible qualifications, which would include areas such as taxation, financial management and information technology. It said the voluntary framework should be built on existing chartered accountancy qualifications and be designed to appeal to accountants in both professional firms and businesses. It should be controlled by formally approved institute accreditation. Mr David Clark, a council member, said professional recognition of specialisms was very important for accountants competing with consultants in other fields such as information technology.</p>

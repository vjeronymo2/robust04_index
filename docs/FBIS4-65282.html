			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party of Germany leader </F> Rudolf Scharping by Ulrich Rosenbaum; place and date not given:  "Scharping Sees an Opportunity for the SPD"]    [Text] [Rosenbaum] Eleven months ago, the SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] rank and file elected you SPD  leader. What has changed for you since then?    [Scharping] Personally? I work harder and have less free  time.    [Rosenbaum] And what has changed for the SPD?    [Scharping] The SPD has bcome more cohesive and much more  determined regarding the elections than one expected 12 months  ago.    [Rosenbaum] The SPD has also become more uniform, At least  that is what the people of the Left are saying.    [Scharping] The SPD was and remains a reform-minded party  that enjoys debate. In an open society, one can only  communicate by presenting clear objectives and arguments, not by  issuing orders.    [Rosenbaum] Have you already taken the next conflict into  consideration?    [Scharping] The principles of our policy are clear -- we  want a change in politics so that life is more free and safe.  For example, we want to see the combating of unemployment and  more social justice. We have a government program, which will  be adopted at the party congress on 22 June. Perhaps a few  minor points in this program will be adjusted at the same time.    [Rosenbaum] Such as financial and social policy? The Left  is not very happy.    [Scharping] We are determined not to raise taxation above  the levels planned for 1995. We want a restructuring so that an  economic improvement occurs for everyone. We want more than  just a rise in foreign demand. For the time being, we in  Germany are reaping the fruits of better economic policies in  foreign countries while at the same time experiencing a weak  rate of economic development and a growth in unemployment. This  year, unemployment will have risen by 500,000.    [Rosenbaum] Even so, the ruling coalition could take  advantage of the first signs of the economic improvement. Are  you not afraid of that?    [Scharping] No. This is not an economic improvement for  everyone. The SPD wants an economic improve for everyone. The  SPD's situation tends to improve in line with economic  improvement.    [Rosenbaum] The Forsa research institute said this week that  this is the first time in any election year that Kohl is ahead  of Scharping.    [Scharpoing] Forsa might say that, but the population thinks  differently. That is suggested by many other surveys. The  population is cleverer and more careful in its assessments than  many propaganda-mongers make out.    [Rosenbaum] The ruling chancellor has a major advantage. He  has been in office for a long time. He can lay down topics and  create results.    [Scharping] Well, no one is going to forget the results of  12 years of Kohl -- high unemployment, high debts, major  injustice, and no future prospects. What else I do not like  about the government is its partially dishonorable and  unconstitutional use of government resources for the purpose of  propaganda. That is a violation of the judgments of the  Constitutional Court.    [Rosenbaum] Do you want to copy Clinton, together with his  slogan: It's time for a change?    [Scharping] Not directly. However, it is certainly no  disadvantage that Clinton and I belong to the same generation.    [Rosenbaum] The presidential elections are the next  appointment in election year, even if the people have no voice.  Have you taken steps to prevent the SPD and its supporters from  falling into a depression if they fail to win a majority for  Johannes Rau.    [Scharping] Until I am proved wrong, I assume that the  members of the Federal Assembly have enough sovereignty to  dispense with parochial party tactics. In any case, as far as  the Bundestag deputies are concerned, the election will take  place on the basis of the majority relations of 1990, and not,  unfortunately, on the basis of the fact that the majority of the  German population wants Rau to become president.    [Rosenbaum] The FDP [Free Democratic Party] is displaying  greater cohesiveness than it did a few weeks ago. Do you still  have a chance of entering into a red-green coalition?    [Scharping] No. Life experience shows that on election day,  16 October, the SPD will have more partners than it needs. I am  also sure that at its party congress, the FDP will speak out in  favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], but with the  proviso that the electorate must itself create the basis of this  support. In clear German, this means: The FDP will watch the  results of the elections on the evening of 16 October, and then  reconsider its offer.    [Rosenbaum] One again hears disappointing tones from the  Greens. Ludger Volmer says you are authoritarian and do not  want to cooperate with the Greens.    [Scharping] Obviously, the Greens are not used to being  criticized for their illusionary and unrealistic demands, which  include calls for the abolition of the Bundeswehr, the  dissolution of NATO, and a gasoline price of 5 German marks [DM]  per liter. The Greens will find no partners if they suggest such  things. I also find it unfair that the Greens adopted at their  party congress a resolution in favor of the closure of all  nuclear power stations within the space of two years, a  resolution, which, by the way, goes against the express wishes  of Joschka Fischer. It would take much longer to close the  nuclear power stations and will cost about DM200 billion. The  Greens make no mention of that.    [Rosenbaum] The European elections are ahead of us.  Lafontaine has said we have paid too much into the EU's coffers.  What do you say to that?    [Scharping] He meant we have paid more than necessary. Here  we are dealing with the extreme carelessness of Messrs Waigel  and Kohl who, in 1993, in full knowledge of the fact that  Germany is no longer in second place on the European prosperity  table, but in seventh place, decided on a disproportionately  high level of payments to the EU. In addition, we are paying  over DM1 billion per year for Great Britain's rebate. This must  be changed. To compensate, Lafontaine has called for higher  influxes of EU funds to Germany.    [Rosenbaum] The old parties seem rather helpless in the face  of the Democratic Socialist Party's [PDS] success in eastern  Germany. Should the SPD not realize that as a left-wing  people's party, it obviously cannot prevent this development?    [Scharping] We are going to be by far the strongest party in  eastern Germany, but I must admit that the government's policies  have directly contributed to the PDS's increased strength. But  whoever votes for the PDS out of anger for Kohl and his empty  promises is indirectly strengthening the CDU, for every vote for  the PDS is a vote against the formation of a new government.  Therefore we are firmly against the PDS as the direct descendant  of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. But we are not against  the PDS' voters. We want to have them for ourselves.    [Rosenbaum] Is there a clear no at all levels to cooperation  with the PDS?    [Scharping] Yes. The PDS is a clear political opponent not  only in daily matters, but also in political convictions.</p>

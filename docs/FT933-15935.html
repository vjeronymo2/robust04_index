			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Russian Vice-President claims Yeltsin sanctioned Urals republic plot Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi claimed yesterday that President Boris Yeltsin's home region had declared itself a republic, as part of a plot sanctioned by the Russian leader. The latest broadside against Mr Yeltsin, who has not commented on the proclamation of a Urals republic within Russia, came as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, warned the declaration could upset attempts to hammer out a new constitution.</p>

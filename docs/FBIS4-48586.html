			<p>BFN     [Text] Fears of a guerrilla war waged by young supporters  of ousted Malawian President Kamuzu Banda have resurfaced in  Malawi following this week's inauguration of President Bakili  Muluzi.    Although Dr. Banda was toppled in last week's elections, the  election results also showed that Dr. Banda and his Malawi  Congress Party [MCP] are still a powerful force in the country.  With five seats still undeclared, the MCP has won 52 seats and  will be the second-largest party in Parliament after Mr.  Muluzi's United Democratic Front, which captured 84 seats. Dr.  Banda also came second in the race for president. Fuelling the  fears of guerrilla war are reports that at least 2,000 armed  members of the MCP youth wing, the Young Pioneers, are in hiding  in Mozambique. President Muluzi, who once commanded the Young  Pioneers when he was an aid to Dr. Banda, said last week he was  very concerned about these armed young men hiding in Mozambique  and that he expected that they would be a source of violence.    He said his government would seek their immediate return  home  by appealing to Mozambique's government and the Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance] movement, whose camps the  pioneers are alleged to be using as a repayment for Dr. Banda's  staunch support for Renamo in the 1980's.</p>

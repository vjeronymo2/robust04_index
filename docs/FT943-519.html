			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Ikarus signs contract to supply Indonesia Ikarus, the state-owned Hungarian bus manufacturer, has signed a contract to supply 400 buses to Indonesia, its biggest order from the country so far. The buses, to be used for city bus services, are due to be delivered by August of next year. The deal has been under discussion for two years. Ikarus, one of Hungary's largest companies, was badly hit by the collapse of Comecon, the former East bloc trading organisation, but in the past four years has successfully penetrated new markets in the Far East and western Europe.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Israeli weapons group in red EVIDENCE of the problems besetting much of Israel's big defence industry emerged yesterday when Israel Military Industries (IMI), one of the biggest state-owned weapons producers, announced losses in 1991 of almost USDollars 240m and warned it was likely to incur a further Dollars 120m loss this year. The government also announced the appointment of a special team to assess the viability of converting Rafael, a state-owned developer of weapons systems, into an independently-run commercial company following several years of heavy losses. At present, it is run directly by the Defence Ministry, as was IMI until two years ago. The defence sector is a stalwart of Israeli exports and its difficulties, due in large measure to a decline in world demand for weaponry, contributed to the country's poor export performance over the past 18 months. The lack of export growth is worrying policy-makers because it is regarded as the key to expanding the economy to accommodate mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. IMI, best known as the maker of the Uzi sub-machine gun, exports about 70 per cent of its production. Its sales fell in 1991 to Dollars 520m from Dollars 670m in 1990. At the same time, it incurred huge costs associated with a crash recovery programme, including a Dollars 84m write-off of unsaleable stock. Last year, IMI sales to civilian markets were just Dollars 30m. The company is seeking government aid to help it complete a painful reorganisation in which it plans to cut the workforce from 10,000 two years ago to around 7,500.</p>

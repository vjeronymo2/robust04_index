			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Industry turns over a new leaf  -British companies faces tougher pollution laws from today THE UK government's ambitious attempt to bring the environmental clean-up of industry under one umbrella by a system of integrated pollution control (IPC) has just come to the end of its first year. Today marks the start of the five-year plan's second stage. To prevent or minimise environmental damage the volume of pollutants emitted from a plant has to be authorised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution. HMIP has the difficult task of policing the regime introduced by the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. New or substantially altered processes came under the regime last April. Existing processes are being brought in under a timetable stretching from last April to 1996. About 5,000 large companies are affected in total. Industry has complained repeatedly about the time and cost of getting operations approved under the new system, and about the difficulty in getting quick advice from HMIP. The inspectors maintain, however, that industry often has itself to blame for any delays as many companies produced insufficient data in their applications. Diane Brown, environmental executive at the Chemical Industries Association (CIA), says that HMIP is 'trying hard' but progress has been very slow. 'There was not sufficient time allowed to make all the preparations,' she says. 'The politicians wanted the system introduced quickly - so quickly it was.' John Cridland, director of environment for the Confederation of British Industry, estimates that it takes an average of 30 days for companies to fill in the application forms for authorisation, which run to 30 pages of questions. The rise in the costs of complying with the regulations has brought protests from the CBI and the CIA. For the coming year, the cost of authorisation doubles from Pounds 1,800 to Pounds 3,650 and the annual fee to cover inspection triples from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,500. These are levied on individual processes so a company might have to pay a much larger total sum to authorise an entire plant. Industry has been worried about public access to the information it provides to get authorisation. The act says that the information has to appear on public registers but it can be withheld on the grounds of commercial confidentiality if a company can prove it would be disadvantaged by disclosure. The two large power companies, National Power and PowerGen, have not been brought under the new regime. They objected that publication of the mix of fuel they use would provide confidential information to their competitors. HMIP rejected this and the companies appealed under the procedure laid down in the Environmental Protection Act. A verdict on the appeal is awaited from Michael Heseltine, environment secretary. Teething troubles were inevitable but many of the problems are now being ironed out. An example is the way the system has been adapted to meet the complaints from the specialty chemical industry. Companies in this sector make a wide range of products in a swiftly changing and competitive market. If each process had to be authorised every time a new order was received the cost and time consumed could drive them out of business. After consultation the inspectorate has produced a system whereby similar processes are combined in one 'envelope' which is given a single authorisation. The heart of the regime is the rule that companies must apply the 'best available technique not entailing excessive cost' (Batneec) in controlling pollution. Some companies have had difficulty finding out what this means in practice and fear that it will prove costly to introduce. But David Slater, director of HMIP, says it need not be a problem. Multinational companies can often demonstrate the best techniques available and this provides a benchmark for others. 'The keynote is practicability. We don't want to put industries out of business. We want them to stay in business and clean up.'</p>

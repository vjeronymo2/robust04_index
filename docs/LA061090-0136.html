			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / STEVE HENSON;  </P> <P> PHILLIES' VATCHER SAVORS MAJOR PROMOTION  </P> <P> It was just a dinky hit, but for Jim Vatcher, Friday's single took on enormous  proportions because it was his first hit in the big leagues.  </P> <P> Vatcher, a 5-foot-9 Philadelphia Phillie outfielder from Cal State Northridge,  faced Dean Wilkins of the Chicago Cubs with two out in the eighth inning.  Vatcher topped a forkball and the ball trickled down the third-base line as  Vatcher dashed to first.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget running down the line at Wrigley Field in the sun," Vatcher  said.  </P> <P> The game was stopped and Vatcher was given the baseball. Philadelphia trailed,  15-1, at the time, which muted the celebration. But Vatcher is savoring every  major league moment.  </P> <P> "I'm holding on day to day," said Vatcher, who also delivered a pinch-hit  single Saturday. "I'm incredibly fortunate to be here this early in the season.  I'm pumped."  </P> <P> On May 28, Vatcher was playing left field and batting a ho-hum .260 for the  Phillies' triple-A team in Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa. Manager Bill Terlecky  told Vatcher that he wouldn't be in the lineup that night and to meet him in  his office.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what to expect," Vatcher recalled. "He said, 'You're going to  the Phillies tomorrow.' I was like, 'Wow.' I was speechless."  </P> <P> Since being called up, he had been hitless until Friday. All six of his  appearances have been as a pinch-hitter, although twice he has remained in the  game as an outfielder.  </P> <P> He vividly recalls every detail of the first four at-bats, the way a pilot  remembers his first flight.  </P> <P> At-bat No. 1: Vatcher leads off the fifth against San Diego Padre right-hander  Andy Benes. "Not much of a pressure situation except for being my first  big-league at-bat," Vatcher said. "I thought I'd be a lot more nervous. You get  kind of locked in with the pitcher and don't really realize where you're at."  </P> <P> Vatcher redirects a 2-2 pitch to right field. For Vatcher, it's that  unforgettable first major league at-bat. But for right fielder Tony Gwynn, it's  just another easy fly ball.  </P> <P> At-bat No. 2: With Darren Daulton on first and none out in the eighth, Vatcher  bats against New York Met left-hander Frank Viola. "Daulton walked on all  fastballs and I was stupid to think he'd throw fastballs to me," Vatcher said.  </P> <P> Viola throws a first-pitch changeup, Vatcher lunges and bounces into a double  play.  </P> <P> At-bat No. 3: St. Louis Cardinal left-hander John Tudor has made a career of  getting hitters to swing at pitches low and away. Vatcher lays off 'em and  draws a walk.  </P> <P> At-bat No. 4: With runners on first and second and Cardinal left-hander Ken  Dayley on the mound, Vatcher watches a fastball right down the middle for  strike one. "I figured, 'Well, I'm gonna look at one.' It was the best pitch  I've seen yet," Vatcher said.  </P> <P> He also looks at strike two and strikes out swinging at a high curve.  </P> <P> "Normally, I've got a pretty good eye and I wait for my pitch," he said. "But  when I'm pinch-hitting, if I get a fastball anywhere near, I'm hacking."  </P> <P> There is no time to waste. Phillie outfielder Carmelo Martinez is scheduled to  come off the disabled list Wednesday, which could signal a return to the minors  for Vatcher.  </P> <P> "I'm not thinking about when I'm going back," he said. "The big leagues are  unbelievable. They take care of you so well. You get spoiled in a hurry, I'll  tell you."  </P> <P> Hard to take: Steve Dailey knows what it's like to come up short, and it has  nothing to do with his stature.  </P> <P> Dailey, Oklahoma State's left fielder and a former two-sport standout at  Ventura High, took a called third strike Saturday to end the College World  Series. Georgia defeated the Cowboys, 2-1, for the championship.  </P> <P> But if history is true to form, Dailey, a sophomore, will get a chance at  redemption. Oklahoma State has qualified for the series eight times in the past  11 years but has yet to win the title.  </P> <P> Add CWS: Cal State Fullerton, which made a quick exit from the series, had  three area players -- Steve Sisco, Kevin Farlow and Frank Charles -- in its  lineup.  </P> <P> Sisco, a sophomore infielder from Thousand Oaks High, was Fullerton's regular  first baseman despite standing only 5-9. Sisco, however, holds a winning hand  in low ball. "In our key regional win against Texas, he picked three throws in  the dirt," Coach Larry Cochell said.  </P> <P> Sisco, who batted .294 with 32 runs batted in this season, has broken a mold  before. As a senior shortstop at Thousand Oaks, he batted leadoff and set a  school record with nine home runs.  </P> <P> Across the infield from Sisco, at shortstop, was Farlow, a former All-City  Section player at Kennedy High.  </P> <P> Farlow, a 6-4 senior, transferred from USC last summer and solidified the Titan  defense. He also batted .284 with 32 RBIs.  </P> <P> "He worked out great for us," Cochell said.  </P> <P> Charles, a transfer from Pepperdine who played at Montclair Prep, is a catcher  and designated-hitter who batted .330 with 43 RBIs.  </P> <P> "All three of those guys are the type I want on my club," Cochell said. "After  coaching 24 years, I am interested in being around good citizens. Kevin, Steve  and Frank fit the mold exactly."  </P></p>

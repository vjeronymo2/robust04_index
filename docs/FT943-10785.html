			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fate adds poignancy to Wilde's characters Sir, The comment of your critic (Theatre, July 27) on Lady Windermere's Fan that 'Wilde's parade of fictitious titled characters, both on-stage and off, seems absurd now: why should they be titled?' calls for the observation that by 1914 a very numerous titled class had in fact accumulated in (non-revolutionary) Britain. The men of this class were decimated in the first world war, and the wealth of this class was considerably reduced. I cannot quote numbers, but my grandfather had a prosperous business manufacturing Turkish and Egyptian cigarettes for these gentlemen. As they gallantly went 'over the top', the business fell away - never to recover. Consideration of the fate awaiting these characters in real life off-stage adds poignancy to the brilliance of the play, as does the thought of Wilde's own sad fate.

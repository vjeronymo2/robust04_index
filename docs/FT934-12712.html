			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / London may host new Yugoslav talks THE United Nations is considering whether to convene a new round of peace talks in London to end the civil war in former Yugoslavia, the UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, said yesterday. Mr Boutros Ghali said after talks in London with the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, that the conference would need careful preparation as well as the approval of all the warring parties in ex-Yugoslavia and the participants of last year's talks in London. 'We are still preparing the idea. We believe that this idea may help us to find a solution,' Mr Boutros Ghali said. He said he held exploratory talks on Monday with the Norwegian mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, who is the UN envoy in the Yugoslavia peace talks, and would meet him again today. Mr Hurd said the other mediator, Lord Owen, who is the representative of the European Community, approved of the idea of a new London conference and would discuss it with EC foreign ministers when they meet in Luxembourg today. 'There's no good calling a conference tomorrow with no guarantee it is to succeed. So it needs careful preparation and that's what its receiving,' Hurd said. In fighting in Bosnia yesterday a Danish lorry driver was killed and nine other UN workers wounded when their relief convoy was caught in crossfire between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia. In Sarajevo, up to 13 people were injured in an attack on a market amid an upsurge in shelling by Serb forces on Mount Zuc, north-west of the capital, Bosnian radio said. The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, yesterday named his foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, to the vacant post of prime minister and also included him in the republic's collective presidency. His appointment may reflect intensified efforts to reach a settlement with Serb adversaries as Mr Silajdzic, a Moslem, is the key figure for bilateral negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. He was singled out at the weekend by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, for 'having turned around and understood reality'. Meanwhile, relief operations of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees suffered a severe setback when two convoys, escorted by British armoured vehicles, were hit by machinegun and mortar fire as they crossed a frontline south of Novi Travnik. Another Danish driver was wounded and eight Dutch soldiers accompanying the military supply convoy were hurt. Mr Nicholas Morris, a UN spokesman, said in Zagreb, the Croatian capital: 'Such an attack is totally unacceptable . . . everyone knows that this is a vital road for the survival of all communities in central Bosnia.'</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs take toll on US markets Wall Street HEAVY profit-taking and computerised sell programs continued to take a toll on US stock markets yesterday, although late buying caused share prices to pick up from the day's lows, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 18.17 down at 3,588.93. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.87 to 456.65, while the American SE composite shed 5.20 to 451.08 and the Nasdaq composite lost 8.62 at 730.73. New York SE volume was heavy at 283m shares. Prices opened lower across the board as the markets failed to rally from Tuesday's losses, when a late surge of sell programs sent the Dow tumbling more than 26 points. Although stocks just about held their own for the first 2 1/2 hours of trading, slightly before midday another round of sell programs, and heavy profit-taking in all markets, prompted sizeable losses. The late buying helped to bring prices back from their lows in the final hour of trading. The day's economic news - the publication of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on the economy - had little effect on sentiment. The Beige Book reported that the economy grew at a 'slow to moderate' pace in late-July and August. Investors also ignored fresh gains in the rallying Treasury market, where longer dated securities rose sharply, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond down to an historic low of 5.858 per cent. Among individual sectors, drug and healthcare stocks, which rallied last week when President Bill Clinton backed down from his original proposals to impose price controls on drug and health services companies, took a beating. Pfizer declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 62, Merck Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 3/4 , Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 3/8 and Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 . Warner-Lambert fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 1/4 , undermined by a ratings downgrade from brokerage house Hambrecht &amp; Quist. Health care shares on the Nasdaq market were also sharply lower. US Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 44, Pacificare Health Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 34 and Oxford Health Plans Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 . Baxter International slid Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 22 7/8 in volume of 4.7m shares after the company warned that its third-quarter earnings would come in below those reported a year ago. Baxter also announced plans to freeze employee salaries and cut senior managers' pay by as much as 25 per cent. Selected bank stocks remained a rare bright area, buoyed by falling interest rates and renewed interest in the recently neglected sector. BankAmerica rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 1/2 , Citicorp Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 . Nasdaq technology issues fluctuated wildly. After declining almost Dollars 2 in early trading, Intel rebounded to end Dollars 1 up on balance at Dollars 63. Canada TORONTO plunged for the second straight day as the market continued its correction after the recent run-up that took it to record high levels. The TSE 300 index closed 70.8 lower at 3,952.9 for a two-day drop of 173 points. The index fell to just below 3,930 in mid-afternoon before staging a modest recovery. Falls outnumbered rises by 647 to 150 after volume of 67.6m shares.</p>

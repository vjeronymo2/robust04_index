			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos: "Tourism in the Forefront" </F> -- live]    [Text] A workshop for journalists and advertising people  was held recently in Havana. In it, the new structure for the  Cuban tourism sector was announced. When I say structure, I mean  tourism's managerial system and its operational concepts.    Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of  Ministers, who has for years directed this strategic endeavor,  explained the gradual functioning of this sector from now on --  specifically, from 1 April on.    I want to discuss the operational principles -- the ideas  upon which these tourism enterprises are based: The highest  quality hotels -- four- and five-star hotels -- are grouped in  the Gran Caribe chain; three-star hotels belong to the Horizonte  chain; and those for Cuban tourism to the Isla Azul chain. The  interesting thing is that these chains are merely hotel chains.  In other words, they are specialized in the operation of their  hotels, and if they need rental cars, will contact Transtur; if  supplies, Abatur; if advertising, Plublicitur; and so on. Thus,  they can direct all their energies to manage the hotels without  having to manage ancillary services, which on many occasions  affect their profits and efficiency.    Every region, perhaps every province, on the basis of its  tourism facilities, excluding hotels, will create a recreation  and tourism enterprise to exploit every resource in the region  for the entertainment of visitors: for example, restaurants,  parks, fishing or hunting preserves, museums, theaters, et  cetera.    Something I have yet to mention, although it is inferred, is  that the new Cuban tourism structure will be guided by a new  ministry. However, as Osmany Cienfuegos said: It will be a small  ministry, perhaps 50 or 60 people, not responsible for the  management of anything, but in charge of setting the pace to  improve performance.    Cienfuegos stated that if, for example, it is necessary to  have ministry representation in a province, it will consist of  only three people: the delegate, a secretary, a driver, and  nothing else because nothing else is needed to guide or set the  pace. This has to be this way because if we minimize personnel  at the root level -- the hotels and tourism services -- we are  not then going to create a super ministry full of people.    Tourism, as Cuba's strategic front, remains thus in the  forefront.</p>

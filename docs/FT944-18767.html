			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Autumn days in the McCormack empire - Derek Lawrenson greets the start of IMG season in Europe / Golf Few people sit on the fence when Mark McCormack and his company, the International Management Group, are the subject. In Arnold Palmer's biography, written by Larry Guest, the author headlined the chapter dealing with lMG: 'Darth McCormack and the Evil Empire'. The European tour, by contrast, swoons at the sight of the man. If it is autumn, it must be time for Mark McCormack month. Last week we had the IMG-promoted Lancome Trophy. This week it is the IMG-run German Masters. Over the next fortnight, the Dunhill Cup at St Andrews and the World Matchplay championship at Wentworth take place. McCormack devised these tournaments. He promotes them and commentates on them for the BBC. The players he manages will be there. During the Dunhill Cup he will chair a committee on the Sony World Ranking, which he devised and has run since it began nine years ago. The ranking is backed by the game's ruling body, the Royal and Ancient, which allows McCormack to handle the television rights for The Open. Is there any area of the professional game outside his reach? Not if there is the potential to make money. He has enormous influence over both the R &amp; A and the European tour. There is no questioning his position as the most influential man in golf. His genius lay first in recognising, and then exploiting, Palmer's charismatic appeal. In doing so he changed golf from a sport with limited appeal to one that attracted support from all walks of life. Furthermore, McCormack was not an insular American. The key word in IMG was always international. Gary Player's signature gave IMG access to the South African market and Tony Jacklin's gave an entry into Britain. When the European tour opened for business, McCormack was offering tournaments, sponsors, back-up, the works. McCormack did a lot for golf in the 30 years after he teamed up with Palmer at the start of the 1960s. (He was also heavily involved in tennis, but that is another story.) No one indeed, did more. But can the same be said today? There are many who believe his empire is now hurting the game. Certainly, with such power, there is the potential for doing so. The Sony Ranking, for example, is run by the same company whose job it is to promote some of the top players and who gain contract endorsements on the strength of them being in the top 10. And in the World Matchplay championship, Severiano Ballesteros, the most popular player in Europe but non-IMG, did not receive an invitation until one of the original invitees dropped out. At the same time, Brad Faxon, winless this year but an IMG man, and John Daly, 76th in the world rankings but a player IMG would desperately like to promote, were both on the original list. IMG promotes 10 events in Europe, offering the tournament sponsors such top players as Nick Faldo, Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, whom it manages. It then claims appearance money on behalf of its clients and takes the percentage which it is entitled to from all their tournament earnings, whether IMG-sponsored or not. IMG vehemently denies that its players' schedules show a bias towards IMG events. Discounting The Open and the tour's flagship event, the Volvo PGA Championship, Faldo has played in just one non-IMG tournament in Europe this year. It was McCormack who came up with the idea of defacing every tee at the Open with sponsors' billboards. It was McCormack who asked so much for Open television rights that Swedish television refused to pay, and so viewers there missed Jesper Parnevik's brave stab at winning the sport's blue riband event. There is evidence that the players are growing tired of IMG. Two years ago Greg Norman left, his new manager, Frank Williams, said the Australian was tired of 'hidden agendas: you know, IMG making deals like we'll give you Greg if you give us TV rights'. This year, Nick Price left, making it two Open champions in a row. The good young players are also steering clear. Ernie Els, Jose-Maria Olazabal and Phil Mickelson all chose other management groups. Many are put off by the terms (IMG takes 10 per cent of prize money and 25 per cent of endorsements). Faxon is McCormack's leading US player, a far cry from the early days when he had both Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. No wonder he is assiduously courting Daly. McCormack, uncharacteristically, found himself on the back foot this summer, trying to counter reports concerning the decline of his American fortunes. He revealed that he had had offers from Rupert Murdoch and Phil Knight, the owner of the Nike sports company, for IMG, but said there had been no serious discussions. In Europe, however, he remains omnipotent, and talk of a crisis is surely fanciful. He will enjoy the next fortnight as his British tournaments take centre stage and, it has to be said, there will be no shortage of spectators who will enjoy them as well.</p>

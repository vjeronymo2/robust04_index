The meeting's result proved that the differences between  both  parties are still considerable and that there is very little  time to overcome them. The deadline is only 11 days off and  many of the measures the Brazilian Government could take to  stave off sanctions must be passed by Congress.    The foreign minister noted: There are still differences of  perceptions that could not be settled today. Nevertheless, we  will keep in contact in the next few days. We decided that we  would speak on the phone if necessary. This is not an easy  situation, but it is not impossible to surmount either.    Kantor was circumspect in his remarks. He said it was a  productive meeting, "but there are some issues whose settlement  is still pending." Having assessed the meeting, another U.S.  official involved in the negotiations later defined the  situation:    -- This is a very complicated situation because our  differences of opinion over certain items on the list under  discussion are still quite considerable and serious.    The United States is convinced that Brazil does not give  adequate protection to copyright, patent, and trademark rights  and demands that this state of affairs be changed. Following  the expiration of the first deadline [for taking corrective  action] (last May), a period of six months was established to  enter into negotiations. This period was extended another 90  days last November and the deadline is 28 February. This could  be the fateful date.    Amorim declined to speculate about the implications of  possible retaliation by the United Sates. He said:    -- We are working on the assumption that we will be able to  prevent retaliation.    After being asked openly what his wager on the denouement of  this conflict was, the minister evinced uncertainty:    -- I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic.    Amorim asserted that both parties came up with new ideas but  refused to disclose them. Kantor had at least mentioned that.  In practice, the Brazilian Government has 11 days to try to  convince the United States that this time it will indeed make  the concessions that have been demanded.    If a trade sanction were imposed on our country, it would  consist of a surtax on several Brazilian products entering the  American market. The idea behind this is to offset the losses  incurred by U.S. companies in Brazil -- a little more than $500  million -- due to piracy.</p>

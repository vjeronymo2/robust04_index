			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATEST PROGNOSIS: ELLISON CAN'T PLAY UNTIL MARCH  </P> <P> Pervis Ellison's first NBA season appeared to slip away Wednesday, as  Sacramento King officials predicted that the No. 1 draft pick wouldn't be ready  to play until mid-March.  </P> <P> Earlier reports indicating that Ellison would miss only three weeks were  incorrect, the Kings said.  </P> <P> Suffering from tendinitis in his right big toe, Ellison was ordered by doctors  to stay off his foot for three weeks.  </P> <P> After three weeks of inactivity, the 6-foot-10 rookie will begin a slow and  cautious rehabilitation.  </P> <P> In practical terms, Ellison will have to learn to walk and run all over again,  the club said.  </P> <P> Finally, he must get into competitive shape, conditioning his legs for the  rigors of the NBA.  </P> <P> The process will probably keep Ellison out of the lineup until March, when the  regular season dwindles to its last five or six weeks. The season ends April  21.  </P></p>

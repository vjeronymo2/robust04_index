			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party [PRD],  grouped in the National Executive Committee, are meeting in  total secrecy at party headquarters on 50 Monterrey Street, Roma  Neighborhood, in Mexico City. The meeting is trying to  establish a new alliance among all the party's factions, since  the fissure in unity is threatening even the presidential  candidacy of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. We will be in  direct contact with our colleague Maria Martinez de la Vega from  PRD offices for all the details on this meeting.    As Heberto Castillo said this morning, the PRD urgently  needs  to make a clean sweep of procedures, not people. Speaking this  morning to ACIR, Heberto Castillo said the problem inside his  party is not [as heard] that PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo  has lacked the discipline to heed the mandate of the National  Executive Committee.    [Begin Castillo recording] What we have here is a problem  that arose because of Mr. Porfirio Munoz Ledo's disrespect for  the decisions of the National Executive Committee. In the  political reforms, a plan submitted to the Government  Secretariat and voted on, but the vote [words indistinct] even  comrade Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. He had to distance himself from  that position in his 18 March speech at the Zocalo. The  fundamental difference is that we, as the PRD, have proposed  that electoral authorities be independent of the executive  branch. The political reforms retain the government secretary  as chairman. [end recording]    As Heberto Castillo reiterated, the problem within the PRD  is  the indiscipline of Porfirio Munoz Ledo.    This morning, we interviewed PRD presidential candidate  Cardenas. A little more at ease, Cardenas said the problems  within his party are normal for a democratic institution that  does not hide its differences.    [Begin Cardenas recording] I see no major problem. I believe  this a normal arrangement in a party where we openly and  publicly hold our discussions. We do not resolve our problems  behind closed doors, but in public. [end recording]</p>

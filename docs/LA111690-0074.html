Coleman, 56, allegedly increased the amount of his  $33.62 state refund check to $644,933.62 before submitting it to his bank in  Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> "Now wasn't that chutzpah? Can you believe it? This is classic. I've never seen  a case like this," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti, who heads the  district attorney's Torrance branch.  </P> <P> Coleman, who was scheduled to turn himself in to Manhattan Beach police this  morning, faces up to three years in state prison if convicted. His attorney,  Robert Corbin, declined to comment.  </P></p>

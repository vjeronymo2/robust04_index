			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Lloyd's spiral syndicates hit hard NEARLY HALF the Pounds 2bn loss faced by Lloyd's of London in its 1989 underwriting year will be borne by syndicates which specialised in so-called spiral catastrophe reinsurance, according to the latest forecasts by Chatset, which provides detailed analysis of Lloyd's insurance market. Spiral business - in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposure to high-level catastrophe risks - is at 'the root of the debacle', said Mr Charles Sturge of Chatset. Fifteen syndicates, managed by agents such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Devonshire and Rose Thomson Young - which account for less than 5 per cent of the market's stamp capacity, or capital base, of around Pounds 11bn - face the worst losses, with a minority of the 31,329 Names underwriting during the year bearing a disproportionate share of the loss. All this is bound to fuel the controversy at Lloyd's about the market's regulation and will increase pressure on the Lloyd's Council to bail out the worst-hit Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting. Outside Names - those who are not market professionals - are heavily over-represented on the worst-performing syndicates which grew very quickly during the mid to late 1980s. Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset's reports and himself a Name facing heavy losses, said: 'There has been a total failure of regulation of the Lloyd's market.' He said some Names faced losses which dwarfed the size of their deposits - the funds Names must lodge with their agents when they join the market. 'Either the deposits are too low, the risks are too great or the risks are not being monitored properly,' Mr Rew said. He described the performance of some syndicates as 'absolutely grotesque'. In spite of recent increases, the size of the Lloyd's deposit - now equivalent to 30 per cent of the insurance premiums a Name can accept - was 'obviously inadequate'. Lloyd's had also failed to ensure that catastrophe syndicates were buying adequate reinsurance. Chatset is also gloomy about the future. It is sticking to its forecasts that Lloyd's is heading for losses of Pounds 1.15bn for 1990 and Pounds 750m for last year. Lloyd's produces reports on these years in 1993 and 1994. The projections were criticised as over-pessimistic by Lloyd's earlier this year. The Chatset figures also show the 1989 loss to be heavily concentrated on the marine market, where syndicates specialised in US liability and spiral reinsurance, as well as the bread-and-butter business of insuring ships, their cargoes and oil rigs. Marine syndicates look set to be hit heavily by their exposure to US liability risks - such as pollution and asbestos clean-up and asbestos-related diseases - in which claims can emerge many years after the policies' are first taken out. Three of the 10 largest marine syndicates - Janson Green 932, Secretan 367, and Wellington 448 - have been unable to reach a sufficiently accurate assessment of these so-called long-tail risks to be able to close their accounts.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOO DAH BECOMING A SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR PARADE ORGANIZER  </P> <P> In his office on the third floor of the YWCA, Peter Apanel is talking business.  </P> <P> Profit margins. Corporate sponsorship. Advertising revenue. These are concepts  to which the Apanel of 13 years ago, when he started the Doo Dah Parade, paid  scant attention.  </P> <P> But now, the self-proclaimed czar of the annual spoof of the Tournament of  Roses is bowing to economic pressure. Disappointed after a lower-than-expected  turnout at last November's event and weary of eking out a living on slim parade  profits, Apanel has made a couple of business decisions.  </P> <P> He's signed a three-year exclusive contract with KCOP Channel 13 to televise  Doo Dah, a deal Apanel says will bring him $10,000 this November and $2,500  more the two subsequent years.  </P> <P> He also has found a corporate sponsor for the parade, which runs the Sunday  after Thanksgiving. GTE California Inc. will pay for the $175-a-page cost of  printing the Doo Dah program in exchange for advertising space and exposure of  the company logo. Twenty percent of the ad revenue will go to a local nonprofit  arts organization.  </P> <P> This all may seem out of character for Doo Dah, which since its 1978 birth has  been everything that the multimillion-dollar New Year's Day extravaganza isn't:  eccentric, ridiculous, racy, anti-Establishment.  </P> <P> Will going electronic and enlisting corporate sponsorship spoil Doo Dah's  offbeat character? "Everybody's going to think I totally sold out," the  39-year-old Apanel conceded, "but I can't do this for nothing anymore."  </P> <P> Apanel estimates that Doo Dah parade-goers pour $100,000 into city businesses  each year, assuming there are about 50,000 spectators who spend about $2 each.  Gail Thompson, executive director of the Pasadena Convention &amp; Visitors  Bureau, said her organization doesn't keep track of Doo Dah Parade-generated  business, and Apanel's figures are probably conservative.  </P> <P> But Apanel must pay the city for law enforcement, health department  inspections, cleanup, and portable toilets. Last year's bill came to $11,747,  said Cissy Schreiner, a senior accountant in Pasadena's Finance Department.  </P> <P> Apanel said he ended up netting $12,000 from the $10 each participant pays and  sales of T-shirts and other items.  </P> <P> In a sense, Doo Dah itself has become an establishment, inspiring people from  New Jersey, Florida, Texas, and Pismo Beach to start their own spoof parades.  </P> <P> "Before, people didn't like the Doo Dah Parade. Now, they love it," said Tom  Behrens, a drummer for Snotty Scotty and the Hankies, a local band that has  appeared in all 13 Pasadena Doo Dahs. "The Doo Dah will grow up and be like the  Rose Parade, get established. A whole Tournament of Doo Dah, you know? Then we  can do a spoof on that."  </P></p>

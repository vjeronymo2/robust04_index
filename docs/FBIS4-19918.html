			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Alexander Privtera after the NATO Council meeting in Brussels on  22 April--recorded]    [Text] [Privtera] Secretary General Woerner, do you  believe today's decisions will finally convince the Serbs to  return to the negotiating table and negotiate seriously?    [Woerner] I hope so, but to say I believe so would be an  exaggeration. Above all, we are raising the stakes of their  aggression. I hope this will at least mean they will think  about distancing themselves from their policy of unbridled  aggression particularly against civilians, hospitals, and  refugee camps. As I say, I cannot express any more than my hope.    [Privtera] In the other protection zones, with the exception  of Gorazde and Sarajevo, there has been no model along the lines  of the ultimatum for Sarajevo. [sentence as heard] Why this  solution? Is it perhaps also a concession to Moscow?    [Woerner] I would not call it a concession. It does indeed  give Moscow the possibility, which it already had at the time of  the first ultimatum for Sarajevo, to talk to the Serbs in an  effort to convince them to stop attacking safe zones. It will  not have gone unnoticed that the Russians were disappointed by  the Bosnian Serbs and their behavior in Gorazde. I can  therefore well imagine the Russians making their contribution to  this. But regardless of that, we were the one to make the  decision, on the advice of the UN secretary general; but the  decision, as I said, was made by the 16 NATO nations.</p>

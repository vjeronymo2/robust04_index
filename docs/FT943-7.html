			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (64): Poised to benefit from thriving Asia - Australia and New Zealand / Both countries are forecasting growth of around 4 per cent Australia and New Zealand, taking their cue from the US, have led the industrialised world out of recession. The improvement began to be apparent in late 1993. By 1994, both countries had posted year-on-year growth rates, in terms of gross domestic product, of around 5 per cent. Now both are forecasting that growth will be sustained at slightly below this level - somewhere around the 4 per cent mark - for the foreseeable future. But, despite the countries' geographical proximity and the fact that both implemented significant reform programmes in the 1980s - which deregulated their economies, lowered tariff barriers, and encouraged competition in key industries - the differences between the two countries are marked. New Zealand has pushed down the reform road at a cracking pace, and extended the reform programme into its welfare sector, replacing the previous 'universal' system with 'targeted' arrangements aimed at aiding only the most needy. It has also enshrined in law some key elements of its new economic order. The Reserve Bank's right to pursue anti-inflationary policies independently of political interference, is one example. The Employment Contracts Act, which essentially did away with the centralised wage award system in favour of individual contracts, is another. On the one hand, this has brought international approbation. Foreign investment in New Zealand has been strong; direct net investment inflow in the year to end-March was more than twice the level of the previous 12 months, at NZDollars 4.7bn. The country also moved to a small budget surplus in the year to end of June 1994, the first seen in New Zealand for 20 years and a result which surpassed even Treasury expectations. Even with this extra leeway, however, the ruling National government decided to first tackle the country's lingering debt problem - at mid-year, public debt stood at 39.6 per cent of GDP - and only then reward New Zealanders for their past sacrifices. Tax cuts were held out as a very distant carrot, possibly becoming available in 1996/7. But New Zealand has paid a political price for this financial zealotry. The reform programme was begun under a Labour government, and initially tagged 'Rogernomics' after Sir Roger Douglas, the finance minister. In 1990, the electorate switched its allegiance to the National Party, only to find the new government extending the reforms to the welfare system. At the last general election, in November last year, the electorate appeared at first to have returned a hung parliament - until a recount in marginal seats gave National a one-seat majority. Since then, there has been one by-election, where National scraped home again by just over 300 votes. More fundamentally, the New Zealand electorate showed its dissatisfaction by electing to replace the current 'first-past-the-post' electoral system, which mirrors the British model, by a form of proportional representation which is based loosely on the German system. This, it has been said, will give minority parties a greater say, and lead to 'consensus' government. Both National and Labour look likely to be losers under the new arrangements which could come into force from mid-1995 onwards. Australia, with a much larger economy and a very different cultural history, has made the changes more gently. Trade barriers are set to come down over the present decade, for example. The government has moved to encourage workplace-based 'enterprise bargaining', but has traded a slower rate of change for union compliance. Its recent industrial relations reform legislation actually beefed up workers' protections - by, for example, enshrining the right to strike in law. The Reserve Bank, despite some political assertions, is not seen as an independent force, and certainly has none of the guaranteed protections and clearly-stated objectives under which the Reserve Bank of New Zealand operates. Some large government or state-controlled enterprises, such as Telecom Australia (known as Telstra outside its home market), have not yet been privatised. The issue of what, if any, further sell-offs should be permitted is a matter of debate. A federal budget surplus is not expected before 1997. And Australia's federal government used the 'growth dividend' - the financial leeway resulting from the country's faster-than-expected growth rate over the past 12 months - to finance a major jobs programme, designed to help tackle the issue of 'long-term' unemployment. The result has been a much more stable political environment. The Australian Labor Party, which began the changes, is still in office although many observers did not favour its chances going into the 1993 election. A backlash has been more apparent at state level, with only Queensland remaining under Labor control. Where the two economies go from here is an interesting question. Both stand to benefit from the booming Asian region, in terms of export demand, investment opportunities, and through the service sector - whether it is catering to Japanese brides in Christchurch or Malaysian students in Perth. Both, though, have to move up the value-added export curve, and reduce their role as Asia's 'farm and quarry'. Australia and New Zealand are also seen as two leading beneficiaries of the Uruguay Round's conclusion, in the latest GATT negotiations. The benefit to the New Zealand farm sector has been put at around NZDollars 1.5bn a year of extra export business, once the provisions are fully implemented; in Australia, the equivalent figure could be around ADollars 1bn-plus. For Australia, the challenge centres on avoiding the 'boom-and-bust' cycle seen in previous upswings. In part, this scenario has resulted because of a tendency for the country's balance of payments to lurch out of kilter - prompting interest rate hikes. There are some Cassandras who see this scenario repeating itself, especially if business investment, which has been slow to recover, surges all at once. Imports of plant and equipment will rise, it is argued, and the current account deficit will widen. The optimists' counter-claim is that the restructuring of the economy means that Australia is more competitive, and that it will maintain a much stronger export performance. For New Zealand, there is still the task of reducing debt. But the bigger issue remains the political one - in particular, whether the economic benefits of the decade of austerity have filtered down to enough voters to ensure that some of the more controversial elements of the reform process, such as the Employment Contracts Act, are not repealed.</p>

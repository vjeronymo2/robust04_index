			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Fear of inflation continues to grip the US credit markets. At the end of a jittery week, bond prices plummeted on Friday after the Federal Reserve reported bigger than expected increases in August industrial production and capacity utilisation. The benchmark 30-year long bond sank by 1 19/32 to 96 13/16 , lifting its yield by 12 basis points to nearly 7.8 per cent - the highest this year. Most analysts cling to the belief that the Fed will hold off until November before contemplating another rise in short-term interest rates, but each time another bout of bad news like Friday's hits the market, investors turn their thoughts to the possibility that the Fed could move before then - perhaps as early as its September 27 meeting. Fortunately, perhaps, the next few days may be relatively quiet in this respect, since the economic reports due to be published are less closely watched for signs of incipient inflation than last week's. On Tuesday, figures for July's trade deficit are expected to show little change from June's Dollars 9.4bn; on Wednesday, figures for August housing starts are expected to have slipped a little to an annual rate of 1.4m; and on Thursday, the federal government is expected to report a budget deficit of Dollars 24bn for August, putting it on track for a deficit of less than Dollars 200bn for the year - the lowest since 1989.</p>

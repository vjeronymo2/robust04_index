			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / More gripping than the winter Olympics: The passions stirred in Norway by Monday's EU referendum From the barren arctic northlands, through the spectacular mountain valleys and fjords, down to Oslo's humdrum inner suburbs, the word Nei] has been inescapable in Norway this year. It has been carved into hillsides, daubed on cows, flown from flagstaffs and hung on banners across streets. One farmer won himself a front-page picture in a national newspaper, grinning beside a sign he had erected barring European Union visitors from his campsite. A few weeks ago, a group of women formed 'Blondes against the EU'. The passions stirred by Monday's referendum on joining the EU have been exceeded recently only by the Lillehammar winter Olympics last February  - when Norway skied off with a horde of gold medals - and the football World Cup finals in July, for which Norway qualified for the first time in more than 50 years. As the vote draws near, the confidence of the No camp has been dented. Its commanding lead in the opinion polls has been eroded since Sweden voted in favour of membership earlier this month. But even if, as the latest polls suggest is possible, the Yes campaign achieves an against-the-odds victory, Norway will have lived up to its billing as the most Euro-sceptical of the four nations due to join the EU next year. (Austria and Finland, like Sweden, have voted Yes.) Last weekend, the No camp organised the largest rally in any of the four prospective member countries: 25,000 people streamed into Oslo in driving rain and snow to boo Brussels. It was the biggest political demonstration in Norway since the second world war - even bigger than any rally during the campaign in 1972, when Norway rejected membership of the European Community in an earlier referendum. In the Oslo crowd was Mr Skjalg Jensen, 27, who had travelled 1,200km from Finnmark, Norway's northernmost county, where the country borders Russia and the arctic Barents sea. Dressed, like many in the crowd, in traditional knickerbocker trousers and a floppy felt mountain hat, with the Norwegian flag sticking out of his backpack, Mr Jensen declared: 'The question of joining the EU is a question of our values, and that is why we are against joining. 'They say the politicians in Brussels are the voices of the people, but what do they understand? Their realities are golf and socialising. Theirs is a different culture from normal people like us in the north.' Nor was Mr Jensen worried by the arguments of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the formidable prime minister who leads the Yes campaign. She has warned that Norway could be dangerously decoupled from its Nordic and European neighbours. 'I think after a No vote, we will have the same Norway that exists today,' said Mr Jensen. 'Our economy is strong - it is the strongest in Europe.' Norwegians' hostility to the EU is based on a sense of their special place in European culture, a jealously guarded political independence, and the economic security gained from North Sea oil. The very word 'union' provokes a grimace in a country that only gained independence from Sweden in 1905 and was occupied by Nazi Germany during the last war. As for political isolation, many Norwegians believe that by joining the EU they would increase their separation from the seat of decision making. 'It is already a long way from here to Oslo,' say people in the regions. 'We will be even further away from Brussels.' They are happy to confine themselves to membership of Nato. The oil bonanza, meanwhile, has allowed Norway to indulge its preference for a social system heavily weighted towards state welfare and lavish subsidies for rural communities. And fear of losing control of its petroleum and fish riches outweighs the mostly intangible economic benefits EU membership might bring. Unlike both Sweden and Finland, which have recently suffered deep recessions, Norway has fared quite well, with relatively low unemployment (a total of about 8 per cent compared with 13 per cent in Sweden and 18 per cent in Finland). Warnings from the Yes camp that petroleum revenues will soon peak, exposing the weak state of Norway's onshore industrial base, make little impression on many Norwegians, made comfortable by the generous redistribution of oil wealth. 'A market economy for north Norway will never work,' said Mr Mats Albinson, a docker from Hammerfest, at the Oslo rally. 'Currently there is protection of the economy, but joining the Union implies there would be totally free access for outside competition. We are not fools - we've seen this happen before in other countries.' The counter-argument, that Norway could find itself excluded from European markets, also has little impact on the No camp. It believes that oil and fish can continue to be the backbone of the economy. 'They don't trade with us because they are sorry for us,' proclaims Ms Torhild Lamo, a No campaigner in the north-western town of Bodo. 'They trade because they need what we've got. We have the natural resources, so I don't think that would be a problem.' Mrs Brundtland hopes that enough people in the urban areas, which are more populous than the regions, will reject these arguments. In the cities, her appeal for Norway not to vote itself out of the political and economic development of Europe shows signs of hitting home. But even if she wins, it will be an uneasy victory over the outlying regions, which have traditionally embodied Norway's national identity. 'We are a very different country, we have different values and we are a different people. We want to protect the value of life in Norwegian society,' said Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the principal leader of the No campaign, at a meeting in Oslo last week. It won her a standing ovation.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lifting the load of unit trust charges  -A look at the impact of a bold move by Murray Johnstone in cutting its initial fees for fund management THE FRESH air of competition was brought into the unit trust market this week - and investors can reap the benefits. Murray Johnstone has cut the initial charge on its range of unit trusts from 5 to 1 per cent, which will bring immediate savings to new investors. The initial charge is one of two key factors which make up the spread between bid and offer prices. The other is the cost of dealing in the shares which the trust owns. By cutting the initial charge, this spread between bid and offer prices will be reduced sharply, as the table below shows. This means that a unitholder's investment will have a smaller hurdle to surmount before he makes a profit. If charges fall across the industry, returns to investors should increase. The effect on Murray Johnstone's trusts was seen in a fall in offer prices. The price of its equity income fund - 83.7p at Tuesday's opening, before the change - fell immediately to 81.31p. The bid price, however, rose from 78.43p to 78.94p. This spread looks a lot better than the rest of the industry. On February 1, the average spread on all non-cash unit trusts was 6 per cent, according to Finstat. So, an investor who buys into a Murray Johnstone unit trust is making an average saving of between 1.8 and 4.2 per cent. The initial charge on a unit trust personal equity plan from Murray Johnstone will also fall, from 5 to 1.5 per cent. Murray Johnstone is not being entirely altruistic. It is increasing the annual management charge on the trusts from 1 to 1.5 per cent as part compensation for its reduced initial charge. But an annual charge of 1.5 per cent is not out of line with much of the sector. Existing Murray Johnstone unitholders might not see the move as entirely beneficial; they have already paid the 5 per cent initial charge and now face a rise in annual charges. But they will be offered an extra discount of 0.5 per cent - bringing the initial charge down to 0.5 per cent - on any new funds in which they invest. They might also expect to benefit if large numbers of new unitholders are attracted, as growing funds are expected to perform better than shrinking funds. The Murray Johnstone initiative certainly is against the industry trend. Over the past few years charges have tended to rise, not fall, with initial fees edging up from 5 to 6 per cent and annual fees from 1 to 1.5 per cent. Lazards already offers funds with no initial charge, but these require a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000. Some cash trusts also have no initial charge. But Murray Johnstone is offering its service across a wide range of funds and on a minimum of just Pounds 500. In the US, a large number of mutual funds (the equivalent of unit trusts) have reduced or no initial charges, and are known as 'no-load' or 'low-load.' But the UK industry has not moved in the same direction because of the difficulty in selling such funds. Unit trusts are sold mainly through tied agents and independent financial advisers, who are offered a 3 per cent commission on each deal. The commission is the main component of the initial charge. Without it, there is no incentive for advisers to recommend a trust - and that will be the main barrier to Murray Johnstone making a success of its radical move. The company is, however, offering a renewal commission of 0.5 per cent to advisers who keep client money within the group's trusts for a year. This commission will be paid out of the group's annual management fee and is designed to encourage long-term investment. Although Murray Johnstone reported an encouraging reaction from advisers this week, it may need to rely on those few advisers who charge a fee (see companion piece), or investors who buy trusts direct. The latter can do so by ringing 0345-090-933 or by writing to Murray Johnstone for further information at 7 West Nile Street, Glasgow G2 2PX. Other fund managers doubtless will claim that they can produce better investment performance than Murray Johnstone, Thus, their unitholders will prosper in the long run, despite the higher initial charges. And it is true that while the three-year performance of Murray's unit trusts (shown in the table) is not dreadful, neither is it particularly impressive. Ignoring the cash fund, only two Murray Johnstone funds have a top quartile (best 25 per cent) sector performance, with one of those being the tiny UK growth trust. But performance has been improving. Over the (admittedly short) one-year period, eight out of nine funds have produced above-average growth for their sectors. And the group's short-term performance should be given a boost by the reduction in the initial charge. Over the long term, it could be that those funds which retain a 1 per cent annual management fee, but a higher initial charge, turn out to be offering better value. But Murray Johnstone's bold move has to be welcomed by anyone who wants to see greater competition in the financial services market.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MURRAY JOHNSTONE'S PERFORMANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust            Size        3 yr     3 yr          Sector                  (Pounds m)  perf     sector perf   ranking  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Amer Inc         15.3        +30.6    +38.9         69/111 European         25.4        +14.6    +22.1         80/105 Equity Inc       47.2         +6.3     +0.9         29/105 Far Eastern      10.4         +2.2     -1.2         19/48 Olympiad          8.3         +0.6    +10.7         94/130 Olympiad Inc      3.5        +21.6    +10.0          5/16 Small Cos         3.9        -30.1    -15.6         44/54 UK Growth         1.1        +19.1     +3.2         21/126 Acumen           15.9        +16.1     +1.2          4/26 Acumen Res        neg        +28.7    +27.8          1/2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat.

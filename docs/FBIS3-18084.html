A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry says that the  violence which has been escalating in the occupied territories  during the past few days causes great concern for the future of  the Middle East peace process. The statement says: We hope  that this was an isolated incident carried out by an insane  person. We feel concern about the clashes that took place after  the incident, and about the harsh measures taken by the police  force during these clashes.</p>

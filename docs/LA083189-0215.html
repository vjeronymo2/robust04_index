			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MASSIVE E. GERMAN ESCAPE PLAN DEVISED;  </P> <P> HUNGARY, W. GERMANS READY TO MOVE 20,000 BY RAIL, SOURCES SAY  </P> <P> Hungarian and West German officials have devised a plan that would allow up to  20,000 East Germans to flee to the West in the next few days, government  sources disclosed today.  </P> <P> About 10% of the 150,000 to 200,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary are  thought to be seeking passage to West Germany, and Bonn and Budapest have  agreed to help them, the sources said on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> In Vienna, Austrian officials confirmed Bonn had asked them to arrange for  special rail transportation for 15,000 to 20,000 East Germans to West Germany.  </P> <P> A reported plan to allow East Germans out of Hungary without the usual  documents authorizing their departure may have been intentionally leaked by  officials to let would-be emigres in East Germany know about the rare escape  opportunity.  </P> <P> Most areas of East Germany receive Western radio or TV broadcasts, and the  reports of the purported agreement between West Germany and Hungary were widely  circulated today.  </P> <P> Asked if Austria had agreed to allow the escapes during the next few days, one  West German official told the Associated Press: "I cannot deny that."  </P> <P> Officially, West Germany has denied it is working with Hungary to aid the  escapees.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen described reports of the plan as "pure  speculation."  </P> <P> However, Austrian Railways officials in Vienna told the Associated Press they  had been asked by Bonn to ready railroad cars for a mass transport of refugees  from the Hungarian border on Sept. 6.  </P> <P> One official said he expected the exodus sooner, perhaps this weekend. He said  West German railroad administrators told them to prepare for up to 20,000 East  German passengers.  </P> <P> Austrian Railways has promised to make up to 50 train cars available within six  hours at an unspecified border point with Hungary, the official said.  </P> <P> A Frankfurt-based national newspaper said the refugees would be allowed passage  to West Germany on the basis of their East German visas for Hungary.  </P> <P> The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported that the "pragmatic solution" had  been worked out between West Germany and Hungary during confidential  negotiations.  </P></p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Opera casts its net back - Records About 20 years ago my local library moved into new premises and took what then seemed the ambitious step of opening a record section. The objective was not to make money by charging, as it is now. The expansion of the library's services was simply an invitation to its readers to broaden their interests. As no payment was required, anyone could afford to be adventurous. Why I borrowed a boxed set of LPs entitled Stars of the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells I do not now remember. Most of the singers would have been unknown to me and I had never been to the opera at either the Old Vic or Sadler's Wells. The records had to be returned within a fortnight, but there was one group of performances in that collection so exciting that it has stayed fresh in my mind ever since. The set concluded with a selection of excerpts from Britten's Peter Grimes, performed by the original cast soon after the opera's premiere, in 1948. For some reason they had never been issued at the time and EMI had decided to use them to illustrate a high-point in the history of the Sadler's Wells company. Now they are back, superly re-mastered, in excellent sound, as part of a two-CD box of historic Britten recordings which unearthes still more rare treasures, a tempting proposition. No] - it is more than that. The Peter Grimes excerpts are essential listening for anybody interested in the opera. Hearing them again, one realises why this opera blew through the British musical world like an East-coast gale. The music has a biting edge, the drama a chill realism, by the side of which performances today all too often sound warm and comfortable. No other singer surpasses Peter Pears's intensity in the mad scene, unhinged and wild, frightening to hear. It is also good to have preserved on disc Reginald Goodall, the original conductor, and Joan Cross, Britten's chosen Ellen Orford, who died aged 93 just before Christmas. The rest of the set has substantial excerpts from The Rape of Lucretia made in 1947 (not, alas, with Kathleen Ferrier) and early recordings of Britten folksongs. Six tracks, including some of the Peter Grimes, are appearing for the first time. EMI's set of Donizetti's Anna Bolena will also be new to many people. This release bestows a certain legality upon what used to be a pirate recording, though the sound quality unfortunately remains very poor, subject to sudden outbreaks of twittering, which I take to be interference in the radio reception. This is the price we have to pay to hear Maria Callas in the title-role, live at La Scala, Milan, 1957, at the very height of her career. The whole of the final scene, sung with infinite variety of colour, is an object-lesson in bel canto singing, every line with something to say. There are also live recordings of Callas in Bellini's Il pirata and Verdi's Macbeth. The set devoted to another prima donna from the 1960s - Regine Crespin  - does not offer enlightenment on such a consistent level, but is a welcome collectors' item. Crespin's voice and style of singing have been described as 'addictive', which seems to me apt. There are unsuccessful performances here - a deadly slow Schumann Liederkreis Op. 39 is one - but, as with Callas, this is a truly personal singer, imaginative, moving, memorable. A shame that Decca, which holds her best recordings, has not issued a similar retrospective. That company's main operatic release this winter had one eye on the future. Ever since Luciano Pavarotti signed an exclusive contract near the start of his career, Decca has been building up its recordings of the tenor's main operatic roles (prime material for future re-release, long after the singer himself has retired). As his repertoire is relatively small, there is not much to go, but Puccini's Manon Lescaut is a new addition, which Pavarotti sings with all his customary beauty of voice. Mirella Freni, with whom as a child he shared a wet nurse, sounds less well preserved. Decca's recording is brash and James Levine conducts with relentless passion, loving the music to death. It is interesting to speculate which recordings from today will be accorded historic importance in the next century. Individual stars, like Pavarotti, will certainly have a place, but how shall we look back on the authentic instrument movement, if it continues to progress and change at the present rate? Even the most advanced performances, in terms of research and period accuracy, might soon sound out-of-date. If any present recordings retain their importance, John Eliot Gardiner's cycle of the Mozart operas will surely be among them. This series sums up all that is best about the movement in general. His new set of Cos fan tutte is thoughtfully cast, immaculately - nay, astonishingly - precise in every technical detail, considering it was made at a live performance. Gardiner has a reputation for ruling his singers and orchestra with a rod of iron. And it shows. Of the three Da Ponte comedies, on which he is now engaged, none sparkles as a result of technical brilliance more brightly than Cos fan tutte. The trios and quintets of the first act are so clear that an average music student could sit down and write out the parts without any need to hear the music again - assuming, that is, he could keep up with Gardiner's speeds. One imagines long hours of rehearsal, in which the conductor went over each passage time and time again until every little phrase was balanced as he wanted it. Single-mindedness can be a virtue in a conductor. It is a feature of the performance that the six solo singers should form an obedient ensemble. Anybody who has a favourite old recording in which the singers flaunt their personalities (Montserrat Caballe and Janet Baker, for example) may feel cheated at the comparatively pale portrayals here, in which blending of voices rather than individuality is the prime requirement. Nevertheless, Amanda Roocroft and Rosa Mannion as the two sisters, Rainer Trost and Rodney Gilfry as their lovers, contribute some beautiful singing, the soprano and tenor especially. Eirian James is the Despina with a surprise baritone register, Carlos Feller the Don Alfonso. Gardiner could not achieve his high standards without colleagues as skilled as these.

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Exco float shows leap in value Exco, the fixed-income and money broking arm of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, is to return to the stock market almost eight years after it was bought by the finance group which collapsed in 1990. Exco is expected to carry a stock market value of more than Pounds 200m, enabling B&amp;C's administrators to raise at least Pounds 80m from the flotation. This compares with the Pounds 75m value attached to the business in June 1992, when 60 per cent was sold to institutions and senior staff after flotation plans were scrapped. One analyst said: 'The big profits have already been made by the investors who bought in during 1992.' But the company argues a push into emerging markets, combined with new products, should enhance profitability. Exco has seen profits surge in the past two years, spurred on by increased activity in the foreign exchange and debt markets in which it operates. Pre-tax profits rose 52 per cent to Pounds 41.5m in 1993. Subject to pricing, B&amp;C will sell its entire 40 per cent holding. Other shareholders - senior employees own 15 per cent and Caledonia Investments owns 27.4 per cent - have yet to decide. Exco operates a 24-hour global business, with offices in Tokyo, London and New York - the last accounted for more than half of last year's profits. Moneybroking operations, which include spot foreign exchange, money markets and derivatives, all increased profits last year but have been affected by fierce competition. The fixed interest operations had an excellent year against a background of declining interest rates and high levels of government deficit funding. Exco's profits are reliant on market volatility to generate the turnover on which it earns commission. It is a cyclical business and profits fell from 1987 to 1991. However, it remained profitable throughout the recession and its global diversification helps cushion earnings. Salaries account for around 65 per cent of operating costs and these grew 26 per cent to Pounds 109m last year. Intense competition in the industry is likely to put further pressure on profit margins. NM Rothschild is sponsor to the issue, while Kleinwort Benson Securities has been appointed as brokers. The flotation will be priced before the end of June. Lex, Page 18</p>

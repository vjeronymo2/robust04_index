			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / EBRD: East Europeans say EBRD is failing them EAST Europeans have sharply attacked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) at its first annual meeting in Budapest for its failure to meet the financing needs of the region. The bank has responded by saying its hands are so tied by the strict restraints of its founding charter that is unable to disperse much of the money it already has. In Budapest, Mr Ivan Kostov, the Bulgarian finance minister, complained that the EBRD had approved only one investment in his country, and had none in the pipeline. 'We need the help now; in two years it might be too late.' The bank is nowhere near exhausting its starting capital of Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.16bn). In the words of Mr Attali the bank 'has more money than projects'. The main difficulty is that the bank's ability to address a wide range of economic problems is boxed in by the EBRD's founding charter and the powerful directors shareholding countries put in place to rein in Mr Attali's ambitions. He came smack up against those constraints this week, when he proposed a special restructuring facility containing a combination of soft loans and high-risk equity. But the initiative was pushed aside by the US and other shareholders which want the EBRD to stick to its brief. In its first year the bank approved about 20 projects and committed Ecu620m (Pounds 444m). But those results must be viewed against Mr Attali's grandiose ambitions and his estimate of Ecu4,000bn for east Europe's needs. The EBRD is thought by investment bankers, however, to have made a promising start given its tight remit. But isolated achievements have failed to satisfy east Europeans whose high expectations were inflated by Mr Attali's rhetoric. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovakian finance minister, summed up the region's reaction: 'So far the role of EBRD in our part of world has been no more than marginal.' Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, was yesterday appointed new chairman of the EBRD board of governors. Mr Waigel repeated Bonn's objections to the bank offering soft loans, although he said an exception could be made to finance urgent safety work on eastern European nuclear reactors.

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Unitrin tries to cool bid pressure Unitrin, the Chicago-based insurance company which has become the target of a Dollars 2.6bn hostile takeover approach from its larger rival, American General, said yesterday that a combination of the two companies was unlikely to be permitted under current US anti-trust laws. The company said that, together, the two insurers would account for 25 per cent of the national home-service market, which involves selling life and health insurance and other financial services to mainly lower-income families in their homes. In some states, the market share would exceed 40 per cent, it added. 'It is very hard to believe that federal anti-trust regulators or state insurance commissioners would approve the transaction American General proposes,' said Mr Richard Vie, president of Unitrin. The company added that the cost and time it takes to build a network of home-service agents 'severely limits' new entrants to the market. Unitrin's statement yesterday was seen as part of an attempt to deflect any pressure it may be under from shareholders to accept the bid approach. American General announced its interest publicly last week, in an attempt to win the support of Unitrin's shareholders for an acquisition.</p>

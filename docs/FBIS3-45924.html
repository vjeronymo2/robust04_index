"That is, from swelling in numbers and scale, to emphasis on  quality and efficiency," Yu Youxian, director of the State Press  and Publications Administration, told a national meeting which  opened here today.    In the past 10-odd years, he said, the number of newspapers  and magazines has grown from 1,000 to more than 10,000, and that  of publishing houses has exceeded 800.    "The speed has exceeded the country's capacity to support  them," he said.    The situation has caused concern among the public, he said.  And the up-coming change will be in line with the emphasis on  efficiency in the national economy.    He called for insisting on a correct political line in media  and publications work. Meanwhile, administrative mandates  should be reduced to a minimum and replaced by legal measures.  In addition, he said, the sector will be mainly run as an  enterprise instead of a government department.    Meanwhile, the draft of a press law, China's first, is  expected to be speeded up this year, he revealed.    And the country will continue its campaign to crack down on  illegal publications, including pornographic ones, he said.</p>

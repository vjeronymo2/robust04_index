			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers </F> by Lionel Barber and Ronald van de Krol; place and date not  given: "Spoiler in the Euro Contest"]    [Text] Mr Ruud Lubbers ought to be feeling very sore. This  week, the Dutch prime minister saw his bid to succeed Mr Jacques  Delors as president of the European Commission blocked by a  Franco-German steamroller in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,  prime minister of neighbouring Belgium. Once the favourite, Mr  Lubbers finds himself scrambling to salvage his candidacy.    The Franco-German preference for Mr Dehaene is a clear snub;  but Mr Lubbers appeared unruffled yesterday morning as he sipped  black coffee in his office in the centre of the Hague. "The  choice that has to be made now is not only a choice to be made  by Bonn and Paris, ...it is, of course, up to all other  countries (of the European Union) [EU]."    His appeal to a broader constituency remains his strongest  card; but it poses an explicit challenge to the Franco-German  axis which has set the direction of the Union for the past 30  years. Unless he or Mr Dehaene withdraws, there could be an  unseemly row at the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25, When  EU leaders are set to decide in secret on the successor to Mr  Delors.    For Mr Lubbers, this is a painful prospect. A  consensusseeker  schooled in the art of coalition-building in Dutch politics, he  has spent 12 years brokering compromises inside the EU with  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois  Mitterrand -- on issues ranging from the mindnumbing detail of  the EU budget to German unification and the Maastricht treaty,  which he pulled off at the end of the 1991 Dutch presidency.    Yet the Lubbers candidacy now transcends personalities. It  is about the place of the Netherlands inside the Union, and the  dilemma of smaller states struggling to preserve their influence  ahead of the prospective entry of four new members from Austria,  Sweden, Finland and Norway.    The Dutch dilemma is poignant because the Netherlands has  never won its fair share of Euro-spoils, despite being an EU  founder member. Unlike Belgium or Luxembourg, it has failed to  secure Euro-institutions such as the European Parliament, the  European Commission or the European Court of Justice, which are  money-spinners for the local economy. Only last year, the Dutch  bid to put the European Monetary Institute in Amsterdam was  dashed by Mr Kohl's insistence on locating the forerunner of the  European central bank in Frankfurt.    The Lubbers candidacy was supposed to redress the balance.  Here was a prestigious post which Mr Delors has changed beyond  recognition since he first arrived in Brussels almost 10 years  ago. Thanks to Mr Delors, the president of the Commission is not  just a top-flight bureaucrat, he is the public face of the  Union. With his Christian Democrat background, and 12-year  membership of the club of EU leaders, Mr Lubbers looked like a  shoe-in. So what went wrong?    Mr Lubbers concedes he may have alienated the French and the  Germans earlier this year by refusing to commit himself to  entering the race. He was worried about distracting public  attention from last month,s Dutch general election at a time  when Mr Elco Brinkman, his hand-picked successor, was struggling  to take over his mantle. He had also pledged to Queen Beatrix to  serve out his term as prime minister, which precluded a public  campaign for the Brussels post of the kind waged by Sir Leon  Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon and Mr Peter  Sutherland, former head of Gatt, are long-shot contenders.    In retrospect Mr Lubbers's reticence looks like  miscalculation. The French seized on Mr Dehaene, a  French-speaker on the left of the Christian Democrat party, who  had impressed during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU.  Mr Kohl, who favoured initially Mr Wilfried Martens, a former  Belgian premier, fell into line.    Mr Martens did not command the support of his own  government,  so "Kohl feared that he was empty-handed," said Mr Lubbers,  adding mischievously that the rotund Mr Dehaene had the goesting  (appetite) for the top job.    That may not be the whole story. Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl have  never been close. Nor did the German chancellor appreciate the  Dutchman's call for clarity about the German-Polish border  during German unification, challenging Mr Kohl's preference for  leaving the question open in order to placate the German right  ahead of the 1990 general election. So is he too  independent-minded for Mr Kohl? The Dutch prime minister  paused: "Perhaps."    There is no question that Mr Lubbers has his own views on  the  future of Europe. He is keen on a common European defence  evolving under the umbrella of the NATO alliance, and is  frustrated with the UK government for dragging its feet. He  also supports European monetary union, mainly because the Dutch  are certain to be in the vanguard along with the Germans.    Yet he is sympathetic to British warnings about the risks of  integration moving too far ahead of European public opinion.  Even in his own country, he feels that enthusiasm for Europe is  diminishing. Hence the need for Europe's leaders to restore a  sense of mission. He offered three slogans:    1. Efficiency. Mr Lubbers, who comes from a line of  Rotterdam industrialists, wants tighter controls on the ECU70bn  annual EU budget and a bigger role for the Court of Auditors,  the spending watchdog. "People must have the feeling that  resources are well spent."    2. Democracy. He wants more transparency in  decision-making. He favours a bigger role for the European  Parliament in shaping legislation, more public debates with the  Commission, and more involvement by national parliaments in  areas of inter-governmental co-operation under the second and  third pillars of the Maastricht treaty, such as foreign policy,  security and justice matters.    3. Credibility. He is worried about the EU stretching its  ambitions. He cautions against a "Big Bang" conference to  review Maastricht in 1996 which could introduce more qualified  majority voting in an expanded Union. He welcomes the  "inevitable" EU membership of the central European countries  such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; but he warns  against arousing unrealistic expectations about the timing of  entry.    Yet Mr Lubbers wants the EU to work. With out criticising  the call this week by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for a  multi-speed Europe, he said the principle of opting out should  apply only to the second and third pillars. On EMU [European  Monetary Union], he conceded that some countries might move  faster than others, "but there must be a limited time  difference. We should not accept too easily all sorts of  exceptions and differences in speeds."    On the other hand, Mr Lubbers has little sympathy for French  calls for a club of "founder members" led by France, Germany,  the Benelux and Italy -- an idea floated again this week by Mr  Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for European affairs.    "I find this fascinating. Why? Because he suggests that the  old Six should give a new example of what to do. But he  (Lamassoure) writes the article on the very same day as two of  them, France and Germany, come out of the preparations for the  next (European) Council not as Six but as Two. Italy and the  Netherlands are included in his architecture, but are excluded  from consensus-seeking."    There is a firmness in tone which suggests that Mr Lubbers  is  loath to let a Franco-German diktat push him out of the race.  So is he ready to take his candidacy "down to the wire" at  Corfu? "Yes," came the unequivocal response.</p>

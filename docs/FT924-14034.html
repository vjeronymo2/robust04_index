			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Siemens plans to cut 2,300 jobs TWO of Germany's leading multinationals yesterday blamed falling demand and prices in markets for electronics for the planned loss of almost 3,000 jobs. Siemens, the electrical and electronics engineering giant, said it had been forced to speed up rationalisation of its loss-making semiconductor business. The division, which has already shed almost 2,000 jobs this year, plans to reduce its international workforce by a further 2,300 to 11,000 by the time restructuring is complete in 1995, Mr Jurgen Knorr, managing director, said yesterday. Timing of the cuts would depend on market developments, he said, painting a gloomy picture of current prospects. Meanwhile, BASF unveiled plans to close two audio and video cassette factories by the end of next year and reduce its payroll by 570. BASF Magnetics, a subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, which lost DM234m (Pounds 93.6m) last year on sales of DM2bn, said its tape factory in Ettenheim, Germany, would close by the middle of next year and a works in Gien, France, would be shut by the end of 1993. The announcements add to a rapidly growing tally of job losses among leading German manufacturers, which are now feeling the full effects of international recession coupled with a rapid slowdown in the domestic economy. Other recent cuts include the loss of 7,500 jobs at Deutsche Aerospace, the aircraft and space division of Daimler-Benz. Earlier this year the group said it was to reduce the payroll at its Mercedes-Benz vehicles subsidiary by 20,000. Mr Knorr said prices for semiconductors had fallen 20 per cent and sales to important customers such as television, audio and engineering companies were down 25 per cent. Olivetti, the Italian conglomerate, is to close its Triumph-Adler factory in Nuremberg at the cost of about 1,000 jobs.</p>

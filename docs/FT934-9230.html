			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Three investment trusts are ready for market THREE new investment trusts are coming to the market as the industry continues to take advantage of the low discount on which its shares trade, and private investor enthusiasm for equities. Govett High Income Investment Trust is attempting to raise Pounds 50m via a placing and offer-for-subscription. The new trust will invest in a combination of UK shares, international high yield bonds and emerging markets to offer investors an initial gross yield of 7 per cent. The trust is issuing up to 50m ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Some 34m shares are being placed, with the balance of 16m on offer to the public. The aim of the trust will be to provide a high and steadily rising income, with the potential for long-term capital growth. More than 50 per cent of the portfolio will be kept in UK equities to ensure the trust qualifies for Personal Equity Plan status; income and capital gains from a Pep are tax-free. Dividends will be paid quarterly. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and dealings in the shares are expected to start on December 3. Kleinwort Second Endowment Policy Trust will invest in second-hand with-profits endowment policies. It is usually more profitable for policyholders to sell their unwanted policies than to surrender them to the insurance company; the attraction for those who buy the policies is the relatively stable and tax-efficient returns on offer. Kleinwort is placing 15m shares and is offering a further 5m shares to the public. The issue price is 100p, with 50p payable on application and a further 50p payable in six months' time. The minimum subscription is for 1,000 shares. Last year, Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust was launched with a similar investment strategy. Its shares are trading at 114.5p, com-pared with a launch price of 100p. The new trust will primarily be buying policies which mature between 2005 and 2006, coinciding with the planned wind-up of the trust. The Friends Provident Ethical Investment Trust is seeking to raise over Pounds 30m. The trust will have a split capital structure, with zero dividend and ordinary shares. The zeros will pay no income but will have the first claim on the assets, and will offer a growth rate of about 8 per cent. The ordinary shares will receive all the dividend income of the trust and will pay an initial gross yield of 8 per cent. The shares will qualify for inclusion in a Personal Equity Plan. However, the ordinary shares will only be entitled to the assets of the trust when it is wound up in eight years, after the zeros have been repaid. Shares will be selected for the fund on both positive (eg backing companies which benefit the community) and negative (eg avoiding companies which deal in tobacco or arms) criteria. The shares will be payable in two instalments: 60p on application and a further 40p (for the ordinaries) and 43p (for the zeros) in February 1994. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL SITE TO BE GRADED AFTER 4 YEARS  DELAYS  </P> <P> The Montebello school board has decided to proceed with plans for a new  elementary and intermediate school after four years of delays caused by legal  wrangling and debates about safety at the 15-acre site in an industrial area in  southeast Commerce.  </P> <P> The board made its decision Thursday after an engineering firm said in a  preliminary report that soil at the site does no contain dangerous levels of  contaminants. Construction is contingent on voter approval of a state bond  issue in November, but the district still plans to grade the site and build  school annex of portable classrooms to house 600 to 900 students at Bell  Gardens High School.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Maintain a </F> Consensus, Push Forward the Development of Cross-Strait  Relations"]    [Text] My brothers,    The fourth round of working talks between the Association  for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Straits  Exchange Foundation [SEF] is to be held in Beijing late this  month. Much attention has been given to the talks on both sides  of the Taiwan Straits, because the goal is to reach a mutually  agreed- upon draft agreement, based on the consensus reached in  Beijing early last month between the persons-in-charge of ARATS  and SEF. These talks will play an important role of continuing  the process already begun and paving the way for future  development in pushing forward the growth of cross-strait ties.    Whether the task shouldered by the fourth round of working  talks can be smoothly carried out or not depends on the joint  efforts of both sides. What is pleasant and encouraging is that  both sides have given very high credence to the consensus  reached in the Tang [Shubei]-Chiao [Jen-ho] talks in Beijing in  early February, and both have taken an active and optimistic  attitude towards translating such views into an agreed-upon  text. Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of ARATS, observed  that in the February talks between Mr. Chiao Jen-ho and himself,  three issues existing in the working talks had been settled in  terms of overall direction, and the wording of a document had  been informally put forward by both sides. Both sides have the  willingness and confidence to fix, in the fourth talks, a draft  agreement on the three issues. Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the  board of SEF, commented that it was not easy to gain in five  days the achievements of the third round of talks held in early  February, proving the influence and importance of high-level  dialogue. Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of  SEF, hoped that the results of his talks with Tang Shubei would  cause a consensus to be reached as swiftly as possible in the  fourth round of working talks so that final preparation for  signing an agreement could be completed.    Admittedly, there will be difficulties in translating the  consensus achieved into the concrete articles of the agreement,  and disagreements do need to be overcome. However, with the  consensus reached last time as the basis, it is presumed those  problems will not be difficult to resolve. What needs to be  mentioned in particular is that the first point of the 5-point  consensus expressed in the joint press release is: "Both sides  hold that in the working talks between ARATS and SEF, political  issues should be avoided with an attitude of pragmatism." It is  an important sign that progress has been made in the working  talks between the two associations. People believe that as long  as both sides make joint efforts and maintain and keep to the  consensus, instead of damaging and diverging from the consensus,  they will be able to overcome disagreements and finalize the  drafting of the agreement articles.    In the first point of the five-point consensus of the joint  press release of the Tang-Chiao talks, it was stipulated that in  the fourth round of working talks -- to be held in late March --  opinions would be exchanged or discussions conducted on several  economic and scientific and technological issues cited in the  "Joint Agreement of the Wang-Koo Talks". An important  achievement of the Wang-Koo talks was that economic, scientific,  and technological topics should be included on the agenda of the  cross-strait working talks as soon as possible. Only because of  the Taiwan side was that important topic not fixed until the  February Tang-Chiao talks as one of the contents of the next  talks. Although the wording in this paragraph was determined  through modification just before the release of news of the  talks and therefore economic, scientific, and technological  topics were not formally included on the agenda, it does show,  all the same, that both sides have reached a certain degree of  consensus on this issue.    As a matter of fact, it is in the interest of the people on  both sides to strengthen cross-strait economic and trade  exchange and cooperation, whether in terms of the current  realities of the relationship between the two sides of the  Taiwan Straits, or in terms of looking into the vast prospects  of cross-strait economic and trade cooperation. In this  respect, we should not avoid general problems that await both  sides to settle through discussion and coordination, nor is it  proper to procrastinate. As authorized nongovernmental bodies,  ARATS and SEF should shoulder the task of promoting economic and  scientific and technological exchange and cooperation between  the two sides.    At this moment, it is very difficult to soften and  eliminate,  in a short period of time, political disagreements formed  because of the long-time estrangement between the two sides of  the Taiwan Straits. Yet complementary and mutually beneficial  economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two  sides can build closer cross-strait relations. The progress in  cross-strait relations in recent years demonstrates that among  nongovernmental contacts and exchanges between the two sides,  the most dynamic factor is economic and trade cooperation and  exchange, which not only plays a positive role in promoting the  economic prosperity of the two sides, but also promotes the  healthy, mutually driving development of cross-strait relations.  It can be said that, with the two sides having more common  economic interests, it will be beneficial in greatly increasing  the mutual trust and consensus between both sides.    The mainland side has made unceasing efforts to promote  economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two  sides of the straits. Not long ago, the Law of the People's  Republic of China on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan  Compatriots was examined and approved during the Sixth Session  of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's  Congress. The law provides the highest level and fullest legal  protection of investments in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots.  Its promulgation and execution will certainly promote  cross-strait economic and trade exchange and cooperation.  Meanwhile, it will create the favorable conditions for ARATS and  SEF to jointly discuss topics on cross-strait economic  cooperation.    May the fourth round of working talks between ARATS and SEF  be a complete success!    Sincerely,    [Signed] Bao Xin    [Dated] 13 March</p>

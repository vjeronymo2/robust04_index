			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israeli delegation to the Qatar arms control  talks has invited the neighboring countries participating in the  multilateral talks to send delegations to visit IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] bases and installations. Sources in the Israeli  delegation said that even if the invitation is declined, this  will not mean failure because the very fact that it was issued  constitutes a small step forward that is indicative of a change  in atmosphere.    Our correspondent in Qatar Karmela Menashe reports that the  Israeli delegation is meeting with delegations from Arab states  concurrently with the plenum sessions. Sources in the Israeli  delegation said that progress has been made in the discussions  of the committee on arms control.    The atmosphere in the meetings outside the plenum hall is  relaxed. In all the sessions, all the participants are  addressing the issue of Israel's nonconventional weapons arsenal.    The Qatari foreign minister will leave for Cairo tomorrow to  attend the signing ceremony of the agreement between the PLO and  Israel.</p>

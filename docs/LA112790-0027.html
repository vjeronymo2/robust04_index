			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: IF IT'S A TYPICAL FRIDAY, IT MUST BE FIGHT NIGHT  </P> <P> I just figured out that if my marriage can survive Friday nights, it can  survive anything. That's the night my husband and I have all the togetherness  of Texas Gov. Ann Richards and Clayton Williams on a blind date.  </P> <P> After dinner, I retire to the living room where I watch an evening of sitcoms  and movies. My spouse, the news junkie, turns on the TV set in the kitchen and  watches a verbal SWAT team led by John McLaughlin.  </P> <P> From time to time I hear my husband laugh and pound his fist on the table, but  for all purposes, we are in separate worlds. "The McLaughlin Group" has to be  the thinking man's answer to mud wrestling. Surrounded by four cowboys who  gallop their way through political issues, McLaughlin reminds me of a  gunslinger in a saloon who fires at their feet and orders them to dance.  </P> <P> So what does it matter if a married couple have different tastes in television?  Well, how would you feel if your husband crept up behind you and shouted in  your ear, "Bombeck! Bush shows Bo Derek around the White House. Will it help or  hinder his popularity?"  </P> <P> "Uhhh, I don't know."  </P> <P> "An answer!"  </P> <P> "It would help, I guess."  </P> <P> "Wrong!" he snaps. "Are you suggesting the President has nothing better to do?  What kind of a pinko Commie answer is that!  </P> <P> "OK, then, it would hinder."  </P> <P> "On a scale of one to 10."  </P> <P> "What a question," I said. "Bo Derek is a 10."  </P> <P> "Not Bo Derek, you fool! The state of the presidency."  </P> <P> My husband says John McLaughlin is a former Jesuit priest. Right. And Robert  Novak left the show to become a maitre d' at the House of Pancakes. Can't you  see McLaughlin hearing confessions on a Saturday afternoon? "What do you mean  it's been three months since your last confession? Are you asking me to believe  you've been lily-white with no impure thoughts for three solid months? You  sound like a guy named Buchanan I just had in here. You know what I think? I  think you just don't have the guts to admit you made a mistake."  </P> <P> The other night my husband wandered onto my turf and asked, "What are you  watching?" I looked up from my TV set and said, "It's a series called 'Over My  Dead Body.' "  </P> <P> "How can you stand all that violence?" he said.  </P> <P> I don't believe he said that.  </P></p>

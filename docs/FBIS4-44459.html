			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liaoning Provincial Social Sciences Academy, </F> Economic Research Institute Director Li Xiangping (2621 0686  1627): "Liaoning and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia:  Opportunities and Policy Recommendations"]    [Text] Today, the world economy is undergoing readjustments  and regionalization of the international economy is beginning to  take shape; in Northeast Asia, international cooperation, though  starting later than elsewhere, is beginning to accelerate. This  is particularly so in Japan which, in trying to reduce the  economic burden of slow growth in some sectors of the country's  main economic axis (a zone of heavy concentration of industries  linking nine urban centers such as Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka), is  urgently seeking international cooperation with countries  contiguous to the Japan Sea to develop a second axis in the area  north of Kyoto and the coastal area along the Japan Sea.  Concerned local governments in Japan are making new plans for  industries in this area by constructing basic infrastructure  facilities, establishing free ports and taking a series of  initiatives to engage neighboring countries in direct  discussions over cooperation in relevant areas. Japan's actions  fall right in step with developmental needs of other Northeast  Asian countries. Both the Republic of Korea, which seeks to  develop the area bordering the Tonghae (Korean name for the  Japan Sea) and to speed up the changing and upgrading of its  industrial structure, and Russia, which desires to develop the  rich natural resources of its Far East region, need access to  markets and new production facilities of neighboring areas in  Northeast Asia. Analysis suggests that from the 1980s to the  early part of the next century, China's development has seen  three stages of growth, beginning in the south and moving  northward, which will in term spur economic development in the  country as a whole. The first growth stage started with  Guangdong which, relying on its special geographic relationship  with Hong Kong, formed and built up the south China economic  zone, and achieved the benefits of reform, opening up and  development not shared by other provinces, setting in motion the  waves of industrial revolution during the 10 years of reform in  China. From the 1990s onward, the Central Government has begun  to favor the Shanghai-Pudong area, granting favorable conditions  for its economic renewal, restructuring and development,  enabling Shanghai to use its substantial economic strength and  position to help the country's internal and external  developments, and using this the second stage of growth to spur  continued development of the national economy. By the beginning  of the new century, the central government will turn its  attention to areas bordering the Bohai Sea and the old  industrial base such as Liaoning and elsewhere; at that time,  Liaoning can look forward to relying on international  cooperation in Northeast Asia to complete its substantive  renewal, and benefiting from the third stage of growth which  will bring China to becoming a mid-grade developed country.    Summarizing the above, it can be said that the Northeast  Asia  economic area is based on developmental needs of the area and  relevant countries themselves, and the combined economic  benefits to all can sweep away any noneconomic obstacles and  open up a new era in the Northeast Asian economic area.    Within the Northeast Asia economic area, Liaoning is  situated  at the hub of both the transportation network and the  circulation of goods. Viewed in terms of transportation, the  main channel linking the coastal areas of Northeast Asia and  China's interior is the rail trunk line of  Fugang-Dalien-Shenyang-Jiningxian-Russia's Siberia; another fast  and convenient channel conceivably available at some future  point runs from Japan through an undersea tunnel to Pusan, on  to Seoul, Pyongyang, Shenyang and points north. Other channels,  such as the Xinxie-Tumen-Manzhouli-Chita line which, limited by  the present small quantities of goods circulated, is not likely  to become a main trunk line linking sea-land transportation in  Northeast Asia within this century. Transportation routes often  lead to economic development. Liaoning, using its advantageous  position in the transportation network, can look forward to  becoming an important wing in the main axis of the Northeast  Asia economic area. In terms of division of labor and  circulation of goods, although Liaoning's level of development  is lower than that of comparable areas in Japan and South Korea,  Liaoning is not substantially behind in terms of its industrial  stage of development. The area north of Japan's Kyoto and along  the Sea of Japan coast was the base of Japan's traditional  industries including the heavy chemical industries, and not  Japan's [modern] industrially developed area, and the difference  vis-a-vis Liaoning is not as great as people may imagine.  Therefore, Liaoning, South Korea and Japan's coastal areas are  comparable and together constitute the developed and relatively  developed areas of the Northeast Asia region. From the central  part of Liaoning, north and westward to Russia's Far East  hinterland, to eastern Mongolia, Northeast Inner Mongolia and to  northern Jiangxi and Fujian, this is a large area making up the  hinterland of the NE Asia economic area which is next to be  developed. Because Liaoning's middle-grade technology can link  up with economies of the above-mentioned developed and  developing areas, Liaoning stands to gain given its advantageous  position as these areas begin to open up to the outside world.  Unquestionably, the day when this possibility is realized will  be the time that Liaoning's old industrial base will be  revitalized.    Therefore, Liaoning should look ahead to the future and, to  carry out concrete initiatives to promote the Northeast Asia  economic area, consider adopting new policies in the following  areas:    First, determine a positive international market strategy,  and direct the policy of opening toward the Northeast Asia  region. This is not to suggest that we change the basic policy  of opening to the outside, but following the principle of  gaining benefits for both sides, we should select markets with  the most potentials and gradually develop a stable international  division of labor by adjusting the enterprise structure on a  reciprocally beneficial basis. In moving toward this direction,  we should carry out suitable preferential policies to promote  and advance cooperation.    Second, base the policy of developing an industrial policy  to  promote change and upgrading the industrial structure through  opening to the outside. With a new structure, we advance to the  level of the developed zone within the Northeast Asia region. In  Japan, coastal areas in northern Kyushu are positively promoting  industrial structural readjustment, seeking to move the  traditional heavy chemical industries to the China mainland,  keeping in Japan the advanced, high-tech components of these  industries and vigorously developing a new high-tech industrial  strategy. From the standpoint of resources, Liaoning no longer  has any advantage to develop traditional heavy chemical  industries, and if more investments were drawn to such  industries, it will only exacerbate the limitations on  development of such industries and cause them to be mired in  even grater difficulties. Liaoning should adopt an industrial  policy similar to that of Northern Kyushu in Japan, by  dispersing the first-stage of production of heavy industries and  moving it to the interior, by vigorously developing the advanced  and high-tech components of these industries and, at the same  time, positively developing [other] new high-tech industries.  Therefore, Liaoning should adopt even more favorable  preferential policies to attract foreign investment in new  high-tech industries, strengthen further the coastal area new  high-tech zones and the building of basic infrastructure  facilities, and compete with other similar areas in Japan and  South Korea for investment in new, high-tech industries by  offering an even more advantageous investment environment.    Third, promote policy coordination and direct dialogue with  various local governments in the Northeast Asia region. Planning  officials of relevant local governments in Japan have pointed  out that international cooperation in the region should have the  special characteristic of direct cooperation between neighboring  countries in the area, and called upon various local governments  to enter into direct contact and negotiations for construction  of infrastructure facilities along the coastal areas. Government  departments on our side should respond positively to such  suggestions which create a policy environment conducive to  cooperation.    Fourth, establish a repository of information and reference  sources on Northeast Asia international cooperation. To begin  with, we should devote effort to foster cooperation and pooling  of knowledge capital among the societies in Northeast Asia. It  is the intellectual and scholarly circles that suggested and  actively promoted the concept of cooperation in the Northeast  Asia region. Intellectuals and scholars are the most important  asset in the information age -- they are society's knowledge  capital, and will be of pivotal importance in the development of  the future Northeast Asia economic area. To meet today's demands  against a background of international cooperation in Northeast  Asia, we should also promote scholarly exchanges in our own  area, take greater initiatives to support scholars and  intellectuals in building information and reference repositories  to strengthen the atmosphere for international cooperation in  Northeast Asia, stimulate new thinking on cooperation, and  provide direct informational and intellectual support to bring  about such cooperation.</p>

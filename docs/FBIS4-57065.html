			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been officially announced in Pretoria that  South African President Nelson Mandela made one of his first  foreign policy decisions today, establishing diplomatic  relations with Cuba.    Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina  and  Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in  relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments  had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government  and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of  apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela,  leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the  relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for  years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the  government level.    During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been  moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations  between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's  internationalist position against the policy of apartheid  against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia,  and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now  a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection  toward Cuba.    Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will  conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa,  a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson  Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left  behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now.    At the signing of the new document regarding diplomatic  relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was accompanied by  Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador to Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon,  minister of Science, Technology, and Environment; and (Marcos  Rodriguez), who will represent our country in Pretoria  temporarily.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Adia deficit widens ADIA, the troubled Swiss temporary employment group which yesterday sold off its inspectorate subsidiary to a UK-financed consortium, reported a SFr60.2m (Dollars 48.50m) net loss in the first half, compared with a SFr5.7m loss for the same period last year. Control of Adia, formerly part of the collapsed Omni conglomerate led by Mr Werner K. Rey, was sold last year to the German retail group ASKO and Mr Klaus Jacobs. The two, who together hold 56.1 per cent of the shares, have agreed to make a subordinated loan of SFr200m at 5 per cent to the group to improve its overall financial position. The group is considering a capital increase next year when the loan would be partially or fully converted into equity. It is negotiating a SFr400m credit facility with its bank syndicate. Revenues from the core personnel services activities rose 3.6 per cent in the first half to SFr1.6bn, but its net loss widened to SFr41.8m from a loss of SFr3.7m, especially due to high restructuring costs in France. The non-core businesses suffered a loss of SFr18.4m in the first half, against a SFr2m loss. Thanks to disposals, net debts stood at SFr1.1bn, compared with SFr1.3bn last year. Adia said it did not expect to return to profit in the second half, 'but measures taken in the difficult markets as well as the favourable development of the other markets will produce better results'.</p>

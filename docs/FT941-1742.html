			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US secures Gatt waiver over China The US yesterday won a change in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules allowing it to refuse Gatt benefits to China even if Beijing succeeds in rejoining the world trade body this year. US trade officials have indicated that Washington might seek this opt-out if the Clinton administration decides in June not to renew China's most favoured nation status in the US market because of Beijing's poor human rights record. The MFN rule, which forbids discrimination between trading partners, is one of Gatt's fundamental tenets. At yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US secured formal approval from other nations for a reinterpretation of the 'non-application' rule. This provision, rarely invoked, allows any individual Gatt member to refuse to apply the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to an incoming member (and vice versa). However, the present rule stipulates that the two countries must not have begun tariff negotiations with each other, an integral part of the bargaining process on Gatt entry terms. The new interpretation, effective immediately, will allow 'non-application' even after tariff negotiations have been started. This effectively applies to Gatt the redrafted 'non-application' rule of the new World Trade Organisation, due to come into force next year. The change means that the US could lift its effective block on China's rapid entry into Gatt, and begin the necessary bilateral tariff bargaining with Beijing, without prejudice to this year's decision on MFN. China is anxious to become a Gatt member by the end of the year in order to qualify as an original member of the WTO. At a meeting last week of Gatt's negotiating group on Chinese entry terms, trading partners agreed to try to accelerate the seven-year-old talks but the US has so far refused to commit itself to an early deadline. The possibility of allowing China to join Gatt, while reserving the right of 'non-application', could help the US administration in its search for a long-term way out of the damaging annual MFN debate over Chinese trade and human rights. If the US decides not to invoke the 'non-application' provision at the outset, or later revokes it, it cannot under WTO rules reinstate it again. Yesterday's council meeting also saw strong criticism of the US decision to reinstate Super 301 provisions for unilateral trade action. In addition, the council decided: to set up a working party to draft membership terms for Estonia, which brings the number of countries negotiating Gatt entry to 22; to set up a working party to examine whether the North American Free Trade Agreement is consistent with Gatt rules; to postpone substantive discussion of a Gatt disputes panel report condemning EU restrictions on imports of Latin American bananas. Negotiations between the EU and the affected producers are continuing. Separately, trade officials expressed confidence yesterday that all 81 Uruguay Round tariff schedules would be cleared by trading partners as final and correct by tomorrow's deadline.</p>

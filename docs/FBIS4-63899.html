			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arkadiy Pasechnik report from Chisinau: "If You Want To </F> Live, Learn To Shoot"]    [Text] The Moldovan parliament has adopted at its first  reading the Law On Control over Individual Weapons, or more  simply, on the right to own such weapons.    This development, as should have been expected, has drawn a  mixed reaction in the republic. Some people welcome the  decision, but most citizens are worried, expecting a new, this  time even more dangerous surge in crime rates. These worries  are far from groundless. According to the Moldovan Internal  Affairs Ministry, this year alone the number of crimes involving  firearms has almost trebled against 1993. Specialists think  that lots of the weapons involved are still kept from the armed  conflict on the Dniester in the summer of 1992. Plus, of  course, what has been obtained recently on the side by criminal  gangs that clash in increasingly frequent bloody showdowns.    So, an ordinary person also needs the chance to defend  himself, runs the argument taken up by those favoring the open  sale of weapons. Yes he does, the law's opponents counter, but  such weapons will be too expensive for the ordinary person for a  long time to come. Look, a citizen does not have enough money  even to pay for his apartment. As a result, the right to armed  defense could become an exclusive privilege of the rich.    Most important, as readers point out in the local press very  frequently, the adoption of such a law will mean that the state  recognizes its impotence in ensuring the security of its own  citizens.</p>

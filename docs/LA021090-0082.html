			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALL 3 RAIL PLANS RECOMMENDED IN PLANNERS' REPORT;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: THE FINDINGS ARE INDICATIVE OF INTENSE LOBBYING FOR AND AGAINST THE  PLANS. THE COUNTY WILL CHOOSE ONE OF THE OPTIONS, POSSIBLY AS SOON AS FEB. 28.  </P> <P> Unwilling to choose from among three rival San Fernando Valley rail plans, mass  transit planners on Friday gave their recommendation to all three, setting the  stage for a decisive battle in the coming weeks.  </P> <P> The recommended plans are an extension of the Metro Rail subway from North  Hollywood to the San Diego Freeway, a light-rail line in a shallow trench from  North Hollywood to Warner Center and an elevated rail line along the Ventura  Freeway from Universal City to Warner Center.  </P> <P> The long-awaited report by professional rail planners now goes to the Los  Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is scheduled to choose one of  the options, possibly as early as Feb. 28.  </P> <P> The commission's staff recommendations show the effects of intensive lobbying  in recent weeks by elected officials on behalf of two of the plans.  </P> <P> The freeway elevated line and the Metro Rail extension, both of which have  prominent advocates and well-organized opponents, have been altered in recent  weeks to make them less expensive and easier to build.  </P> <P> The 11-member commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines,  has given no clear signal on how it might vote on the competing plans.  </P> <P> Complicating the picture is the fact that in addition to the dueling Valley  plans, the commission has pitted the Valley against two other areas for the  next rail line, which planners say will be the last to be built locally in this  century.  </P> <P> In competition with the Valley are proposed light-rail lines from El Segundo to  Marina del Rey and from downtown Los Angeles through northeast Los Angeles to  Pasadena, both of which have strong political backing on the commission.  </P> <P> In addition, county supervisors on Tuesday placed the three Valley rail  alternatives recommended in the staff report Friday on the June 5 ballot, a  move that could further complicate the route-selection process.  </P> <P> The Valley proposal with the greatest support is the 5.6-mile extension of the  downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway to the San Diego Freeway along  the Southern Pacific freight right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory  boulevards.  </P> <P> The route traverses numerous residential neighborhoods and has ignited fierce  opposition from homeowner groups.  </P> <P> However, the subway extension, proposed last May by state Sen. Alan Robbins  (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, has brought together  warring homeowners and business leaders.  </P> <P> Business leaders gave up their drive for a line that would reach all the way to  Warner Center. In exchange, many, but not all, homeowner leaders dropped their  firm opposition to any line that intrudes in single-family areas.  </P> <P> Robbins said Friday that he remains "confident that it is the only plan that  will work."  </P> <P> He acknowledged having a hand in key changes in the subway plan that pruned  $200 million from the $1.3-billion cost estimate the staff presented at public  hearings in December.  </P> <P> He said the cost savings were achieved by halting the line at the San Diego  Freeway rather than Balboa Boulevard, moving the North Hollywood station from  Chandler and Lankershim boulevards to Chandler and Tujunga Avenue and  eliminating a proposed rail maintenance yard in the Valley.  </P> <P> Commission sources said that while Robbins and other subway advocates were  massaging their proposal in recent weeks, Supervisor Mike Antonovich also was  reshaping his rival plan for an elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> Efforts by the supervisor, who contends that only a futuristic monorail system  will lure motorists from their cars, have reduced the estimated cost of a  16.5-mile line spanning the Valley by about $300 million from the $2.1-billion  cost projected in December.  </P> <P> County public works planners, acting at Antonovich's behest, recently secured  an important concession from the state Department of Transportation that would  allow pillars supporting an elevated line to be placed between on- and  off-ramps and the freeway lanes, sources said.  </P> <P> According to commission executive director Neil Peterson, that change in  alignment reduces to 20 the number of houses to be demolished for a freeway  rail line. Previous estimates ranged from 200 to 500 houses.  </P> <P> Also contributing to the lowered cost estimate was acceptance by the commission  staff of a proposal that parking lots could be built on the north side of the  freeway with rail passengers walking under the freeway lanes to board trains.  </P> <P> Caltrans has insisted that the north shoulder of the freeway be left available  for a possible upper deck, which is under study.  </P> <P> The third alternative -- light rail in a shallow trench along the Southern  Pacific right of way -- has been a staff favorite throughout the three-year  study of Valley rail alternatives.  </P> <P> Such a light-rail system could be built from North Hollywood to Warner Center  for $1.1 billion, the report states.  </P> <P> While that plan initially enjoyed strong support among business groups, most  such advocates abandoned it in favor of the Robbins-Braude subway plan.  </P> <P> Robert H. Silver, a leader of the North Hollywood-based Eastern Sector Transit  Coalition, said Friday that his group, which never endorsed the Robbins-Braude  plan, was organizing to make a strong showing against both plans that use the  Southern Pacific right of way.  </P> <P> "We expect hundreds to attend to argue that neither plan is acceptable," he  said. "We don't trust the commission. They will get the route established, then  because of financial considerations the plan will be modified to surface rail."  </P> <P> The staff report will first be aired at 9 a.m. Wednesday at a meeting in Los  Angeles of the commission's five-member Transit Committee.  </P> <P> The committee is expected to make a recommendation to the full commission,  which meets Feb. 28.  </P></p>

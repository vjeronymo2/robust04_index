			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: Much ventured, a fairly small amount gained: A mixed mini-season of mini-operas As they say, 'Nothing ventured ..'; but for all the good intentions of the Garden Venture, it is doubtful just what the gains amount to in hard operatic currency. This is its third mini-season of commissioned mini-operas, three in each of two alternating programmes at the Riverside Studios. With generally high standards of singing, direction and design, and polished accompaniment by the Endymion Ensemble, every piece got a good run for its money. Yet only one 'opera' in each programme, by my reckoning, scored a plausible success in its own terms. A third was dry and neat, but slight - one felt no inclination to hear it again; two others were hobbled by operatic miscalculations, and the sixth was ridiculous. For so much devoted and costly labour, that seemed a meagre result. What principles guide the Venture's commissions? (There is an evident bias toward 'fringe' music, some way outside the tougher centre.) Once commissioned, are the composers left fancy-free to pursue duff ideas? Of the four also-ran entries, none would imaginably command anything more than a small, specialised audience: did anybody think that mattered? Brief reports, in descending order of admiration: - Edward Kemp supplied the tall tale (funny, touching, at once down-to-earth and visionary) for Geoff Westley's Travels in the Arctic Circle, about a disillusioned man who decides to abandon everything and walk alone to the North Pole. Westley's flamboyantly lush piano-and-strings score, unabashed '30s English-Romantic with Hollywood echoes, feigns total ignorance of any musical development since then. But it is also expertly paced and varied, sets the words impeccably, presses the right expressive buttons in all the right places and was hugely lucky in Gwion Thomas as its protagonist - bluff and subtle, with the charisma of a bemused, chastened Bruce Willis. As Travels was the saving hit of Programme A, so was The Wheel in Programme B. Felicity Hayes-McCoy's libretto, a caprice about macho hero-figures in far-flung cultures, might have seemed too precious, had not the Bolivian composer Agustn Fernandez found so much lithe muscle for it. With prominent accordion and guitar, the music is springy, pungent and original within an unmistakably Latin-American idiom, for all its artful ethnic borrowings. Wilfred Judd's whole production gleamed: bright costumes and props by Claudia Mayer, virtuoso lighting by Ace McCarron, the vital 'movement' (fights, struts, poses) devised by Amanda Demetriou - no doubt Stephen Austin's lusty, stupid Hero owed his Toshiro Mifune airs to her. Fiona Rose's eternal object-of-heroic-desire was knowing, seductive and delectably sung; in their multiple roles Martin Lindsay and Jonathan Peter Kenny were just as clever. Graham Fitkin chose to make a minimal operatic sketch of Paul Auster's novella Ghosts (librettised by Walter Donohue), in which White hires Blue, a low-budget private eye, to keep perpetual, pointless watch on Black. The denouement falls somewhere between Kafka and O Henry. Nearly all Auster's sedulously flat urban detail is stripped away, leaving only an abstract fable which Fitkin has set in a jaunty post-minimalist vein - like very dilute Michael Torke. It just about works. In Four Figures with Harlequin, the composer-librettist Errolyn Wallen adds amiable, pop-oriented music to what the programme-book told us was 'a journey into the theatre of the subconscious where a lost boy searches to be born'. There was a boy, not a foetus but a stock pre-adolescent, and three other stereotypes: a self-absorbed Mother, a spoken Politician ('I am a Man of the State') and a raddled Fellini monstress. Though their words were clear enough, the dramatic sense remained opaque, the music catch-as-catch-can and exiguous. In Geoffrey Alvarez's The European Story, we lost too much of Ruth Fainlight's poetic text ('a young woman writer confronts the archetypes of European consciousness') to overlapping voices to discover what it was meant to be about, though timeless folktale themes surfaced en passant. Musically, the Alvarez score was drawn tauter than most of the others here; but just on that account, its impact was too contrived to suggest the intended depth of feeling. Luke Stoneham's Arms for the Maid exposed a Russian counter-tenor (Slava Kagan-Paley, brilliantly flexible) in a corn-silk wig and little else as Joan of Arc: warbling away in endless melismata, arms writhing like Rider Haggard's 'She' at the point of immolation. He/She was attended by vamping maidens a la Theda Bara (Kate Flowers and Jeannie Marsh did their melodious best, as also in The European Story). At bottom Stoneham's score is quite austere (mostly chaconne-like, upon a stern tonal basis), and insofar as Karen Whiteson's text was discernible it sounded like plain historical narrative. For all that one could tell, the ultra-camp but ill-focused Bailey production appeared to be her own, ludicrously tacky idea.

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER, WHITTIER TO SPLIT $2.4 MILLION IN EXTRA SHOPPING CENTER COSTS  </P> <P> City officials have agreed with a developer to split about $2.4 million in  unplanned costs of the proposed Whittier Station Center, a much-debated  shopping center opposed by historic preservationists, American Indians and  enraged motorists.  </P> <P> The agreement eliminates the reason for a potentially costly lawsuit filed last  month by the Encino-based developer Urbatec against the city.  </P> <P> In the lawsuit, Urbatec had accused the city of violating its agreement to  provide the developer with the 16-acre triangle of land northwest of the city  center.  </P> <P> City officials, in turn, said the developer is responsible for delays that  increased the city's costs by about $2.4 million. City officials said the costs  for land the city bought and for the overall project increased by the time  Urbatec provided the $12.5 million that had been agreed on. The city also  underestimated the cost of relocating businesses from the site.  </P> <P> The agreement, approved by the City Council last week, gives both sides what  they want most. Urbatec gets the go-ahead to take possession of the land by  Nov. 1 to begin construction well before year's end.  </P> <P> The city lightened its financial burden for a project that proved more  expensive than anticipated. The developer will foot the costs of putting  utility lines underground and relocating storm drains. In addition, Urbatec  will contribute about $1.2 million for the city's unexpected costs.  </P> <P> The developer was not legally obliged to pay more merely because the city had  underestimated how much the project would cost, company attorney Mark S. Novak  said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, city officials presented the company with a choice, Novak said.  "Do you want the project or do you want a lawsuit?"  </P> <P> Urbatec chose the project, Novak said.  </P> <P> Varied citizens groups would have preferred otherwise. Preservationists have  opposed the shopping center because it would displace a 100-year-old train  depot.  </P> <P> City officials agreed to save the depot by moving it to an empty lot about a  quarter-mile away, but the move could permanently strip the depot of its status  as a national historic landmark.  </P> <P> A group of local Indians also sought to stop the project. They say an Indian  burial ground is at the site. The city has invited an archeological firm to bid  on a study of the area.  </P> <P> Should a burial ground be found, which city officials say is unlikely, the  project could be further delayed.  </P> <P> Finally, local motorists were enraged to learn recently that the development  would result in a permanent closing of Magnolia Avenue between Whittier  Boulevard and Hadley Street.  </P> <P> About 130 people crowded into Tuesday's public City Council hearing on closing  the street. The comments ran more than 3 to 1 against the idea before the  council approved the closing, 3 to 2.  </P> <P> Abandoning that section of road will effectively eliminate a popular  north-south shortcut between Beverly and Whittier boulevards. Leaving Magnolia  alone, however, would have nullified Urbatec's city-approved design.  </P> <P> At the hearing, speakers complained of the timing. "Why is this hearing being  held now, rather than a year and a half ago, or two years ago, or three years  ago?" resident Charles Hanson asked.  </P></p>

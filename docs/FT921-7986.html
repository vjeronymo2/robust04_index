			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (2): Challenge of competition reaches the public sector - Government and the Marketplace IT HAS been dubbed a 'British disease' but there are signs that a cure is finally on the way. For most of the post-war period, central and local government in Britain successfully resisted the idea of relinquishing any hold on their extensive responsibilities and handing over elements of the job to the disciplines of the competitive marketplace. It was a national trait which, in the opinion of such critics as Mr Michael Ivens, director of Aims of Industry, the right-wing pressure group, spawned costs and inefficiencies on a scale which could no longer be tolerated in a modern economy. According to a paper written by Mr Ivens and published last month by the Centre for Policy Studies, the passion shown by public bodies in Britain for 'doing it themselves' has proved unique in the capitalist world. But public services, he says, have finally had to admit they must learn from private business and can no longer resist the tide of events. He suggests, for example, that if competition were extended to all general non-medical services in the National Health Service, annual savings could reach Pounds 500m. With schools now also able to seek grant-maintained status, handing them responsibility for most of their own budgets, there is potential for education to follow the same route. Others want to go further still. The issue of introducing the rigours of the free market into the public sector has traditionally provoked an intense political debate which only now appears, gradually, to be giving way to a broader consensus. The era of the citizen's charter has arrived and the major political parties are laying at least as much emphasis on a fair deal for the consumers of public services as on the fate of those who have traditionally provided them. Recently, Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised a comprehensive plan for buying outside skills into public service. He said he was determined to ensure 'there was no hiding place from the challenge of competition for the sloppy or second-rate'. Labour, whose own charter proposals include binding 'customer contracts', claims that the local councils it controls, far from representing the worst models of local authority management, are now among the most efficient. It accepts the role of private sector contractors, though it questions their ability to provide high quality services and has threatened to remove the compulsory element to the tendering process. But while the political debate continues, the actual process of opening up is well under way. Over the past 10 years, competitive tendering has created a management revolution in local government, with a range of services having to go out to tender at regular intervals. Though the majority of contracts is still awarded to council workforces, managers have found the threat of contracting-out a powerful argument for improving the efficiency of services. Last year, the government acted to reinforce moves towards contracting out in local government, publishing a consultation paper on improving arrangements for competitive tendering and for extending the process to some white collar services. Competitive tendering has also been introduced in all central government departments for services such as cleaning, laundry, maintenance, catering and security, where total spending is around Pounds 250m a year. Savings are put at more than 10 per cent. Until now, however, Whitehall itself has been notable for its failure to subject itself to the competitive regime which it has imposed on local government. Ministers have looked primarily to the Next Steps programme of executive agencies to deliver improved central government services, but critics see the move as an essentially managerial initiative which still shields civil servants from market pressures. Mr Graham Mather, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, says that while Next Steps has improved the management of the civil service, it has nevertheless protected Whitehall from the challenges and disciplines of competitive tendering which have applied in local government for several years. Mr Mather, one of the advocates of 'government by contract', has gone as far as to suggest that a civil service of 500,000 people could be cut to as few as 10,000, their responsibilities confined to the narrow Whitehall tasks of assisting ministers and supervising the awarding and enforcement of contracts for the remainder of all civil service functions. Even if his views are unlikely to be implemented fully, a new government initiative means that Whitehall is in for a shake-up. At the end of last year, the government published a white paper entitled 'Competing for Quality', intended to increase competition and, hence efficiency, within the civil service. It proposes the appointment of management consultants to government departments to help identify opportunities for putting more work out to competitive tender. Beyond the traditional support services which have so far been contracted out, new areas to be considered include: professional and specialist services like accounting and auditing, clerical operations, office services such as records storage and messengers and estate and construction services. A public competition and purchasing unit will be set up in the Treasury to help tenderers with applications. Though the proposals may meet the same sort of resistance within Whitehall which greeted earlier competitive initiatives directed at the country's town halls, there seems no doubt that a huge, additional customer base is slowly opening up to those businesses who can provide services on a contracted basis. Organisations like P&amp;O Total Facilities Management, the business support services company, have been quick to capitalise on the potential within the public sector. P&amp;O is negotiating, for example, with West Berkshire Health Authority to take over some of its non-core services. A contract worth over Pounds 6m could lead to annual savings in excess of Pounds 500,000. Mr Robin Booker, managing director, believes the opportunities for support services in the public sector are 'enormous' and says the culture which dictates the provision of public services is undergoing a revolution. He expects the sector to become increasingly competitive as more providers enter the marketplace. Mr David Hepworth, marketing director of BET, the business services conglomerate, reckons the public sector will represent a market at least as big as that available in the private corporate sector: 'We have been up against long- standing custom and practice which has refused to acknowledge there are better ways of doing things. 'But those attitudes are now shifting throughout the public sector as increasing numbers of clients, always under pressure to stretch resources to the limit, begin to see how much further their money can go if they bring in the private sector'.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: MIM Holdings slips into red after charge Heavy abnormal charges and a ADollars 19.3m (USDollars 13.8m) foreign exchange loss related to its Canadian holding company caused MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, to post a ADollars 61.4m loss after tax in the first nine months of the current financial year. The loss compared with a ADollars 70.8m profit in the same period of 1992-93. In the first six months of 1993-94, MIM had reported a net loss of ADollars 18.5m. At the operating level, MIM made a ADollars 60.2m profit, with sales standing at ADollars 1.7bn. The profits figure was well below the ADollars 140m recorded in the previous year, and MIM said average base metal prices for the 40-week period remained 'significantly lower' than a year ago, in spite of a pick-up in the third quarter. According to MIM, the average copper price, in Australian dollars, was down 19 per cent, lead down 12 per cent, and zinc down 13 per cent. Gold was up by 11 per cent, and silver by 31 per cent. Coal prices in the first 40 weeks were 9 per cent lower than in the comparable period of 1992-93. The damage to the third quarter results came from a ADollars 42.2m abnormal charge. This was made up of a ADollars 25m general provision for the loss in the value of investments, a ADollars 2.3m net loss on the partial disposal of Canadian and German investments, and the previously-announced ADollars 17.8m loss of the German joint venture smelting operations.</p>

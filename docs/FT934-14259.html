			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Absurd to hold banks responsible Sir, You reported that Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, is to tell leading banks that the government believes they have financial responsibility when lending monies to companies that pollute the environment ('Banks face liability for pollution', October 13). This seems absurd, unethical, and inequitable. How can the lender be held responsible if he has no control over the purpose for which the asset is used. He may have financed it, but the lender is no more than a supplier to the customer of money and financial services. So why not hold accountable those others who have supplied resources, like the utilities for power and telecommunication, for example? The assumption of responsibility appears too obscure to be maintained, and I guess the purpose is to effect some form of tax from the private sector. If so, the authorities should come clean and say so. J C Munnery, Eyeswell Villa, 8 Gaol Butts, Eccleshall, Staffordshire</p>

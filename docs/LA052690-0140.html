			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP BUCKS ANTI-ABORTION TREND;  </P> <P> ISSUES: WEAKLAND IN MILWAUKEE CRITICIZES TACTICS OF MANY IN THE MOVEMENT. THERE  ARE NO SIMPLE ANSWERS TO THE CONCERNS OF WOMEN, HE SAYS.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Archbishop Rembert Weakland, bucking the trend toward increasing  confrontation in fighting legalized abortion, has issued a statement that  criticizes many in the anti-abortion movement as narrow and lacking compassion  and urges the church to spend more time listening to the concerns of women  about the root causes of abortion.  </P> <P> The 21-page statement is the archbishop's response to a series of six  "listening sessions" held with women around the Milwaukee Archdiocese earlier  this year. The sessions fulfilled a promise he made in November when the U.S.  bishops agreed to make the abortion issue a top priority. At the time,  Weakland, long a spokesmen for women's concerns, promised to go back to his  archdiocese and consult women on the matter.  </P> <P> Weakland not only takes issue with anti-abortion tactics but also advocates  that the church "allow to our politicians as much latitude as reason permits."  </P> <P> In a number of places, the statement mentions the consistent life ethic, a  concept that would place abortion amid a whole range of human life issues --  including poverty, hunger, education and abuse of children and women -- some of  which have a direct bearing on women's decisions to have abortions.  </P> <P> While not veering from the church's ban on abortion in most circumstances, the  archbishop pointed out that the teaching "does not have the full support of  many Catholics, especially of many women, because it seems to be too simplistic  an answer to a complicated and emotional question."  </P> <P> The statement's toughest language is aimed at elements of the anti-abortion  movement and fundamentalist groups, which Weakland sees as heavily influencing  some in the movement.  </P> <P> "Many dislike the narrowness of so many in the pro-life movement, their  tactics, their non-acceptance of the consistent life ethic approach, their lack  of compassion, their alliances with groups that often are very anti-Catholic in  other areas, their lack of civility and so on," he says. Consequently, he adds,  many women and priests are being driven away from the movement.  </P> <P> "Many priests, moreover, feel uncomfortable with some of the political and  other aggressive activities of the pro-life movement. Some of the rhetoric and  literature seem ugly and demeaning."  </P> <P> Weakland also wrote that he was "surprised and disturbed by the strong  influence of fundamentalist positions" on the anti-abortion movement. "I say  disturbed because they did not seem to know the Catholic approach to Scripture  and fell into proof-texting in ways that are not our tradition. I will have to  talk much with the priests and other pastoral ministers in the diocese about  this unwholesome influence and what it means. It might also account for some of  the narrowness of vision on the part of some of the pro-life people one meets."  </P> <P> At the same time, the statement criticizes the abortion rights movement's  advocacy of " 'rights' over one's body or 'rights to an abortion.' "  </P> <P> "The church has never accepted this point of view, namely, that one has control  over one's body to do with it what one wants," the statement says. "The body is  not a mannequin nor a machine. Cutting off any part of the body just to show  that one has control over this 'machine' is contrary to the whole approach our  faith takes to the body as integral to the identity of the whole person."  </P> <P> On a personal level, the archbishop says he "came away from the listening  sessions making a few resolutions. I would never be so glib in talking about  the 'moment of conception' since from a medical point of view that is far from  accurate: conception is a long process, not a moment. I have learned from  letters and from the discussion among the health care women that the first days  and weeks of the growth of a fetus are . . . anything but simple. I know I must  be more precise and correct in talking about those stages of development."  </P> <P> He says he also will be more careful in talking about infertility and  miscarriages, having learned that a very real sense of loss follows a  miscarriage.  </P> <P> "Nor will I talk so glibly about bringing the baby to term and then 'just give  up for adoption' since I learned that there can be so much grieving here, too,  and a deep sense of loss that often needs to be faced."  </P> <P> The statement also asks what would happen if a total ban on abortion were to  occur. "Would the wealthy, because they could afford to do so, then go to other  countries where abortions would be permitted? Would there be again the  back-alley illegal practitioners? These are urgent questions, especially if  there is not a clear consensus of the population on this issue."  </P></p>

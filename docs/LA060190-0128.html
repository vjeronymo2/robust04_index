			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACTORY ORDERS DECREASE 2.3% DURING APRIL  </P> <P> Weak demand for autos and aircraft pulled orders to factories down 2.3% in  April, leaving orders for the year 2% below last year, the Commerce Department  said Thursday in a report showing further evidence of a slow manufacturing  economy.  </P> <P> "Basically, it shows the manufacturing sector is still dead in the water," said  Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist with the First National Bank of  Chicago.  </P> <P> "It's just not going anywhere."  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said orders to factories for durable and non-durable  manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $235.6 billion. That followed  gains of 4% in March and 1.8% in February.  </P> <P> Despite the gains, the April decline and a 5.5% drop in January means factory  orders have fallen 2% in the year's first four months. The department said  orders have been relatively flat since the beginning of 1989.  </P> <P> Factory orders are an important barometer of manufacturing industry plans for  production.  </P></p>

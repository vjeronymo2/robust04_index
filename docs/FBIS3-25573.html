			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Constitutional Development Minister </F> Roelf Meyer in Johannesburg on 22 February]    [Text] The constitutional negotiations were completed and  the constitution passed by Parliament in December 1993. Since  then further attempts have been made to ensure the participation  of the Freedom Alliance (FA) parties in the transitional process  and the April elections. This was done in order to seek a  settlement on outstanding constitutional differences and to  achieve amendments to the constitution while there was still  time to do so before the elections.    This was done through trilateral talks involving the  government, the Freedom Alliance and the African National  Congress (ANC) from the beginning of January to early February.  No final result could be achieved during this time on account  of:    1. The uncompromising stances which some of the parties  adopted on various issues.    2. The fact that the FA parties excluded themselves from the  multiparty negotiating process during the second half of last  year when the constitution was actually drafted. Thus they were  not aware of, and eventually lacked understanding of, the  compromises reached during these negotiations, as reflected in  the text of the constitution.    3. The absence of a single negotiating position on the part  of the FA. At no stage during negotiations were they able to  present a uniform position or arrive at a final decision  whenever a possible breakthrough was imminent.    4. At no stage did the FA have sanctioning from their  respective principals, and they had to refer back to their  principals constantly, leading to delays, interruptions,  inconclusive meetings, and the frequent changing of agendas.    5. The government had to deal with the different points of  departure of individual negotiators in the FA. There were the  solution-orientated, and those who were obviously not prepared  to seek solutions.    A final attempt to reach trilateral agreements was made on 3  February 1994, when government presented their package of  proposed amendments that could have led to an agreement ensuring  participation by the FA. The FA initially reacted positively to  these proposals, but were not prepared to bind themselves  finally to any solution on that basis.    Since the trilateral talks had failed to bring about a  settlement, the government had to take a different route. That  was to go forward and amend the constitution in Parliament with  the co-operation of the negotiating council. The ANC was  approached and agreed to such a process. The negotiating  council was subsequently convened on 21 February 1994 to  consider and approve the package of proposals.    The package of proposals consisted of the following:    1. The amendment of Section 126 of the constitution which  deals with the powers and functions of provinces. The reference  to concurrency has been deleted in order to make it absolutely  certain that the laws passed by the provincial legislatures will  prevail over laws passed by the national parliament on matters  listed in schedule 6 to the constitution, except for overrides  already provided for and previously accepted by the FA.    2. The amendment of sections 155-159 of the constitution to  strengthen the taxing competence of provinces. This was  previously agreed to by the FA.    3. The amendment of section 160 of the constitution to  enable  provincial legislatures to include specific provisions in their  own constitutions regarding their own legislative and executive  structures. This will, for example, enable the province of  kwaZulu/Natal to make special arrangements for the position of  the Zulu monarchy.    4. The amendment of constitutional principle XVIII to  provide  that the powers and functions of provinces, as set out, will not  be diminished in the final constitution. This effectively means  entrenchment of this most critical provincial provision,  according to the FA. No constitutional principle can be changed  after the election, even by a 100 percent majority in Parliament.    5. Changing the name of the Province of Natal to  kwaZulu/Natal.    6. Adding an additional constitutional principle on the  subject of self-determination, including the possibility that it  can be exercised in a territorial entity, if constitutionally  agreed. Provision is also made by amending chapter 11 to create  a mechanism for conducting further negotiations on the subject  of a volkstaat [homeland] for those who really want it.    7. Amendments to the Electoral Act to provide for two ballot  papers, one for the national assembly and one for the provincial  legislatures and for the extension to 4 March 1994 of the date  for parties to register for the elections.    All these amendments have now been approved by the  negotiating council and will be put before Parliament for  deliberation next week. This is a complete package that in fact  addresses all the concerns that were raised by the FA. There is  now nothing to keep them from participating in the elections.  For the sake of our country's future we can only hope that  reason will now prevail.

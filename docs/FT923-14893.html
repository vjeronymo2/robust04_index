			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Argentina begins foreign debt talks THE Argentine government has begun exploratory talks in an attempt to seek a 'definitive' solution over its debts to foreign creditor governments, a senior Economy Ministry official said yesterday. Mr Horacio Liendo, undersecretary for finance, said talks were starting with officials of creditor governments on a variety of Argentine proposals regarding its official debt. Argentina was not seeking debt forgiveness, but he said a rescheduling of the entire debt to the Paris Club of creditor governments would be a 'good idea'. The Paris Club usually reschedules debts falling due over a fairly narrow period. Official bilateral debt accounts for about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of an overall debt burden officials put at Dollars 75bn. The government last week finalised details of a debt reduction accord with leading commercial banks, and Argentine officials met banks in London yesterday to explain the plan to restructure Dollars 23bn of medium-term debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears. It is seeking to close the deal by the end of this year. The government hopes the bank deal will fix the bank debt servicing bill at Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.4bn a year, out of an annual debt servicing bill of just over Dollars 3bn. It calculates that Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.8bn of funds will be needed to guarantee the concessionary bonds issued under the accord.</p>

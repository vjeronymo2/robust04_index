In an interview with our political news  staff Mr. Botha said there were fears for the life of former  Ciskei military leader, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. He said the South  African Defense Force had been deployed and was on full alert to  intervene if necessary. The South African ambassador to Ciskei,  Mr. Piet Goosen, has been appointed interim administrator until  the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] appoints two  administrators to take over the running of the homeland. A  crowd of about 8,000 people has gathered at the stadium at Bisho  to be addressed by Brigadier Gqozo. Brigadier Gqozo was supposed  to be at the stadium at 1100 but didn't arrive.    A delegation of the Transitional Executive Council which has  arrived in King William's Town will decide later if Brigadier  Gqozo will address the people at the stadium.</p>

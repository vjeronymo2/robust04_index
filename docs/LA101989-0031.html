			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> The truth and nothing but: Former Secretary of State George Shultz said he  doesn't expect everyone who reads his memoirs to be happy. "I have to tell it  the way I see it, as I felt it at the time," he said. Shultz has contracted  with Charles Scribner's Sons for a reported $2 million to write two books: one  a memoir and the other on the art of diplomacy.  </P> <P> * Foiled: The computer showed no one won the $28 million jackpot -- the largest  in the history of the Massachusetts lottery. So when Ralph Brunner, 25, of  Newton, allegedly added the winning numbers to his ticket with a dot-matrix  printer and tried to claim the prize, he was arrested and charged with forging  a lottery ticket. "I guess he figured he was going to walk away with the  money," lottery spokesman David Ellis said.  </P> <P> *Exemplary: Axel Hanson of Chippewa Falls, Wis., capped a perfect 72-year  driving career with what officials called a rare act: voluntarily giving up his  driver's license at age 88. "I figured at my age I might make a wrong move  sometime or other," Hanson said. "I thought it was a good idea to give up my  license for my own safety and for other people, too."  </P> <P> * Dog days: Rowena Russell of Chesterfield, Mass., has had enough. Twice in 14  months, dogs left in the cab of pickup trucks while their owners dashed into  the General Store, uphill from her house, have knocked the vehicles out of gear  and sent them careening into her yard. Russell has asked selectmen in her town  to put up a barrier to protect her house, and they're sympathetic. "(What she's  gone through) is a bit much," said Police Chief Gary Wickland.  </P> <P> * Send it to the round file: Atheist Rob Sherman asked the McHenry County Clerk  in Illinois to eliminate references to God on complimentary marriage  certificates her office gives couples who wed. Clerk Rosemary Azzaro declined,  saying the paper had no legal value and "if anyone objects, they can throw it  away."  </P></p>

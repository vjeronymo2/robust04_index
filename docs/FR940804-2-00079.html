Summary Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Energy (Department) held a public meeting on May 21, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada (59FR19680). The purposes of the meeting were to follow-up on a previous stakeholder meeting held in August 1993; to update stakeholders on Yucca Mountain site characterization activities; and to provide an opportunity to discuss the development of a process to evaluate the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for development as a repository. Through this Notice, the Department announces that the Summary Reports of the meeting are available upon request.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Decision on the Use of 10 CFR Part 960  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in 1984, DOE's 10 CFR Part 960 siting guidelines cover all phases of the siting process including the screening and comparison of several sites in order to select three for detailed characterization as potential repository sites. The Department has considered a range of options concerning the application of the guidelines, from revising them through the rulemaking process to simply continuing to use them in their present form and has found that the guidelines are applicable to the site suitability process. The Department has decided that it will not amend the siting guidelines. Therefore, in making suitability decisions that are required at this stage of the siting process, the Department will use the guidelines as they are currently written. Their use, however, will be subject to the programmatic changes and reconfiguration provided in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. Because the Amendments Act eliminated all of the pre-characterization stages by requiring the Secretary to proceed with site characterization at Yucca Mountain and to cease investigation of all other potential sites for the first repository, comparative evaluation is no longer relevant. Accordingly, the Program will not utilize the comparative portions of the guidelines for purposes of the suitability assessment of the Yucca Mountain site. This means that the Program will not make specific evaluations of the favorable and potentially adverse conditions since these tests are primarily for use in comparing sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Availability of the draft description of the process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is developing a process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain Site for a repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel. Through this Notice, the Department announces that a draft description of the proposed process is available for public comment. Written comments on the draft description of the proposed process are due as set forth near the beginning of this notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Stakeholder Meetings  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the comment process discussed above, two day-long public meetings have been scheduled as set forth near the beginning of this notice. The meeting will provide an opportunity for representatives from the DOE to explain the draft description of the process and to receive the views and comments of the public on the proposed process and, in particular, opportunities for public involvement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on July 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Daniel A.

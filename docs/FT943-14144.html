			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Buy a stake in other people's economies - It's not just a way of spreading risk, says Gillian O'Connor, in this introduction to a sequence of articles on investing overseas Some of the canniest investors seldom invest overseas. They like to be able to keep an eye on the businesses they are backing. That's fine for a stockpicker as talented as American sage Warren Buffett. But most professional investors believe in getting a spread of investments in their portfolios: that means both different types of business and businesses in different countries. Putting some money overseas is a well established tradition in Britain. Our oldest investment trust is called Foreign and Colonial. Foreign investment is not just a form of risk-spreading: it is also a way of getting a stake in economies which appear to have better prospects for growth than Britain. And it allows investors to participate in industries which do not exist in Britain. For example, the Japanese economy and stock market is out of synch with those of other main world economies: the decline came later than it did in the US and Europe, and enthusiasts for Japanese shares argue that they now offer the same kind of potential as UK shares did early in 1993. Or, suppose there is a world commodity boom. Since Britain does not produce commodities, the immediate effect would be a rise in the cost of imports, and ultimately inflation. But if British investors have shares in the overseas companies which do produce commodities, they will participate in their prosperity. UK pension funds and insurance companies had a substantial proportion of their assets overseas, even when exchange controls made foreign investment an expensive hobby. Since the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, their overseas interests have increased. American investors have been slower to move abroad - understandably, given the importance of their own economy. But US pension funds have belatedly admitted that it makes sense for them to put at least some of thir eggs in a foreign basket. And in 1993 American private investors joined the rush to invest abroad, mainly through mutual funds. One large US broker has recommended all its private clients to have a fifth of their investment portfolios overseas by the end of this century. The growing American interest in foreign stock markets has two consequences for British investors. The sheer scale of American buying power means that US investment fancies tend to be self-fulfilling, particularly in smaller stock markets. But if that buying slows or reverses, the departure of the investment 'tourists' can have a devastating effect on the markets they have patronised. US pension-fund money is generally expected to be in for the long haul, while mutual-fund investors may prove more fickle. Most British firms which manage money for private clients have long recommended some overseas exposure, and tend to allocate specific chunks of client portfolios to overseas markets. Fund managers will suggest different portfolio splits for different clients. Very broadly, the greater your desire for income from your investments, and the more worried you are about risk, the smaller the overseas chunk. Normally that means that, the less affluent you are or the nearer you are to retirement, the more parochial you need to be. The table of benchmarks shows how one fund manager splits funds for different types of client in a 'neutral' world: ie, one in which he does not expect big changes in currency or stock markets. In practice, the actual allocations will usually differ substantially from the benchmarks for strategic reasons.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Possible portfolio benchmarks (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Asset type            Growth  Balanced    Income  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Index linked gilts        20        15         - Conventional gilts         -        10        30 UK Equities               40        45        50 Overseas Equities         40        30        20  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Kleinwort Benson Private Client Management  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

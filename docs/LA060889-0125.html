			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Wall Street investment banker who was raped and beaten into a coma when  jogging in New York's Central Park was transferred to a Connecticut  rehabilitation center, where she will undergo therapy to help her live  independently. The 28-year-old woman, whose name has not been released, was  brought to Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford by ambulance from Metropolitan  Hospital in Manhattan, where she had been a patient since the April 19 attack.  "She was admitted to the 16-bed unit for traumatic brain-injured patients and  will undergo a period of evaluation during which a complete treatment plan will  be developed," said Lori Ann Brass, the hospital's spokeswoman. The victim had  been near-dead after being attacked by a roving youth gang on a night of  "wilding" in the park and was on life-support systems for more than a week.  </P></p>

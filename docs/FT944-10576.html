			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Chile inflation at annual 8.3% Chile will have single digit inflation this year for only the second time in 30 years. Mr Eduardo Aninat, finance minister, said in London yesterday that restrictive economic policies had brought inflation down to an annual 8.3 per cent, from 13.7 per cent when the government took over in March. The government's 1994 target of 10-11 per cent would be undershot, and the 1995 target might have to be revised downwards. Chile had single digit annual inflation for a single year in 1980 but the exchange rate policy that brought it about was unsustainable. The previous year of single digit inflation was 1961. Growth this year will slow to 4.3 per cent - with consumer expenditures slowing - but should expand to more than 6 per cent next year. Next year's overall budget surplus should be about 1 per cent, compared with 2 per cent this year. Last year's trade deficit of Dollars 974m (Pounds 593.9m) will become a surplus this year of about Dollars 200m, helped by price increases for exports and a 10-12 per cent growth in export volumes.</p>

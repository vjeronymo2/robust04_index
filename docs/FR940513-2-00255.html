Therefore, youth/residents must be included in the planning and implementation of this program. The PHA shall develop a process that assures that public housing youth, through their Resident Council if feasible, are active partners in the development of the content of the PHA's application in response to this NOFA. The PHA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of the youth representatives. The Department envisions that the youth representatives will work in concert with the duly elected Resident Council. The process shall include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Informing youth of the selected developments regarding the preparation of the application, and providing for residents to become active partners in the development of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Once a draft application has been prepared, the PHA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office; provide copies of the draft to the duly-elected resident organization representing the residents of the developments involved; and provide adequate opportunity for comment by all residents, including youth, of the development and their representative organizations prior to making the application final. A copy of all comments shall be kept on file for review, at their request, by the duly elected Resident Council and HUD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) After HUD approval of a grant, notify youth and other residents of the development, and any representative organizations, of approval of the grant; notify the youth of the availability of the HUD-approved implementation schedule in the management office for reading; and develop a system to facilitate a regular youth role in all aspects of program implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training/Employment of PHA Youth Residents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3) requires that programs of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes of training and employment, the PHA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i) Youth residents of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside within a project area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the PHA that is expending the assistance; and (iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each PHA, and each of its contractors and subcontractors receiving funds under this program, shall to the greatest extent feasible, employ PHA residents to provide services and renovation or conversion work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For purposes of the requirements under Section 3, to the greatest extent feasible means that the PHA shall: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

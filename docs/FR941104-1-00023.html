			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length of military duty.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each time an employee leaves his or her employment to enter military service, he or she is subject to the time limits prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 4304 (a) and (b) for purposes of restoration rights. Generally, these are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regular active duty  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> soldiers have 4 years plus 1 additional year if the additional duty was ``at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government.'' (Their orders or DD Form 214 must so state.) Also, in the event of a Presidential call-up such as Operation Desert Storm, numerous active duty troops in key positions may be held over beyond their enlistments. This additional duty is covered because it is ``additional service imposed pursuant to law.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reserves and National Guard  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are covered under 38 U.S.C. 4304(b)(2). Normally, their restoration rights are limited to 4 years. (They do not get the extra 5th year ``at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government.'') To go beyond 4 years, their service has to be other than for training, it is limited by the time period that the President is authorized to call up troops (currently 180 days), and, if voluntary, their orders or DD Form 214 must say that the additional duty was at the request and for the convenience of the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobilization authority.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Since 1978, 10 U.S.C. 673b has authorized the President to call up as many as 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve for up to 90 days. In 1986, this authority was broadened to allow the President to extend the call-up for an additional 90 days, if necessary, without regard to a state of national emergency or war, for the purpose of augmenting the active component forces for an operational mission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The President is also authorized by 10 U.S.C. 673a to call up as many as one million members of the Ready Reserves for not longer than 24 months in a national emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Under 10 U.S.C. 672, with a declaration of war or national emergency by the Congress, all Reserve components, including Standby and Retired, could be ordered to active duty for the duration of the war, plus 6 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.203 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Physical disqualification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or an equivalent one because of disability sustained during military service shall be placed in the agency in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in each case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.204 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Retention protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> While on military duty.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An employee with restoration rights under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a), (b), or (c) may not be demoted or separated (other than military separation) while on military duty. He or she is not a ``competing employee'' under section 351.404 of this chapter. If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of like seniority, status, and pay. An employee on a leave of absence under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (d) or (e) has no special protections in a reduction in force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Upon reemployment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon reemployment, an employee with a restoration right under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a) or (b) may not be discharged for a period of 1 year except for cause. A member of a Reserve component returning from an initial period of active duty for training under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (c) may not be discharged for a period of 6 months except for cause. (Reduction in force is not considered ``for cause.'') Employees returning from a leave of absence under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (d) or (e) have no special protections against discharge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TAPER employees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section does not apply to employees serving under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.205 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibition against discrimination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A person who seeks or holds a position in the Federal Government may not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

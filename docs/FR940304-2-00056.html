This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 3.25(f) of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may, without further notice to respondents, (1) issue its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto.

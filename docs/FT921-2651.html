			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Ashdown campaign takes to the road ONE six-year-old girl at Darrel Primary School in Richmond upon Thames thought Mr Paddy Ashdown had a very special policy. 'An animal welfare commission - that's a very powerful commitment,' he said during a stop-off on his whirl around London on the first day of his campaign roadshow. The Liberal Democrat leader's breakneck tour of seats where his party has the best chances of success was about matching policy messages with photo opportunities and the people he met with, well, more photo opportunities. Mr Ashdown is confident of snatching Richmond and Barnes from Mr Jeremy Hanley, the junior Northern Ireland Office minister who has a majority of 1,766. Dr Jenny Tonge, Lib Dem candidate, admitted the party was supposed to win in 1983 and 1987 - but this time the Tory vote could prove much softer. 'This is the first time we have been on a high locally, with a huge majority on the local council and an unpopular Tory government,' said Dr Tonge. Lib Dem posters already flutter amid suburban, albeit recession-hit, prosperity. Mr Ashdown focused on education. Hence his audience with children, not councillors or canvassers. What is a politician, he was asked? 'A politician is someone who lies for his party abroad,' he replied, adapting an adage with perhaps reckless aplomb. Earlier in Sutton and Cheam (Tory majority 15,718), Mr Graham Tope, who won the constituency for the Liberals in 1972, said the Tory vote was 'soft and crumbly'. Mr Ashdown concentrated on the environment - and more children. Television crews waded through a pond to film Mr Ashdown returning frog spawn with toddlers. In Southwark and Bermondsey (held by Mr Simon Hughes for the Liberal Democrats with a 2,779 majority over Labour), the theme was health and promises of job creation. The Liberal Democrats would reduce the rate of basic income tax to offset local taxes raised by regional assemblies, Baroness Seear, the party's deputy leader in the House of Lords, said yesterday in Liverpool. In the first of a series of regional manifesto launches she will make this week in northern England, she said there would be a shift of spending from central to regional government, with a corresponding shift in tax raising. A regional assembly could raise more local money, in effect increasing the 26p standard income tax rate in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rayma Rondon; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Venezuelan Senate condemns the statements made  by U.S. Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who  criticized the government of her country for exporting [as  heard] Venezuelan oil, which, according to her, does not meet  with environmental regulations that are applied to U.S. gasoline.    Antonio Ledezma, second vice president of the Senate, said  he  learned about the statements made by the U.S. representative  through the national media. In this regard, he pointed out that  it is in poor taste for the U.S. Congress to criticize its  government for purchasing the black liquid since the United  States has been purchasing Venezuelan oil for many years, even  when modern technology did not exist.    [Begin recording] [Ledezma] Our gasoline is a good product,  as tests and experts confirm. It contains less toxic elements,  even less than the percentage that will permitted in 1995 and  1997.    [Unidentified reporter] What do you believe is behind this  attitude of the U.S. Congress?    [Ledezma] It is not an attitude of the U.S. Congress. On  behalf of Venezuela and on behalf of the Venezuelan Congress, I  am going to condemn the statements made by this congresswoman,  Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who has said that  our oil is dirty. [end recording]    Finally, Senator Antonio Ledezma announced that the Senate  will approve additional credit to help the Government of the  Federal District face the current hospital crisis.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / OECD praises Hungary but urges more reforms THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has paid a back-handed tribute to the maturity of Hungary's reforms by issuing a comprehensive critique of its economic policy in a survey released yesterday. 'Many of the issues could not have arisen had not Hungary already made substantial progress in establishing a market economy,' the organisation says of its 'partner in transition'. The OECD sugars its uncomfortable recommendations by saying that their very detail is 'indicative of progress'. However, the organisation's reproaches are bound to embarrass the Hungarian authorities. Singled out for particular concern is the financial system which, despite rapid development, showed 'weaknesses in its basic structure'. A 'credit crunch' arose last year in Hungary, the OECD states. Banks, although highly liquid, curtailed their lending to enterprises sharply because of new bankruptcy legislation which increased credit risk. Accompanying the crunch was a steep rise in spreads between deposit and lending rates from 4 per cent to 11 per cent by the end of 1992. The survey puts much of the blame on fiscal pressures and high taxation in the financial services sector; reserve requirements alone are estimated to have added two percentage points to spreads. Budgetary economy has also conflicted with attempts to recapitalise the banks, the OECD says, noting that the government's effort in 1992 was too limited, and 'partial reconstitutions are simply not workable'. The OECD accepts that the budget deficit is a product of reforms and the unexpectedly deep recession which saw GDP fall 11.9 per cent in 1991 and 5 per cent in 1992. But the survey nevertheless identifies 'serious structural budget problems' and states that the government deficit, which was 8 per cent of GDP on a consolidated basis in 1992, is 'the major macroeconomic imbalance'. Privatisation is a key to recovery and, while the OECD praises Hungary's quest for 'real owners' through market sales, the organisation argues for an acceleration of the process. But the authors come out unequivocally against the proposed privatisation investment proposals to involve the public in purchases. The scheme, which went on the cabinet's agenda this week, appears to be 'seriously flawed', the OECD says.</p>

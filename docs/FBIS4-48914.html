			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 1 (XINHUA) -- People in various parts  of China celebrated the May 1st International Labor Day in  different ways today.    In Shanghai, the largest industrial city of China, over  5,000  workers poured into the East Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace  to visit an exhibition of the heroic deeds of Bao Qifan, an  inventor and one of the ten national model workers. Meanwhile,  "Red-May" singing contests were held in over 30 workers' clubs.    Model workers became the stars at a rally of over 50,000  people in Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan Province to  mark International Labor Day. With red flowers pinned to their  chests, more than 560 model workers from various circles were  praised and presented their skills at the rally.    Many workers in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei  Province, stood fast at their posts, such as sites of highway  construction, steel-making and airport construction. They made  up their minds to make greater contributions as a celebration of  their own festival on the day.    Leading officials of Liaoning Province and Shenyang city  joined the local people in get-togethers in the four major parks  in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province. They saluted  advanced workers at the provincial and city levels, who were  also invited to attend the gatherings.    Wang Mingliang, director of the smeltery of the No. 3 Steel  Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the largest special  steel producing base of China, told XINHUA that a "Red-May"  labor emulation drive was launched today to celebrate  International Labor Day, and all the workers are enthusiastic  about taking part in the drive.</p>

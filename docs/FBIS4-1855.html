			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Guo Jia (6753 0857) and XINHUA </F> reporters Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429) and Jia Yong (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee, state president, and  chairman of the Central Military Commission, held a discussion  today with the trainees of the first rotational training class  for military cadres at and above the corps-level to study Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. He  emphasized during the discussion: It is a long-term strategic  task to arm the People's Liberation Army [PLA] with the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should  apply what we have studied in our practical work and raise our  awareness of the need to carry out the major tasks.    Present at the discussion were Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen,  vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission; and Zhang  Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, members of the Central  Military Commission.    Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech after hearing  views  of several trainees. He pointed out: We should study Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping thoroughly and  unremittingly. Since the publication of the Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the whole party,  the whole PLA, and the whole country have rapidly whipped up an  upsurge of study, which has played a great role in achieving an  ideological unity in the party and in promoting reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the  Marxism of contemporary China, as well as a strong spiritual  pillar which inspires the whole party, the whole Army, and the  people of all nationalities across the country to work with one  heart and one mind to attain our grand goals. The more progress  we make in reform, opening up, and modernization, the more new  circumstances and new problems we will have to deal with. So,  it is even more necessary to arm ourselves ideologically with  scientific theories. We will be able to achieve one success  after another in reform, opening up, and modernization if our  party has a large number of cadres who have had a grasp of basic  Marxist theories and the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, systematically and practically, not  fragmentarily nor hollowly, and who know how to apply these  theories in studying and solving important problems. It is no  easy task to truly master and use skillfully Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and it won't work to merely study it once or  twice. We must study it constantly and repeatedly in light of  our reality, deem the study to be a long-term strategic task,  and pay attention to it persistently and unremittingly.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: Comrade Xiaoping has always called  on us to study Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods, and he  always opposes dogmatism and pragmatism. The theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete scientific  system, in which the basic views and doctrines are inter-related  and none of them is isolated. During the course of study and  application, we should always pay attention to comprehensively  and correctly understanding the essence of those views and  doctrines and know the relationship among them. We should have  a firm grasp of the quintessence of emancipating the mind and  seeking truth from facts. We should know how to study and ponder  Comrade Xiaoping's basic views in conjunction with the  relationship among them, so that we will have a thorough and  profound grasp of them.    Jiang Zemin said: In order to study well Comrade Xiaoping's  works, it is very important to study them in conjunction with  the important party documents issued since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, as well as the  important policy decisions of the party Central Committee and  the Central Military Commission. In this way, it will be easier  for us to enhance our understanding of Comrade Xiaoping's  important thoughts and his basic theories and views, as well as  the party's policies. At present, it is particularly necessary  to study well the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and the theory and basic knowledge on  socialist market economy.    Jiang Zemin emphasized: During the course of thoroughly  studying Volume 3 of the Selected Work of Ding  Xiaoping, we should consider the major tasks of the party's  work this year and raise our awareness of the need to carry out  those tasks. The Central Committee has set the major tasks of  the party's work this year as seizing opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  statability. They are based on a comprehensive analysis and  correct appraisal of the present domestic and international  situation. The key to success in promoting China's reform,  opening up, and modernization lies in handling well the  relationship among reform, development, and stability. We have  promulgated a number of reform measures this year for the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, which is  like a battle to storm heavily fortified positions. If we win  in the battle and successfully build the framework of a  socialist market economy, we will lay an important foundation  for China's economic development. To win in this tough battle  particularly requires the whole party, the whole Army, and the  people of all nationalities across the country to unite as one,  share weal and woe, take concerted actions, and forge ahead.  Leading party cadres at all levels should fully understand the  major tasks of the party's work and conscientiously subordinate  themselves to and serve these major tasks. Our armed forces  should provide a strong security guarantee for reform, opening  up, and modernization and take up the historic responsibility.  Through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's works, all PLA officers  and men should identify themselves ideologically with the major  tasks of the party's work and with the party's and government's  important policies of deepening reforms. We should strive to  promote reform, development, and stability at our workposts. We  should educate the vast number of officers and men to treat  correctly the readjusted relationship among different interest  groups in the course of reform; conscientiously subordinate  their individual interest to the interest of the whole; and set  an example in stressing lofty ideals, good discipline, unity,  and the interest of the whole.    Jiang Zemin emphasized, "While thoroughly studying Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiapping, we should  strive to improve the overall quality of the leading groups and  promote Army building in an all-round way. While studying  Comrade Xiaoping's works, we must consider the Army's realities,  carry out well the decisions of the Central Military Commission,  and constantly promote Army building. In strengthening the  leading groups, we should first adhere to the requirements of  making the leading cadres more revolutionary, a younger average  age, better educated, and professionally more competent.  Comrade Xiaoping has always attached importance to training and  selecting young outstanding cadres. He has had many important  expositions in this regard, and we should comprehend and  implement them very well. Second, we should raise our ability  in conceiving strategic concepts and policy decisions. We  should strive to learn from Comrade Xiaoping's rich experience  and superb leadership in governing the party, the government,  and the Army, as well as his revolutionary courage and  resourcefulness, his realistic spirit and his scientific  methods. We should learn from his ability in grasping the  development characteristics and law of things. We should know  how to discuss important matters and formulate important  policies in consideration of the interest of the whole. We  should constantly improve our ability in guiding the Army  building and in keeping complex situation under control. Third,  we should step up the cultivation of party character and  maintain ethical integrity. A strong and pure party character  among the leading cadres is an extremely important condition for  realizing the party's program and line. During the course of  developing a socialist market economy, leading cadres should  take the lead in resisting the influence of mammonism, extreme  individualism, and decadent life style. Fourth, we should  seriously improve the style of leadership and perform actual  deeds. We have already laid down clear and definite principles  and policies for the building and reform of the party, the  country, and the Army. The key now is making actual, strenuous  efforts to carry them out. Leading cadres at oil levels should  go deep into the realities of life, conduct investigation and  study, combine general calls with specific guidance, and do a  solid and effective work. We should resolutely oppose the  seeking of superficial forms and pretty appearances, as well as  the practice of exaggeration and fraud. There are a multitude  of things to do for the troops, but all of them must be done  eventually at the grass- roots units. We must build the  grass-roots units well, fully arouse the enthusiasm of the  cadres and fighters there, lay an even stronger foundation for  the Army, and enhance its combat effectiveness in an all-round  way.    The rotational training class is run by the National Defense  University at the request of the General Political Department.    Also present at the discussion were Xu Caihou, deputy  director of the General Political Department, and Zhu Dunfa and  Li Wenqing, commandant and political commissar respectively of  the National Defense University.</p>

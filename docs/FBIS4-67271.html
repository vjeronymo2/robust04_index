			<p>Regions   <F P=102>   PA2105024794 Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 17 May 94 p D-9 </F> <F P=103> PA2105024794 </F> <F P=104>  Caracas EL NACIONAL </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" Report by Ramon Meneses from Puerto Ayacucho] </F>   [Text] DEA reports on the increasing use of Venezuela as a  bridge for drugs have also revealed that the "doors" open to the  south, specifically in the Amazon and Apure regions, a  high-level police official has reported.    "This situation has been getting more serious every day.  During the past years, the drug barons, who were operating in  neighboring Colombia, have transferred all their laboratories to  areas in Vichada and Guainia regions. It has been easy for them  to work in those secluded areas because the presence of security  forces is sparse there," Venezuelan intelligence officials have  pointed out.    People know about the groups in Puerto Ayacucho but they  move  very cautiously due to the [words indistinct] with the movement  of money and weapons. Many people have reported encountering  drug traffickers when they are working in the Amazon region.  Drug traffickers reportedly have opened roads in the Montana  Fria, Rueda, and Garcitas areas, to the south of Puerto  Ayacucho. They also reportedly opened another road in the  northern area, very near Puerto Paez, to take advantage of  Puerto Carreno and other Vichada towns.    A prominent National Guard official, who has been working  against drug traffickers for several years, has reported:  "People don't talk about them because they fear retributions,  but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in  the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the  Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now  cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers'  paths in the south."  <H5>  The Road is Free on the Colombian Side </H5>   Due to the freedom they have on the other side of the  Orinoco  [Colombia], Venezuelan authorities can do little about the  presence of the drug traffickers in the Venezuelan side. The  drug traffickers control entire towns in the neighboring country  and authorities do not get close, sometimes due to fear and  others due to compliance with the illegal activity. "Things are  so serious that on one occasion we arrested a Colombian citizen  who had a large amount of drugs on him in Puerto Ayacucho and we  were surprised to find out that he was the top police official  in a town close to the Amazon capital city. How can you fight  against this?" the official asked.    The Orinoco is a long fluvial highway, through which  Venezuelan authorities, by an agreement signed with Colombian  authorities, are able to transit freely. They did not consider  that international right today would cause a serious problem on  that bordering and depressed region where drug traffickers have  set up their headquarters and where they secure allies in all  the sectors of the, up until now respectable, community.    Enrique Betancourt, one of only two native governors that  region has had in all its history, and one of the few strugglers  against that scourge said: "When I was governor I ordered  measures against all the drug traffickers' fronts, because I  knew that it [drugs] was filtering through the weak and scarcely  guarded border. Unfortunately my administration was short-lived.  However, during those months not one act of violence took place  in the state and not one case of kidnaping was reported, as is  happening today, he noted. This scourge has been spreading its  evil on several fronts of our community, from which officials of  the security corps and officials of the governorship do not  escape."    Betancourt said: "It is of no avail to report personal  incidents linked to drug trafficking if a stiff and courageous  response does not exist by those in charge of enforcing the law.  These individuals, most of them from Caracas, become powerful  lords based on false promises and positions from which they  manipulate and operate under their superiors' complacent gaze;  this is also a crime," the former governor of that Amazon region  stressed.</p>

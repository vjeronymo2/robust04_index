			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.L.: "Aerospatiale-DASA Satellite and Missile </F> Partnership"]    [Text] The inter-union association at Aerospatial's Cannes  facility is worried about company plans to form a "joint  subsidiary" for satellites with Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], while  a partnership agreement between the two firms in the missile  domain is "approaching closure."    Currently in the discussion phase, a possible partnership in  the satellite domain between Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace  is stirring intense anxiety in the trade unions at the  Aerospatiale plant in Cannes (Cote d'Azur). In an unusual  gesture on 14 January, the inter-union issued a joint communique  on the subject signed by FO [Workers Force], CFE/CGC, CGT  [General Confederation of Labor], and CFDT [French Democratic  Labor Confederation].    The Cannes inter-union--with the support, it claims, of  unions at the other facilities in Mureaux and  Aquitaine--"opposes the creation of a joint company" to  integrate the space activities, especially the satellite  activities, of Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace; it also  opposes what it terms "subsidiarization of the Cannes facility."  The unions believe such a move would be "the first step towards  loss of human, technological, and material patrimony" along with  "loss of Aerospatiale Group's identity." They add that such a  partnership would lead to "abandonment of our national  independence in the sensitive sector of military intelligence  satellites."    In support of its position--and it threatens to call a  strike  eventually, "if the views of organized labor groups are not  taken into account"--the Cannes inter-union published what it  said would be the "financial structure" of the joint satellite  subsidiary. Emphasizing that Aerospatiale would control "less  than 50 percent" of the company while DASA would control "more  than 50 percent." It also claimed Aerospatiale and DASA have  parallel plans for cooperation on missiles, in the framework of  another schema that is identical but for the fact that in this  case the French group would have a controlling share.    Sources at Aerospatiale headquarters say the satellite  partnership "is still only in the early stages of discussion;  formal negotiations have not even begun." According to the  spokesman for the French group, "no apportionment (of shares in  the partnership) has yet been proposed, because the scope of  activities is still being evaluated" with respect to the  satellite partnership. On the other hand, Aerospatiale  management acknowledges that the missile partnership is "further  advanced" and even "approaching closure." Not that any  announcement is expected in the very near future!    Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's CEO, said in early January  there were "two sets of discussions under way with DASA, one on  space and another on missiles," with the objective of  establishing "a balanced structure in which neither side would  swallow the other"---a structure which he said might be based  "on the Eurocopter model." As for when it might all come to  pass, he "hoped" (but that is all) for 1994!    But Gallois's problem is how to create a "balanced" dual  partnership with Deutsche Aerospace when Aerospatiale is in a  much better industrial position than its German partner,  especially in satellites. So one can begin to appreciate the  anxiety felt at Cannes by the unions--and workers--knowing the  facility currently has a "full order-book." And should continue  to have one, even after delivering the four Eutelsat and Turksat  satellites that Ariane is supposed to launch in 1994.    Broadly speaking, Aerospatiale's Space and Defense division  is in relatively good shape. Michel Delaye, head of the  division, told us recently that with manpower cut back to 4,725  (from 5,600), the division last year produced Fr8 billion in  sales and Fr9 billion in orders, with satellites alone  responsible for Fr3.2 billion of orders and Fr2.4 billion of  sales, almost double the volumes for 1992!</p>

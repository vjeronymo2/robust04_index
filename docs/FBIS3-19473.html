This  position of the Federal Government became known in Tunis on  Tuesday [15 March] on the sidelines of a talk between 'Arafat  and Juergen Moellemann, president of the German-Arab Society.    However, Bonn will not support the efforts of 'Arafat, who  is  weakened in his own camp, to get an international armed  protection force. Bonn will only advocate sending civilian  observers -- with the participation of the European Union -- to  the territories occupied by Israel.    Bonn sees the Arab-Israeli peace process as being in a  serious crisis and considers a longer delay likely. It doubts  that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will take  place on 13 April as planned. However, as soon as the autonomy  administration has been established there, the Federal  Government wants to open a German coordination office in Jericho.    According to information obtained by Bonn, Israel does not  rule out an attack by Islamic fundamentalists in retaliation for  the massacre in Hebron. During a meeting with Moellemann on  Tuesday, Tunisian Foreign Minister Ben Yahya warned against  "underestimating the explosive potential of Shi'ite  fundamentalism, in particular in Egypt."</p>

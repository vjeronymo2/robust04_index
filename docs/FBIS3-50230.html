			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We briefly reported on today's meeting between  Minister of Finance Stoyan Aleksandrov and Professor Ivan Lalov  in some of our news programs. Commenting on the talks, Minister  Aleksandrov reportedly said that the demands of the students on  strike have been fulfilled. Let us hear some of his latest  remarks on the subject as submitted to BTA:    The strike of the Sofia University students is political,  the  finance minister declared in briefing the media at the Council  of Ministers headquarters today. He is convinced that the  students have either been deceived, or are acting at someone's  instructions. I am even in doubt whether a strike exists at  all, considering that 500 people cannot possible represent the  interests of 140,000 students all over the country, Minister  Stoyan Aleksandrov is reported as saying.    After his meeting with Prof. Ivan Lalov, during which he was  informed of the demands of the strikers, the finance minister  resolutely declared that he would neither negotiate with the  strikers nor sign any agreements with them. According to the  minister, the scholarships were paid from the university's  extrabudgetary funds on the basis of the rectors' decision. The  university's leadership preferred to spend the means of the  state subsidies for its own wages, which were increased by 40  percent.    Stoyan Aleksandrov described as preposterous the claim that  2  percent of the gross national domestic product should be spent  on education as of 1995. According to him, the (?state  subsidies) will not be abolished, but it should be considered  whether to preserve the current system of distribution in higher  educational institutions, or whether a new scheme should be  adopted at the suggestion of the rectors, in accordance with the  specialists required in different spheres. The legal documents  related to scholarships, students' hostels, and credits for  students shall be adopted in one package, as the strikers  demand, but this will presumably take place only at the  beginning of the next or in the middle of the current school  year, the minister is reported as saying.</p>

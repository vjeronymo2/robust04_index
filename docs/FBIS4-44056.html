			<p>BFN     [Text] Four Swedish ministers this afternoon arrived on the  Greek island of Corfu. Sweden's membership agreement with the  European Union [EU] is going to be signed in Corfu tomorrow  morning. This ceremony will take place before the EU starts its  summit, where the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister  are allowed to take part. Prime Minister Carl Bildt sees the  Corfu meeting as important for Sweden.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are now taking a step toward  European cooperation (?with this agreement). We have been  outside European cooperation for a very long time. I hope we  will approve this at a national referendum in November. Now for  the first time we have the possibility of a seat and a voice,  even though we cannot yet vote in European cooperation. This is  a historic step.    [Correspondent Titti Nylander] You are going to be sitting  among the other prime ministers as if you -- Sweden -- are a  member, almost. Are you not going to feel slightly odd because  we are not really members yet?    [Bildt] It will be the case that I will not have the  possibility to influence any of the decisions. I do have the  possibility to say what we think about various points, but when  the decisions are made, then we -- Norway, Sweden, and Finland  -- we are not taking part, we are observers. However, we think  it is important that we join in the cooperation as soon as  possible, and therefore we are active observers. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and U.S.  President Bill Clinton had a telephone conversation yesterday  during which they agreed on the need for a speedy solution of  the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  issue. During the telephone conversation, the U.S. President  also expressed his support for the confidence-building measures  for the Cyprus issue which, he said, are the best hope to  achieve progress.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the U.S.  interest in a solution to the Greek-Skopje dispute as obvious.  Venizelos added that the Ubited States understands the Greek  positions and wants a swift solution of the issue, something  which we want as well.    Next week there will be a meeting in New York between  Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director  general and UN Mediator Cyrus Vance.</p>

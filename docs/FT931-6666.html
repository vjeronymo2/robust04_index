			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Job for a millionaire - Off the Wall IF THERE is a millionaire out there who enjoys first nights at the opera and the theatre and has a fairly clear diary for the next five years the perfect job is hovering on the horizon. Lord Palumbo has made it plain that he will relinquish the chairmanship of the Arts Council when his term comes to an end in April 1994. Lord Palumbo was far from being the first choice when selected but he has grown in confidence over the years and no one could fault him on diligence. He made the Council his life, helped perhaps by the comatose state of the property market, the source of his fortune. His major contribution has been getting the Millennium Fund idea off the ground. As chairman Lord Palumbo had one other minor advantage to the Government: he was amazingly cheap. He paid for his car and chauffeur, never claimed expenses, and entertained Arts Council members, and the arts generally, out of his own pocket. A successor needs to be almost as rich because the post is unpaid. Heritage Minister Peter Brooke will probably allow you to claim travel, and other expenses, if he is really keen for you to do the job. Who will succeed Palumbo? The likes of Lord Sainsbury, who turned down the chairmanship last time round, will not be interested. There is always Lord Archer, but the fragrancy of a women chairperson might favour Lady Archer. Much depends upon what sort of Arts Council the new chairman will inherit. The consultants are about to move in again for yet another overhaul and there may not be much left to rule over. The Department of Heritage can never quite make up its mind what kind of Council it wants: in the last five years it has moved from imminent extinction to extra powers back to shrinkage with uncanny speed. If the consultants recommend a slimmed down advisory Council, the masthead could well be served by Prince Edward. On the other hand the main attraction has always been that it confers a title on the recipient, which could bring a bright commoner to the fore. ***** In a recession museums come into their own. They tend to retain their purchasing grants, however small, while private collectors cut back. The most expensive Old Master pictures sold these days end up in American institutions. Last month the Kimbell at Fort Worth paid Dollars 2.4m for a late 15th century portrait, perhaps by Memling, and this week the Getty in Malibu gave Pounds 11m to Royal Holloway College for Turner's whirling seascape, 'Van Tromp going about to please his masters'. So it is a shrewd move for Colnaghi's, the Bond Street dealers, to invest in a fine new gallery which, with its red wall covering and natural daylight, resembles many a museum. It will be used to hang 'museum' pictures, one of which, a Guercino, has already been sold. The gallery is the jewel from Colnaghi's acquisition for something approaching Pounds 10m of its adjacent building, giving it a line of three prime freeholds. Obviously Colnaghi's owner, German food magnate Rudolf Oetker, is confident that the worst is now over for Old Masters. As for the Getty Turner, the Royal Holloway College undoubtedly trampled over the wishes of its pill-producing founder in selling the painting but it got a very good price, a record for a British picture. The temporary export block to give the British a chance to raise a matching sum will be a formality, and there is much to be said for fine works by the UK's greatest artist entering major overseas collections. If a gallery in the UK needs a Turner, the Tate has plenty in its vaults that it might lend. It is noteworthy that the College sold the Turner privately. In the last couple of years Turner oils have fared badly in the saleroom: a discreet sale reduced the hostility to the transaction and prevented a public failure, which would have lessened the value of the Turner. The knee-jerk reaction of the museum establishment to the sale overseas was predictable. Of course it sets an unwelcome precedent, but no comparable institution has such magnificent pictures and after this furore Royal Holloway is unlikely to split up its superb art collection. It might even repair its image by making it more accessible. Turner is poorly represented overseas: more British people will see it in California than at Egham. ***** The Festival Hall is seeking to widen its repertoire, and from today until Tuesday night it will be showing off its flexibility for the very best of causes. War Child, a charity set up last month to help children caught up in hostilities, specifically in the former Yugoslavia, has taken the Hall for four nights. Tonight John Thaw hosts a classical night, with pianist Peter Donohoe, among others; Sunday features contemporary jazz; Monday comedy with Jo Brand, Jim Tavare, etc; and Tuesday, rock with the Blues Band, the Bhundu Boys, and more.</p>

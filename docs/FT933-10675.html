			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Home loans pick up as values rise FURTHER evidence of increased activity in the UK housing market emerged yesterday with figures showing that borrowing by house-buyers is picking up and house prices are continuing their slow rise. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage advances rose to Pounds 13.5bn in the second quarter of this year from Pounds 10.9bn in the first quarter. Net new lending rose to Pounds 4.1bn, up from Pounds 2.9bn in the first quarter. Nationwide Building Society's house price index rose for the fifth consecutive month in July, rising 0.7 per cent on June. Nationwide said prices had risen 4.3 per cent since the end of 1992, but were still 2.4 per cent lower than last July. The council's figures showed that mortgage balances at the end of June were Pounds 347bn, almost 5 per cent higher than at the end of June last year. The number of loans approved was 274,000, up more than 25 per cent on the previous quarter and the highest figure for two years. Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said the figures were 'very encouraging' and confirmation that the market was slowly recovering. He said the increase in the number and value of mortgage approvals corroborated signs that confidence was returning. Mortgage approvals were up 10 per cent on the same period last year even though the 1991 figures had been 'artificially boosted' by the deadline for the stamp-duty holiday. At Nationwide, Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said: 'The modest recovery . . . appears to be continuing.' He noted that the increase in prices was supported by a small rise in the number of houses sold. Nationwide said that by the end of the year prices are likely to record modest gains over December 1992 - provided that the increase in activity is sustained. The average UK house price was Pounds 54,103 in July, up Pounds 393 on June. Nationwide's monthly index, based at 100 in the first quarter of 1983, stood at just under 200 in July last year, but fell in the late summer and autumn before picking up in January. After reaching a low point in February of 186.77, it has recovered to 195.13 in July. Abbey gain marred, Page 15</p>

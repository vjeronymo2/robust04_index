			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / People: GKN Nick de Jongh is quitting as director of external affairs at the Engineering Employers Federation to become director of public affairs at GKN, one of the federation's biggest members. De Jongh's move at the end of April ends 19 years at the federation, whose role has changed, particularly in recent years. In his opinion, some new faces are needed among the senior officials. At GKN, he will replace John Southgate, who next month becomes Ford of Europe's vice-president for public and government affairs. The federation is already looking for a new director- general following Neil Johnson's departure in November and the recent cancellation of plans to merge its central functions with those of the Confederation of British Industry. Meanwhile John Rugman, GKN's head of human resources services, has been elected president of EEF West Midlands, the largest of the associations affiliated to the federation.</p>

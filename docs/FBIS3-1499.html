Today, the negotiating team of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] met with Faustino Muteka's  delegation to study methods to be used in discussing the topic  of dealing with the second round of presidential elections. The  parties had to move to this topic because of the intransigence  and arrogance demonstrated by the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party. Basing its arguments on the  so-called electoral victory after the rigged elections, it  refuses to make important concessions. Faced with an impasse,  Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary  general in Angola, decided to move on to the electoral issue,  which appears to be less polemical.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: LYNN NAMED PRESIDENT OF PRICE CO.  </P> <P> Mitchell G. Lynn, 42, has been named president of Price Co., the San  Diego-based chain of membership discount warehouses.  </P> <P> Price Co. stock closed down $1.375 to $36.875 in over the counter trading  Monday but retail analyst Sarah Stack of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los  Angeles discounted a "link between the news announcement and the stock price  decline."  </P> <P> Noting that Costco fell by $.75 and that May Co. was down $1 in Monday trading,  Stack said other retail stocks declined on Monday, possibly a result of the  segment being "overvalued" on the whole.  </P> <P> Lynn has held a variety of posts within Price Co. since joining the company as  controller in 1979. Most recently, he was president of Price Club Industries,  which includes the chain's photo processing, optical services, food packaging  and other warehouse operations.  </P> <P> A certified public accountant, Lynn is a graduate of UCLA. He replaces Robert  Price, who will continue to be Price Co. chief executive and board chairman.  Lynn will be given a seat on Price's board of directors after the annual  shareholders meeting next month, the company said.  </P></p>

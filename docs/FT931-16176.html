			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers come to the rescue When accidents occur, the first reaction is often panic. To help deal with emergencies in industries processing hazardous materials, Pacer Systems of the US has developed what it calls the first expert computer system for those responding on the spot. Plantsafe provides automated advice for emergency co-ordinators, safety managers and on-site team leaders who have to react quickly to fires, leaks, spills and other hazardous situations. Its main uses are in the oil, petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Says David Whitby, UK-based marketing manager for Plantsafe in Europe: 'Previous systems have been able to provide information only on vapour or gas releases. Plantsafe provides the full range of information for emergency team needs.' Plantsafe: UK, 0483 730905. Pacer: US, 508 667 8800.</p>

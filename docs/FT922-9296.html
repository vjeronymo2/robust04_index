			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Administrators appointed at Ward Group WARD GROUP, the structural steel and building components combine, yesterday became the latest company to fall foul of the recession in the construction industry. Directors applied to the High Court for an administration order stating that this would ensure a more advantageous realisation of assets than winding up the business. Mr Michael Moore and Mr David Waterhouse of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte have been appointed as joint administrators. Ward shares were suspended at 63p on Tuesday. A year ago they were trading at more than 200p. In 1990 the company employed more than 2,300 full time workers of which 1,200 were in the UK. That year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.72m on turnover of Pounds 172.8m. The group went into the red during the first six months of last year when it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.48m. Mr Nigel Forsyth, chief executive, said then that trading conditions in the UK were the worst in the company's 45 year history. According to the most recent accounts, for the 1990 year, bank overdraft and loans totalled Pounds 19.5m compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 28.3m.</p>

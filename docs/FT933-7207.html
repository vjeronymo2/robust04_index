			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: US tobacco group signs agreement with China PHILIP Morris Asia and China National Tobacco Corporation have agreed to co-produce Marlboro cigarettes in Shanghai. An agreement was signed in Beijing last week. Under the accord, the two sides will also develop and produce other brands in Ningbo, a city south of Shanghai. The new products will aim at both domestic and international markets. No capital investment is expected from Philip Morris. Its role will be to help train staff workers and upgrade leaf processing of the two existing Chinese plants. The CNTC monopolises China's cigarette production. Its 180 plants produce 1,500bn cigarettes a year. Philip Morris will be the fourth international tobacco manufacturer to enter China after RJR Nabisco, Rothmans and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Corp of Hong Kong. Marlboro is the most popular foreign cigarette in China. With living standards improving quickly, more Chinese are buying imported brands. China is the world's largest cigarette consumer, with 300m smokers consuming 1,600bn cigarettes a year.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Foreign side helps Siemens maintain half-time results A fall of 16 per cent in domestic sales at Siemens for the six months ended March, was offset by strengthening foreign business, the German electrical and electronics multinational reported yesterday. Group net earnings were unchanged at DM879m (Dollars 514m) on turnover up 3 per cent at DM38bn, Siemens said. However, growth in sales was due to the first-time inclusion of the US Sylvania lighting business. Osram's turnover jumped 71 per cent to DM2.9bn. A similar rise in lighting product orders, reflecting recovery in the north American economy and the US automotive industry, contributed to an overall 9 per cent increase in demand. While the foreign order book was up 21 per cent at DM27bn after a 33 per cent advance in the first quarter, domestic demand for the six months showed no relative change, and was 6 per cent lower at DM17.5bn. Incoming orders are considered an important indicator at Siemens, but the figures are subject to sharp short-term fluctuations because of the high capital costs of projects such as power stations. The first-quarter surge in foreign demand, for example, was mainly attributable to large Asian contracts. Total new orders at the important KWU power generation division were 36 per cent ahead after six months at DM4.9bn. The group, which in January said it expected full-year profits to fall by 10 or 15 per cent mainly because of reduced investment earnings, is still showing the strains of feeble investment in the German market. Telecom sales were down from DM9.2bn to DM8.3bn. A rise in orders for private systems offset a decline in the public sector, leaving the six-month order total for this business unchanged at DM9.3bn. Sales and orders at the loss-making computer business, Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, were both down around 6 per cent. The group's payroll had increased by 6,000 to 397,000 since March 1993, because of the consolidation of acquisitions such as Sylvania, in spite of shedding some 8,000 jobs in the interim. The group plans to reduce numbers employed by 15,000 this financial year.</p>

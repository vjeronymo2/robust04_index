			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Fixed exchange rates must also be adjustable Sir, Mr Laurens van den Muyzenberg (Letters, March 30) did well to remind the sceptics among us that 'almost nothing will do more to facilitate trade than fixed exchange rates'. After all, no sensible person (foreign exchange dealers excepted) can want floating rates for their own sake. If fixed exchange rates are, however, best because of the stability and discipline they help to provide, they must also be adjustable if need be, as the ERM rules (and those of the Bretton Woods system earlier) lay down. Who doubts that Black Wednesday's trauma could have been avoided by a general ERM realignment in good time? Of course, given the same quality of economic management (and particularly the same commitment to price stability and hence sustainable, non-cyclical growth) everywhere, the results with fixed but adjustable exchange rates and those with floating ones would be the same. The question is, which system would best promote such convergence? Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley N3 3AN</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / People: Leaving the ship of state P&amp;O, the international shipping company, has acquired a senior civil servant as its new director of corporate affairs in the shape of Peter Smith, principal private secretary to Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary since April 1992. Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, has long-standing connections with the DTI, having acted for many years as an adviser to the department, and has known Smith for many years. Smith, 42, will join P&amp;O on September 26 to fill the gap left earlier this year when his predecessor Peter Thomas retired to his native Australia. Lord Sterling is maintaining the link through his senior PR man because Smith, while born in the UK, was brought up in Australia. In his new role, Smith could well find himself exchanging words with his former employer. British shipowners have been vociferous in their condemnation of what they see as the government's neglect of the Red Ensign and are continuing to press for tax breaks. Smith studied philosophy and mathematics at the Australian National University before going on to complete a PhD in philosophy at the University of St Andrews. He has been at the DTI since 1978, working in the fields of overseas trade promotion, industrial policy and company law. In 1989 he took over responsibility for telecommunications policy and prepared the government's white paper on telecoms in the 1990s.</p>

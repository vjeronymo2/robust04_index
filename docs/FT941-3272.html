			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Balladur reforms anger unions France's big union federations will today mount a rare show of unity in demonstrating against the Balladur government's new law permitting young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage. Individual union federations and students unions have held repeated protests at the contrat d'insertion professionelle (CIP), which passed relatively unnoticed into law last autumn as part of the government's labour reforms but provoked a union outcry when implementing decrees were published last month. The communist-leaning CGT federation, for instance, demonstrated alone last Saturday against the CIP, but is joining the three other main union movements in today's action. Mr Balladur has said he will not go beyond the concessions he made to unions on March 3, when he promised that young people under 26 with diplomas would not be paid less than the so-called Smic minimum wage (currently FFr5,600 (Pounds 641) a month), or less than 80 per cent of any sectoral wage agreement. He also promised a tighter definition of the 'tutoring' of young workers under the law. But these concessions have not appeased the unions, with Mrs Nicole Notat, head of the moderate CFDT union federation taking the line this week that 'it is not for the young to pay for their training'. While repeatedly promising not to introduce a cut-price 'youth wage', Mr Balladur clearly thought - at least until last month - that he had quietly got away with doing just that in the guise of this CIP. In addition, the pre-March 3 formulation of the law aroused concerns among the educated young that their diplomas were being effectively devalued, since those with university degrees could be paid as little as those without paper qualifications. At the same time, older workers are anxious lest the young take their jobs. In the circumstances, this Sunday's first round of departmental elections threatens to become a national referendum on government policy. Departmental by-elections over the past year have run strongly in favour of the governing coalition, but with Mr Balladur's own poll standing in decline after rows over education reforms and now labour reforms, this trend could well be reversed. The CIP issue may, in fact, be raising exaggerated fears and hopes in all camps. Taking a formally neutral stance on the issue, the Patronat employers' federation has leading members who question the CIP's value as a generator of jobs for those under 26 who represent a quarter of France's 3.3 unemployed. They would far prefer a rapid reduction in interest rates or a speedy switch in welfare costs from company payrolls to the budget. But Mr Balladur is now constitutionally committed to letting the Bank of France set interest rates, and politically committed to reducing the budget deficit. Mr Didier Maillard, Paribas' chief economist, yesterday commented that the CIP measure was a step in the right direction, because 'structural rigidities relating to wage costs for less-skilled, among them inevitably many younger workers, are responsible for 8-9 percentage points' of the jobless rate of 12.2 per cent. He pointed to the fact that since the Smic was created in 1970, successive governments have increased its level by 98 per cent, while under a strict application of the original 1970 formula it would only have risen by 32 per cent.</p>

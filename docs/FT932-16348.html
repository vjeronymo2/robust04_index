			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: ITN chairman puts emphasis on profit MR MICHAEL Green, chairman of Independent Television News, warned yesterday that the group must move from being 'cost driven to profit driven', and that it must 'develop other sources of revenue from home and abroad'. Mr Green, also chairman of Carlton Communications, refused to be drawn on possible further job cuts: 'There are no jobs for life, but we don't have a piece of paper saying 'these are the new job cuts''. Staff levels have been reduced from 1,100 to 650 in the last two years. Mr David Gordon, the new chief executive, highlighted ITN's need to increase its international business, 'both for input and distribution' of news programmes. Mr Gordon, previously chief executive of The Economist, said he hoped to bring to ITN an 'understanding of the importance of editorial quality'. Last week the Department of Trade and Industry approved a seven-member consortium takeover, under which new shareholders have committed Pounds 30m to fund ITN, and will in principle buy its London headquarters for Pounds 74m from Stanhope Properties. ITN previously had 15 shareholders. The restructuring was in part prompted by what are understood to be Pounds 5m annual losses on the headquarters. Mr Green said yesterday: 'There are no property problems for ITN', adding that the board believed it made better financial sense to buy the property than spend Pounds 8.6m annually in rent. He added that other, unspecified tenants are interested in renting surplus space. In the 17 months to end-1992 it is believed ITN made an operational profit of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 3m for the 1991 year.</p>

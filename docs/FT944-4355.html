			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (1): Catching up with its Asian rivals - While the business acumen of the Vietnamese is fuelling an economic boom in the cities, rural life is also beginning to improve When Vietnamese communist party officials laid bouquets of flowers before Lenin's statue in Hanoi last month to commemorate the Russian revolution, it was more a nostalgic gesture than an act of ideological homage and commitment. For it is the ideology and practice of capitalism - known officially as 'socialism with a market economy' to spare the blushes of communist stalwarts - that is spreading throughout Vietnam at breathtaking speed. Among the first Vietnamese to seize the opportunities presented by doi moi (renovation), the policy of reform introduced by the party in the late 1980s, were the entrepreneurial residents of Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial and industrial centre previously called Saigon. The south's businessmen and women, who had lain dormant since the communist victory over the US-backed South Vietnamese government in 1975, responded enthusiastically to the reforms by opening trading companies, factories, banks, restaurants and chic boutiques. The streets of Cholon, the ethnic Chinese business district, seethe with commercial activity. In 1988, Ho Chi Minh City had only 22 registered private companies; today it has 2,600, not to mention tens of thousands of small shops. Traffic jams and ugly concrete buildings are becoming more common. Hanoi and the north did not take long to follow suit. Only three years ago the capital was a quiet, spartan backwater of south-east Asia with almost no modern facilities. Now it has pizza restaurants, satellite television, meter taxis, karaoke bars, private hotels and mobile telephones, a transformation reinforcing the view that each industrial revolution in east Asia happens quicker than the last. Few opportunities are missed to make money. Last month the Dollars 25m Do Son Casino near the port of Haiphong, a joint venture between Hong Kong investors and the local government, opened its doors to visiting foreign gamblers. On the streets of Hanoi, hawkers openly sell confidential government and World Bank reports on the economy, and photocopies of books banned in Vietnam for criticising the communist party. Less obvious to outsiders than the economic boom in the cities, but just as important, are the changes in the countryside. Most rural Vietnamese are still desperately poor and are forced to choose between surviving on their overcrowded farmland and migrating to the towns, but the situation seems to be improving slowly. The United Nations calculates that 51 per cent of Vietnam's 72m people live below the most basic poverty line - the level at which they can afford 2,100 calories of food a day - but that is down from 70 per cent of the population a decade ago. Peasant farmers, taking advantage of secure land tenure and the chance to make money in a liberalised agricultural market, have sharply increased their output. Vietnam, which once used to suffer from rice shortages, has become the world's third largest rice exporter after the US and Thailand. The private sector's share of gross domestic product has risen to 45 per cent from 10 per cent in less than a decade, Vietnamese government economists say, and the reforms have led to rapid economic expansion; real GDP growth is expected to reach nearly 9 per cent this year. Foreign investors and aid donors, along with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese exiles and the overseas relatives of the ethnic Chinese, are providing much needed capital to finance economic development in a country where average per capita income is still only about Dollars 250 a year. Last month donors pledged Dollars 2bn to support Vietnam at a meeting in Paris, adding to the Dollars 1.86bn that was agreed last year. Foreign investors have promised Dollars 10bn of projects since 1988, with the emphasis on the textile industry, oil and gas exploration and new hotels. Five international investment funds have been established to direct money into what has become Asia's most fashionable emerging economy. Vietnamese and foreign companies are quick to complain about the many problems that remain to be solved: cumbersome bureaucracy, corruption, the reluctance of state enterprises to undergo privatisation, the lack of economic and commercial legislation, the primitive state of the domestic banking system and conflicts between central and local governments. But Vietnam's leaders, from prime minister Vo Van Kiet downwards, are by Asian standards remarkably frank about the government's shortcomings and eager to accelerate economic reforms wherever possible to achieve the official goal of 'a prosperous people, strong country, and just and civilised society'. In the next few weeks the government is expected to respond to criticisms about the complexity of licensing procedures for foreign investors by announcing a new package of investment rules. Among other changes, a requirement for feasibility studies is likely to be waived for small projects. 'I myself say we Vietnamese are moving too slow,' says Tran Ba Tuoc of VP Bank, a newly-founded private bank in Ho Chi Minh City. 'But looking back, we have done a lot. In the next two to three years I'm sure we will get almost everything in place.' Several central government ministries, the army, and the local communist people's committees in different provinces have adapted capitalism to their own ends. They have set up their own businesses or entered into joint ventures with foreign investors who cannot find big enough partners in the fledgling private sector. The government nevertheless wants free enterprise to thrive so that Vietnam can catch up with and compete with its Asian rivals. While it concentrates on economic development, Vietnam is urgently seeking to make friends in the region and the wider world. President Bill Clinton finally lifted the US economic embargo against Vietnam in February this year, but the US administration feels unable to restore full diplomatic relations with the communists who won the Vietnam war for fear of protests by American conservatives; the two governments are expected to open 'liaison offices' in each other's capitals shortly. Vietnam, meanwhile, hopes to join the Association of South East Asian Nations next year and is trying to resolve its territorial and maritime disputes with China. When it comes to domestic politics, Vietnam's communists - like their Chinese counterparts - have no intention of abandoning the single-party system, even if Marx and Lenin are not much talked about in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City these days and constructive criticism of the government is officially welcomed. 'The government is very wary of losing control,' says one diplomat in Hanoi. 'The trouble is, as you get more and more foreigners coming in, more and more Vietnamese travelling abroad and more telephones, it becomes more difficult.' Vietnamese officials have trouble defining the ideological basis for communist party rule in a free market economy. Asked to explain what he means by socialism, Le Mai, the deputy foreign minister, says: 'Socialism is bringing better material and spiritual living conditions for the people as a whole.' Government leaders are adamant, however, that economic reform should precede political change (unlike in much of eastern Europe) and they insist that one-party rule is essential for stability, a view shared by other authoritarian governments in east Asia. 'The people here are very careful to maintain political stability,' says Mr Mai. 'And they understand that by maintaining that, the economy can continue to grow.' Eventually the Vietnamese communist party, which earned its nationalist credentials fighting off French, Americans and Chinese, may have to confront popular challenges to its legitimacy and abandon the ritual obeisances to Lenin. But for the time being it faces only spasmodic opposition from Buddhist monks and south Vietnamese exiles living in California. Almost everyone else is too busy trying to make money.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS COUNCILMAN'S INCONSISTENCY  </P> <P> I am puzzled by the inconsistent views of Councilman Larry Horner regarding the  need to maintain business character in Thousand Oaks versus the need to  maintain residential character.  </P> <P> He recently stated, "I'm going to be hard-nosed. . . . I'm not going to change  the character of the business community because of advertising."  </P> <P> Why, then, is he willing to change the character of residential neighborhoods  because of rooming houses, which bring blight, traffic, drugs and crime?  </P> <P> Horner's proposal, as chairman of the Code Enforcement Committee, will reduce  residential zoning standards in violation of the city's ordinances that apply  to occupancy levels, street parking, fire codes and infrastructure. His  proposal does not solve the existing problems with illegal multiple rentals. In  the name of "solving the overcrowding and enforcement problems," his proposal  will increase density, increase street parking and encourage rooming houses to  spring up in family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> I hope homeowner associations and concerned citizens will not be deceived by  slogans but will read the fine print.  </P> <P> MARIE KOERNER  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

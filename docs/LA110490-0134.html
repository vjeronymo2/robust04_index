			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TIP OF THE HAT TO COUNTRY  </P> <P> ** 1/2 GARTH BROOKS "No Fences" Capitol  </P> <P> Garth Brooks' 1989 debut album was not only a hit in country circles, but  climbed the pop charts with surprising ease -- especially for one whose sound  is thoroughly traditional.  </P> <P> The Oklahoma native's follow-up has been doing a similar leap-frog up the pop  and country charts.  </P> <P> This one is a considerable improvement artistically, but more because of the  weaknesses of the first -- which sank musically under the weight of one  hopelessly melodramatic song after another -- than because of the modest yields  of the second.  </P> <P> In "Fences' " best moments, Brooks' woody baritone suggests several lifetimes  of hard living. And he reveals a canny sense of style in a witty swing  treatment of the Fleetwoods' sappy old hit "Mr. Blue." Still, the album suffers  overall from as many predictable comeuppances to wrongdoers and rewards for  do-gooders as an old Gene Autry movie. Give this sophomore effort a split  decision for a few steps in the right direction and the promise it holds for  its successor. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Citic buys 30% stake in Swire Aviation China's involvement in Hong Kong's aviation industry deepened yesterday with Citic Pacific's HKDollars 120m (USDollars 15m) acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in Swire Aviation. Swire Aviation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Swire Pacific and its main asset is a 30 per cent interest in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL) - Hong Kong's air cargo monopoly based at Kai Tak airport. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire Pacific, said the deal would strengthen the relationship between Swire and Citic Pacific. Citic Pacific, which also owns 12.5 per cent of Cathay Pacific, is controlled by China International Trust and Investment Corporation - an arm of the Chinese central government. It has also partnered Swire Pacific in property development in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has used Citic to build up substantial interests in the 'commanding heights' of Hong Kong's economy. In addition to its shareholding in Cathay it owns 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom. It is the likely mainland Chinese candidate to invest in Hongkong Electric or China Light &amp; Power, the colony's two electricity utilities  - a move which is expected before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p>

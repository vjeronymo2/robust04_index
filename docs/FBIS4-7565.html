			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, March 30 (ATA) -- The committee of the Pen  International recently has sent a letter to the Serbian  president, Slobodan Milosevic, expressing its concern for the  maltreatment of the Albanian writers in Kosova and urging him to  stop the violation of the writers' rights there. The  imprisonment of Murteza Nura and Shaip Broiri is considered in  the letter as an unlawful act because they are being kept in  prison for a non-violent activity.</p>

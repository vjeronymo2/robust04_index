			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Row over accounting for leases A ROW is starting over the treatment of leases in company accounts, following a warning from the Finance and Leasing Association. The association said last week that proposed changes to SSAP 21, the accounting standard for leases and hire-purchase agreements, would be difficult to understand. It wants to retain a guideline in the existing standard that a company taking out a finance lease should put it on its balance sheet if the value of the minimum lease payments is at least 90 per cent of the fair value of the asset. However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has recommended that the so-called '90 per cent rule' should be replaced by more qualitative measures for determining whether the risks and rewards of a lease have been transferred to the company that takes it out. The Accounting Standards Board is revising standards and has invited comments and proposed changes to SSAP 21. Two draft chapters in the board's statement of principles, released last week, would appear to suggest that all leases would be placed on the balance sheet. The chapters are not in themselves standards but are the framework for future standards.</p>

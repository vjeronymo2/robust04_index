			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] In a dispatch from Vladivostok on 3 February,  Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that when submarines that were to  be sold to North Korea became an issue in the international  community, Russia decided to stop delivering them to North Korea.    The paper, which carried exclusive news of Russia's plan to  sell submarines to North Korea, sent a reporter to the (Novik)  port in Vladivostok -- which is the prohibited area for  foreigners -- and held an interview with a relevant official  there. He said that Russia had decided to stop delivering  submarines to North Korea.    Having obtained contract documents regarding transactions  for  the submarines that were to be sold to North Korea, the paper  carried commentary on the documents on 3 February along with  submarine photos.    The paper reported that although a relevant Russian military  officer had said that they were "exporting scrap materials, not  submarines," it was more likely that Russia was selling them as  weapons as it has been confirmed that a North Korean  high-ranking naval officer was directly involved in negotiations  for the submarines.    The paper reported: Although Golf II Class submarines, which  were to be sold to North Korea this time, appear to be largely  scrap material, their facilities, including operational  functions, remain functional.    According to the data furnished to the paper, the Management  Bureau of the Resources External Affairs of the Russian Defense  Ministry and the Japanese Toyen trade corporation (head office  in Tokyo) signed the contract on 16-19 November last year.    The price of the 12 Russian submarines are as follows: Two  of the submarines are $140,000 based on price of $51 per ton and  ten submarines, at $92 per ton, amount to $1.15 million. One of  these submarines has already been delivered to Najing port in  North Korea.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance pay and bargaining rights Sir, Your article, 'Power workers accept merit pay' (January 15/16), requires clarification. The new agreement for professional and supervisory staff in Eastern Electricity covers a package of terms and conditions, including the introduction of performance-related pay (PRP). However, the statement that the trade union's acceptance of PRP ends our participation in pay bargaining for this group does not reflect the terms of the agreement. Performance appraisal categories will determine precise individual increases, but the product of the trade union's negotiations will be paid as a minimum to individuals who meet or exceed targets. In addition, we have secured the right to represent members over objective setting and their year-end appraisal rating. Indeed, the new scheme does not go into full effect until 1996; this provides a phasing-in period negotiated by the trade unions due to our reservations about the efficiency of PRP as a method of rewarding and motivating professional staff. It is important that the impression given by the article is corrected, as too often trade unions are portrayed as unable to come to terms with PRP. We have successfully combined the protection of collective pay negotiations with rewards for individual achievement in the PRP system. There is nothing in this acceptance of PRP that is incompatible with strong trade union representation into the future.

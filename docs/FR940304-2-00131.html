			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submitted by letter dated October 19, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, a State standards revision comparable to 29 CFR 1910.133, Eye and Face Protection, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (39 FR 23670) on June 27, 1974. The Oregon Eye and Face Protection Standard is contained in OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;1910.133. The State's original standard was adopted as OAR 437 chapter 7, section 3, rules 5 through 12 on March 19, 1974, and received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> approval (39 FR 38036) on October 25, 1974. The State standard was subsequently recodified without change as OAR 437 Division 50&hyph;025 and received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval (52 FR 27077) on July 17, 1987. OAR 437, Division 50 has been repealed in its entirety. On March 22, 1993, the Notice of Proposed Revision of Rules was mailed to those on the Department of Insurance and Finance mailing list established pursuant to OAR 436&hyph;90&hyph;505 and to those on the Department's distribution mailing list as their interest appeared. Both actions failed to elicit a request for hearing; however, two written comments were received which recommended that the State retain its more specific language in some areas of the standard. The State's revision was adopted on July 29, 1993, with an effective date of September 15, 1993, through OR&hyph;OSHA Administrative Order 9&hyph;1993. The State has retained one State-initiated standard requiring eye protection for employees exposed to laser beams which was previously approved by OSHA. The renumbering changes for the State-initiated rule are as follows: Originally adopted as OAR 437&hyph;7&hyph;3&hyph;2, recodified as OAR 437&hyph;50&hyph;025(12), and readopted as OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;130(2). The State's more stringent rule received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval (39 FR 38036) on October 25, 1974 as part of Oregon's response to Federal OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.133, Eye and Face Protection, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (39 FR 23670) on June 27, 1974. The State has also retained a minor State-initiated rule at OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;130(1), previously OAR 437&hyph;50&hyph;025(3), which requires eye and face protection equipment to be designed and used in accordance with ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having reviewed the State submissions in comparison with the Federal standards, amendments and corrections, it has been determined that the State standard amendments for Formaldehyde, Lead, and Personal Protective Equipment are identical to the Federal standards. OSHA therefore approves these amendments. OSHA has also determined that the Respiratory Protection amendments are at least as effective as the comparable Federal amendments, as required by section 18(c)(2) of the Act. In addition, OSHA has determined that the differences between the State and Federal Respiratory Protection amendments are minimal and that the standards are thus substantially identical. OSHA therefore approves these amendments; however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objection be submitted to the Assistant Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the Eye and Face Protection amendments, OSHA has determined that these amendments are at least as effective as the comparable Federal amendments, as required by section 18(c)(2) of the Act. With the adoption by reference of &sect;1910.133, the State's standard is now identical to the Federal, except for the retention of two State-initiated rules. One of these rules was approved in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 1974, and the other rule is minor. OSHA therefore approves the standard; however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

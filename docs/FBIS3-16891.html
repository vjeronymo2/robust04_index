			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Important international events were discussed at a  news conference in the Seimas today. Guoda Salciute reports:    [Salciute] The Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas commented  at  a news conference on today's events. They are the initialing of  the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty in Warsaw and a meeting of the  military representatives of the Baltic States in preparing a  joint peace-keeping battalion.    [Begin Jursenas recording] How the coincidence of these two  events can be explained, or how should one explain this? I  think that the main thing here is our advance toward Europe.  Both events are linked with our joining European, Western and  world structures. I dare to state on this occasion that we  ensure the continuity of Lithuanian foreign policy, of an  independent state, starting with 11 March 1990 up to this day.  We are convinced that one of the most important things that  must be ensured for our state are its security and its  stability. Both internal means and the corresponding means of  international policy are needed for this purpose.    Thus the regulation of relations with our neighbors, the  existence of good, normal and friendly relations with our  neighbors are exceptionally important in the sense of our  internal situation, too. If we speak of real advance in Europe,  but not of a declaration or nice words, then my dear ones,  nobody is waiting for us in Europe, nobody is waiting for us who  quarrel with neighbors, who are not reconciled with neighbors,  who have not eliminated some conflicts. Europe is not waiting  for such, it has enough of its own problems and suffers because  of the former Yugoslavia or some other situations. Thus we can  more successfully join European structures and can take part in  the creation of a new Europe only if we regulate as far as we  can our relations with our neighbors.    Our previous governments have accomplished a great deal in  this direction, I greatly appreciate this, and what they did not  manage to accomplish or what they have started, like, for  example, a Lithuanian-Polish declaration signed by esteemed  Saudargas [former Lithuanian foreign minister] and esteemed  Skubiszewski, what the previous government did not manage to  accomplish, we are doing this. [end recording]    [Salciute] Having assessed the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty,  Jursenas also dealt with the hue and cry by some politicians in  Lithuania about this document, with meetings and pickets, with a  statement by six parties. Having stressed juridical  involuntariness [as heard] of this statement, Jursenas asked  which experts write such statements.    The Seimas chairman also spoke at the news conference about  the first days of the Seimas spring session. Although only  three days have passed, two capital laws have been adopted: On  land and on the reliability of the litas. Asked by journalists  whether he himself had confidence in the litas, Jursenas replied  that he had and will have confidence in the litas, which has  undergone many tests.</p>

Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said NATO was acting within  the  mandate of the Security Council resolution passed last March  when New Zealand acted as president.    "They (the aircraft) were warned, they ignored it and they  have paid the price," he said.    "The resolution really sent two signals -- that the Security  Council would not tolerate violations of its resolutions and  decisions and that the best course was to stop fighting and  instead work on setting differences by negotiation," the  minister added.    NATO said its fighters yesterday shot down four Serb  warplanes which were conducting a bombing raid over Bosnia.</p>

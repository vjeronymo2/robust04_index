			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>   [Text] Kazan June 20 TASS -- Vice-President of Tatarstan  Vasiliy Likhachev characterised the Russian-Tatarstan  power-sharing treaty as a "most functional document". He  praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree ordering the  foundation of a committee to regulate the implementation of the  treaty. An analogous committee has already been formed in  Tatarstan.    The vice-president said his republic's treaty with the  Russian Federation was the first document in Russia's history  which established constructive cooperation between a region and  the centre. He noted that the Tatarstan commission already has  a specific programme for the agreement's realisation. For  example, Tatarstan plans to play a role in federal-level  economic programmes, such as the ones for the production of  Tu-204-200 aircraft, cars, and oil-tankers.    Yeltsin's decree is a significant step forward in the  implementation of radical reforms aimed at turning Russia into a  truly democratic federation, Likhachev commented.</p>

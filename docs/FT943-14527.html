			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Talks progress may hold up Irish summit London and Dublin are considering postponing next week's UK-Irish summit because of disappointingly slow progress on agreeing the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are expected to meet in Brussels tomorrow to decide whether the summit should go ahead next week as planned. Representatives of both sides yesterday indicated that the decision was in the balance. It is thought unlikely that the meeting will proceed as planned if it is decided that the framework document cannot be completed in time. This is in spite of fears in some Whitehall circles that a postponement until September or later could send out the wrong signal. Tomorrow's Brussels meeting - at a European Union summit to agree the next president of the European Commission - comes as tension in the province again rises in response to a new surge in sectarian violence. Yesterday saw the second attack this week on the home of a member of the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party when a bomb exploded outside a house in County Tyrone. The DUP said the device was meant to kill Mr Sam Mc-Cartney, a former Cookstown councillor. The bombing, in which nobody was injured, came within 72 hours of an IRA gun attack on the County Tyrone home of the Rev William McCrea, the DUP MP for Mid-Ulster. Mr Ray Smallwood, a Protestant militant, was shot dead by the IRA on Monday night. British authorities are braced for a new wave of mainland bombings after the discovery on Tuesday of more than two tonnes of explosives hidden on a lorry arriving at Heysham in north-west England. The attacks come at a provocative time, coinciding with the annual Orange Day celebrations by Protestants. The main obstacles in the path to a framework agreement are differences between the two sides over the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster, and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's territorial claim is not addressed, but it sees little point in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected by unionists. Mr Reynolds continued to adopt a hard line on cross-border co-operation in a speech on Tuesday in the US, saying north-south institutions 'must now be established'. But he said such bodies would be 'without prejudice to longer-term constitutional decisions'.</p>

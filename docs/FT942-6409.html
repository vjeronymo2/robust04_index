			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Experts likely to eclipse incoming 'stars' - It will not always be names best known to voters who hold real levers of power in new assembly On July 19, when the new European Parliament elected on June 9 and 12 holds its inaugural session, Mr Franco Iacono, an Italian Socialist MEP not standing for re-election, will have more than usual regrets. A tireless campaigner in the outgoing legislature for mandatory bidets in European hotels, he may face charges in Naples on corruption allegations once his parliamentary immunity expires. The European Parliament hopes the elections will flush away its lesser talents. It needs a new intake of calibre to project its influence and exploit the new powers invested in it by the Maastricht treaty. The new assembly will not lack grandees, but it will not always be the names best known to voters who hold the real levers of power. And although voters nationally have entrusted their governments to Socialists in only three of the 12 EU member states (Spain, Greece and Denmark), everything indicates that the Union's only directly elected body will be more Socialist-dominated than ever before. The leadership of the Socialist group, the largest at Strasbourg, is the parliament's most influential position. It is expected to go to Mrs Pauline Green, a tough-minded former policewoman who has commanded effectively the British Labour contingent. That UK Labour MEPs, already the largest single national unit and expected to increase heavily at Tory expense, should aim single-mindedly at the group leadership rather than the presidency accurately measures how power flows in the Parliament. It is the leaders of the political groups - in which Mrs Green would be prima inter pares - which set the agenda. Her counterpart in what looks set to be a diminished Christian Democrat bloc is likely to remain Mr Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister, set to be re-elected alongside another former Belgian premier, Mr Wilfried Martens. But the presidency of the parliament, hitherto a politically ill-defined role trapped somewhere between parliamentary speaker and lacklustre figurehead, could yet grow in stature. 'The potential for the presidency becoming the job is growing,' believes Mr David Harley of the assembly's secretariat-general. Ms Elisabeth Guigou, former French minister for Europe standing in the Socialist list, is a figure many insiders reckon has enough clout to give the parliament an image of respect. The Socialists also control environment - possibly the single most influential committee in shaping law - under Labour MEP Mr Ken Collins, who could face challenge from former EU environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana from Italy's Greens. They chair too the foreign affairs committee, under Mr Enrique Baron, a lightweight former president of the parliament whom some would like to see replaced by Mr Fernando Moran, a former Spanish socialist foreign minister. Formal structures aside, it is the preparation for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty, in which parliament will have an important say, that will define which MEPs rise. A key figure here will be the Scots Labour MEP and parliament vice-president Mr David Martin, the Socialists' main constitutional expert. Mr Martin made a highly regarded submission to the Maastricht treaty negotiations, and also chairs the 'conciliation' committee which operates the parliament's new legislative powers in negotiation with the Council of Ministers. With these sorts of priorities, many incoming national 'stars' could well be eclipsed. Mr Bernard Kouchner, flamboyant founder of Medecins sans Frontieres and former minister for humanitarian affairs in the last French socialist government, or Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce, former UNHCR representative in Bosnia, could fade in a body now concentrating more on issues it can influence than on the human rights gestures it was famous for. Nor is it clear what role other national figures, like former French Socialist premier Michel Rocard, or Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the former Italian Communists, intend to play. Mr Occhetto, already an MEP, appeared so seldom at Strasbourg that when he turned up for May's historic enlargement vote to admit four new countries into the Union, he missed the first two votes on Norway and Austria because he did not know how to work his voting card.</p>

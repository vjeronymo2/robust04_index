			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, OSM's proposed rules also provide that an applicant for a permit or any other person that is shown in the AVS as having an ownership or control link to a person may challenge the link (unless the applicant or other person is bound by an earlier administrative or judicial decision concerning the link). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). An applicant or any other person shown in the AVS may also challenge the status of the violation cited in a federal violation notice naming a person with whom the applicant or other person is linked (unless bound by a decision concerning the status of the violation). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(2), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). The applicant or other person may submit a written explanation and supporting evidence to OSM concerning the existence of the link or the status of the violation. See proposed &sect;773.24(b), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Applying the standards for challenging ownership and control links and the status of violations contained in proposed &sect;773.26, 56 FR 45801&hyph;03 (Sept. 6, 1991), OSM will either correct the information in the AVS, if the applicant or other person shows the link is erroneous or the violation is no longer outstanding, or, if this is not shown, OSM will so notify the applicant or other person. See proposed &sect;773.24(d), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). In either event, OSM will issue a written decision and serve it by certified mail. See proposed &sect;&sect;773.24(d)(2)(i), 56 FR 45800&hyph;01 (Sept. 6, 1991). The applicant or other person has a right to request review within 30 days of service of OSM's decision under the procedures proposed by OHA in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387. OSM's decision remains in effect pending a decision on review unless temporary relief is granted under proposed &sect;4.1386. See proposed &sect;773.24(d)(2)(ii), 56 FR 45801 (Sept. 6, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OHA's procedures in proposed 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 closely parallel those in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377. Any person who receives a written OSM decision concerning a challenge to the existence of a link or the status of a violation may request review. &sect;4.1381. The required contents of the request are set forth in proposed &sect;4.1382; the request may be amended once as a matter of right before a response is filed by OSM and with the leave of an administrative law judge thereafter. &sect;4.1382(c). The administrative law judge is to convene a hearing within 90 days of receipt of the responses unless the parties waive that deadline, and give notice at least 10 days in advance of the hearing. &sect;4.1383. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its decision, while the person requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the decision is in error. &sect;4.1384. An initial decision is required within 30 days after the record of the hearing is closed. &sect;4.1385. At any time before the initial decision is issued, any party may file a petition for temporary relief from OSM's decision. Temporary relief may be granted if all parties to the proceeding have been notified of the petition, have had an opportunity to respond, and a hearing has been held if requested; and if the petitioner has demonstrated that it has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that temporary relief will not adversely affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. &sect;4.1386. Expedited review by IBLA or judicial review of a decision granting or denying temporary relief may be requested within 30 days of receipt of the decision. &sect;4.1386(h). If temporary relief is not requested, any party may file a petiton for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision within 30 days of receiving it. &sect;4.1387. The Board is to issue a decision denying the petition or granting it and ruling on the merits within 60 days of the deadline for filing responses to the petition section 4.1387(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of a person's interest in an application for a permit cannot be regarded as a ``legitimate claim of entitlement'' to a permit and therefore requires less due process protection than the interest of a person who holds a permit that is subject to suspension or rescission because it was improvidently issued. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board of Regents  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Roth,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 408 U.S. 564, 569&hyph;71, 577 (1972). For a person who has applied for a permit or may apply for one, due process does not require a hearing on the existence of an ownership or control link or on the existence of a violation when it was cited before OSM issues a decision under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. If the proposed procedures in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377 for administrative review of notices of permit suspension or rescission under proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) provide adequate due process protection, as OHA believes, then the parallel procedures in proposed &sect;&sect;4.1380&hyph;4.1387 certainly satisfy due process requirements for OSM's decisions regarding ownership and control links or the status of a violation under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. In particular, an applicant's opportunity to obtain temporary relief under 43 CFR 4.1386 from an OSM decision provides sufficient due process at this stage. Further administrative review is available to an applicant for a permit in an appeal of the denial of the application under existing procedures in 43 CFR 4.1360 through 4.1369, when the existence of the violation may be challenged. Providing an evidentiary hearing before OSM decisions under proposed 30 CFR 773.24 would severely impede the Department's effective implementation of section 510(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

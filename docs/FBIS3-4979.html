			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea  resumed their dialogue for the first time in four months  Thursday but ended their meeting without reaching any  substantial agreement on the exchange of special envoys to help  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    The two sides, however, agreed to meet again at 10 AM next  Wednesday at Tongil-gak on the northern side of the  demilitarized [zone] in the truce village of Panmunjom.    The delegates to the fourth working-level inter-Korean  contact could not even take up the problems related to the  exchange of special envoys when North Korea demanded that they  first discuss two new issues.    North Korea demanded that South Korea stop trying to deploy  Patriot anti-missile missile and clarify recent remarks by South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam.    The southern delegation, led by Song Yong-tae, vice minister  of the National Unification Board, proposed at the meeting a  13-point agenda for discussions including the implementation of  the delcaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  and the inter-Korean basic accords and a summit between  President Kim and North Korean President Kim Il-song.    Thursday's meeting ended a few hours after the South Korean  Defense Ministry announced a conditional suspension of the joint  U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit" in Seoul.    South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend the  military exercise on condition that Pyongyang resume dialogue  with Seoul for the exchange of special envoys to discuss issues  including the North Korean nuclear question.    "The southern side tabled a revised draft of the proposal  for  the exchange of special envoys to help resolve the nuclear issue  and other measures to improve inter-Korean relations," Song said  after the meeting.    "But we could not make any progress in discussions for the  exchange of envoys since North Korea raised four conditions,"  Song said.    In addition to the two new demands, North Korea wanted South  Korea to scrap the Team Spirit exercise and stop participating  in an international campaign against North Korea. The two sides  are expected to take up the question of exchanging special  envoys at the next meeting on Wednesday, sources asid.    In his opening statement, the South Korean chief delegate  stressed that South and North Korea will have to exchange their  special envoys before North Korea could hold a third round of  high-level talks with the United States, which is tentatively  slated for March 21 in Vienna.    The special envoys have to be exchanged as soon as possible  so that the two Koreas could solve the nuclear problem as well  as other pending inter-Korean issues, Song said.    Shortly before the meeting started at "Peace House" on the  southern side of the demilitarized zone, Song met with the  northern delegates and shook hands with them. He then noted  that the inter-Korean contact was suspended in October last year  "when the winter began to set in."    "As we are meeting you here again today, we feel like we are  waking up from a long hibernation," Song told the northern  delegation led by his counterpart, Pak Yong-su.    "I hope that the inter-Korean relations will also wake up  from a long winter sleep and spring arrives in Panmunjom," Song  added.    The North Korean chief delegate deplored that "we wasted a  whole season since we met each other last fall when grains were  ripe for harvest."    "Let us try to clear up problems for the exchange of special  envoys within today," Pak said.</p>

The U.S.-Russian  summit and the documents signed by the two sides indicated that  although there is some progress in building up the U.S.-Russian  "partnership," disagreements remain on a series of issues  concerning their own respective interests.    Clinton visited Russia after Russia had just elected its new  parliament last December. The Moscow Declaration claimed that  the U.S.-Russian relations had entered into a new stage of a  matured strategic partnership.    The first achievement of the visit is that Russia, the  United  States and Ukraine signed an agreement on eliminating nuclear  weapons on Ukrainian soil, removing the major obstacle that has  been affecting Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.  Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with  176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear warheads, all  aimed at the United States. Russia is concerned about its  nuclear neighbor too. After numerous rounds of negotiations,  while pressing Ukraine, the United States and Russia also made  certain compromises promising security and economic  compensation. Ukraine's consent to eliminate the nuclear  weapons in its territory served to finally relax the United  States and Russia. Clinton pointed out that only after the  United States and Russia have built up this "partnership" will  it be possible for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to agree to  eliminate their nuclear weapons.    On bilateral relations between Russia and the United States,  Clinton reiterated his support for Yeltsin and his reform  policy. Meanwhile, Clinton also voiced his support for new  political forces advocating "a market economy and democratic  values" in Russia. The agreement further pushed bilateral trade  and economic relations forward. Russia's agreement to sell 500  tons of uranium to America in the next 20 years settled one of  the most controversial issues in the bilateral trade war of the  last two years. Clinton also announced plans to lift most of  the restrictions on Russia's commodities entering the U.S.  market, a big gain for Russia which is working hard to become an  equal trade partner with the West.    Another important topic discussed at the summit was  security.  While Russia was worrying about NATO's granting membership to  former Warsaw Pact countries and Baltic nations, Clinton  appeased Russia with the "Partnership for Peace" plan which had  just been approved at the NATO summit. To some extent, the plan  has taken into consideration Russia's security interest and  decided to achieve the integration of NATO and Middle and East  European countries through different stages. Thus it put  Moscow's worries to rest.    It was commented that Clinton's visit didn't bring anything  new into the bilateral relations. The disagreements between the  two nations on certain important issues will continue to affect  the development of the bilateral relations, such as the regional  conflicts in former Soviet Union. Moreover, in regard to  bilateral economic relations, Yeltsin reiterated that Russia  doesn't count on America's aid but asks the United States to  open its market and eliminate trade restrictions. In addition,  the two sides have differences on the issue of Bosnia and  Herzegovina and Russia's relations with three Baltic countries.    The prospect of the "strategic partnership" between the  United States and Russia depends on not only the Russian  domestic political situation, but also on the stand the two  sides will take on the above issues in the future.</p>

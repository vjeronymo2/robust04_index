			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (3): Technical problems not insurmountable - Investment barriers and risks Investing in emerging markets is not purely a stock-picking process. As well as poring over balance sheets, investors must also examine government regulations, tax rules and the share settlement process before making their decisions. The type of restrictions varies from market to market. In China, for example, foreign investors are only allowed to buy special B shares. There is a 10 per cent withholding tax on gross income from dividends, interest, leases of properties, royalties and other China non-source business income. In Pakistan, according to the GT Guide to World Equity Markets, foreign investment is not permitted in agriculture, forestry, irrigation, real estate, radioactive minerals, insurance or health. A common tactic for international investors is to try to bypass the regulations. The most frequent route is via global depositary receipts (GDRs) or American depositary receipts (ADRs), which are traded on principal stock markets. According to Mr Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson 'the market generally has an enthusiasm for ADRs and GDRs. The enthusiasm can be judged by the extent to which they go to a premium to the underlying shares.' Dr Arnab Banerji of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets gives a practical example. 'In Chile, investors face a five-year lock-up clause on their capital. Profits and dividends can be remitted, after a 10 per cent tax, but the mechanics are pretty complicated and bureaucratic.' Instead of investing directly, foreign investors use funds and ADRs, tradeable on the New York Stock Exchange. 'When you look at the premiums at which the ADRs stand to the domestic stocks,' says Dr Banerji, 'you can see the price investors are prepared to pay for liquidity.' Mr Giles Neville of Schroders says his company is always going to be led by the custodian. 'We have to have confidence that the custodian has settlement procedures worked out in the market. We will buy ADRs and GDRs if we cannot get custody in the local market.' The restrictions may thus only succeed in driving the capital markets offshore, rather as US banking regulations in the 1960s led to the development of the Euromarket. Dr Banerji points to India, where there is a short-term capital gains tax of 30 per cent. 'Of the Dollars 3bn raised in India last year, some Dollars 2bn was in the form of global depositary receipts,' he says. 'If the authorities changed the tax structure, that money would flow to the domestic market.' Restrictions can be side-stepped by investing in another, more open, market which has close ties to the chosen economy. With only a limited number of Chinese quoted companies, for example, most investors still prefer to gain access to China via those Hong Kong companies which have strong links with the People's Republic. Another favoured tactic is to invest via a fund which has particular tax privileges. According to Mr King, 'Mauritius has a more favourable tax treaty with India than the rest of the world. Funds based there avoid the capital gains tax problem.' Restrictions on ownership can also lead to the use of a fund by international investors. 'In Korea, the foreign registers for attractive companies are more or less full,' says Dr Banerji, 'which means you have to find a fund with a local partner to avoid the constraint.' Using a fund, which has already received regulatory approval from an emerging market's authorities, can save a lot of administrative hassle. One fund manager has commented that its application to invest in India was a 2 1/2 -feet high pile of paper. Another reported that it took more than 70 pieces of paper to settle a trade in Venezuela. But there is a limit to the use of these devices. 'If people use Mauritius too much,' says Mr King, 'eventually the Indian authorities will get upset and close the loophole.' If there are only a limited number of funds in a market, they can often trade at a premium to asset value, adding an extra element of risk to the investment decision. Furthermore, there is a constraint on ADR and GDR premiums, says Mr King. 'Eventually so many ADRs will be issued that the premiums will go down.' It may be possible to deal with those regulatory and tax problems which are already in place but, of course, there is always the threat that once foreign capital has been attracted, countries might impose new regulations. However, Dr Banerji says: 'The international investment community has communicated pretty clearly to governments, that if the rules are changed disadvantageously, they can kiss goodbye to foreign capital for some time.' The tide towards liberalisation and free markets is certainly running pretty strongly at the moment and Mr King thinks a general move to tighten regulations is unlikely. 'The whole evidence is that demand for fresh capital is so huge that countries are pressured into facilitating the entry of money,' he says. And over-burdensome regulations will encourage capital to go elsewhere. The emerging markets index-makers tend to underweight those markets with restrictions to reflect the lack of availability of stocks. Given the tendency of investors to weight their portfolios in relation to the index, this factor may encourage government to open their markets further. So although the technical problems involved in investing in emerging markets can be complex, they are not impossible. The issues of settlement, tax and possible regulatory changes are all part of the investment decision, says Mr Neville of Schroders. 'It's a risk control process,' he says.</p>

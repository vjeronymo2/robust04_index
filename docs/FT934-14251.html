			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Surrounded by the hungry pack: The London Stock Exchange seems to have no clear strategy for resisting rivals and handling technological change On the 23rd floor of the London Stock Exchange tower, the walls are lined with portraits of former chairmen. From their ornate gilt frames, past generations of grandees gaze down on the City with an air of haughty self-assurance, untouched by doubts about the future. When the present chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, sits for his portrait ahead of his retirement next year, the artist is unlikely to capture such an air of serene complacency. Like other stock exchanges round the world, London's faces unprecedented commercial challenges. Unlike its overseas rivals, however, the London Stock Exchange also faces a crisis of confidence. The people whose confidence matters most to the exchange - the marketmakers and brokers who form its membership, and the investment institutions that buy and sell the bulk of the shares traded - are happy with the day-to-day work of the exchange. Their concerns cover just the area about which the chairmen in the portraits were so sublimely confident: the future role of the institution itself. One incident crystallises these doubts: the ignominious failure, earlier this year, of the stock exchange's ambitious Taurus project to computerise the settlement of stock market bargains. Because of that failure, the exchange lost its chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins, and has all too publicly failed to find a replacement. Worse, Mr Rawlins's departure led to the abandonment of his elaborate vision of the exchange's future - and, again, there is no substitute in sight. The vision was abandoned partly because it offended the big marketmaking firms. Tensions between them and the stock exchange's management also led to a row over whether the exchange could be trusted to deliver its next big computer project, rebuilding the Seaq trading system. When City figures discuss the future of the stock exchange, the conversation usually revolves around these unique local issues. But the biggest challenge it faces is the problem it has in common with the rest of the world's stock market bodies: the commercial threat from rival trading systems. In London, these competitors include Reuters' Instinet system, Tradepoint and Posit, all offering investors or marketmakers an alternative price display mechanism. It is the threat they pose that is the real issue at stake in the debate over the future of the London Stock Exchange. And the exchange knows it. Its counter-attack has already started. 'Those who provide marketplaces ought to have regulatory obligations,' says Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the stock exchange. The emerging competitors, Sir Andrew argues, could not operate without the stock exchange's presence as the central bulletin board for posting prices, and without its role as a reg-ulator. 'These exchanges can't operate without a price formation system. They are parasitic,' he says. The stock exchange has asked the Securities and Investments Board to review the regulatory oversight it gives to all exchanges operating in the UK. Sir Andrew argues that the London Stock Exchange cannot compete on the same commercial basis as the newcomers because they do not have the regulatory duties, such as surveillance and maintenance of listing requirements, that it has. What particularly irks Sir Andrew is that, unlike his institution, which is treated as a Regulated Investment Exchange under securities laws, Tradepoint and other competitors only need to meet the much simpler requirements applying to those defined as service companies. The stock exchange cannot afford to have its most profitable activities 'cherry picked' by competitors, he says. Its complaints have not fallen on deaf ears. The SIB has appointed Mr Jonathan Agnew, formerly chief executive of Kleinwort Benson, to prepare a discussion docu-ment on the matter, among other issues. So far, Sir Andrew says that the competing exchanges account for well under 5 per cent of all trading activity. But evidence from the US suggests the London Stock Exchange is right to be worried. The New York Stock Exchange, as of last year, found that more than a third of the trading volume in all the stocks it lists actually occurs on a competing exchange, and its revenues have suffered accordingly. Like the New York Stock Exchange, the London exchange is building its case on what it believes to be an issue of public interest: the desirability of a unified, central marketplace for equities, rather than a proliferation of rival markets. Only a single central market provides a guarantee that all participants will know about - and get - the best possible price for their share transactions. Not everyone accepts this case. 'The exchange likes to say it is the central marketplace for securities trading,' says one regulator. 'Arguably it does no such thing.' Indeed, the exchange, through its Seaq International system, is actively engaged in fragmenting the markets in other countries by allowing marketmakers to post two-way prices there. The effect has been to draw business away from domestic markets, particularly in Europe, and attract the ire of local bourses. The exchange says that more than 90 per cent of cross-border European trades are conducted on Seaq International. 'If central markets are so valuable, why are we promoting Seaq International?' the regulator asked. As well as issues of principle, there are also practical considerations. The new rivals offer facilities the London exchange cannot currently match. Its present Seaq system acts, in effect, as a bulletin board for marketmakers to post the constantly changing prices at which they are prepared to buy and sell securities in bulk. It is not interactive; it does not allow marketmakers to communicate directly with each other, nor even to confirm electronically that a bargain has been struck. By contrast, Tradepoint, one of the exchange's emerging competitors, will operate an order-driven system in which marketmakers or institutions will be able to post prices anonymously. The system will be able to aggregate orders and present them in bulk to users, and will offer automatic trade confirmation. Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, says that it is intended that users will be charged roughly half of the 0.20 per cent fee now charged on bargains effected through the stock exchange. The growth of new technology and the growing institutionalisation of the market mean that the bulk of the exchange's users could operate their own mini-marketplaces from their desktops, combining feeds from several competing trading systems. If the stock exchange is worried about the costs of its regulatory duties, should it not simply give them up, to compete more efficiently as a commercial entity? That is not in anybody's interest, says Sir Andrew. 'Someone who is merely a regulator might make rules which harm the market,' he says. And privately, exchange board members acknowledge that, without its regulatory role, it could no longer confer such a valuable imprimatur on companies listed on it and it would lose what is probably its most valuable competitive advantage. The stock exchange is getting little help from a UK government philosophically committed to promoting competition. As a result, it has surrendered its monopoly over the distribution of price-sensitive information about companies it lists. Also, it has announced it will no longer provide end-user terminals for information, in recognition of its inability to compete commercially with other providers, such as Reuters. The good news for the stock exchange is that, broadly speaking, its users are emotionally committed to the maintenance of a central marketplace and believe the exchange is the best suited to operate it. Also, they are happy with the service it provides. Mr Geoffrey Lindey, vice-chairman of the investment committee of the shareholders' group, the National Association of Pension Funds, says: 'I can't think of any major change we would make. 'We don't care how the service is delivered; what we want is a well-ordered, regulated market which provides liquidity and transparency. And liquidity is number one.' But such satisfaction does not mean that the leading institutional investors will never defect from the stock exchange to the new technologies, if they perceive additional benefits to be gained there. If this commercial challenge is the greatest long-term threat to the exchange, the shorter-term problems loom at least as large in public discussion. The inability of the stock exchange to replace Mr Rawlins has given the impression of an institution adrift. Sir Andrew is due to retire in November 1994, and leadership at the top remains a question. When Mr Rawlins left, the exchange also abandoned his controversial vision of the way forward for trading in London. He urged a three-tier market, with large liquid European stocks traded using a marketmaking system in which dealers agree to make two-way prices at all times. Large domestic stocks would be traded in this fashion as well. Smaller stocks could be traded on an 'order-driven' basis, where those wishing to buy or sell would post their offers. Small illiquid stocks could be traded using a 'specialist' system similar to that on the NYSE. 'There is no demand for the Rawlins vision,' Sir Andrew says. 'That does not mean that 10 years from now there won't be.' But what vision the stock exchange has of itself, as technology evolves and markets become more international, remains unclear. Sir Andrew says the exchange's main function is to provide a means of converting long-term savings into capital and to help companies raise capital as cheaply as possible. That means running an efficient and orderly market where 'we encourage investors to put up money knowing they can get it back when they need it'. And settlement is part of that, he says. The Bank of England is now heading a project to produce a successor to Taurus. Sir Andrew believes that, in spite of the Taurus debacle, the exchange should continue to have a role in settlement, either through representation on the board of the entity that emerges from the Bank's study or through partial ownership. Yet the Bank has suggested there is no role for the stock exchange to play in settlements at all. Despite the Taurus affair, the exchange seems reluctant to give up the idea that it should be in the business of building systems, not just operating the commercial systems of others. Several board members revolted earlier this year over the exchange's plans to build a successor to Seaq with the help of Andersen Consulting. Instead, they wanted a cheaper option proposed by Nasdaq, the US-based exchange which is also updating its technology. Eventually, Sir Andrew, who championed the home-grown system to be known as Seaquence, got a majority of board members to approve the home-grown system, but not without deep misgivings on the part of several. The new system, Sir Andrew says, will be adaptable to what may be the future of the stock exchange: a bifurcated market with different terms and different regulations for professional and retail investors. Privately, several board members believe this is the route the exchange should be pursuing. Yet it may suggest higher costs and poorer prices for retail investors, and so may be politically unpalatable. Amid these uncertainties, the exchange's vision of how it intends to adapt itself to increasing competition and a technological revolution remains unclear. If it fails to develop a coherent view of how it is to survive, it risks the drift towards irrelevance which befell other once-glorious City institutions, such as the discount houses, the Port of London Authority, and Lloyd's. After all, they had walls full of portraits, too.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Chelsea blooms anew THE CHELSEA Crafts Fair, now in its 13th year, seems to gain in reputation and prestige every year, if not in size. Few would probably dare to quarrel with its own assessment of itself as 'Europe's Finest Crafts Fair'. Gathered together under one roof is a vast range of individual, original hand-made work ranging from something as familiar as a traditional white willow picnic basket, as simple as a wooden bowl, and as eccentric as a curvy candlestick embellished with opals. There are uniquely expensive pieces such as the Stevenson Brothers' hand-carved rocking horses (which it seems adults are as much addicted to as children), Roger Copple's wooden chess set or Alex Monroe's intricate brass sundials, all of which might make special anniversary presents and could be passed down from one generation to another. But there is also a great deal that seems very well-priced, like Diane Flint's 10in high pewter candlesticks, photographed here right, which cost Pounds 28 for the pair and come embellished with opals. There are some exquisitely simple ash and oak bowls by James Marston which range from Pounds 15 upwards or little wooden toys by Roger Copple from Pounds 5, and lots of beautiful jewellery with a great deal to choose from at under Pounds 50. Pictured below is a collection of Mark Nuell's rings - all are hand-made from silver and 22 carat gold and he uses precious and semi-precious stones which he hand-cuts. Prices start at Pounds 100 for ear-rings; the rings are Pounds 170 each. As usual the fair is on at the Chelsea Old Town Hall, King's Road, London SW3 and runs for two weeks. There is a complete change of exhibitors after the first week so anybody with a serious interest in the crafts really needs to go both weeks. The first week runs from October 6 to 11 and the second from October 13 to 18. The entrance fee is Pounds 4 for a single visit, Pounds 6 for one visit during each week.</p>

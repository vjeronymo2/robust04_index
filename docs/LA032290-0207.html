			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DOLAN NO-HITTER LIFTS SAN CLEMENTE  </P> <P> Pitcher Ken Dolan is off to an impressive start for the San Clemente High  School baseball team this season, but you wouldn't know it by his record.  </P> <P> In his first two starts, Dolan struck out 15 batters and allowed one earned  run. For his efforts, he had an 0-2 record.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Dolan was more impressive, throwing a no-hitter against Capistrano  Valley. And this time he even got the victory.  </P> <P> The Tritons made the most of Cougar mistakes and managed to hold their errors  to a minimum for a 4-2 South Coast League victory at San Clemente.  </P> <P> "The last couple of weeks my arm has been a little dead," said Dolan, a junior.  "I took special care of it last night to get it loose. When I was warming up  today, I knew I had my fastball with me."  </P> <P> That was evident from the start.  </P> <P> Dolan kept the Cougars off-balance by mixing his fastball, which has been  clocked at 86 miles per hour, with his knuckle curve. He struck out the first  three batters he faced on 12 pitches.  </P> <P> For the game, Dolan (1-2) struck out 10, including three of the last five  batters he faced.  </P> <P> When the Cougars did manage to hit the ball, it didn't go far. Only one ball  was hit out of the infield off Dolan.  </P> <P> "When Kenny knows he's going against a good team, he gets really pumped up,"  San Clemente Coach Joe Miller said. "He seems to do well against quality  opponents."  </P> <P> No one knows that more than Capistrano Valley Coach Bob Zamora.  </P> <P> Wednesday's game marked the third time in three seasons that Dolan has beaten  the Cougars. As a freshman, he pitched a one-hitter against Capistrano Valley  in only his second start on the varsity.  </P> <P> Last season, Dolan allowed only five hits in a 2-1 victory over the Cougars.  </P> <P> "The kid seems to have our number," Zamora said. "His curveball is very  difficult to read. By the time you do, it's past you."  </P> <P> But Dolan almost gave the game away in the fourth inning. After breezing  through the first nine batters, he opened the fourth by hitting Mike Lavin. The  Tritons then made three errors that allowed the Cougars to score two runs.  </P> <P> Two of the errors were committed by Dolan. First, he booted a sacrifice bunt  and later in the inning he made a throwing error, which allowed the Cougars to  score their second run.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley might have had a bigger inning, but Dan Zamora was caught in  a rundown to end the inning.  </P> <P> "I just blew it that inning," Dolan said. "I made an error and let it get to  me. Fortunately, the team got me some runs early, so that inning didn't hurt me  too much."  </P> <P> San Clemente (2-4 overall, 1-0 in league) gave Dolan an early lead by scoring  four runs in the first inning. The Cougars (4-3, 0-1) lent a helping hand in  the inning with an error, a passed ball and three wild pitches.  </P> <P> Losing pitcher Travis Burgus (2-1) settled down after the first inning,  allowing only one hit and striking out five in the final five innings.  </P> <P> "We just gave it away in the first," Zamora said. "Travis gave up four hits and  struck out five. You would think he'd get a win with numbers like those."  </P> <P> And he might have. Except Wednesday was Dolan's day.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 3, Dana Hills 1 -- Steve Evans allowed eight hits, struck out six  and walked two (2-1) to lead Mission Viejo (3-2-1, 1-0). Don Disbro had a  double and two runs batted in in the first inning for the Diablos. Dana Hills'  Mike Robertson had four hits.  </P> <P> Irvine 5, El Toro 4 (9 innings) -- Mike Seal's double in the bottom of the  ninth inning drove in the winning run for Irvine (4-4, 1-0). Mark Huffman left  off the bottom of the inning with his fourth hit. It was Seal's third hit. John  Bretva (2-1) pitched all nine innings, striking out nine, walking two and  allowing six hits.  </P></p>

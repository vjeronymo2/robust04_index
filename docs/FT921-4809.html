			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Nigeria government braced for test over exchange rate NIGERIA'S military government braced itself for its toughest test since taking office in 1985 as the official rate of the naira fell from 10.6 to 17.8 to the US dollar. The central bank set the rate for the last time yesterday. From Monday it will be implementing Thursday night's decision to let the naira float, but yesterday's fixing has already closed the gap between the official and parallel rates. This meets one of the main conditions of a new stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund currently being negotiated in Lagos. The current IMF agreement, due to expire in April, was effectively suspended in mid-1991 after the government slipped from agreed economic targets. A new agreement would pave the way to further rescheduling of Nigeria's approximately Dollars 30bn external debt. Both the business community and western creditor governments have been stunned by the boldness of the government decision. 'It was a coup de theatre and the IMF was in the audience,' commented one astonished western diplomat. At this week's foreign exchange auction, now discontinued, the country's 120 banks bid for Dollars 407m at between 12.75 and 14 naira to the US dollar. The central bank said yesterday it would sell at 17.8 naira, and gave the banks until close of business on Monday to follow through their bids or reduce the amount of dollars sought. Most banks will have to cut back their applications, particularly in the light of the liquidity squeeze government is expected to introduce. Bankers had expected the central bank to conform to past practice and establish the rate within the range of bids. Praise from abroad for the government's action will be tempered by continuing concern at levels of public expenditure, particularly on large-scale projects such as the Ajaokuta steel complex and the on-going construction of an aluminium smelter complex. At home, many Nigerians are greeting the devaluation with a mixture of incredulity and anger. Local press reports, based on a government briefing two weeks ago, had led them to believe government would take steps to strengthen the naira. Anger stems from the belief that there will be a sharp rise in the cost of living. Government officials say any rise will be modest. The majority of manufacturers pay for most of their imports and raw materials with foreign exchange bought above official rate, and consumer prices already reflect this. Locally grown staple foods will hardly be affected, say officials. Candidates in the elections for a civilian president, due to take place at the end of the year, are unlikely to come to the military government's assistance. Many have promised a return to a 'realistic rate for the naira', conjuring up the oil-boom era of the late 1970's when the naira was worth more than one dollar.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Porvair advance 20% PORVAIR, which manufact-ures microporous plastics and metals for clothing and industrial applications, lifted pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the year to November 30. Profits benefited from last February's Pounds 3.3m rights issue which cut interest charges by Pounds 163,000 to Pounds 263,000. Debt and gearing fell from Pounds 3.59m and 36 per cent before the rights issue to Pounds 3.15m and 28 per cent at the year-end. The rights proceeds also funded July's Pounds 2.4m purchase of Accumatics Filtration, a producer of porous metal materials for use in filtration. Porvair Ceramics, which markets pressure casting equipment and microporous moulds, lost Pounds 230,000 and took a write-off of Pounds 207,000 of marketing and development costs. Group turnover was Pounds 17.9m - including Pounds 1.05m from acquisitions - against Pounds 16.6m. The tax charge for the year was lower than expected at Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 347,000) after previous over-provisions. Earnings per share rose to 11.6p (10.5p). The final dividend is lifted to 2.4p (2.1p) for a total of 3.6p (3.2p), an increase of 12.5 per cent. The company said it was looking for suitable acquisitions in filtration and medical diagnostic devices.</p>

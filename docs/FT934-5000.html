			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: More cash for legal aid Legal aid, the main single component of expenditure by the Lord Chancellor's Departments, is planned to increase from an estimated Pounds 1,254m this year to Pounds 1,633m in 1996-97. This reflects demand-led increases in workload, combined with measures to secure improved value for money by better cost control. The Lord Chancellor's target is to ensure that, by March 1996, average costs per case do not increase by more than inflation.</p>

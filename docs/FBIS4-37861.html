			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, chairman of </F> the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation, in Jerusalem,  by Fayiz al-Miliji in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue  From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] Now that the transmission of the  Palestinian television has started in the Jericho area, we want  to know what are the problems facing you? Also, will there be a  similar radio broadcast?    [Abu-'Ayyash] There are many problems are facing the radio  and television transmission process in Palestine. As for the  radio, we are currently connecting the transformers and  transmitters in Ramallah, which were owned by the Palestinians  before 1967, with the two studios constructed in Jericho and  Gaza Strip. We need a few days to complete the connection. We  implore Almighty God to help us to transmit to the West Bank and  Gaza Strip as well as some parts of the towns in the fraternal  neighboring countries.    [Al-Miliji] What areas which will be covered by the  transmission?    [Abu-'Ayyash] With God's help and care, the transmission  will  cover the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the first stage, and after  a few months we will be able to reach some neighboring areas  such as the Jordan Valley; the pre-1948 territories, Israel; and  certain parts of Sinai. However, this transmission will not be  able to reach Egypt, Syria, Jordan, or Lebanon.    [Al-Miliji] Does this transmission involve both radio and  television?    [Abu-'Ayyash] I am indeed talking about the radio  transmission, which will operate on a medium-wave AM frequency  of 594 [kiloHertz]. This band will cover this area.    [Al-Miliji] What about the television transmission?    [Abu-'Ayyash] We have started experimental television  transmissions in the Jericho area. Work is underway to connect  it with the Gaza region. The television transmission will be  completed in 10 days, God willing. We will be able to cover  Gaza and Jericho after the completion of the structure of the  television network in the West Bank towns and Gaza Strip. At a  later stage this television transmission will be able to cover a  wider area, including the entire West Bank and major parts of  Israel and the Jordan Valley, the Lebanese borders in the north,  and the 'Aqaba and Eilat in the south.    [Al-Miliji] Can you tell us about your cooperation with some  foreign and some Arab countries in this field?    [Abu-'Ayyash] As for the Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan  are  the only two countries that have extended help to the  Palestinian radio and television project, which represents a  national plan within the infrastructure of the future  Palestinian state. Fraternal Jordan has trained 25 male and  female students in this field. They graduated after a six-week  course. We will send 80 candidates to Egypt for the same  intensive course. We hope that the Islamic Bank will release  the necessary funds for accomodations. The Egyptian Information  Ministry has donated 100,000 Egyptian pounds to finance the  building of studios and the hiring of instructors needed for  this course.    [Al-Miliji] How many people will be coming to Cairo?    [Abu-'Ayyash] It is hoped that 70 to 80 people will go to  Cairo for training in various radio and television fields. This  includes studio technicians, because Egypt is known for its  experience in this field. Qatar, Tunisia, and Algeria have  promised to extend assistance in this regard. We have not  received any other offers. Although we applied to the Arab  Radio Association for assistance last summer, regrettably we  have not received a sufficient response, making it difficult to  speed up the project. This is in addition to other problems.  Furthermore, dear brother, Europe has not yet released the  funds it has promised us for this project.    [Al-Miliji] Mr. Abu-'Ayyash, let us briefly discuss media  issues and their relationship to political issues. Let us begin  with the statements by Israeli leaders, led by Rabin, on  Jerusalem, particularly Rabin's statement that President 'Arafat  can visit the holy places as a Muslim?    [Abu-'Ayyash] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin from time  to time opens the issue of Jerusalem. He is well aware that the  issue of Jerusalem has been put off and is a subject for  negotiations at any time and place. He is also aware that  Muslims have lived in Jerusalem for thousands of years, and that  Jerusalem is not Israel's property and can never be so under any  circumstances. Such statements complicate matters and do not  express a genuine intention to achieve a permanent,  comprehensive, and just solution in this area. I say--as  Muslims, Christians, and Jews say--that peace begins and ends in  Jerusalem. No one can have a mandate over Jerusalem other than  those from the three religions who live there. Therefore, it is  an issue for negotiations. As for the visit by President  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to Jerusalem, he cannot visit  Jerusalem as a Muslim but, God willing, he will come to  Jerusalem, because it is part of the territory occupied in 1967,  and what applies to Jericho will definitely apply to Jerusalem,  as stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 242, which is  the basis of the settlement.    [Al-Miliji] The United States has raised the level of  Palestinian representation in Washington to that of a foreign  mission. How do you view this step and its significance?    [Abu-'Ayyash] This was really an important and significant  step. Palestinian leadership circles have worked for such a  decision for a long time. This is also the result of the role  other Arab forces, particularly fraternal Egypt, have played to  promote the process of peace based on justice. Such a step was  natural, particularly after Israel, through the signing of the  agreement, recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people. In my view, this U.S.  step is important and useful and will promote the peace process  and encourage the forces that believe in peace to achieve a just  peaceful solution in all the area and on all tracks.</p>

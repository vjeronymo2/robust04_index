			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Plan to create more jobs endorsed The Naples summit endorsed a seven-point plan to deal with the 'unacceptable waste' of unemployment, which stands at 24m in the G7 countries and 35m throughout nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister and summit chairman, said economic recovery was already creating jobs and putting the unemployed back to work in 'more and more' of the G7 countries. Mr Berlusconi said the jobs plan would build on the conclusions of the OECD Jobs Study published last month, which recommended a broadly deregulatory path to accelerate employment creation. The seven-point plan drawn up by the leaders calls for: Improved skills through better education and training; Reduced labour rigidities through lower indirect employment costs and fewer regulations; Active labour market policies to enhance incentives for the unemployed to seek work; Assistance to promote innovation and the spread of new technology, including an integrated infrastructure for global communications; Job creation in the leisure and environmental protection industries, which are regarded as potential high-growth areas; Increased competition through elimination of unnecessary regulations; Programmes to enrol employers and trade unions in the search for new jobs. Officials conceded that the programme adds little to the conclusions of the OECD report and the Detroit summit on jobs, called by President Clinton, which preceded it. There was no binding agreement on how to implement the plan, leaving G7 countries free to decide how to apply it to such contentious issues as minimum wage legislation and social security programmes. However, the agreement was hailed as a break-through by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who set out to make job creation one of the main themes of the summit. Mr Major said the impact of the plan would be to commit the G7 governments to the principles of deregulation and labour market reforms to create lasting jobs. 'That was a very novel idea two years ago when it was produced primarily, though not exclusively, by the British,' he said. Mr Major said the growing pace of economic recovery and the G7 leaders' commitment to consider further trade liberalisation measures next year would help to raise growth rates and create more jobs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "GATT Out"] </F>   [Text] Opposition leaders say that GATT was not an issue in  the recent by-elections. They are shaken by the fact that they  failed to make a dent in the Congress armour. Their frenzied  rallies and nightmarish stories about MNCs [multinational  corporations] invasion were conveniently forgotten. But it was  an issue, says the Congress spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, gleefully.  He interprets the election results as vindication of his  party's stand on GATT and the voters' rejection of the  opposition propaganda. Considering the asinine way in which  both sides presented the case for and against GATT in the rural  areas, it would seem that they think voters are morons. The  party strategists' confusion was ably summed up by the BJP's  [Bharatiya Janata Party] general secretary, the 'whizchalak'  [whiz kid] Govindacharya, when he said the elections were not  contested on any specific issue like GATT and the agenda was  dominated by local issues.    In that statement lies a glimmer of political understanding.  Except when there is a charismatic leader, elections tend to get  fought on local issues. Like the politician, the voter wants to  know what he or she will get out of the polls. Voters are  willing to forgive a leader his corruption provided he can get  things done for his constituency. Voters can be united on one  issue only when there is a fear of a systemic breakdown, when  the arrogance of power rides roughshod over citizens' basic  rights or a weak central authority allows the emergence of local  dons. Voters then demand a drastic change and vote with a  vengeance to achieve their goal. Political skill lies in  watching the swing of the pendulum -- the ruling party's task is  to slow it down and the opposition's to accelerate it.    Experience has made the Indian voter wary. He has noted that  non-Congress governments do not impart a better direction. He  then gives them a thump on the head, and the Congress soon  restores the familiar status quo. And it's back to local issues  again, at which Congress leaders have shown themselves more  adept than the opposition ones who all vie for national glory  right from the outset. The opposition would fare better if they  borrowed President Clinton's slogan and put up a modification in  all their party offices: "It's the local economy, stupid".</p>

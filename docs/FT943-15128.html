			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Central banks in Germany and the US met last week and did nothing to change interest rates; finance ministers of the G7 countries met in Naples and decided not to launch co-ordinated action to support the US dollar. According to Mr Adolf Rosenstock at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, this creates 'the imminent risk of a massive shake-out in the foreign exchange market'. However, with bund prices displaying 'remarkable resilience' in the face of dollar weakness, Mr Rosenstock believes German government securities are in a good position to weather any storm that breaks early this week. Support from fundamentals will come from two sets of data due in the next few days - retail sales for May and wholesale prices for June. Both figures are likely to add to the picture suggested by recent industrial output and manufacturing order data: that the German recovery from recession is less pronounced than seemed the case earlier in the year, and the risk of a corresponding upsurge in inflation that much less. Towards the end of the week, traders may start looking ahead to June money supply data, likely to be released next Thursday when the Bundesbank policy-making council meets to review the development of M3 in the year to date.</p>

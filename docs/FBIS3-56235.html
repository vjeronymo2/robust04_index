President Leonid  Kravchuk, a cochairman of the Constitutional Commission, said in  his introductory remarks that the conference is supposed to  explore avenues for a constitutional process in Ukraine because  it "is a state recognized by the world community, hence it  should not stand aloof from civilized constitutional norms."  According to Leonid Kravchuk, the objective of passing a new  constitution should be such a separation of the functions of  powers where "each power branch should be authoritative, not  authoritarian." Leonid Kravchuk outlined his own pattern of  such a separation of the functions of powers: The president is  taken out of the system of executive branch to become head of  state; the parliament remains the sole legislative organ  carrying out the legislative, founding, and control functions;  whereas the prime minister, who becomes head of the executive  branch and forms the government, shall be accountable to  parliament in all respects.    In Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, one of the acceptable ways to  pass a new constitution is a nationwide referendum which can be  held simultaneously with the parliamentary elections on 27 March  -- but to enable this, the mechanics for the final discussion  and approval of the constitution's text and its passage via  parliament should be determined. Leonid Kravchuk named as  another condition for putting the constitution to a referendum  the elimination of all political inconsistencies in the text of  the fundamental law that could aggravate the standoff in society.    Leonid Kravchuk specified as other options for setting in  motion a constitutional process in Ukraine the passing of a law  on power if it proves impossible to put the constitution to a  referendum. A draft of such a law elaborated by the president's  team was handed out to those present.    Much as had been expected, those who spoke after him  differed  in their opinions. Some deputies spoke for passing the  constitution, some spoke for passing the law on power.  Gradually one more proposal jelled -- to approve the text of a  new constitution by a constitutional assembly, an ad hoc body.  But the final decision on this matter would most probably be  made by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, whose ninth session will open  on 20 January. Advocates of soviet power, who press for a  purely parliamentary republic, will say what they think about  the constitution at a conference of the chairmen of oblast  Soviets of People's Deputies in Kiev on 18 and 19 January. It is  this conference that its organizers think should come to replace  the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets. Parliament Chairman Ivan  Plyushch, another cochairman of the Constitutional Commission,  will deliver a report at this conference.    According to Leonid Kravchuk, the adoption of a constitution  in Ukraine should be followed by deciding on a system of local  power, and a balance should be struck between the powers of the  center and those of the regions that could please everyone.  Many speakers warned Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch against  dividing powers between Kiev and oblast centers in such a way  that would split Ukraine into 25 autonomous republics.</p>

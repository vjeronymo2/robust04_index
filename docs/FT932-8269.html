			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Positive stance on generators A CHANGE of stance by one of the market's leading securities houses saw the two English power generators substantially outperform the utilities areas and the wider market. SG Warburg Securities was said by dealers to have shifted its recommendation on National Power and PowerGen from 'add' to 'buy'. Warburg was said to have emphasised the two companies' 'extremely encouraging' dividend growth prospects, and to have told its clients that it was not unduly concerned by the supposed regulatory threat to the two stocks. National Power raced up to end 9 higher at 333p on turnover of 2.6m shares, while PowerGen settled the same amount to the good at 343p after trade of 3.4m. Along with other brokers, Warburg expects the generators to achieve dividend increases of 15 per cent or more over the next few years. The regional electricity companies are scheduled to report preliminary results starting next month and are expected to post dividend rises of up to 15 per cent. Scottish Power, expected to announce a 10 per cent increase in the dividend total when it announces its full year results tomorrow, moved up 4 to 311p. The strength of the generators' shares powered the electricity sub-sector of the FT- Actuaries Indices to a 1.1 per cent rise, compared with a 0.3 per cent gain in the water sub-sector and a 0.4 per cent decline in the FT-SE 100 Index.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sudanese ambassador to Stockholm has disputed  claims that he has resigned and asked for political asylum in  Sweden. Sources in the Sudanese capital claimed over the weekend  that Mohammad Zein left his post after the Sudanese Government  recalled him to Khartoum, but the ambassador said today he had  no intention of resigning. Sudanese sources said Mr. Zein had  held office under the former government of Sadeq al-Mahdi, who  was arrested last week on conspiracy charges.</p>

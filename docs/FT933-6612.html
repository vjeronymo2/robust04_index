			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Reader's Digest marks time READER'S Digest Association, the New York-based publisher of books, magazines and other products, yesterday disappointed investors by reporting only a 2 per cent gain in underlying net income for the fourth quarter. The result reflected the continued weakness of its US books and home entertainment business. And Wall Street reacted by marking down the company's shares by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 38 7/8 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange. Net income for the quarter ended June edged higher to Dollars 26.8m, or 23 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 644.4m. The result compares with net income of Dollars 26.2m, or 22 cents, and Dollars 605.4m in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. When restated to reflect changes in accounting for post retirement benefit, net income for the 1993 period was Dollars 25.8m, or 22 cents. International revenues in the 1993 period showed a solid 11 per cent increase, and would have been 17 per cent higher without adverse exchange rate movements. However, US revenues were unchanged from the year-earlier period. Mr George Grune, chairman, said the company had made some progress in restoring the books and home entertainment division to its historic level of growth, but warned that it may require 12 to 24 months to complete the process. For the full year, the company posted a 12 per cent gain in underlying net income. A strong performance in overseas markets also was largely responsible for the yearly advance. Revenues in the US increased only slightly, with the domestic books and home entertainment segment turning in weaker sales on the year.</p>

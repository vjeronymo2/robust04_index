			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The left in disarray The French Socialists' decision to ditch Michel Rocard is hardly surprising, after their miserable score in the European election. But it would be sad if this marked the end of Mr Rocard's political career. For 20 years he has been the leading spokesman within the party for the arguments of reason, of economic as well as political liberalism, and indeed of reality. He has been handicapped throughout by President Mitterrand's ill-concealed, and on the whole ill deserved, resentment. In pure politics Mr Rocard was never Mr Mitterrand's equal, and the fact that he has failed to revive his party's fortunes after its landslide defeat in last year's parliamentary elections can hardly be denied. It seems that Mr Jacques Delors may have a better chance of success. But it is also clear that the crisis of French socialism, indeed of socialism Europe-wide or even worldwide, goes well beyond questions of personality. The existence of such a crisis is only loosely connected to the fall of communism in eastern Europe. It was already visible well before 1989. The central doctrine of socialism, namely collective ownership, had been seen to be inefficient. More modest goals - the levelling of economic differentials, the welfare state, the right of workers to organise and defend their interests collectively within the workplace - had long since been accepted in principle by most European conservatives. The latter challenged them only at the point where they they became difficult to defend: where redistributive taxation put too great a burden on the taxpayer, where deficit-financed public spending threatened national bankruptcy and hyperinflation, or where trade union power became a serious obstacle to economic growth. In Britain and Germany, during the 1980s and early 1990s, socialists have failed repeatedly in their attempts to regain power, and have been driven to accept more and more of their opponents' policies. In France and Spain socialist parties were able to remain in power through most of this period, but only because voters trusted them to blunt the sharper edges of a policy shift towards economic freedom, which the socialists themselves acknowledged as necessary and were prepared to carry out. But in the recession of the early 1990s they found themselves unable to deliver on that promise, and are now paying the electoral price. Fairness might seem to require that British and German socialists should now be given a chance. But, on last week's showing, German voters may not be ready to take that risk come October; while British voters will not have the opportunity to do so for at least another two years. The European left may find encouragement in the efforts of President Bill Clinton to elaborate a new agenda on such issues as healthcare and welfare. But that has to be tempered by awareness that espousing policies similar to those of Mr Clinton would involve a shift to the right far greater than most European social democrat parties are prepared to contemplate. In much of western Europe, the left has ceased to exist as a clear alternative to conservatism or neo-liberalism. That may be a good thing in as much as the old left's economic policies were misguided and ruinous. But in as much as democracy is supposed to be about choice it is rather troubling. Disgruntled voters may be tempted, as in Italy, to plump for the unknown.</p>

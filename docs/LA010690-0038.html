My "compliments" to you on your selection, for the front  page, of the slobbiest, crudest and surely most revolting picture you must have  -- one of comedian Sam Kinison.  </P> <P> Editorial qualifications do not require consideration of the reading public's  sensibilities anymore?  </P> <P> ELIZABETH J.

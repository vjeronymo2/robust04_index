			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poorer yields take toll on JCI gold division The gold division of South African mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, which is due to be spun off to black investors early next year, has reported a sharp drop in profits for the September quarter. Although ore production rose 5 per cent to 2.7m tonnes from 2.55m tonnes in June, a lower average yield meant overall gold revenue increased by only 3.5 per cent to R557.9m (Dollars 157.6m) from R539.1m. Group profits fell 36.6 per cent to R98m from R154m, as all the group's mines reported poorer after-tax profits. However, this was blamed largely on accounting changes to the previous quarter's results, most notably the restatement of figures to reflect a successful insurance claim at Western Areas. As a result, Western Areas showed the most dramatic fall in after-tax profit, of 51.7 per cent to R36.5m from R75.46m. Randfontein was down 21.8 per cent to R60.2m from R76.9m. Struggling HJ Joel fell 37.7 per cent, with after-tax profits down to R1.41m from R2.27m, in spite of a shift to a seven-day working week. However, Mr Kennedy Maxwell, gold division chairman, said the results were satisfactory in the prevailing climate. He was optimistic that the gold price would remain in its current trading range of Dollars 370-Dollars 400, which would benefit the group. Randgold and Exploration, the troubled mining group subject to a management takeover by a consortium led by British merchant bank SG Warburg in August, has continued its downward slide, as two of its four mines reported a loss for the September quarter. Overall, the group's net attributable profit dropped sharply to just R4.3m from R30.8m the previous quarter. This was in spite of an improved gold price. Only Harmony, which reported profits after capital expenditure of R8.63m, up from R7.5m in June, showed improvement.</p>

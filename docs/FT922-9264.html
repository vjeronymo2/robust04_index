			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris makes late spurt as interest rates fall THE prospect of easier money lifted Paris ahead of the long weekend, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS made a late spurt on the Bank of France's disguised interest rate cut. The CAC 40 index closed just below the day's highs at 2,063.40, up 16.25, in turnover just short of FFr3bn. The markets is closed today for a national holiday. Financials, which had anticipated lower interest rates, strengthened further. Paribas gained FFr11.90 to FFr446.90 and Suez added FFr3 to FFr346, while Bancaire surged FFr32 or 6.6 per cent to FFr517. Michelin gained FFr2.9 to FFr214.9 in heavy trading of 1.2m shares, bloated by a big put-through. FRANKFURT traded in a narrow range as talks continued between the government and unions to end the strike. The DAX index closed up 7.31 at 1,750.81 after opening at 1,750.40. The FAZ index was 2.1 firmer at 706.80, while turnover rose to DM6.5bn from DM6.3bn. Daimler-Benz advanced DM4.50 to DM791.50 after positive comments from Mr Edzard Reuter, the chairman, in which he forecast good earnings growth in 1992. Volkswagen continued to gain on Wednesday's strong results, up DM2.80 at DM388.80, but Porsche slid DM30 or 5.6 per cent to the year's low of DM500 in the absence of news. Preussag advanced DM9.10 to DM412.10 on reports that it had sold its 3.5 per cent stake in Australian mining group MIM. Mannesmann gained DM1 to DM284.50 before reporting a 43 per cent fall in 1991 group net profit after the close. Better-than-expected first quarter figures lifted Hochtief shares DM25 to DM1,265. MILAN continued to recover, but prices ended off the session's highs on worries that the Milan corruption scandal could widen to Rome. The Comit index rose 1.66 to 497.41 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's L114bn. Cogefar, one of the construction companies which has been tainted by the scandal, closed L165 down at L3,555. Shares in the insurer RAS were suspended, a move which disconcerted the market, ahead of the announcement of a one-for-four rights issue with warrants. Its parent Allianz said it would take up its quota of the L531bn cash call. The insurer also reported a steep rise in 1991 parent company net profit, which dealers said was due to extraordinary items to sweeten the capital increase. Fiat rose L91 to L5,150 on program buying from London. The release of favourable April car industry data after the close pushed Fiat higher on London's Seaq. ZURICH lost ground after its record-breaking run earlier this week. The SMI index shed 0.5 to 1,936.8. Most blue chip stocks were weaker with Nestle bearers easing SFr10 to SFr9,990 and Brown Boveri bearers losing SFr50 to SFr4,250. However, banks and insurers managed to retain some early gains: UBS bearers advanced SFr10 to SFr3,840 and Zurich bearers put on SFr20 to SFr4,440. STOCKHOLM continued to focus on Volvo as the company made a presentation to fund managers in London. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 3.6 to 1,007.9 in heavy turnover of SKr787m from SKr768m. Volvo B unrestricted shares added SKr6 to SKr436 on optimism for a 1992 earnings recovery and an early merger with Renault. The stock has also been recommended by James Capel as a 'buy'. Ericsson eased SKr3 to SKr132 ahead of reporting a worse-than-expected first quarter pre-tax loss of SKr363m. The company forecast a 'very weak' first half and a 'low' full-year profit. AMSTERDAM was weaker with the CBS Tendency index shedding 0.2 to 129.9 in turnover of Fl 896.4m. Philips lost another 90 cents at Fl 37.10 on Wednesday's disappointing first quarter figures, while Polygram gained 60 cents to Fl 51 on a US buy note. There was active options-related trading in Nedlloyd, and its shares advanced Fl 1.40 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 61.50, but off the day's high of Fl 62.90. KLM gained 70 cents to Fl 39.80 after plans to strengthen its air cargo business, while Daf, which launched two new trucks, lost 30 cents to Fl 24.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1184.65  1184.08  1183.93  1183.83  1184.10  1183.56  1182.58  1182.52  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1184.78             Day's Low  1182.03  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        May 6         May 5         May 1        Apr 30       Apr 29       1182.62       1178.23       1175.00      1174.96      1174.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

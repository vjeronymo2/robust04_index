			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEN HOUSES DEFENDED AS VALUABLE SALES  </P> <P> I read "Open Houses May Be Waste of Time" (by Ellen L. James, oct. 28) with  great dismay.  </P> <P> More than 12 years ago I began selling real estate for Fred Sands Realtors.  </P> <P> I was advised by many people that Sunday open houses weren't worthwhile. I  heard, "Do everything you can to get out of doing open houses. Convince the  sellers it's just a waste of time."  </P> <P> Initially, I heeded their advice. I then had an exerpience for which I am very  thankful. I listed a home in Beverly Hills. On a Sunday afternoon I saw the  owner's brother at a local restaurant. He asked why I as not holding his  siter's house open. I told him, "Open houses are a waste of time." He said he  had recently purchased his home after seeing it at a Sunday open house.  </P> <P> That evening his sister called me to request that I hold her home open on  Sundays. I reluctantly agreed, and a few weeks latewr the house was sold  thorugh a Sunday open house. After that, I held homes open every Sunday. That  same year I sold my own home to a couple who saw it at a Sunday open house.  </P> <P> I never insist that my sellers have open houses. If they prefer not to, it is  their choce. I try to use every tool available to sell the properties I  represent. Sunday open houses make the sale in at leat 10% of my listings.  </P> <P> Open houses are only a waste of time if your home is overpriced. When your  property is priced competitively, a Sunday open house can only increase your  chances of selling.  </P> <P> CLAUDIA DEKOVEN, Brentwood  </P></p>

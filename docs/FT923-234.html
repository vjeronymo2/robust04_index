			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): No room for glossies in the UK - The failure of general business magazines 'FINANCE to fine art': that is what purchasers were promised at the high-profile launch in 1986 of Business magazine. A gap - or so it was thought - had been spotted for a high quality magazine dealing with business issues and interests. And, with the Financial Times contributing its firm grasp of what the business world wanted, and with the US group, Conde Nast, offering its expertise in producing Vogue and other glossy magazines, it was difficult to see how the project could fail, especially under the overall control of minority shareholder Kevin Kelly, founder of one of the publishing successes of the 1980s, World of Interiors. Yet only five years later the two groups were forced to retire with heavy losses, having failed to overturn one of the unwritten rules of UK publishing - that a market does not exist for a successful, paid-for, general business magazine. The timing for the launch of Business could not have been more favourable. In 1986 the stock market was still rising and unemployment falling. The banks were falling over themselves to lend money for business start-ups, or simply for personal consumption. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Business set out to write about the individuals who had become icons of the new boom age - not just successful businessmen such as Lord Hanson, Sir John Harvey-Jones and Richard Branson, but the likes of advertising enfant terrible Graham Fink, PR man extraordinaire, Brian Basham, restaurant PR, Alan Crompton-Batt, and designer Wally Olins. Others were similarly tempted by the apparent opportunities. Eurobusiness, launched shortly after Business, was an attempt to capitalise on the growing integration of European business. During its existence, Business was not lacking in critical acclaim, or, for most of the time, advertising. Prizes it won included 'Magazine of the Year' and 'Business Magazine of the Year'. Its journalists also kept winning awards. Until the bottom fell out of the advertising market in 1991, it also managed to attract some of the most stylish advertising around, from overseas banks, prestige carmakers, men's clothing manufacturers and other advertisers anxious to present their wares in a high-quality environment. Yet, in the words of its former chairman, Conde Nast's Daniel Salem, Business was only a succes d'estime, and it never attracted readers in sufficient numbers to keep going. Everybody seemed to love it, including British Airways, which bought it for its Concorde, First and Club Class cabins, and BMW, which advertised in every issue. Not enough people wanted to buy it, however, to keep its advertising rate card moving forward in line with inflation, or to bring in the extra advertisers that were still needed. Circulation was held only with difficulty around the 45,000 to 50,000 mark, in spite of a battery of subscriber incentives and tie-ups, including, late in the day, a deal with the Association of MBAs which bought it for all its members. The contrast with comparable European countries is at first sight puzzling. The German business magazine Capital sells more than 300,000 each month, with Manager, a broadly similar magazine to Business, on 100,000-plus. In most other European countries, too, there are strong business magazines. In the US, where the success of business magazines was seen as a good portent for a similar UK product, Forbes has a circulation above 700,000 and Fortune is not far behind with more than 650,000, while even the very solid Harvard Business Review has more than 200,000 purchasers every two months. The problem in Britain, if it is one, has to be seen in terms of the quality daily and Sunday press, and of the two main financial news magazines, the Economist and Investors Chronicles, which between them clearly offer as comprehensive a coverage of business as even the most avid business reader is likely to require, and at better publishing intervals. With a monthly publishing schedule Business, though it did get a number of scoops, always felt it had to veer towards the offbeat. Really big financial stories - such as the present UK sterling crisis - could not have been touched because the magazine was always likely to be overtaken by events. In other countries where there is a strong business magazine presence, including Germany and the US, the press is more fragmented regionally, making it much easier for nationalmagazines to position themselves at the centre of business debates. So, what options does this leave the would-be UK business magazine entrepreneur, other than to invest elsewhere? In Britain the complement to a strong national business press is a vibrant trade press, providing news, views and features and, crucially, acting as the job search medium for individuals working within the sector concerned. Because of its general nature and monthly cycle, Business was never able to act as an information board in this way Even in the trade press, successful paid-for subscriber or newsstand launches are now almost unheard-of. Most new entrants rely on the controlled circulation route, and almost all those that are paid-for, such as The Grocer, Caterer and Hotelkeeper and Estates Gazette have a long history and deeply entrenched position to protect them against newer controlled circulation rivals. In the business field, the two surviving members of the triumvirate to which Business used to belong, Management Today and The Director, both rely on controlled circulation as their core readership - managers belonging to the British Institute of Management in the one case and directors in the Institute of Directors in the other. Both groups receive copies of their respective magazines as part of their subscription. Yet, the idea of a general UK business magazine keeps cropping up and it is perhaps possible that a maverick operation might just work, as one entrepreneur, Tom Rubython, seems determined to demonstrate. His first venture into the general business magazine field was Management Week, an irreverent mix of often none too flattering personality profiles, guru potboilers, and 'management' news stories. It folded last year after not many months' publication, but has now been reborn as Business Age, complete with Business magazine's former slogan - Britain's best-selling business magazine. It may succeed, though the lessons of Business and Eurobusiness, and other general titles such as Punch and The Listener, are not encouraging. In the UK, unless there is a specialist category, or an area such as men's fashion (which as GQ and Esquire spotted was not being covered in depth in the daily press), newspapers rule. Rhys David was publisher of Business magazine from 1988-1991.</p>

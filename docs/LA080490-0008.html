			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARR STRIKES OUT SINGING THE ANTHEM  </P> <P> My grandmother just lost her food stamps. The government took them away because  her Social Security check increased $10 a month. She and her friends in the  elderly project are just barely getting by.  </P> <P> Oh, and have you seen those homeless people out in the street? Literally  millions of them there are -- not a bite to eat. In the meantime, we, the fed,  are being sold food in our markets that's laced with cancer-causing pesticides.  Hell, here in L.A., they have a quicker, new improved method: They spray the  stuff right on us.  </P> <P> And how about all those folks with AIDS? Now and then, I swear I hear a  politician mention that in a speech, but I suppose most of the big money goes  to building those nuclear power plants -- you know, the ones that leak  plutonium into our soil, into our air.  </P> <P> For years I've been wondering just what it would take for Americans to get  really angry. Now, I finally have my answer: Roseanne Barr. Congratulations,  honey! Do you realize that you've succeeded in waking up a country of comatose,  back-seat patriots? Quite a feat, I must say.  </P> <P> This is the type of patriotism that requires the least amount of time, energy,  thought and true concern for the people of this country (who, incidentally, are  the country. A flag is wonderful; a song is very nice, but the people are the  country, right?) This is truly the fast-food equivalent of standing up for  one's nation.  </P> <P> If you care that much about the honor of America, why stand around screaming  about an irreverent comedienne? Get out in the street and get your feet wet . .  . or you're wasting your breath. But hey, I've got things to do. Off with her  head! Now, where did I put that darned Constitution?  </P> <P> K. GALLI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

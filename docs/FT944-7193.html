			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Why history has a habit of repeating itself at Hilton Hotels - Chief executive Barron Hilton is once again considering a sale or break-up of the group Hilton Hotels, the US hotel and casino group, has enjoyed three-quarters of a century of independence since Conrad Hilton went into business with his first hotel in Cisco, Texas, in 1919. Now, however, that era may be coming to an end. Last week Hilton Hotels announced that it had appointed Smith Barney, the Wall Street investment bank, to explore the possibilities for 'enhancing shareholder value'. Top of the list of options was a possible sale or break-up of the company. It was an unusual move: companies quoted on the stock market are more often seen resisting bids than inviting them. But Hilton Hotels' history helps explain why. When Conrad Hilton died in 1979 - after a colourful life which included three marriages, one to the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor - he left nearly everything, including his 28 per cent stake in Hilton Hotels, to a charity set up to support Roman Catholic nuns. Conrad's son Barron, chief executive of the company since 1966, spent 10 years challenging the will, arguing that his father had wanted the company to stay under the family's control. Within weeks of triumphing and taking most of the charity's shares, he was inviting offers, saying he was only doing what his father would have done if he had seen the prices people were paying for prime hotels. The expected rush of buyers, however, did not emerge. Some potential US buyers were out of action after the collapse of the junk bond market in autumn 1989. Japanese investors stayed away because of the controversy aroused by other recent Japanese acquisitions in the US; and other foreign buyers may have been deterred by the fact that Hilton Hotels had largely removed itself from overseas markets by selling its Hilton International division in 1966. In the end, only two offers were received, both worth about Dollars 76 a share - less than Mr Hilton was prepared to accept. But it was perhaps only a matter of time before he returned to try again. The company today has more than 200 hotels in the US, mostly trading under the Hilton name, and a handful overseas, mainly trading under the Conrad name. More than half its operating profits - 64 per cent last year - come from its gaming interests, consisting mainly of its Nevada hotel-casinos. Hilton Hotels' past financial performance has not been particularly impressive. Net income has moved sideways for a decade, fluctuating around the Dollars 100m mark (see graphic); last year the company made Dollars 106.1m. This year, however, profits have been picking up. Although the gaming side has been suffering from the effects of increased competition in Las Vegas, the hotels have been benefiting from the strength of the US economy, which has brought better occupancy levels and rising room rates. Net income in the quarter to September rose by 32 per cent to Dollars 27m. Stock market analysts say the company should fetch at least Dollars 80 a share, or Dollars 3.8bn, in an outright sale. Mr Bruce Thorp, an analyst at PNC Bank, points out that the company has some very attractive assets, such as the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York and the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Hawaii. Mr Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, says: 'The brand name alone must be worth Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.' One company cited as a possible buyer is ITT, the US financial, leisure and manufacturing conglomerate. ITT recently put its ITT Financial subsidiary on the market at an asking price of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn, saying it wanted to use the proceeds to expand in leisure and entertainment. ITT already owns the Sheraton hotel chain and has been planning to enter the Las Vegas gaming market. Another possible buyer could be Ladbroke, the UK leisure and entertainment group; Ladbroke already owns Hilton International and has been seeking to expand its gaming interests. Still, Mr Vogel thinks Mr Hilton may consider alternatives to an outright sale: for example, he could spin off the gaming interests and keep the hotel business that bears the family name. Mr Terry Bivens, an analyst at Argus Research, agrees. 'Mr Hilton has some very definite tax considerations at this point,' he says - meaning that if Mr Hilton were to sell his 24.5 per cent stake in the company for cash, virtually all his profits would be taxable. Some other kind of deal - for example, a spin-off involving a stock swap - might give him the opportunity to take his profits over a longer period. Not surprisingly, the uncertainty has led to caution in the stock market. Last time Hilton Hotels was put up for sale, many investors got their fingers burned: the company's share price plunged from Dollars 115 1/2 at the peak of optimism about a deal to Dollars 49 7/8 when the auction was called off. On Wednesday, the shares closed at Dollars 69 3/4, well below what analysts think an outright sale could fetch. Wall Street, it seems, has a long memory.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Tax and US shares I OWN some Marsh and McLennan shares and I enclose a copy of the dividend paid on May 15. I would be grateful if you could explain how I mark out how much 'Tax Credit' I should show on my next tax return in respect of this dividend. The expression 'tax credit' (as distinct from 'foreign tax credit' etc) is only applicable to dividends of UK companies, which are paid without deduction of income tax. Your US dividends should be entered in the section of your tax return headed 'Other dividends . . . already taxed' not in the section headed 'Dividends from UK companies and tax credits'. You should enter the gross amount and add a note that the dividend has suffered 15 per cent US tax as well as 10 per cent UK tax. If you are exempt from tax, the tax refund will be only Pounds 6.79.* If you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will have an extra Pounds 10.19 to pay. * If you are exempt from tax on the dividend by reason of a trading loss, for example, you can elect to forgo foreign tax credit and therefore treat the dividend as reduced by the US tax to Pounds 57.73, which will leave you with an additional Pounds 10.19 loss relief available elsewhere. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

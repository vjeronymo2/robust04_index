			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Aegon rises 11% and sees further gains Aegon, the Dutch insurer, posted a 10.8 per cent rise in first-half net profit and predicted a 'clear increase' in operating profit and profit per share for 1994 as a whole. Net profit rose to Fl 550.7m (Dollars 306m) from Fl 497m, while operating profit rose 13.3 per cent to Fl 465.7m from Fl 411.1m. The net profit figure comprises operating profit plus realised gains on shares and property, which were virtually unchanged at Fl 85m compared with Fl 86m. Premium income rose 46 per cent to Fl 7.66bn, with most of the increase due to the first-time inclusion of results from Scottish Equitable Life following last year's acquisition. If this factor is excluded, premium income would have risen by 8.5 per cent. The company said foreign exchange movements had a modestly positive effect on first-half results. Aegon added it has hedged its risk against a sharp decline in the dollar against the guilder. Aegon said profits grew in the Netherlands, the US and other parts of Europe. One exception was Aegon Insurance Company (UK), the subsidiary in London, which produced disappointing results.</p>

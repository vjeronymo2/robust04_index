			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / People: Raingold goes for Pounds 40m in LSE fund-raising campaign The London School of Economics has set up its own Foundation in a move to formalise fund-raising activities ahead of the so-called 'Second Century' campaign, and hired Howard Raingold, who made his mark as Lincoln College, Oxford's fund-raiser, as its first director. In his four years at Lincoln, Raingold raised around Pounds 6m, from Old Members as well as from companies including Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Elf UK. 'The college is small, with an Old Member population in the UK of just 3,000,' he points out. 'It recruits from minor public and grammar schools; we didn't have the Sainsburys and Rothschilds in our repertoire.' Raingold, who claims that learning to fund-raise is easier - and a lot more fun - than learning to drive, says the secret is 'education, not begging. People want to belong.' He identified the third of Lincoln's Old Members who were on a salary over Pounds 30,000, and, by dint of a series of face-to-face meetings, persuaded around 70 per cent to give an average of Pounds 2,500 each. The campaign funded additional undergraduate accommodation - work on which has just started - as well as a series of junior research fellowships. Raingold hopes to be able to do the same 'with an additional nought on everything' for the LSE, which celebrates its centenary in 1995. The provisional target is to raise Pounds 40m over five years, but Raingold says much is to be decided before the official launch of the campaign, probably some time next year. With its bid for County Hall turned down, the LSE will now concentrate on improving the present Houghton Street site, as well as creating new research fellowships. Raingold, 52, went to Cambridge as a mature student in the late 1970's and took a history degree. After three years as deputy director of Shelter, he spent a year studying international history at the LSE, and then taught at two schools before applying for the Lincoln job. Lester May, 41, who worked for eight months in the public relations office of the Corporation of London on the campaign for the European Central Bank, but has otherwise been unemployed since leaving the Royal Navy in 1989, becomes deputy director. 'The best thing about it is that I can stop job hunting for the first time in four years,' he says.</p>

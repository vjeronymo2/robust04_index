			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES STALL OVER AGENDA ON MEASURE TO BAIL OUT S&amp;LS  </P> <P> The congressional conference to prepare a massive savings and loan industry  rescue bill bogged down in confusion and acrimony Thursday as House and Senate  members disagreed on procedures.  </P> <P> The Senate negotiators, in a surprise move, offered a package deal but were  quickly rebuffed by House members, who want to discuss and resolve each issue  separately.  </P> <P> The differing approaches reflect the numbers involved: There are just eight  Senate conferees, with five handling most of the bill. The House, by contrast,  has 94 participants divided into "platoons" dealing with different issues.  </P> <P> The original agenda called for the conferees to spend Thursday dealing with the  two biggest issues of the legislation: the proposed tough new financial  standards for S&amp;Ls and whether to include the full cost of the bailout in  the federal budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stringent Capital Requirement  </P> <P> After meeting separately earlier Thursday, the key Senate conferees assembled a  package proposal calling for tight capital rules and accepting a House  provision that would require S&amp;L owners to furnish $3 of their own cash for  every $100 in loans made by the institution.  </P> <P> This indicated their willingness to go beyond the bill that was passed by the  Senate -- and even to surpass the stricter House version -- by forcing the 3%  standard into effect immediately on passage of the legislation.  </P> <P> However, the Senate negotiators' package plan also calls for keeping the  financing of the S&amp;L rescue, estimated at nearly $300 billion over 30  years, off the federal budget through a special bond issue. The bill passed by  the House would require the cost of the bailout to be on the budget.  </P> <P> The senators' willingness to accept a more stringent capital requirement for  S&amp;Ls, as well as to accept the House view of some other issues, did not  impress the House members.  </P> <P> House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), clearly miffed by the  senators' surprise move, called the proposed package "raw and undefined." Its  sudden presentation "is a horrendous injustice to House conferees," Gonzalez  said after the legislators had been wrangling for several hours without  resolving a single issue.  </P> <P> "I am deeply disappointed we have wasted so much time when we could have  cleared out the capital issue," Gonzalez said. "For us to be stalled by the  Senate conferees . . . is quite unfair."  </P> <P> The leader of the Senate contingent, Banking Committee Chairman Donald W.  Riegle Jr. (D-Mich)., said the Senate proposal included "as many of the key  House provisions as we can. In many areas we are very close together." He  expressed hope that the House would consider the Senate plan and respond  quickly, enabling the conference to complete its work early next week.  </P> <P> The ranking Republican senator, Jake Garn of Utah, also appealed for a quick  response. "We can't hold the package together that we hammered out with each  other unless it is responded to by the House," he said.  </P> <P> But Gonzalez and his House colleagues were adamant that the conference should  continue with its original agenda, dealing with capital standards and the  budget financing issue, on a discrete basis, rather than trying for a broad  compromise.  </P> <P> The Senate plan "is very vague and undefined," Gonzalez said. "It is so broad  and general it doesn't contain any real offer we could entertain."  </P> <P> With S&amp;L losses continuing to mount at a rate of $500 million to $1 billion  a month, the goal of the conference is to send a bill to President Bush before  the end of the month. The legislation would provide funds to close hundreds of  insolvent thrift institutions and pay off their customers, whose deposits of up  to $100,000 are guaranteed by federal insurance.  </P></p>

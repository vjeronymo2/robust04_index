He stressed that the purposes of the visit  were to get acquainted with Chinese military leaders and help  "establish fraternal relations" between the armed forces of the  two countries.    Nurmagambetov pointed out: China is a great neighbour of  Kazakhstan. In his first visit to China as minister of defense,  he will meet with his Chinese counterpart in order to establish  dependable relations and deepen mutual understanding between the  armed forces of the two countries. He hopes that the armed  forces of Kazakhstan and China can learn from each other, share  experiences, and watch each other's military exercises.    Speaking on Kazakhstan's army building, General  Nurmagambetov  said: The structure of Kazakhstan's armed forces is based on  that of the former Soviet's forces in Kazakhstan. The military  is not large-scale; however, it will be a well-equipped army  with combat effectiveness.    General Nurmagambetov was born into a Kazakh family in 1924.  Joining the army in 1942, he participated in the Great Patriotic  War and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. As a  member of a delegation of former Soviet veterans, he visited  China in 1991. He was appointed Kazakhstan's first minister of  defense in May 1992.</p>

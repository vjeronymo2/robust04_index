			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Zhengxian (4376 2973 0341): "Quick Eye and </F> Deft Hand of Member of Joint Defense Force Seizes Drug Criminal  Crossing the Border--Changning County Breaks Especially Large  Multinational Armed Drug Peddling Case"]    [Text] Recently Changning County broke an especially large  multinational armed drug peddling case, captured a foreign drug  dealer, and seized 17.93 kilograms of heroin.    On 12 January, three people, a member of the Zhujie  Township,  Changning County joint defense force; a leading comrade from  Yangjie Village; and a village forest protector, went up the  mountain on forest protection. At 6:30 p.m., while walking at  the foot of Jinjia, Yangjie Village, they saw two middle-aged  men coming at them from a distance. One man carrying a  two-shoulder backpack was walking in the front and one man  carrying two bulging woven plastic bags was walking in back  peering around flustered. Our three people were suddenly  suspicious. Waiting for the three suspects to approach, our  three people, carrying pistols and assault rifles, came forward  to interrogate them. The two people appeared more flustered and  hemmed and hawed. As the member of the joint force was preparing  to search the two woven plastic bags, the middle-aged man with  the backpack suddenly pulled a hand grenade from his waist and  wildly smashed into the body of the member of the joint force,  and after throwing the hand grenade at his body, rolled on the  ground. Seeing the smoking hand grenade, our three people  quickly fell back on the ground and the instant that the hand  grenade exploded, the two suspects jumped into a ditch overgrown  with foliage and fled.    After the sound of the explosion had passed, our people  quickly followed in the direction of the fleeing suspects and  discovered that one suspect had already run to a hill 80 meters  away and the other had vanished without a trace. One after the  other, they lifted their rifles and fired and then and there  they shot one of the suspects and confiscated 17.93 kilograms of  heroin. Our people arrested the drug dealer and took him to the  village public security station and immediately reported to the  county and the township. The township party secretary and the  county public security bureau leader one after another led  cadres and police to the scene and conducted a detailed  reconnaissance of the scene. It was determined that the wounded  drug dealer was Li Laoqi [2621 5071 0003] from Guogang [2654  2413] in Burma.    Presently, Changning County public security organizations  are  organizing police forces to apprehend the escapee and are trying  the case.</p>

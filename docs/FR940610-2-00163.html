			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act states that exchange rules should be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to securities transactions; to remove impediments to a free and open market; and to protect investors and the public interest. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (i.e., as long as five business days) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October 1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts to compare all trades on trade date. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989), 54 FR 11470 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;88&hyph;36] (order approving proposed rule change) and Division of Market Regulation, Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989, 117&hyph;129 (December 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Testimony on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Recommendations Regarding the October 1987 Market Break delivered by David S. Ruder, Chairman, Commission, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs at 23&hyph;24 (February 3, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1988, the NYSE, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The NYSE reduced its comparison cycle in stocks first from T+5 in 1990. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  T+1 comparison also was made applicable to NYSE listed options in 1992 <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  and to NYSE listed bonds in 1993. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Currently, according to the NYSE, more than seventy-five percent of all trades executed on the NYSE trading floor are captured and locked-in electronically. The NYSE views the electronic capture of the remaining twenty-five percent of its trades, which primarily occur in trading crowds on its trading floor, as a major goal of OCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28285 (July 30, 1990), 55 FR 31030 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;21] (order approving proposed rule change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of T+1 comparison or close-out for options, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30293 (January 27, 1992), 57 FR 4229 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;91&hyph;36]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of T+1 comparison of close-out for bonds, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31826 (February 4, 1993), 58 FR 8075 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;92&hyph;32]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE's main objectives as it moves toward complete implementation of OCS include: (1) Increasing the percentage of electronically locked-in trades; (2) maintaining a low rate of uncompared trades rate during the various phases of the project; (3) electronic capture and comparison of trades, especially trading crowd transactions, that currently are not captured by any electronic order entry system; and (4) elimination of any redundant comparison processing. Significantly, as the NYSE moves through its various implementation phases of OCS, its current Rule 130 will remain in operation. That rule requires that each transaction effected on the NYSE be compared or closed out by NYSE's close of business on T+1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required changes may affect numerous clearing and non-clearing firms' operations, including such things as trading floor operations, purchase and sales department procedures, clearing operations, and internal account balancing and reconciliation procedures. Because of these significant changes, the NYSE has established two committees, a steering committee and a working group, to advise it on the best methods by which trade-date comparison may be achieved. Additionally, this program of trade-date comparison is being implemented in conjunction with the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, by shortening the NYSE comparison cycle from T+1 to trade date, will make NYSE's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors' funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental and important improvements to the marketplace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly with sections 6(b)(5) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;08) be, and hereby is, approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weaker yen helps Nikkei ahead Buying by financial institutions, encouraged by the easing of the yen against the dollar bolstered activity, and the Nikkei index gained ground for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 120.83 to 20,342.17 after a low of 20,255.15 and a high of 20,438.39, a slight increase over the week. Although profit-taking by investment trusts eroded some of the early gains, purchases of large capital stocks by Japanese institutional investors supported the index. 'We're buyers rather than sellers next week,' said Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg, on expectations of lower short term interest rates, an improved corporate profit outlook and enhanced balance sheets at the banks. Volume was 350m shares against 258m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rebounded 8.14 to 1,642.54 while the Nikkei 300 rose 1.59 to 300.37. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 4.27 at 1,344.84. Domestic institutions sought large capital steels and shipbuilders. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y13 to Y366 and Kawasaki Steel added Y9 to Y397. Higher commodity products supported mining and nonferrous metals stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y16 to Y929 and Showa Aluminium added Y15 to Y505. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone continued to decline on profit-taking by investors discouraged by the freeze on its rate increase. The stock lost Y12,000 to Y843,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 136.23 to 22,507.65 in volume of 17.3m shares. Aoki International, the men's suits retailer rebounded Y80 to Y2,980. Roundup The region's markets closed the week with mixed performances. SEOUL experienced a round of institutional profit-taking which left the composite index 3.23 lower at 948.50, off a days high of 957.10, little changed on the week. Speculation that three trusts had been ordered to redeem all of their loans from the central bank put further pressure on the market. The trusts are scheduled to pay back some Won2,150bn in soft loans from the central bank by August 10. SINGAPORE ended little changed in subdued trading as foreign fund managers turned their attention to Hong Kong and elsewhere. The Straits Times Industrials index rose 7.41 to 2,337.01 in thin volume of 106.25m shares. The market advanced 2.2 per cent over the week MANILA was firmer after two days' of losses, and the composite index closed up 14.75 at 2,870.32, a week's decline of 2.3 per cent. Turnover was 795.6m pesos. TAIPEI was generally lower although the paper sector improved slightly on expectations for higher product prices. The weighted index declined 38.82 to 5,905.79, off 2.6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 50bn from TDollars 58.3bn. BOMBAY was on the downward track for much of the session after the market authorities refused to back down on the severe restrictions it has prescribed for resumption of the badla or the carry forward system of trading. But towards the close, financial institutions resumed buying and the BSE 30 share index finished 25.10 down at 3,783.67, after a low of 3,757. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from its lows at the close led by some core stocks which reacted to remarks by the finance minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, that Malaysia would like to see a strong local currency and low interest rates to achieve low inflation. The composite index closed down 1.82 points at 1,001.16 after touching an intra-day low of 993.94, but was little changed on the week. SYDNEY was supported by a late rally in futures and the All Ordinaries index closed up 10.2 at 2,103.9 in turnover of ADollars 1bn. The market has advanced 1.6 per cent on the week. Some traders noted switching from CRA and into BHP: the former declined 38 cents to ADollars 18.10 and the latter rose 36 cents to ADollars 18.36.</p>

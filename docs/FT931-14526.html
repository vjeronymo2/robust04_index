			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Making the customer do the work Middle-level officials in any organisation tend to treat their clients as a nuisance to be kept at bay. This is as true of private enterprise as of government organisations. The short-term costs of exit from a long-standing relationship with, for instance, a bank or building society are high; and customers will put up with a lot of contemptuous treatment rather than make the wrench. The advent of the computer has made matters worse. Instead of this invention being used to make life easier for customers, it has been used to pile extra burdens on them. One of the worst examples is in standardised letters in relation to annual renewals, which make the client look up information which could much more conveniently be found by the organisation concerned. Too many renewal forms say something like: 'If you have a standing order, do nothing. If you pay by cheque, do X. Ignore this letter if you have already paid.' In other words the sender of the demand cannot even be bothered to scan his records - which a computer could readily do - to ascertain the client's status and whether he has paid. All the checking has to be done at the receiving end. This is breathtakingly unfair. Most of us do not have homes equipped as offices. A cheque may have come out of various books kept in different places; and we do not always have comprehensive lists of standing orders to hand. If we ask our bank for such a list, it would take time and may carry a substantial fee. Above all such research increases the amount of time required for activities which are neither leisure nor work but that most tedious of tasks - personal administration. My most outrageous experience occurred after a five-day Christmas holiday in Rome. On return I found a computerised letter from my bank stating that it had not received payment on my credit card 'for over a month' thus 'leaving the account in arrears to the extent of Pounds 12'. It went on to say that it was 'not normally possible for a transaction to be authorised when an account is out of order', and warning of the resulting embarrassments. I was not aware of the outstanding sum, but of course a communication could have been mislaid in the Christmas post. Despite the demand for instant satisfaction and despite the likelihood of holiday delays, the letter had been sent by second-class post. As I normally carry only one bank credit card in addition to the more satisfactory American Express card, I telephoned straight away, but received no reply after I had hung on for a very long time - a possibility that compilers of computer letters never take into account. Nevertheless I sent the required payment immediately and first class, with an accompanying letter. The deviser of the system did not have the courtesy or intelligence to allow for time taken by his own organisation to process communications. Imagine my indignation when a week later I received a second and more sinister computer letter serving me with a default notice. Small businessmen dependent on banks for finance have presumably far more about which to complain.  Indeed I have been told that banks are very careful before taking on disgruntled customers from their so-called competitors. British banks are behaving with all the ruthlessness that comes of weakness.  Because their own profitability has been so undermined, they are taking it out on their smaller customers.  Experienced observers tell me that the way to get genuine competition at the lower end of the banking system would be to unleash the building societies, who are still heavily restricted in most of their lending to houses and property. Unfortunately the Bank of England is so deperately concerned with rebuilding bank profits that it is basically on the banks' side. But I will resist the temptation to say everything is the fault of official policy.  It is up to the victims of banks and other private or public bureaucratic oligopolies to band together to fight back.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER FORECAST: MORE JUNE GLOOM  </P> <P> Weather for the month of June is following the norm: night and morning low  clouds, with either afternoon clearing or partial clearing, the National  Weather Service said Thursday.  </P> <P> With May and June usually being the cloudiest months of the year, the  now-familiar weather pattern is expected to continue for at least 10 more days,  forecaster Ray Robben said.  </P> <P> The morning cloud cover will be slightly heavier this weekend because of the  onshore flow of marine air. The cover should break by noon.  </P> <P> The beaches will have low clouds and fog in the mornings, becoming partly  cloudy in the afternoons, Robben said. Temperatures at the beaches are expected  to be in the mid-60s throughout the weekend, with sea breezes from 10 to 16  m.p.h.  </P> <P> There will be some patchy fog as well in the coastal and inland areas, clearing  by afternoon. Coastal temperatures are expected to range in the 70s this  weekend, with overnight lows in the low 50s. The inland valleys will reach the  high 70s and fall to the mid- to low 50s.  </P> <P> The mountain and deserts will remain fair through Saturday, with gusty winds.  Mountain areas will range in the low 70s, dropping to 40 to 47 nightly. Deserts  may hit 100 degrees and should bottom out in the 60s overnight.  </P> <P> Surf is 2 to 3 feet at 10-second intervals.

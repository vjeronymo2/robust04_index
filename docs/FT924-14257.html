			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week Cyclamen hederaefolium Hederaefolium means ivy-leaved which very aptly describes the leaves of this delightful little hardy cyclamen - except that every plant is different and all are mottled dark green and silver, some much more elaborately than others. The flowers are pink or white and usually produce seed freely which, in favourable places, means that the plants sometimes spread of their own accord. Sometimes they appear a long way from the parent plant. This cyclamen likes semi-shade and cool, humus-rich soil and is an ideal plant for naturalising beneath deciduous trees not too closely planted. It makes a solid tuber which gets bigger and bigger but never splits and, so far as I know, cannot be divided. Seed is the only method of increase.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (AFP) -- Foreigners, including four  Italians from the same family, two Americans and two British  nationals were among the 160 victims of a China Northwest  Airlines plane crash near the central Chinese city of Xian, the  company said Tuesday.    A company spokesman interviewed by telephone from Xian said  a  ninth "foreigner" who was killed in the crash early Monday had  not yet been identified.    The crash of China Northwest Airlines Flight WH2303, which  had been carrying 146 passengers and 14 crew members, also  killed three Hong Kong residents and a Taiwanese.    Chinese sources said the unidentified foreigner was Swiss,  but the Swiss Embassy here refused to confirm the information  before formal identification.    The Italian Embassy here confirmed that an Italian couple  had  died along with their son and daughter in the crash of the  Soviet-made Tupolev-154 aircraft which was travelling from Xian  to the southern city of Guangzhou. The father of the children  was reported to be a professor from the Florence Polytechnical  School.    The embassies of Britain and the United States also  confirmed  the presence of four of their nationals aboard China Northwest  Airlines flight Wh2303. The British Embassy added that both of  its nationals aboard the flight were male but did not provide  further details.    The accident -- the worst in China's civil aviation history  -- occurred about 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of Xian  near the Qinling mountain range.    The English-language CHINA DAILY newspaper said Tuesday that  "three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in the  clouds and then saw a fireball crashing to the ground."    A spokesman for the airline company earlier said the plane  had taken off in bad weather under heavy rain, adding that an  investigation was immediately launched into the incident.    A Civil Air Administration of China (CAAC) spokesman refused  to comment on the disaster Tuesday.    Xian, the ancient imperial capital some 900 kilometres (540  miles) southwest of Beijing, is where the terracotta warrior  statues of the emperor Qin Shihuang were found, making the city  a popular tourist attraction.</p>

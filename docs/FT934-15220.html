			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Woolf attacks Howard's plans GOVERNMENT proposals to get tough on crime were described last night as 'short-sighted and irresponsible' by Lord Woolf, who conducted the official inquiry into the 1990 riots at Strangeways and other prisons, Alan Pike writes. Policies of imprisoning greater numbers of people, he said, had a 'miserable record of failure.' He warned that cramming more people into a prison system already under acute pressure could lead to further riots. Lord Woolf's comments in a London lecture were in contrast to those of Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, at the Conservative Party conference last week. Mr Howard announced wide-ranging proposals to crack down on crime and said his plans were likely to increase the prison population.</p>

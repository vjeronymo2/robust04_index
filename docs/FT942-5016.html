			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: A Doll's House - Theatre As if to reassure the shades of those London theatregoers shocked by A Doll's House in 1889, Chichester's Minerva Theatre has mounted a new production of this dissection of sexual non-communication that places Ibsen smack in the middle of old-fashioned melodrama. Tchaikovsky surging in the background, ominously dimming lights, an erring heroine who almost launches into a mad scene: it might be Lady Audley's Secret. The director, Annie Castledine, did a full-blooded Gaslight at Greenwich; and a colleague at Chichester wondered aloud whether a new last act for Ibsen would reveal that patronising husband Torvald had engineered the whole crisis to get rid of wife Nora and make off with her old chum. Jane Maud's unusually strong Christine would make this understandable. Poor Mrs Linde's hard luck story emerges with bleak melancholy that occasionally erupts into anger. Her reunion with Nora is competitive, defiant, as they prowl around each other catching up with the news like big cats marking out their territories. Sharon Maughan's Nora is hampered by entering in a red dress on a minimal red-walled set that recalls Ingmar Bergman's Hedda Gabler. Like Hedda, or Ellida in The Lady From The Sea, Nora is looking for moral responsibility, the right to make her own decisions, in the face of stifling masculine protectiveness. Delightedly identified from the Gold Blend TV commercial by a section of the audience, Ms Maughan cleverly suggests the bird in the gilded cage, the pampered plaything in a marriage whose cloying sweetness is disturbed only by tension over too many tooth-rotting macaroons. The sexual side of the marriage is absent until the last act, when Peter McEnery's fantasising Torvald, inflamed by Nora's dancing, reveals himself as the true Victorian paterfamilias: obviously vastly experienced with women of a different sort, reserving a mixture of worship and possessiveness for his wife. By this time the production's throbbingly theatrical mood has turned Torvald into a clown. 'I don't want any melodramatics,' declares Mr McEnery, who has evidently not noticed that the past 2 1/2 hours have consisted of nothing else. Christopher Hampton's 1971 version hardly helps with its blend of Victorianisms ('Get on with you, you little minx]') and detached editorialism - a 'terrible blow to his masculine self-esteem' is not the sort of over-aware phrase Nora would come out with; before Act Three anyway. Initially the direction makes Nora bounce between the chirpy and the hysterical, ending Act One frozen into the dating mask of a silent scream, a Norwegian national pastime to judge by the country's most famous painting. The performance is not only too lightweight; it makes Nora's final, rational declaration of independence totally implausible. This is unfair on Ms Maughan, who comes into her own with an earnest eagerness that makes the scene into a quietly controlled but murderous call to arms. Liabilities include an offstage ball that sounds as if the St Petersburg Philharmonic has moved in upstairs and an inert Krogstad (Nick Reding) of pure Norwegian wood. But the play's issues still reverberate uncomfortably: 'Most young criminals usually have dishonest mothers,' says the benign husband. Substitute unmarried for dishonest and we are back to basics - and concomitant attitudes - unchanged since Ibsen's day.</p>

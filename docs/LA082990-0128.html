			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES TRASH CONTRACT  </P> <P> Refusing to bow to the will of an overflow crowd, the City Council voted this  week to award an exclusive contract for residential trash removal to Waste  Management Inc.  </P> <P> Notified of the meeting by a citywide mailer sent last week by representatives  of Western Waste Inc., a competing trash hauler, the large crowd mainly  supported sending out the garbage removal contract for competitive bids.  </P> <P> With standing room only in the council chambers and residents crowded into the  corridors and interior offices of City Hall, the council voted, 3 to 2, to  approve a contract with Waste Management Inc. of Irvine.  </P> <P> The five-year contract will raise garbage collection rates from $8.73 to $11.85  per household -- the highest among Orange County cities. However, the pact will  add several new services, including hazardous household waste pickup, a 20%  discount for senior citizens and a recycling program.  </P> <P> Despite pressure from the audience, the council held firm to its July 9  decision to deal only with Waste Management Inc., which has held the contract  in the community for about 20 years.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it's all over," Councilman William S. Craycraft said. "It's tiring  when issue after issue in this city is like Armageddon."  </P> <P> Several speakers, including Susan Withrow and Ray Carolin, who are council  candidates in the November municipal elections, criticized the exclusive  contract, saying the city would get a better rate by allowing competitive  bidding.  </P> <P> But other residents supported dealing exclusively with Waste Management, saying  the firm has served the city well.

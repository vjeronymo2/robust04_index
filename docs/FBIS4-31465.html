			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 6 (CTK) -- "The Civic Democratic Party  (ODS) Executive Council confirms that the ODS has supported in  the past and is unambiguously supporting the establishment of  the Senate on the majoritarian principle in accordance with the  Czech Constitution," ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  said today. Speaking to journalists during a break in an  Executive Council meeting, Klaus added that the ODS Deputies'  Group had proceeded from this principle while discussing the  bill on the senatorial elections.    He said the council had resolutely rejected the  unsubstantiated statements about a non-constitutional state  which had allegedly arisen in the Czech Republic. "Nothing of  the kind is true. I see no signs of the constitutional crisis  which would justify an urgent need for change in the Czech  Constitution," Klaus said.    He described as a "fully false card produced by some  political parties" statements about the non-constitutional state  in the Republic and proposals by some deputies that if the  Senate is not established some of its powers should be  transferred to the president. Klaus pointed to the existing  temporary provisions in the Constitution which "clearly say how  competences are being divided up to the moment when the Senate  appears." "We permanently respect the Constitution and the  majoritarian principle on which the Senate should be set up and  we believe it will be filled at a proper moment," Klaus said.</p>

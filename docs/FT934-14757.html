			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Sri Lanka's military stalks Jaffna: Army hopes of an end to rebel control of the northern peninsula SRI LANKA'S military top brass, angered by months of political prevarication and the assassination in May of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, say they now have the go-ahead to regain the rebel-held northern peninsula of Jaffna. Of course, no one will say when the main offensive - across the war-torn area that is also home to about 600,000 Tamil civilianslaunched, but army commanders hint that it is likely to be in the new year. The over-stretched Sri Lankan army, well below strength from casualties and injuries in a war that has claimed 32,000 lives since 1983, has been rapidly rebuilding. Some 10,000 new recruits are in training to join the 80,000 already under arms. The target is 100,000. The military plans to purchase helicopter gunships, landing craft and fast patrol boats in preparation for the big push. A number of preparatory tactical thrusts may already have begun. Earlier this month 4,000 soldiers, backed by tanks, fighter jets and gunboats, launched an operation to destroy the Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels' main port on the Jaffna lagoon which is used to bypass the army land blockade. Setting off from their strategic army base at Elephant Pass - which seals off the largely guerrilla-held Jaffna Peninsula from the mainland  - the government troops thrust north. But on the second day they were caught by surprise in a murderous crossfire from 1,000 well-dug-in Tamil Tigers. In a pitched battle, involving dozens of women and some of the fiercest hand-to-hand fighting of the war, the army lost 118 men and killed at least 150 guerrillas. The soldiers held their ground and went on to destroy the port of Kilaly before returning to base. Senior commanders are optimistic they will be ready to take Jaffna soon  - after all, they say, it is a comparatively tiny piece of land just 50 miles long and 20 miles wide. Others believe this is wishful thinking. The Sri Lankan armed forces lost their most experienced commanders in a land mine explosion more than a year ago and, it is argued, is no match for the fanatical and tightly organised Tamil Tigers. The guerrillas, whose well armed and trained members in the north may amount to just a few thousand, were able to defeat 120,000 Indian troops in the late 1980s. They are so single-minded that every combatant carries a cyanide pill around the neck, which they swallow rather than allow themselves to be taken alive. The group is led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, an autocrat, one of the world's most wanted terrorists and a brilliant military strategist who commands almost religious obedience from his fighters. Mr S T Hondaman, Sri Lanka's most famous Tamil and a minister in every cabinet since 1978, is not convinced that the army will go in. 'They have been saying they will take Jaffna for years. In the latest offensive, what happened? They withdrew,' he says. Many in the government, however, say the impossibility of negotiating with Mr Prabhakaran has at last persuaded the cabinet it has no alternative but to go all-out for the military option. The final straw is said to have come in May when a Tamil suicide bomber with explosive strapped round his waist, assassinated President Premadasa at a political rally in Colombo. His successor, President DB Wijetunge, has publicly vowed to crush terrorism. 'There is no ethnic problem in the north, only terrorism,' he says. Success over the past 12 months in reducing terrorist control in the country's Eastern province could free thousands of Sri Lankan troops for operations in the north. In addition there is some evidence of growing Tamil resentment of the LTTE's iron grip on the lives and pockets of inhabitants in the Jaffna Peninsula. These have added to Colombo's belief that the time is right for military action. The fallout, should the army defeat the guerrillas and regain control of the peninsula in a relatively short period, is unclear. The biggest fear is that the price which may have to be paid in terms of loss of life, foreign investor confidence and international opprobrium may be more than the country can bear. Says one International Red Cross official who regularly goes to Jaffna: 'If the army besieges the city of Jaffna with its half-million citizens and leaves the Tigers no escape route it will be murderous hand-to-hand fighting with civilians caught in the middle. Many thousands of non-combatants will die. The best we can hope for is that the population will be able to go to designated safe areas and that the LTTE will be allowed to retreat southward into the jungle.'</p>

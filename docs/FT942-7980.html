			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Ancient Greek rituals Much in need of an international image makeover, Greece could have made a start by fielding some bright young politicians for next month's Euro-elections. Instead, prime minister Andreas Papandreou's list of candidates reads like an exercise in personal debt repayment. Angela Kokkola, Papandreou's secretary for a couple of decades until his new wife Dimitra decided she wanted the job, is for instance certain to win one of the 25 seats. Journalist Yannis Roubatis has another safe slot. Once Papandreou's loyal spokesman, Roubatis was caught up in the backwash of the Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal which toppled the government in 1988, and kept him on the sidelines for quite some time too. The opposition, meanwhile, has made a stab at sprucing up its image by including the well-known singer Nana Mouskouri. Sadly, she is so rarely sighted in Athens that many Greeks think she is French. Alketas Panagoulias, who is coaching the Greek soccer team for its first appearance in the World Cup this summer, is another unusual choice. However, if Greece's 5-0 thrashing by England at Wembley last week is anything to go by, Panagoulias might find the bright lights of Brussels an attractive proposition next season.</p>

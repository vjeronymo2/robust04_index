			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BE CAREFUL OF EFFECT OF HEATING ON HOUSEPLANTS  </P> <P> The African violet is a lovely houseplant that can and will bloom almost  continuously throughout the year.  </P> <P> Other houseplants are just as lovely whether they also offer flowers or are  known for their attractive foliage.  </P> <P> Take care of them this fall and winter months so they don't suffer. In heating  your home, the air gets drier and the heat should not blow directly onto any  plant. Window areas are cold and sometimes too cold for houseplants. Many  houseplants go dormant at this time, and they should be allowed their rest.  They can use only a limited amount of water. When spring comes, they will again  return to normal needs.  </P></p>

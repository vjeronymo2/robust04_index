			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Key Bonn adviser warns of recession THE differences at the heart of the German economic establishment over both policy and prospects for the economy have been underlined with a warning of impending recession from a leading government economic adviser. In today's Handelsblatt, the business newspaper, Professor Hans-Karl Schneider, one of the government's so-called 'five wise men', criticises the recent decision of the Bundesbank to raise interest rates by a half point. He says that interest rates are already 'very, very high' and are not appropriate for the current economic situation, in which the boom associated with German unification has slowed to a virtual standstill in the past six months. Prof Schneider, whose report in November sharply criticised the level of the public spending deficit, warns that a failure by the government to restrain spending, and by the trade unions to accept moderate wage increases, could tip the economy into a recession. His comments underline a concern in the highest levels of the government that the Bundesbank may have gone too far in raising the Lombard rate by half a point to 9.75 per cent, and the discount rate from 7.5 to 8 per cent. The government is torn over its attitude to wage negotiations. Several trade unions are seeking wage rises in double figures. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, has called for a limit of 5 per cent on pay rises, and has been criticised by his colleagues for interfering in the wage round. The cabinet, and the coalition partners, yesterday issued statements insisting that they would not interfere in the 'constitutionally protected' wage negotiations. However, Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said unjustified pay rises, including those in the public sector, could cause grave problems. Negotiations on steel industry pay resumed in Dusseldorf yesterday, with IG Metall, the steelworkers' union, calling for a rise of 10.5 per cent, and the employers offering 3.4 per cent. The union is already making preparations for a strike ballot among its members. Germany's four leading political parties have agreed to draw up a common proposal for a new asylum law, intended to accelerate the processing of asylum applications from 12 months to six weeks. The agreement emerged from cross-party talks yesterday, in spite of grave doubts that the acceleration plan will work, and against criticism that the streamlined procedure will limit the fundamental rights of asylum-seekers. The idea is to speed up processing of asylum applications, which last year exceeded 256,000, an increase of almost 33 per cent, in order to stem the flow and send economic migrants swiftly home. However, there is a fundamental difference between the parties. The Christian Democrats, senior partners in the ruling coalition, believe that the liberal German constitution should be changed to limit the right of political asylum. Their coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), and the Social Democrats (SPD) in opposition, reject any constitutional change, and say that the influx can be contained through improved procedures.</p>

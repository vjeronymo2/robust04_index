			<p>BFN     [Text] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, has  announced that 150 terrorists were killed and 50 terrorists were  captured in operations conducted in the state of emergency  region in the past week.    Addressing the inauguration of the communications satellite  ground station in Batman's Sason District, Erkan declared that  the terrorist organization has reached the point of collapse as  a result of the assistance the regional population has extended  to the security forces in their joint struggle against  terrorism. Pointing out that the number of terrorists  surrendering to the security forces is increasing, despite the  groundless propaganda that terrorists who surrender are  mistreated, Erkan explained that the organization's sources of  income from narcotics smuggling have also been wiped out.</p>

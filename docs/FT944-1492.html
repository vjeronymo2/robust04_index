			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Betterware looks to better itself Betterware, the direct home-shopping group, announced a number of board changes yesterday to try to boost its flagging share price. Peter Hartley, the former managing director of Texas Homecare who joined Betterware in December last year, has been promoted to group managing director from group financial director. Andrew Cohen has moved from the post of chief executive to be executive chairman. Hartley will be based permanently at the group's Birmingham headquarters and distribution centre; Cohen was previously in charge of operations but only spent three days a week in Birmingham. Now, he will concentrate on the group's strategy, especially the development of Betterware's new partnership with Avon in north and south America. Paul Turner, currently financial director of Betterware UK, becomes group financial controller; the board has not yet decided whether to appoint him permanently as group financial director. Walter Goldsmith has retired as non-executive chairman but remains on the board and will continue to chair the audit and remuneration committee. Betterware has fallen out of favour in the City this year. Its shares have dropped from a peak of 278p in July last year to 44p yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- President Lech Walesa on Tuesday  told diplomatic corps accredited to Warsaw that a "real and full  European integration has become possible thanks to the victory  of democracy" in our continent. "The integration is favoured by  such initiatives as the Partnership for Peace. Poland expresses  the hope that it will become a road towards the creation of an  efficient European security system," Walesa said at a meeting  held at the royal castle on the occasion of the national day of  Poland, the 3rd of May constitution anniversary.    "Regional cooperation also brings us closer to the united  and  safe Europe," Walesa stressed and added that Poland attaches  importance to the Visegrad group and the Council of the Baltic  Countries and the regional meeting at Litomysl.    The Polish president spoke of Poland's "frequent and  significant contacts with Washington, and also Bonn, London and  Paris" and said: "We are of the opinion that the role of the  United States in maintaining European stability should not be  weakened. At the same time we attach great weight to  cooperation with democratic Russia. Our proposal to codify the  principles of the Eastern policy serves this end. Through  discussions with our partner we are trying to open the road  towards concrete solutions."    Apart from President Walesa and his wife Danuta, the meeting  was hosted by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Sejm Speaker Jozef  Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam Struzik and Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski. On behalf of the diplomats the dean of the  Diplomatic Corps, Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk  expressed recognition to the Polish president and the Polish  people for their "everyday toil and struggle for a new shape of  the democratic country."</p>

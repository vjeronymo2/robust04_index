			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Cocom's future NO SYSTEM of export controls can guarantee to stop countries with the will to establish large and sophisticated arms industries from carrying out that aim. Restricting supplies of technology to countries which the international community wishes to prevent from producing atomic, bacteriological or chemical weapons can, however, act as a considerable disincentive to such activities. During postwar decades, the 17-nation Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) controlled access of western technology to the former Soviet bloc as a means of hampering its military capability. Four years after the Berlin wall fell, Cocom's membership and objectives need radical redefinition. The US and its allies are due shortly to conclude talks on creating a successor. During the 1980s, Cocom restrictions were frequently the focus of commercial and ideological differences between the US and Europe. In a post-cold war world, policing flows of sensitive knowhow and components has become still more difficult and controversial. However, a new Cocom which can reduce arms proliferation is in the interest of international stability. There is no shortage of impediments. The east-west line which separated friend and foe into easily definable power blocs has disappeared. Underlined by the weapons programmes of countries like Iraq, Pakistan, Libya or North Korea, the list of suppliers and potential users of military technologies has grown longer and more diffuse. China - treated leniently by Cocom, and now a supplier of ever more sophisticated and deadly weaponry to the third world - may prove impossible to bring into a new system. For the west, however, the key aim of the new Cocom diplomacy is to persuade Russia and other ex-Soviet republics to participate in enforcing new arrangements. Otherwise, parts of their armaments capabilities will increasingly migrate to other still more unstable regions. The US hopes that relaxing remaining restrictions on exports to the former Soviet Union will persuade erstwhile Cocom poachers to become gamekeepers. But the west will need to provide former Soviet republics with more help to improve controls of borders. The Cocom system has already undergone change. Contacts between governments on regulating exports with uses in nuclear and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles include links with both Russia and China. The new Cocom organisation can achieve better co-ordination by pinpointing which countries are deemed as threats in particular sectors. The technologies subject to embargo will need to be limited as tightly as possible to those with clear-cut applications in weapons of mass destruction. Export controls are an essentially defensive method of combating proliferation. They should not be used to impede the economies of countries of which the west disapproves.</p>

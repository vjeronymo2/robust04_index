			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Observer: Pitman's finest hour It is a very long time since a London clearing bank had an effective chief executive, rather than an old-style general manager. But Brian Pitman of Lloyds Bank fits the bill. No other bank chief executive would have had the guts to challenge the establishment thinking in the way that he has done. True, Howard Lloyd and Midland's Edward Holden were giant figures a century ago. But after them it is hard to remember a manager who has had as big an impact as Pitman. Indeed, what is odd is that he has been permitted to make such a mark on Lloyds which in the past was more like Barclays with managers obeying orders and leaving the chairmen to have bright ideas. Ironically, it was only banks like Midland where managers who had worked their way up from the bottom were allowed to run the show. Pitman is unusual amongst his kind in having not only the vision of where he wanted to take his bank but the ability to persuade both his staff and his board to follow. Whereas most bankers pride themselves on their lending skills, Pitman's great strength is his strategic antennae. He also had the benefit of Sir Jeremy Morse as chairman. When the chairmanship changes next year, it will be interesting to see how Pitman's reputation fares in the absence of Morse's restraining hand.</p>

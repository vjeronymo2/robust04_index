			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bols, Wessanen open door to further mergers THE MERGER between Bols, the Dutch spirits, wine and beverages group, and Wessanen, the Dutch foods group, is designed to produce a big new European drinks company, including further mergers, possibly with a partner outside the Netherlands. The two companies, which unveiled the terms of their share swap proposal yesterday, said the new company, to be called Bols Wessanen, would create a 'docking station' for potential future merger candidates. 'The door (to talks) is open, and they don't even have to knock to be admitted,' said Mr Peter Bakker Schut, chairman of Wessanen. A round of mergers would be welcome in the coming year, although no talks were taking place, he said. Last week, Bols and Wessanen were forced to announce merger talks after rumours about a deal had leaked on to the floor of the Amsterdam stock exchange, prompting the bourse to launch an insider trading investigation. The merger will create a company with turnover of Fl 4.8bn (Dollars 2.68bn) and a workforce of around 9,000. The merger proposal, which the companies describe as a tie-up between equal partners, calls first for Wessanen to make a 2.5-for-one share split to reduce the nominal value of its shares to Fl 2, matching that of Bols. Wessanen will then offer 1.185 new shares for each share in Bols. The prospectus will be published in the first two weeks of March, with the deal to be completed a month later. Wessanen's shareholders will own 54.5 per cent of the new company against 45.5 per cent to be held by Bols' shareholders, reflecting Wessanen's slightly bigger operating profit, net profit and market capitalisation. Replying to some analysts' comments that they saw little industrial logic in the move, Mr Bakker Schut and Mr Robert Schipper, the chairman of Bols, said the two companies had converged over the past 10 years. Together, they would be able to consider acquisitions of between Fl 200m and Fl 400m a time rather than the current Fl 100m. Bols Wessanen would also have a better currency and geographic spread.</p>

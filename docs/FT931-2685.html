			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Uni fined NKr3.2m for rule breaches UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, has been ordered by the Oslo bourse to pay a record NKr3.2m (Dollars 450,000) fine for breaching information reporting rules seven times during the company's raid on Swedish rival Skandia Forsakrings. A 155-page report condemns Uni's actions during the failed raid on Skandia in the period August 15 1991 to August 25 last year. Uni, during 1991 and 1992, built a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia in spite of a law forbidding Norwegian financial institutions from owning more than 10 per cent of foreign financial concerns without a special concession. Uni borrowed heavily to finance the acquisition in an attempt to force the Swedish insurer into a Nordic pact. Uni last year collapsed into the hands of public administrators after suspending payments to creditors. The Uni affair has become known as Norway's biggest corporate scandal. The finance minister is due to issue a report to parliament on the affair later this year, and a public commission is soon to be named to launch another investigation into the scandal. The company's board has two weeks in which to appeal the ruling. Separately, despite Uni shareholders' complaints, the bourse decided to uphold its earlier decision to de-list the company indefinitely.</p>

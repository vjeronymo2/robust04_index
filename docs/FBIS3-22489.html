A  new serotype Vibrio cholerae strain 0[.sup]139[/] was  identified to be the cause of the outbreak. Because up to 7  July, all 106 cases including two deaths were identified to be  non-01 Vibrio cholerae infections, and were all adults.  Professor Gao Shouyu [7559 1343 0001] at the Institute of  Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine  pointed out that 0[.sup]139[/] is a highly virulent serotype  strain, and it is still unknown whether it came from the two  close neighboring countries, India and Bangladesh, which had  just reported the outbreaks not long ago. Professor Gao said  that since nobody in China has the kind of antibody to fight  against the new strain, if an outbreak should occur, it would be  an uncontrollable one.</p>

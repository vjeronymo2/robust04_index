			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sulayman Nimr: "Gulf States Studying </F> `Declaration of Principles' Proposed by United States for  Multilaterals"]    [Text] London -- Experts from the foreign ministries of  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states discussed at a meeting  in Riyadh yesterday a draft statement proposed by the United  States for the multilateral negotiations in the Middle East. It  is called the "declaration of principles" statement. The U.S.  Administration submitted it for approval by the participating  states during the multilateral negotiations steering committee  meetings in Ottawa on 6 February. The proposed declaration lays  the foundations for the shape of political and economic  cooperations among Middle Eastern states.    The meeting of the Gulf foreign ministries' experts was held  to discuss developments in the multilaterals and the meetings of  their five committees and ways of coordinating positions in this  connection.    The Sultanate of Oman last week hosted the meetings of the  water committee arising from these negotiations. Qatar is  scheduled to host the arms control committee meetings next  Monday. And Bahrain has offered to host the environment  committee meetings scheduled to held next fall.    The GCC states showed interest in the draft "declaration of  principles" proposed by the United States because of the clauses  related to political conditions in Middle Eastern states and the  future of relations among them; the declaration urges working  "to develop a view of what the region will be like after the  achievement of peace at the bilateral level, and to develop the  regional institutions which the region might need." Gulf states  are concerned that this statement might impose on it material  and political obligations they do not need. This is why despite  their participation in the meetings of the multilateral  committees, they do not want any future obligations to be  imposed on them. Hence the experts' meetings in Riyadh are  important to the foreign ministers.    As is known, Gulf experts for the multilaterals met on 26  March and sent a report containing their view to their foreign  ministers during their meetings in the Saudi capital in the  first week of this month. The ministers decided that the  experts should meet again.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Analysts today said the  approval by the great majority in Congress of a draft bill  submitted by the Lima Bar Association proposing that the  original National Elections Board (JNE) run the general  elections scheduled for April 1995, follows a recommendation by  President Alberto Fujimori to avoid any suspicion of fraud.    After three months of unsuccessful debates, the government  bloc suddenly on the evening of 20 April sided with the minority  to approve the proposal for the JNE to organize the elections,  thus freezing the implementation of a new elections system  provided for in the new Constitution (1993).    One political analyst said: "This drastic change was  prompted  by a recommendation by President Fujimori."    The chief of state allegedly said: "There can be no  suspicion  of fraud if the adversary's rules are used."    The draft bill was approved by 55 votes to four, with three  abstentions. It is divided into 11 articles. The first article  states: The JNE, fully renewed, will organize the national  electoral process for the election of president, vice president,  and legislators.    The JNE will comprise five members: One chosen by the  Supreme  Court, one by the Board of Supreme Court Prosecutors, one by the  Lima Bar Association, one by the deans of the law schools of the  public universities, and one by the deans of the law schools of  private universities.    It also states that by next July, at the latest, the JNE  should have a comprehensive single text of the election rules to  be used in April 1995.    Moreover, it must draft the regulations for the operation of  the voters' registry and come up with a vote return system to  expedite the vote tally.    Constitution Commission President Carlos Torres y Torres  justified the "sudden change of mind," stating that it sought to  prevent people from "talking about fraud."    Henry Pease of the Democratic Left Movement (MDI), among  others, praised the decision.    "The opposition was being pressed by public opinion and had  no other alternative than to back down."</p>

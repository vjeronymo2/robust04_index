			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Family business It's not often that a City gent gets to be in a world premiere as opposed to at one. However, tonight sees the debut of Chris Chapman, managing director of discount house Seccombe, Marshall &amp; Campion, in a new musical about Jane Eyre which is being presented at The Royal Naval School, Haslemere. Chapman plays the wicked parson, Mr Brocklehurst, in a cast which includes his wife and two daughters. Kitting him out has not been a problem. Not only is Chapman's father a Suffolk clergyman but Chapman also gets a chance to wear his City top hat - the hallmark of a billbroker - without feeling silly, for a change.</p>

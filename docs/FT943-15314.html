			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Property: Signs that add kudos to your home - London's intriguing blue plaque house scheme Delightful curiosities on the streets of London include oval blue plaques, marking the place where famous people lived or worked. They can suddenly transport the stroller, or the prospective buyer, into a world of history and imagination. To discover that Karl Marx or Dr Johnson 'lived here' can cause even the busiest pedestrian to pause and speculate. And the signs can invest a particular property, even a street, with an aura of class. It is difficult to say whether this distinction translates into a premium price when a property is sold - perhaps not - but they must at least help to excite the interest of prospective buyers. These plaques, that mark not only where London's famous inhabitants lived, but where great moments in the city's history took place, reflect the rich variety of capital life. People as diverse as Nancy Astor, the first woman MP, and French writer Emile Zola are remembered by them. Many, however, commemorate those who are less well-known, reminding or informing passers-by of their achievements. Sir David Low (1891-1963), the cartoonist who created Colonel Blimp, lived at Melbury Court, Kensington High Street, London W8. Dr Charles Vickery Drysdale (1874-1961), a founder of the Family Planning Association, opened his first birth control clinic in 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth, London SE17, and changed countless lives. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) of Donovan Court, Drayton Gardens SW10, was a pioneer of the study of molecular structures. The Royal Society of Arts began the blue plaque scheme in 1867, starting at Byron's birthplace in Holles Street, W1 (now demolished). London County Council took it over in 1901 and ran the scheme until passing it on to the Greater London Council in 1965. Since 1986 English Heritage has run it. Unofficial plaques also exist in London - the Dead Comics Society put one up to mark the home of comedy actor Kenneth Williams (1926-1988) in Marlborough House, Osnaburgh Street, NW1. And there is nothing to stop any property owner putting up a blue plaque if it has the necessary planning permissions, including listed building consent and/or conservation area consent. There are now 616 official plaques, of which the Royal Society of Arts has put up 36 (only 13 survive) the LCC 249, the GLC 262, and English Heritage 83. Nine have been erected by other bodies. English Heritage erects about 12 plaques a year. Its Blue Plaques committee, part of its London advisory committee, meets twice a year to pick them from 25-30 candidates suggested by the public. If you are famous and live in London today, however, you have no chance of seeing your own name on a blue plaque - English Heritage will not even consider you for the honour until 20 years after your death or 100 years from your birth - apart from rare exceptions. In addition to this rule, official blue plaque houses must meet the following criteria: There must be a surviving building (or possibly an identical replacement on the same site); or it must be a site of special historical interest, such as 'The first flying bomb on London fell here 13 June 1944' - Railway Bridge, Grove Road, E3. The candidates must be thought eminent by their own profession, or have made an important positive contribution to human welfare or happiness, and/or have had such remarkable personalities that a well-informed passer-by recognises their names at once, and they must deserve recognition. Fictional characters do not qualify (Sherlock Holmes excepted). And (since 1987) if a candidate has a plaque at one building, they cannot have another. Foreigners must have an international reputation or significant standing in their own countries and have been in London at an important time in their life and work. Prince Peter Kropotkin - 1802-1894 'theorist of anarchism' - lived at 6 Crescent Road, Bromley, and Karl Marx at 28 Dean Street, W1. Would-be owners of blue plaque homes may be interested in two properties currently for sale. PG Wodehouse lived at 17 Dunraven Street, W1, now converted into flats and maisonettes (Blenheim Bishop, 071-629 2484; Wetherell 071-493 6935; and John D Wood, 071-408 0055). Two maisonettes and two flats are offered at between Pounds 275,000 and Pounds 550,000. Emily Davies, founder of Girton College, Cambridge, lived at 8 Cunningham Place, NW8, near Lord's cricket ground. John D Wood (071-267 3267) offers it at Pounds 475,000. The Blue Plaque Guide costs Pounds 6.50 (Journeyman Press, 1991)</p>

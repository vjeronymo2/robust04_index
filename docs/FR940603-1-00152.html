			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> UR&hyph;4a Pavement Assembly Unit, Asphalt_Consists of the labor and material necessary to remove and restore one (1) lineal foot of asphalt pavement, measured along the route of the cable, including any trenching necessary to place the cable at the required depth. All work shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of state or local authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR&hyph;4c Pavement Assembly Unit, Concrete_Consists of the labor and material necessary to remove and restore one (1) lineal foot of concrete pavement, measured along the route of the cable, including any trenching necessary to place the cable at the required depth. All work shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of state or local authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR&hyph;5 (&blank;) Underground Pipe Crossing Assembly Unit_Consists of one (1) lineal foot of steel pipe, of the inside diameter, in inches, specified in the last digit of the assembly unit designation, installed in place. This unit includes the pushing of pipe and any excavation, backfilling and tamping necessary for the installation of the pipe. The pipe will be installed at the depth specified by the Owner. Underground cable installed in the pipe is not included in this unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR&hyph;6 Underground Nonpipe Crossing Assembly Unit_Consists of the labor in providing a hole in soil one (1) foot in length of a diameter sufficient to accommodate the cable to be installed therein. The depth of the hole below the surface of the ground shall be specified by the Owner. This unit includes any excavation, backfilling and tamping necessary for the installation. This unit may be used where the permanent installation of a steel pipe under the UR&hyph;5 unit is not required. Underground cable installed in the hole is not included in this unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,xls32,7,7,7 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Unit No.  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1 Unit price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Labor  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Materials  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Labor and materials <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> UR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Construction Units_Line Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The general heading of Line Changes applies to the changing of existing lines or portions thereof from their existing phasing, wire size, and type to new phasing, wire size, and type and the removal of existing lines or portions thereof and replacing with new lines in close proximity thereto.

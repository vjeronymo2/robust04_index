The National Assembly voted on some articles on which  there were still differing views. Then it voted to pass from  chapter six onwards of the Labor Code. With high unanimity, the  National Assembly voted to pass the entire text of the Labor  Code. This is a very important law. It is the legal foundation  for adjusting both the labor relation between employees and  employers and social relations which are directly involved with  the labor relation in the new period.    Tomorrow, 18 June, the National Assembly will work in the  conference hall to pass the bill on tax levied on the transfer  of rights on land usage.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] The Jordanian and the Palestinian officials held  another round of talks this evening. Minister of Information  Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the talks were open and candid, but  that tangible results have yet to be achieved.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, I think that the  meetings  were very open, very candid. They dealt with down-to-earth  issues. It was very much businesslike. We have agreed that we  agree on the basic principles and the guiding aims for our  internal dialogue. However, we feel that this is necessary but  not sufficient. What is sufficient is to arrive at tangible and  practical steps that people can feel, make a difference of their  own lives. And we assure them that the process of negotiations  is going to ensure their own concerns.    [Reporter] Dr. al-'Anani: Do you think that the king's last  speech has put a lot more pressure on the PLO to deal with the  issues that are still in the air with the Palestinians and  Jordanians?    [Al-'Anani] I do not need to analyze his majesty's motives.  I think that the speech of his majesty was very clear, very  candid. He was showing a great deal of concern that we need more  coordination, and this coordination is not only a Jordanian  demand, but it is a Jordanian as well as a Palestinian demand.    [Reporter] When do you expect the signing?    [Al-'Anani] We expect that we should continue to negotiate.  [end recording]</p>

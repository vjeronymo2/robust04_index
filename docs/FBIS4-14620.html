			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin is fully aware of the mood of society  concerning the possibility of Russia joining NATO's Partnership  for Peace [PFP] program, the president's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov said at a briefing in the Kremlin Thursday  [31 March]. In any case, the president does not intend to be  hurried and may need six or seven months to make a decision.    Kostikov said that special services, the Defense Ministry  and  the Foreign Ministry supported the joining of the Partnership  for Peace program.    "The president also recognizes the arguments of the  opponents  of this step," Kostikov said. He cited numerous considerations  which made Yeltsin listen to the views of both the supporters  and opponents of joining the program.    The opponents of the program, said Kostikov, say it does not  reflect the role played by Russia or its weight in today's  world. It might result in Russia losing the room to maneuver in  trouble spots.    What is more, the opponents tell the president that Russia  does not stand to gain anything specific by joining the program.    The world community will celebrate the 50th anniversary of  the landing of allied armies in Europe in World War II this  year. Russia has not been invited to the opening ceremony. Such  incidents, Kostikov said, compel Russian opponents of the  Partnership to press for special conditions to be incorporated  into the agreement.</p>

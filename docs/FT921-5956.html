			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Morocco and EC pull back from brink MOROCCO and the European Community last night pulled back from the brink of a crisis, agreeing in last-minute talks in Rabat to extend a fishing pact. The deal meant that 800 fishing vessels, mostly Spanish, could still fish in Moroccan waters instead of pulling out by midnight last night. Relations between Morocco and the EC ran into stormy weather after the European Parliament voted down Ecu463m (Pounds 324m) in credit and aid under a co-operation agreement, because of its human rights record. Rabat responded by freezing the agreement with the EC and so jeopardising a four-year fishing accord, which is vital to Spain's large fleet and due to run out today. As the fishing accord deadline neared, the EC ordered vessels in Moroccan waters back to port from midnight. But with both sides anxious to avoid a breach, a Brussels official - Mr Manuel Marin, the EC commissioner for development and fisheries - flew to Rabat yesterday evening for talks with cabinet ministers. An EC spokesman in Brussels later announced: 'There's been an agreement to prolong the deal for two months.' There were indications of a change of heart in Rabat after EC foreign ministers decided last week to explore a wider-ranging free trade agreement with Morocco. The ministers are to discuss this possibility in Brussels on Monday. EC officials said the discussion would widen to examine similar agreements with Morocco's neighbours, Algeria and Tunisia. What had seemed a tactical ploy to mend diplomatic fences with Rabat could eventually widen into a strategic aim to bind the Maghreb as a whole closer to the EC. Morocco's creditor governments have agreed to allow the country to delay payment on a large portion of its Dollars 22bn foreign debt, Reuter reports. The agreement was reached at a meeting of the Paris Club of creditor countries. Moroccan Finance Minister Mohammed Berrada said the agreement allowed his country to reschedule Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

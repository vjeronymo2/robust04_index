			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Animator at work - Dominique Damon explains to Ian Rodger her business version of 'explication de texte' It may sound unlikely, but the management approach of Dominique Damon, recently appointed chief operating officer of Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, bears a striking resemblance to the great French discipline of 'explication de texte'. The idea behind explication de texte is not to make grand assessments from an overview of a whole novel, play or poem, but to focus on a small, but significant, text, and thereby to achieve a new enlightenment about the whole. The 47-year-old Damon, who is French, tries to do just that, travelling nearly constantly to visit the group's subsidiaries in Europe and the US and examine with the managers very specific problems. On a recent visit to a subsidiary in Basle, for example, she devoted the day to working capital. 'What could be more banal, you may say, and it would be banal if I just walked in and looked at the figures and said, 'right, you have to do better,' and walked out,' she explains. Instead, she sat down with the managers of the subsidiary and probed into the finest details until they all understood what was really wrong and could come up with ideas for improvements. 'I am not interested in them making presentations for me. I want an exchange of ideas at every level,' she says. 'People are stressed if there are problems, and you can make it worse if you do not help. It is not for me to find solutions, but I cannot leave people in anguish.' She uses the French word 'animation' to describe her approach - roughly a combination of motivating and stimulating - and she is convinced that it can conquer most management problems. She recalled visiting a company in the Netherlands - in pre-Alusuisse days - where an absenteeism rate of 16 per cent was destroying its competitiveness. She was told nothing could be done because that was a national pattern. She refused to accept it, meeting again and again with the managers and employees until ways were found to bring it down. Is it easier for a woman to win the confidence of employees than for a man? 'I don't think so, except in extreme situations.' She recalls an occasion at the beginning of her career at the Boussois flat glass company in Paris. A particularly rowdy union was staging a sit-in and her superiors were so frightened that they sent her in to deal with the leaders. 'They were shouting loudly. My only tactic was to talk very quietly. Gradually, things calmed down until only one man was shouting, and I said calmly that either he had to go or that I would go.' Damon's most noteworthy achievement in her six years at Alusuisse has been to make nine acquisitions - including the big Canadian Lawson Mardon packaging group early this year - in five years, without a disaster and without losing the companies' top managers. She says she is careful when looking at acquisition candidates to pick those whose natural development has been artificially blocked - perhaps by a nervous owner or excessive debt or the lack of critical mass. Then from the day of the purchase, she moves in, sets goals and gets people 'animated'. Within a week of the takeover of Lawson Mardon, every line executive was given clear targets to achieve. Damon has a doctorate in experimental psychology but has never been to business school. She reads books on management but has no favourites among the gurus. 'They all add something, but they tend to repeat themselves after a few years,' she says. Now that she is chief operating officer and soon to be group chief executive, should she not be sitting back, contemplating the big picture and leaving the nitty gritty to others? 'I hope not,' she replies without hesitation. Questions such as whether Alusuisse should have three legs or five, or whether packaging should make up 50 per cent or 75 per cent of the whole in 10 years do not seem to interest her. 'Of course, we have a very strong strategic team in Zurich that analyses every project and every company's business plan. We use a three-year rolling plan and we have worked very hard on the accuracy of our forecasts. But I do not see any need for a longer-term plan. We know our markets well enough that we should not go wrong.'</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: GTE lifts net income to Dollars 427m GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported an underlying increase in earnings per share in the three months to end-March. GTE said total net income was Dollars 427m, compared with Dollars 201m in the same period a year earlier. However, the first quarter of 1991 bore a one-off charge, totalling Dollars 204m at the after-tax level, related to the merger with Contel and the gain on the transfer of certain cellular telephone assets. Stripping out the effect of this and discontinued operations, GTE calculated a 7 per cent improvement in earnings per share, with sales for the quarter reaching Dollars 4.8bn, against Dollars 4.7bn a year ago. GTE said it was pleased with the figures given the economic environment. It added that all business areas showed an improvement, with the telephone and cellular-mobile units faring particularly well. Revenues on the telephone side rose 1 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn, while operating profits were up 6 per cent at more than Dollars 1bn. On the telecommunications products and services side, there was a 7 per cent revenue gain, at Dollars 977m, with operating profits up from Dollars 18m to Dollars 39m. AMERITECH, one of the seven Baby Bells, said its first-quarter results revealed signs that the Midwest's economy was emerging from the national recession, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago. Its net income for the first quarter was Dollars 337m, up 19.1 per cent over last year's Dollars 283m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.26 for the three months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 1.07 a year ago. Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said the rate of line growth was improving and that customers were using the telephones more. Net income for the first quarter also included Dollars 28m, or about 10 cents per share, from interest income on a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the IRS settlement's interest, earnings per share were Dollars 1.16, up 8.4 per cent.</p>

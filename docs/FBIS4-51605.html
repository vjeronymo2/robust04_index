			<p>BFN     [Text] Seven constitutional amendment bills sponsored by  the government received less than half of the votes of the 625  members of the National Assembly during a joint session, which  was opened at 0955 today. The draft legislation therefore  failed to pass its first reading.    In compliance with the suggestion of House Speaker Marut  Bunnak, the alphabetic roll call was employed and members of the  National Assembly were requested to vote on all the seven bills  at one time. Normally, special legislation involving  constitutional amendment bills would require separate voting,  which in the case of the seven drafts would take about 10 hours.    The result of the voting was that the seven bills failed to  get 313 votes or half of the votes from the 265 senators and 360  members of the House of Representatives. The majority of the  members of the National Assembly abstained from voting. The  vote counting was completed at 1310.    In response to criticism of his job performance by some  opposition members of the House, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  said it was a rather difficult task to try to please everyone,  noting that the government had to be very careful in making  decisions. He asked everyone to keep firmly to the democratic  path, something which might not satisfy everybody. Things must  proceed according to the procedures. He pointed out that the  government not only had to serve the people, but also had to  preserve the country's democratic system.    Members of the National Assembly stood up to hear the Royal  Decree declaring the closure of the extraordinary session on 1  May.    The ordinary parliamentary session will be opened on 1 May  for a period of three months.</p>

History  will provide once again an opportunity for the Tajiks, together,  to contribute to the fate of this ancient nation. It is  necessary for us to discuss comprehensively the new  constitution, the main law of Tajikistan, and to put it to a  nationwide referendum, and on its basis to hold elections for  the highest bodies of power in the republic.    These fateful political activities on which the sovereignty,  the future of the state, and the present and future life of the  people depend, have to be carried out until the end of the  current year.    Dear compatriots, our Tajikistan can not only overcome all  the difficulties posed by the fratricidal war, as a result of  which it has lost much, but it can preserve political unity,  territorial integrity and its sovereignty. Today, our dear  Tajikistan is flourishing, and the republic looks with hope to  every one of its worthy sons who can contribute to this in this  ancient land.    The process of reconciliation and forgiveness continues in  long- suffering Tajikistan. Fruitful negotiations with the  different political forces of the republic have been under way  for several months. Brother can not have offended brother. We  all remember you, and we hope that you will return soon and will  shake hands with your brothers. We hope that you will settle in  the motherland of your ancestors and at the same time will  contribute in helping our country flourish. We hope that you,  our dear compatriots abroad, will take an active part in the  future political and economic life of Tajikistan.    The leadership of Tajikistan is ready to create all the  conditions required for your return. We are ready to solve your  economic, social and political problems fraternally, and to find  decisions which satisfy everyone. We are ready to say welcome  to all who want to return home and to create favorable  conditions for them.    We are confident that the sense of patriotism will envelop  you and that you will overcome all obstacles to your return  home. The Tajiks have one motherland and our task is to  preserve and to love it. Each home, each family and each town  are waiting for you.    [Signed] Imamali Rakhmanov, head of state of the Republic of  Tajikistan</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Klaus Peter Krause commentary: "Club-Law in Trade"] </F>   [Text] Is the news on the agreement in the U.S.-Japanese  dispute over radio telephones news from the world of trade peace  or trade war? One may disagree on this issue. In fact, the  U.S. Administration is once again using the club in trade  policy. President Bill Clinton has reenacted the Super 301  clause of the U.S. trade law. It makes possible sanctions  against the import of goods from countries that close their  markets to U.S. goods and services. Thus, the U.S.  Administration can impose high punitive tariffs on these  imports. Yet a certain procedure has to be followed. It  ensures that no rash decisions are made, and that there is  enough time for negotiations and compromises.    Still, the threatening gesture has a certain impact -- as  can  be seen in connection with the radio telephone issue. Yet this  behavior is not exactly a fair procedure in trade policies; it  does not follow the principle that the international community  has been trying to implement so long -- opening up markets on  the basis of multilateral rules, not with the help of  multilateral retaliatory strikes.    After all, it took seven years to adopt successfully new  GATT  rules for fair trade among the states. The results of the  eighth GATT round -- the Uruguay Round -- that were achieved  with difficulty are to be signed by the governments in Marrakesh  in mid-April and to be ratified by the participants afterward.  The agreement is based on the principle of multilaterality,  which also applies to conflicts between two countries.  Washington simply ignores this rule.    The agreement restricts U.S. leeway for unilateral  sanctions.  In fact, it has not yet entered into force and the United  States is not yet obliged to observe it. However, it would be  wise for the largest trade power to respect the spirit of the  GATT agreement already at this point instead of violating it in  such an obvious manner and of undermining it before it is  signed. Moreover, this affects U.S. credibility as a power that  strongly advocates free trade. It is important for the United  States to strengthen its credibility because it is not exactly a  shining example as far as fending off undesirable import  competition at home is concerned.    Japan, too, is not enthusiastic about opening up its markets  for free trade. Yet the United States is threatening the  government in Tokyo in such a way that one has the impression  that stubborn Japan is barricading itself against the goods that  the United States wants to export, with high protective tariffs,  quotas, import bans, and other classical protectionist measures.  Yet this is not true at all (with the exception of rice, which,  however, is not an issue at present). The goods reach Japan  unimpeded, but it is difficult or impossible to sell them there.    One reason for that is restraint of competition in the  Japanese market, partly carried out by the state and partly by  private enterprises. The restrictions by the state include  vague regulations, complicated provisions governing aliens'  registration, the preferential treatment of Japanese enterprises  in public invitations to bid, arbitrariness on the part of the  authorities, additional examination of products, delayed  permits, other technical requirements, and similar things.    Some of these barriers naturally result from the realities  in  Japan, which exist everywhere, including the United States, and  which are not aimed at impeding import competition. Yet they  have this effect. Some measures, however, are designed to serve  this goal. It is clear and quite understandable that Washington  is trying to urge the Japanese Government to remove these  barriers. This also applies to restrictions in the private  sector, including cartels aimed at allocating market shares and  regulations that partly or completely deny importers access to  the market. However, Japanese "newcomers" also suffer from  these rules. A stricter policy on competition by the state is  required in this respect.    Another reason that makes it difficult for exporters to  sell their goods in the Japanese market is naturally foreign  peculiarities which have to be handled by foreign suppliers  everywhere. They include the Japanese mentality, the behavior  and regulations prevailing there, the foreign language and  characters, the complicated trade and sales network, developed  personal relationships, exclusive contracts between subsuppliers  and the production industry, old habits, different industrial  structures, and the different tastes of consumers. All these  and many other things make it extraordinarily difficult for  foreigners to carry out business. In other words: These are  advantages that domestic competitors always enjoy at home and  which are not condemnable at all.    The United States, however, behaves as though the Japanese  Government should also eliminate these natural peculiarities  because they limit "fair competition." What it does not say is  that the Japanese are facing similar difficulties in the United  States, but that the Japanese apparently find it much easier to  adapt. Another aspect that the United States ignores is that  there are foreign companies that have succeeded in gaining a  foothold in Japan, despite the fact that they were confronted  with the same problems. Thus, they must be more skillful in  offering their products and in their behavior, which means that  they must be more competitive.    Clearing the path forcibly for U.S. enterprises which are  not  capable of adapting to the situation by means of official U.S.  pressure on Japan, by urging fixed import quotas and market  shares does not correspond to the spirit and meaning of free  trade. Washington believes that it is right in its dispute with  Japan, which is partly justified, but it is trying to manipulate  trade, resorting to club-law. Both sides are exaggerating. The  Japanese Government is wriggling like an eel. The truth is that  the market in Japan is much less closed than Washington claims.</p>

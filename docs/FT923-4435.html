			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Cloudy skies at Farnborough: One of the world's biggest air shows takes place against a background of uncertainty in the aerospace industry Mr Jean Pierson, the chairman of Airbus, was offering a bottle of champagne for the first serious customer to walk into the European aircraft consortium's hospitality chalet at the Berlin air show in June. He is likely to double the offer at Farnborough today. Airbus, like the rest of the industry, is scrambling for new orders at a time when the overlapping and growing difficulties of both the civil and defence sides of the business are accelerating a radical reshaping of large sections of the industry. The last Farnborough air show two years ago was dominated by the impact of the sharp defence cuts on the military business that followed the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the cold war. This time, the focus of concern has shifted to civil aviation which has so far failed to recover from its worst recession in 40 years. 'Frankly, the financial health of civil aviation worries me more than the fall-off in the military market,' said Mr Brian Rowe, head of the US General Electric company's aero-engine activities. For Mr Rowe, the military slowdown was not unexpected although it occurred much faster than anticipated. 'The question is how do we continue to develop large commercial engines when our customers are losing multi-billions of dollars a year and it appears they are still a few years away from relief,' he added. Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman of GPA, the Irish leasing group which was forced to shelve its flotation this year because of the depressed state of the commercial aircraft market, said the industry's financial situation was a disaster. 'Since mid-1990, the world airline industry has lost at least Dollars 10bn, an amount roughly equivalent to its entire earnings in the previous six years. For any industry, such a setback would be a significant blow: for one which must finance over Dollars 30bn worth of new assets a year on average, it is a catastrophe,' he said last week. A big gap is emerging between the airline industry's financial resources and its needs. In turn, airlines' growing difficulties in financing new aircraft acquisitions is becoming one of the main challenges facing aircraft manufacturers. Unless new sources of financing are developed, the industry's more optimistic long-term growth forecasts are unlikely to be realised, warns Mr Adam Brown, the Airbus planning director. The industry continues to believe that air traffic will grow by 5 per cent a year on average during the next 10 years and that the world aircraft fleet will need to expand accordingly. Airbus last week predicted that during the next 20 years 90 per cent of the world's current inventory of about 7,800 jets will be replaced. Most will be retired. Airbus is now forecasting that world airlines will order more than 9,000 additional new aircraft during the next 20 years. This represents business worth about Dollars 850bn at today's prices. But this bright future hinges on the industry overcoming its short-term difficulties. Although passenger traffic has picked up since the air travel slump caused by the combination of the Gulf war last year and economic recession, business has failed so far to recover sufficiently to match the overall rise in capacity which is still outstripping passenger demand. Simply put, too many aircraft are flying with empty seats. After falling by 3 per cent last year - the first decline in air traffic since the introduction of the jet aircraft - passenger traffic has increased so far this year by 8 per cent compared with 1990, the year before the collapse provoked by the Gulf conflict. But according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), overall capacity is 12 per cent higher than in 1990. Airlines are engaged in what Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, calls a 'kamikaze fare discounting war' to maintain market share in anticipation of an eventual traffic rebound and to position themselves in an increasingly deregulated international aviation market. The Association of European Airlines (AEA), which groups together 24 European carriers, also noted last week that the current weakness in the market has coincided with a surge in capacity by US airlines. This, in turn, has created a renewed fares war to attract US traffic hit by the falling value of the US dollar. In Europe, even the Olympic Games and the world trade fair in Spain failed to regain the lost momentum in air travel, AEA added. Excess capacity is also unsettling aircraft manufacturers. 'Air travel may experience much stronger growth than we now project, but our best guess today is that there is no foreseeable shortfall to 2010 in commercial aircraft manufacturing capacity,' said Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice-president of planning and international development. 'It seems clear that the growing problem of excess capacity will have a huge impact on our industry over the next five to 10 years and we will probably see a change in both the composition of the airframe manufacturers and their relationship with suppliers,' he added. The contraction in the defence industry is expected to continue spawning new ventures in commercial aerospace, putting even greater pressure on capacity. This is likely to take place not only among the big western manufacturing industries but also in Russia and other countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region with aerospace aspirations. Russia is mounting an unprecedented marketing drive to sell military and commercial aircraft in the west at Farnborough this year. More than 400 Russian officials are attending the show. At least 20 Russian aircraft will be exhibited, including seven never shown in the west before. During the last cyclical expansion, airlines and leasing companies ordered more than 1,000 aircraft a year between 1988 and 1990. This has created an order backlog equivalent to five years of future production for the big three airliner manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas. This compares with a historical average of just over two years for the industry. Although the big three manufacturers have lost some firm orders through cancellation and have been forced to reschedule deliveries of new aircraft as well as reduce production on some programmes, they are still confident that their huge order backlog will ultimately be delivered over a longer than originally envisaged timescale. Manufacturers still expect to deliver a record total of about 800 new aircraft this year. But Airbus now acknowledges that deliveries will decline to some 400 aircraft a year in 2004 before rising again when the next aircraft replacement cycle pushes the number up to 600 a year by 2008/2010. But the industry is not only facing overcapacity. It is also having to cope with a sharp increase in new product development costs. 'Driven at least in part by the increasing complexity of airworthiness regulations, the non-recurring costs necessary to conceive a new product and to bring it to the market have been growing far more rapidly than general cost inflation,' says Mr Brown of Airbus. This is expected to lead to a sharp reduction in commercial aircraft programme launches - a mirror of the trend in the military aircraft industry. In the US, the world's largest aerospace market, the number of combat aircraft programmes in production has already fallen from 11 in the 1970s to seven in the 1980s and probably to no more than one or possibly two in the 1990s. On the commercial side, there have been a total of 19 important new product launches in the past 20 years. 'I find it difficult to envisage more than a quarter of this number - that is, at a maximum four or five - of major product launches in the next 20 years,' said Mr Brown. He also expects the focus in the industry to shift from new product development to improving existing aircraft programmes. Excess capacity and increasing development costs have forced the pace of restructuring in the industry. The past few months have seen Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, negotiate a partnership with Fokker of the Netherlands which is expected to lead to a significant realignment in the European regional aircraft industry. McDonnell Douglas has been striving to forge an alliance with aerospace manufacturers in the Far East to form a new international commercial aerospace partnership to match Boeing, which controls 55 per cent of the world market, and the European Airbus consortium which has built up a 26 per cent share of the market during the past 20 years. The pressures of the market are also driving companies into broader cross-border alliances and forcing them to retrench around their core activities. General Dynamics, the biggest US defence contractor, took the lead when it decided to shed all its non-strategic defence activities, including those in the commercial sector, to refocus itself on its principal military businesses. British Aerospace is in the throes of a similar process. It is expected to announce later this month a restructuring programme aimed at focusing the company on its core military and large civil airliner business. And Boeing, the world's dominant commercial aerospace company with a long 'do-it-alone' tradition, is now openly talking of expanding international collaboration. The industry both in the US and Europe believes that future market requirements for more technologically and environmentally efficient aircraft, including a new generation of 600-seater jumbos and supersonic jets, will require significant government support. This summer the European aerospace companies have already urged the European Community to fund a five-year Pounds 1.2bn programme to develop advanced new aircraft technologies. In turn, the US industry has called for more consistent political support for aerospace companies. Ultimately, however, there is bound to be a significant shake-out both in the civil aviation and defence industries. Sir Colin Marshall, the deputy chairman of British Airways, believes the industry will eventually be dominated by 'no more than 10-12 global airline combines, perhaps less'. On the manufacturing side, Mr Rowe of GE believes that 'out of the ashes of 1991 and 1992, a more streamlined, cost-efficient industry has to emerge'. Mr Pierson of Airbus gave a blunter prediction: 'If you want to make a small fortune in aerospace these days, you better start with a big one.'</p>

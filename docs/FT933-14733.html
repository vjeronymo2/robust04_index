			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Unusual show of strength: Japan's election poses questions about the bureaucracy's role Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, apparently mortally wounded by a no-confidence vote against him two weeks ago, turned the conventional wisdom of Japanese politics on its head last week: he took a decision. Not only was the decision significant - to make concessions to secure a framework for trade talks - but Mr Miyazawa did so despite opposition from one of the most powerful arms of Japan's bureaucracy, the Ministry for International Trade and Industry. Mr Miyazawa bypassed Miti with a personal letter to President Bill Clinton to reopen talks with the US, stalled in Tokyo 10 days ago. Miti was furious, but worse was to come. Mr Miyazawa repeatedly intervened last week to keep negotiations going. His boldness sent a shudder through the ordered world of Kasumigaseki, the Tokyo district between the Imperial Palace and parliament, which is home to Tokyo's shabby ministries. The life of the elite bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki rests upon a clear division of labour: they decide the policies, the politicians present them; the bureaucrats worry about Japan's long-term interests, the politicians worry about getting re-elected; the bureaucracy prides itself on probity, the political system is lubricated by corruption. It was widely assumed that this division of labour would be reinforced by the political turmoil in the run-up to next weekend's general election, which was triggered by the no-confidence vote. The prime minister was supposed to be a lame duck. The splits in the Liberal Democratic party ranks mean the next government is almost certain to be a coalition, preoccupied with political reform. So, many assumed, the bureaucrats would fill the vacuum by increasing their already prodigious power. Mr Miyazawa's sudden transformation into a man of action has sent the bureaucracy a warning. The political upheaval is not simply a challenge to the LDP's political dominance, it is threatening to rewrite the rules by which Japan has been governed since 1945. Under those rules, the LDP, in power for 38 years, has provided a political umbrella under which the bureaucracy can work untroubled by political interference. The LDP has benefited from its privileged access to ministries, and can press for concessions on behalf of constituents who may want building regulations relaxed or a bridge built, for instance. So the bureaucracy shares with the LDP a vested interest in maintaining the post-war framework which has given it such influence. Japan's top civil servants have been bred to rule. They are as powerful as their counterparts in France, while being more pragmatic. They are more practical than the British and less politicised than the Americans. The bureaucrats are also a closed society - the top echelons of the finance ministry, the pinnacle of the bureaucracy, are drawn almost exclusively from one department of Tokyo University, the law faculty. The graduates of the handful of universities - Tokyo, Waseda, Keio - which staff the upper posts of the civil service will move through their careers together at the same orderly pace, frequently crossing paths. Yet in spite of this incestuousness, ministries compete fiercely to guard their turf. The finance ministry, Miti and the foreign ministry run parallel, but sometimes conflicting, foreign policies which cover trade, finance and diplomacy. Each ministry has a mission. At the finance ministry it is to keep the public finances out of the clutches of spendthrift politicians. At Miti it is to promote the interests of Japanese industry. At the foreign ministry it is to shepherd Japan into a wider world role to match its economic dominance. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, until recently the top official at Miti, believes the bureaucrats will steer Japan through the political turmoil ahead. He explained: 'This may be a fundamental change in the political structure but not in the bureaucratic system, which is very stable, with capable people who will serve their country even if there is are big changes in politics.' In the short term, bureaucrats may gain more power. A senior finance ministry official said: 'The bureaucracy is powerful when the politicians are divided. When they cannot agree they turn to us for policies. If Japan is now going to have rather unstable coalition government, with divisions between partners on policies, then the bureaucracy may have to do more by way of making policy.' Yet the idea that the civil service will emerge after the election as the main winner is probably mistaken, for two reasons. First, top officials admit big decisions can only be taken by democratically accountable politicians rather than unelected bureaucrats. As a rising stars at the finance ministry admitted: 'The bureaucracy will keep the wheels of government moving on small, routine decisions. But big issues, like tax reform or whether another pump-priming package is needed to boost the economy, require political leadership. The bureaucracy is too cautious to take such decisions on its own.' Mr Shinichi Kitaoka, professor of politics at Rikkyo University, put it this way: 'Japanese bureaucrats are generally a talented lot but the bureaucracy operates effectively only when it has good precedents. The end of the cold war and the turmoil in Japan is taking us into a world without precedents. Politicians must lead the way where no precedent exists, especially when decisions such as on trade have global repercussions.' Second, Japan's young reformers want to reorganise the relationship between politics and the bureaucracy, to put politicians firmly in the driving seat. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, one of the leaders of the Japan Renewal party, formed after splitting from the LDP, argues Japan needs two parties capable of governing to reinvigorate political debate. Mr Ozawa also believes Japan needs more decisive leadership. Mr Kazuo Aichi, another Japan Renewal member, said: 'Policies should be decided openly by political debate, not in ministries. Politicians should make decisions, set priorities and then the bureaucrats should carry them out.' There are few finer symbols of the system the reformers say they want to overhaul than Mr Miyazawa, a cautious former civil servant turned politician. They have poured scorn on his record and ridiculed his failure to introduce reforms. Yet as a lame duck, at the end of his career, he was suddenly freed last week from the inhibiting customs and practices with which he has lived. As a result he was able to take a decisive political initiative which would have been unthinkable a month ago when he was nominally the most powerful man in the country. In perhaps his final act as prime minister, Mr Miyazawa may have set an example of decisiveness which the reformers will struggle to match.</p>

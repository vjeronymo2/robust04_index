			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of these requirements reflect the HACCP principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed by NACMCF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is not proposing to require that the HACCP plan be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signed by any official of a company, but invites comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merits of such a requirement in the final regulations as a means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of both ensuring and demonstrating formal adoption of the plan by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that company. FDA also invites comment on who in the firm would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the appropriate individual to sign the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Guidelines and Other Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA recognizes that HACCP plans will vary in complexity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from those having many critical control points, such as plans for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multicomponent, ready-to-eat products, to those having only a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points, such as a plan for a fish filleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant. Plan development can be facilitated by technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance from many sources and by the detailed advice provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the literature. NACMCF, for example, has recommended that, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate the development of HACCP plans, processors should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create an HACCP team, identify the intended use and likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers of the food, and prepare a flow diagram of the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing process to help identify critical control points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency favors simplicity and the rapid development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans without undue expense. The appendices at the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations are intended to facilitate plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development by setting forth certain critical control points,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical limits, controls, and records that, if incorporated into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or prepared under a HACCP plan, would be acceptable to the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the types of products mentioned. To further facilitate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of HACCP plans, FDA intends to issue separate HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance for seafood that will provide information on hazards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate controls by species and by product type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance will provide a broad spectrum of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from which firms will be able to identify likely hazards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points that apply to them. The agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the number of critical control points will range, roughly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 2 and 12 per product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance will also contain a fill-in-the-blank type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plan with instructions on how to complete the plan based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the guidance. The agency has tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that a plan that follows this model is likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to FDA. The agency is including samples of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance it is developing in Appendix 1 to this document. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to issue a separate draft guidance document for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment and to make the completed guidance available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public at the time that the regulations are finalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

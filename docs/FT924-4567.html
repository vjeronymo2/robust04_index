			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Death toll in Palestinian feud hits 25 TWO members of Abu Nidal's extremist Palestinian Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) were killed by their own bomb yesterday in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, bringing to 25 the number of Palestinians killed in a six-month vendetta between Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and the FRC. A series of bombings and gangland-style murders, carried out with submachine guns and silenced pistols in marketplaces and cafes and on the sea-front promenade, have terrorised the residents of Sidon. Abu Nidal has demanded that the PLO release 62 FRC members it is holding in Sidon. The 19 year-old conflict between the two groups has been exacerbated by the Middle East peace talks. The FRC accuses the PLO of betraying Palestinians by accepting the talks should take place. PLO officials in Lebanon claim the Abu Nidal group seeks to ruin Lebanese-Palestinian relations and force Lebanese authorities to disarm the refugee camps. The Lebanese army surrounded the camps in July 1991 and seized heavy weapons, but allowed guerrillas inside the camps to keep their guns. Walid Abu Tarboush and Hassan Dib, the two men who died yesterday, were planting a bomb near a PLO office in the Ein el Hilweh refugee camp when the device exploded. The feud began on June 8 when Mr Atef Bseiso, head of security for the PLO, was gunned down in Paris. The assassination campaign moved to Sidon with the murder of Fatah's Ein el Helweh commander. Fatah then went on the offensive, assassinating three FRC members in July, including Mr Walid Khaled, the group's leader in Lebanon. Israeli security forces shot dead a 12-year-old boy and wounded 30 people during clashes with Palestinians yesterday in the occupied Gaza Strip, Reuter reports from Gaza. Arabs said the violence began when troops charged into a wake for a Palestinian stone-thrower killed last week.</p>

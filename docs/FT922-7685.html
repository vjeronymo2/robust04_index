			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Hit and miss Schnitke THE MUSIC of Alfred Shnitke forms the backbone of the London Sinfonietta's current South Bank series. Alongside Shnitke's Concerti Grossi and his Fourth Symphony, which gets its London premiere next Thursday, there are premieres of three British works - by Nicholas Maw and James MacMillan so far, and by Benedict Mason in the final concert. Shnitke is very much the flavour of the moment in Western Europe. Max Loppert reported from Amsterdam on the premiere of his first opera, Life with an Idiot a month ago, and the Sinfonietta's survey follows in the wake of the Barbican's major Shnitke celebration last year. Those concerts were splendidly supported and rapturously received. The new series so far has attracted less attention, perhaps because the first concert had to compete with Philip Glass strutting his endless stuff in the Festival Hall, while this week's clashed with a performance of Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony. There is a serious risk, too, of over-exposing a highly circumscribed talent. The more one hears of Shnitke's music, the more one realises how hit-and-miss it is, and how its superficially seductive synthesis of such disparate musical elements works expressively on some occasions, surreally on others, while misfiring completely far too often. So the First Concerto Grosso from 1977, which Antony Pay conducted in the first concert is one of his successes, but the orchestral version of the 1985 Trio Sonata proved to be a dogged, overlong failure. At another extreme the Concerto for Piano and Strings, in which Paul Crossley was the excellent soloist on Thursday, seems undisciplined and unfocussed, piling up grandiose gestures from shards of the old Tsarist National Anthem, echoes of Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto, and fistfuls of tone clusters. The new works promised much more. Both Maw and MacMillan were writing for the Sinfonietta for the first time, and it was intriguing to discover how Maw in particular would pare down his usually luxuriant orchestral palette to the band's slender resources. In fact his Shahnama is scored for a decent body of strings alongside the single wind, and generates some passingly luscious sounds around its Brittenish gestures. But it emerged as a rather thin sequence of movements, inspired in an almost programmatic way by Persian paintings of the 15th century; each of the nine movements carries a descriptive title, and in the score Maw allows for them to be played in any order. Perhaps in a truly punchy, alert performance Shanama would emerge more positively. But the Sinfonietta under Pay was not at its best in the first concert, though it had tightened up considerably for the second, conducted by Martyn Brabbins; MacMillan's new Sinfonietta was cleanly and often eloquently projected. MacMillan's music becomes ever clearer in its outline and more direct in its emotional impact. The new piece is cast as a 20-minute arch, beginning with chant-like melodies before erupting with Varese-like violence into a grotesque march, which veers in and out of focus before subsiding into the quietude of the opening again. It is effective, well-paced and worryingly soft-centred. MacMillan remains an exceptional talent, but one whose voice still seems to be seeking its most convincing tone. Queen Elizabeth Hall, London; final concert May 21</p>

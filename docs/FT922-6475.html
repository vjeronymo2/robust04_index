			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Argyll mixes it with the big boys - The Bottom Line SIR Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost grocery chains, once likened his company's directors to a group of small boys in shorts playing football at the far end of the schoolyard. 'Now we are up mixing it with the big boys,' he says proudly. In the five years since it bought the Safeway chain of supermarkets, Argyll has indeed grown to maturity and is widely recognised as being among the 'big three' of the grocery trade - some way short of, but at least in touch, with J. Sainsbury and Tesco. This week Argyll confirmed its strength by producing a 25 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 364.5m in the middle of a recession and in the face of intense competition. Spending on food has been little affected by the economic downturn, but the pace of Argyll's physical growth and profits expansion has nevertheless been eye-catching. Last year it opened 17 Safeway stores, accounting for most of its capital expenditure budget of Pounds 442m. And Safeway is stepping up its development programme by opening 25 stores both this year and next. Still flush with funds from last June's Pounds 387m rights issue, Argyll will invest a further Pounds 550m this year, which works out at almost Pounds 1 1/2 m a day. Its new stores, costing about Pounds 15m, are achieving a return on investment of 30 per cent. The 322-store Safeway chain accounts for about three-quarters of the group's turnover of Pounds 5.04bn. In the past five years its profits have grown sixfold and sales threefold. Safeway has been transformed since it was acquired. Five years ago, most of its store portfolio consisted of 1970s American-style supermarkets which were losing their edge against the out-of-town superstores being erected by their rivals. But Argyll has strongly developed the Safeway brand moving into edge-of-town superstore sites, expanding the company's own-label range, investing heavily in electronic point of sale (epos) systems, and creating a centralised distribution network. In 1987 the company scanned only 2 per cent of its goods through epos systems. Now it scans 100 per cent, giving the company enormous marketing and operational benefits. Argyll is also a marketing company. This year it will launch 1,500 own-label lines which will enable it to edge margins still higher. 'We now have more in common with Unilever than with Jack Cohen's style of 'piling it high selling it cheap' in the early days of Tesco,' says Grant. David Webster, deputy chairman, points out that Safeway has broadened its range of activities and runs 317 delicatessens, 275 bakeries, 31 petrol stations, and 53 pharmacies. Argyll also owns the Presto chain, which has 212 supermarkets, and Lo-Cost, which runs 285 discount outlets. In recent years, these two businesses have taken the back seat to Safeway's development plans. But Argyll's directors hinted this week that they may push these brands far more aggressively as the exceptional returns achieved from the big edge-of-town Safeway superstores begin to tail off. Argyll has kept a close eye on developments in the mainland European food retailing market by linking up with Ahold of the Netherlands and Casino of France to form the European Retail Alliance (Era). This group swaps technology skills and distribution expertise and is beginning to pool buying power. The link is already being seen in some of Safeway's stores. Shoppers at the recently-opened Hatch End store have been treated to a range of 50 Casino-sourced French products, such as cassoulet and creme dessert. But in spite of its progress, Argyll will always remain one of the great 'what if?' stories of UK corporate history. Would Argyll have performed still better had James Gulliver won the controversial contested auction for the Distillers drinks group in 1986 and been able to take advantage of the great profits uplift that Guinness has enjoyed? Nobody can know for sure. But Argyll seems quite happy spending the Pounds 100m proceeds it received from Guinness in settlement of its legal claim building several more highly profitable superstores.</p>

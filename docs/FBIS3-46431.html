			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> Do Not Interfere in Other Countries' Internal Affairs"]    [Text] A basic criterion for establishing normal relations  between states is precisely non-interference in other countries'  internal affairs; that can be found in the United Nations  Charter as well as many international declarations and  statements. Regretfully, incidents of interfering in other  countries' internal affairs have taken place one after another.  In the past, when the two superpowers dominated the world, it  was primarily the United States and the USSR that interfered  with other countries' internal affairs. The Soviet Army's  invasion of Afghanistan and U.S. Army's invasion of Panama are  the most conspicuous examples in our memory. In the wake of the  disintegration of the USSR, the United States is the only  country that can constantly interfere with other countries'  internal affairs while claiming itself the international  policeman.  <H5>  The Inauguration of "Radio Free Asia" Is a Hegemonist Act </H5>   In recent years, the United States has consistently created  disputes in its relations with China and has interfered with  China's internal affairs, resulting in great disharmony in  bilateral relations. Since U.S. President Clinton held a summit  and invited Chinese State President Jiang Zemin to visit  Seattle, the U.S. Administration's attitude toward China has  tended to be realistic; ties between officials of the two sides  have markedly increased; their mutual understanding has been  greatly enhanced; and the momentum of development has been  sound. However, anyone can see that there is always some  element within the United States that is unwilling to see the  normalization of international relations, especially Sino-U.S.  relations, and is doing all it can to set up hurdles. The  so-called "Radio Free Asia" that primarily targets China is  precisely one of their most up-to-date inventions. A few days  ago, the U.S. Senate officially adopted the bill on establishing  "Radio Free Asia." Due to the U.S. economic recession, the  United States is having difficulty making ends meet in its  financial situation; the U.S. Federal Government has already  received complaints from Los Angeles earthquake victims because  it is unable to provide Los Angeles more money for relief  purposes. Nevertheless, at this particular moment, they would  rather spend a huge sum starting up "Radio Free Asia" -- why?  Its real aim is precisely to utilize the station to create  disputes, instigate turmoil, and realize the goal of interfering  the internal affairs of China as well as other Asian countries.  This being the case, the bill has naturally met with opposition  from China and the other Asian countries. Such behavior of  brazenly trampling upon international law and the criterion of  international relations is a demonstration of its stubborn  hegemonist ideas.  <H5>  Be Vigilant Against the Americans' Frame-Up </H5>   Not long ago, news suddenly appeared in the U.S. press that  prohibited chemicals that had been manufactured in China were  found on a German vessel berthed in a Saudi Arabian port. The  reports claimed that the marketing of these substances had been  banned by an international agreement, and they could be used to  create nuclear and biochemical weapons. When the news spread,  many people associated it with the "Yinhe" incident that had  been unilaterally created by the United States last summer.  That incident went bankrupt due to the Americans' inferior  handling of the situation; their plot was seen through and ended  with their losing face throughout the world. The day before  yesterday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman  explained the current issue. The fact was that, in response to  the repeated requests of a U.S. company, a Chinese company sold  a certain quantity of prohibited chemicals to that company in  violation of the relevant regulations of the Chinese Government.  The destination and purpose of those chemicals were entirely  the business of the U.S. company in question. Of course, the  matter must be investigated and clarified. Nevertheless, people  cannot help but ask why the U.S. press should have singled out  Saudi Arabia, Germany and China, but left out the country that  was most directly related, namely, the United States? Was it out  of neglect, omission, or a trick to feint to the east and attack  in the west to deceive the public? Drawing a lesson from the  "Yinhe" incident, people have ample grounds for asking a few  more questions.</p>

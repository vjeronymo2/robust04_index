			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Drawing the line The equity market has not decided whether to cast Professor David Tweedie as hero or villain. This year's missives from the Accounting Standards Board certainly demand fuller disclosure from companies. In theory, that should contribute to a more transparent and efficient equity market. The danger is that the new standards will simply breed conflicting measures of company performance which leave investors none the wiser. The full-year results season in spring promises to be a rollercoaster affair as the market comes to terms with the regime. That some companies will report under the old rules and some under the new hardly implies an orderly transition. Since the market is accustomed to valuing shares by earnings, the new shape of the profit and loss account will be a culture shock. Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS3) includes a definition of extraordinary items which all but outlaws below-the-line gains and losses. Earnings per share will be more volatile as a result. Reporting companies will doubtless publish their own preferred measure of earnings, in addition to the FRS3 figure. The standard allows them to do so, provided their reasoning is explained. The trouble is that if investors choose to concentrate on these measures, they may be just as badly off as before. Analysts may put forward alternative measures, but then investors would have to judge the quality of the analysis as well as the accounts. Many may yearn for the simplicity of the old system.</p>

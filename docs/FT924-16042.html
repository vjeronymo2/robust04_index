			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps BLP back to profit Continuing efforts to cut costs and develop new business opportunities helped BLP Group, the USM-quoted maker of wood laminates and mouldings, to move back into the black in the first half of 1992, albeit with a small profit of Pounds 1,000. The company warned however, that trading conditions had been very difficult, and it would be 'unrealistic' to expect second half results to match those of the first. The interim profit compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 261,000 last time, which included results of Berg Mantelprofilwerk of Germany up to its disposal in June, 1991. Turnover dropped from Pounds 28m to Pounds 11.5m, while interest charges were cut to Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 403,000) reflecting the cashflow benefits of the Berg sale and positive cash generation by the businesses. Losses per share were 2.3p (5.3p). There is again no interim dividend.</p>

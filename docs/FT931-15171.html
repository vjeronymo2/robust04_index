			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Time for government to ensure real airline competition Sir, One of the principles on which the Conservative government initially came to power was that creating competition, through deregulation and privatisation, would not only lead to greater efficiency but to cheaper services. The fundamentals of that principle have not yet happened, particularly in the provision of utility services. Regardless of this, one of the first companies to make the 'quantum leap' was BA and, while it cannot be denied BA is now a flourishing business, it would appear that success may have been achieved through stifling rather than embracing competition. Now BA has accepted the possibility of a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic, and has unreservedly apologised and apparently accepted the bill for legal costs. Is it not time for government ministers to 'put their money where their mouths are' and allow Virgin Atlantic and other British airline companies to compete with BA on a more 'level playing field' by allowing them slots at Heathrow and access to more international routes?

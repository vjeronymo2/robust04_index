There will be privatized the units of  the uncompleted construction, agriculture, trade and public  service.    Speaking to the extraordinary session of the Armenian  Parliament the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan accepted  the fact that the Republic is essentially behind of the  privatization process. "Armenia did only two serious `steps' in  privatization -- there were privatized only flats and land",  Levon Ter-Petrosyan declared.    According to Levon Ter-Petrosyan, "the expected 1994  privatization of the state enterprises won't influence the  Armenian economy because of the small volumes".</p>

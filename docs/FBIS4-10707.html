			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca  Network in Spanish at 0207 GMT on 18 April broadcasts the  "Elections 94" program, which consists of a recorded studio  interview with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the presidential  candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party,  PRI, by Marisa Escribano.    The interview begins with a discussion of Zedillo's  childhood. When asked what motivates him, Zedillo says serving  Mexico.    At 0222 GMT Escribano says the country is experiencing some  hard times. She asks how can they face the problems. Zedillo  says they must remain calm and resort to the values that have  given the country strength. Escribano notes the economy is on  the right path, but there is still much unemployment. Zedillo  responds: "I have pointed out again and again that unemployment  is one of Mexico's most serious problems at present. Let me  tell you that I have mentioned Mexico's four big problems. The  first one, which I mentioned earlier, is insecurity and  injustice, followed by unemployment, insufficient wages, and  poverty and inequality. From my point of view, we have to  attack these four problems on several fronts and simultaneously.  We must have greater justice in our country. Why greater  justice? What does it have to do with unemployment? We want to  have a growing economy, one which creates jobs with plenty of  productive investment."    He goes on to say that the country must make an effort to  train its workers, improve the infrastructure, and work on the  social policy.    At 0235 GMT Escribano asks whether the economic adjustment  measures now need to be relaxed. Zedillo answers: "I believe  conditions to stabilize the economy are essential to promote  development that will benefit most Mexicans. You are right; I  have heard people say that fighting inflation should not be so  important. These people seem to forget that inflation affects  the poorest Mexicans the most. The largest decrease in real  salaries, in terms of purchasing power, occurred at the time  when inflation reached the highest levels: the 1970's and  1980's. I believe having a healthy, balanced, and low-inflation  economy is essential, but it is insufficient to generate  widespread prosperity."    The interview then moves on to the topic of education, about  which Zedillo says the education system needs to be flexible,  the opinions of teachers must be taken into account, and the  bureaucracy must be reduced.    At 0245 GMT they begin to discuss what type of father he is  for his children and how he will balance his role as a father  with that of being president. Escribano then asks how Zedillo  views the future of Mexico. He says: "I look at Mexico's  future with great optimism. As I said before, I look at it with  great hope. Our problems are big, but our potential and  determination as a country to confront these problems are great.  I think there are solutions to our problems. I think that,  historically speaking, the Mexican people have proven to possess  an enormous capability to meet challenges even bigger than those  we face at present. I envision Mexico at the end of this  century or at the beginning of the next one as a strong and  united nation, with an expanding economy, whose product will be  distributed more equitably; a fully sovereign nation with a  stronger democracy, as all Mexicans desire, a nation respected  in the world."    The final question is on whether he will participate in a  debate with the other presidential candidates. Zedillo says he  wants to debate the other candidates and is convinced the debate  must take place.    The interview and program end at 0255 GMT.</p>

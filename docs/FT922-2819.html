			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Rio summit organiser calls for firmer aid promises WORLD LEADERS at the Earth Summit failed to grasp the challenge to save the global environment, Mr Maurice Strong, the summit organiser, said yesterday on the summit's last day. 'We're on a course that is leading to tragedy and as we leave Rio we have not satisfied that concern,' he said as 103 world leaders left Rio de Janeiro at the end of the 12-day gathering. Mr Strong said he was particularly disappointed with the lack of substantial financial commitments by the developed world to help the Third World overcome its environmental problems. 'I would have like to have seen solid commitments but for the most part leaders have made broad policy statements. I strongly urge them to translate these into concrete commitments. 'I say with the strongest possible passion that we must change.' However, he added: 'We simply cannot save the world in a one-shot quick fix conference.' In the last hours of the summit, several industrial countries, including the UK, Germany, Japan and the US, refused to commit themselves to a large increase in aid by the end of the century. An attempt to win their support for an increase in aid to the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year 2000 - the official United Nations target - was watered down in a conference document to 'as soon as possible'. Only France, among the G7 industrial countries, agreed to the proposed target. All the conference documents were agreed in time for the close, although the US refused to sign a legally-binding treaty on biological diversity - or species protection. The US was the only important industrialised nation not to sign. More than than 150 countries signed treaties on both biodiversity and climate change. Other documents agreed included a statement of principles on forests, the Rio Declaration of environmental principles, and the Agenda 21 action plan. Although these were agreed only after tortuous, at times bitter, struggles, they all fell short of their original goals. Mr Strong estimated the total new resources pledged in Rio as Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.8bn) but said: 'I believe frankly we're not going to get the kind of finance we need without some innovative mechanisms such as tradeable emissions permits.'

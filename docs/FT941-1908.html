			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lincat up 25% but warns on full year Lincat Group, USM-quoted designer and manufacturer of commercial catering equipment, lifted pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 688,000 in the first half of 1993. But Mr Martin Craddock, chairman and chief executive, said he was cautious about the outcome for the full year. The shares fell 9p to 220p yesterday. The profit was achieved on a 10 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 6.51m to Pounds 7.17m, but behind the result there was a mixed response from the subsidiaries. Mr Craddock said that the main subsidiary, Lincat, had a good first half with turnover up 18 per cent and profit 11 per cent. At Colnbrook turnover was held and there was a small profit compared with a loss. Because of the way contracts fell, turnover at Corsair fell by 9 per cent with marginally reduced profits but there was progress in most areas. Douglas lifted turnover by 10 per cent and profit by 29 per cent. Sales of Lincat in the US grew by 36 per cent. Mr Craddock said current order levels were slightly lower than could normally be expected at this time. However, the interim dividend is increased from 2p to 2.2p, from earnings per share of 6.6p (5.4p).</p>

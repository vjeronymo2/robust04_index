			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / People: Non-executive directors - M&amp;S Guy McCracken, 45, an executive director of Marks &amp; Spencer, has resigned as a non-executive director of the TSB Group in order to avoid any possible conflicts of interest as Britain's most profitable high street retailer expands into the financial services sector. M&amp;S entered financial services in 1984 when it launched its chargecard. It added a unit trust management company in 1988 and started offering personal loans. Earlier this year it announced that it was entering the pensions and life assurance market. In its latest financial year operating profits from financial activities rose 26.4 per cent to Pounds 41.7m. McCracken joined the TSB board in October 1991 and was the bank's youngest non-executive director. McCracken's place on the TSB board has been filled by Paddy Linaker, 59, who retires in July after seven years as chief executive of M&amp;G, the fund management group. Linaker (left), a chartered accountant, started his career with Esso Petroleum and joined M&amp;G in 1963.</p>

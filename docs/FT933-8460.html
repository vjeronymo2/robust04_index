			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Babangida set to compromise on government PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida is expected to end uncertainty over the make-up of the proposed interim government when he addresses Nigeria's national assembly in the capital Abuja tonight. Government officials have speculated that the new administration will contain about six military commanders but will be led by a civilian, with the possibility that President Babangida could retire from the army and remain in office. It has also been suggested that the new government will be subject to a higher military council and will lack power, as was the case with the outgoing transitional council appointed in January. Nigeria's three-day strike, which ended on Saturday, showed that pro-democracy groups can defy the military regime by peaceful protest in Lagos and the south-west, but cannot rally support in the rest of the country. The Campaign for Democracy (CD), the loose association of civil liberties groups which is behind the civil protest, claim the arrest without trial of three of their leaders, including chairman Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, closure of some of the independent press and the passing of some repressive decrees have left Nigerians more politicised in the past two months than in 10 years of military rule. The CD's unconditional rejection of the interim government commands support in the south-west, the Yoruba homeland of Chief Moshood Abiola, victorious candidate in the annulled June poll. Mr Abiola, who fled to Britain 12 days ago, said he planned to return home soon. 'On August 24, I will be 56. I expect to be in Nigeria to celebrate my birthday,' said Mr Abiola, adding that there were no circumstances in which he would withdraw his claim to be Nigeria's legitimate leader as a result of the June 12 poll.</p>

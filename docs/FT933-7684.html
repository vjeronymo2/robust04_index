			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Pakistan to tax feudal landlords THE Pakistani government last night announced a package of economic reforms, imposing taxes on the politically influential feudal landowners. Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister who is due to remain in power till the October 6 elections, also promised to take punitive action against tax evaders and those with unpaid utility bills. He also announced a plan to reduce import tariffs to an average of between 35 and 50 per cent over the next three years. Tariffs now average more than 90 per cent. The televised speech ended several days of speculation over the package, which aims to curtail Pakistan's budget deficit. In the past, successive Pakistani governments have failed to introduce steps such the imposition of income taxes on farmers because of the farmers' political clout. 'We are fully prepared to take the politically tough decisions that we believe are necessary to put Pakistan back on the road to prosperity,' said Mr Qureshi. He also announced wage increases for low-paid government servants and promised to introduce a new system of social security for the poor. Implementation of some of the reforms may extend beyond Mr Qureshi's term in office but his successors are expected to continue with the programme, officials said.</p>

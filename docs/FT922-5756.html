			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Shanghai shock for bulls in China's stock market shops THE CHINESE, who have embraced share trading with wild enthusiasm, are having to get used to the concept of prices going down as well as up. Prices on Shanghai's stock exchange have dropped 19 per cent in the past three days, after the authorities attempted to ban investment syndicates suspected of ramping share prices. A week ago prices doubled in a single day when the exchange removed limits on daily price movements. The exchanges in Shanghai and in Shenzhen special economic zone, close to Hong Kong, have caught the imagination of the Chinese, many of whom have substantial savings and are looking for ways to put their money to profitable use. Many other cities, including Guangzhou, capital of prosperous Guangdong province, have applied to open stock exchanges. The authorities in Beijing are adopting a cautious approach and officials believe that any new exchanges approved will be in the north. Shanghai lists 'A' shares, which can be traded by Chinese, in only 14 companies, and 'B' shares, which can be traded by foreigners, in one of them. A further 15 'A' shares and six 'B' shares are listed in Shenzhen. With the opportunities for investment so limited, the prices of shares have soared. Although the exchanges have been open for 18 months, trading this year has become frenzied following Beijing's endorsement of accelerated economic reform and as a result of growing prosperity in the south. There is growing interest in the markets from investors in other provinces. Investors see share trading as a way to make quick money in a country which offers few profitable avenues for investment. Communist officials in provinces all over China see share ownership as a means to mobilise savings to back economic reform, to revitalise grossly inefficient state industries and to emulate the booming south. Many officials seem unabashed by the volatility in the existing fledgling markets, and the exchanges themselves are planning a large number of new listings. The mayhem in Shenzhen has seen one murder and hundreds of arrests as the authorities cracked down on gangsters who were fighting for places in queues outside brokers' offices - queue positions were being traded as well as shares. In Shanghai, one man committed suicide after losing 6,000 yuan (Dollars 1,000).</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> LYME DISEASE TRACED TO 1940S  </P> <P> Tests on ticks collected in the 1940s indicate Lyme disease plagued the United  States three decades earlier than previously thought and may have originated on  Long Island, researchers said today.  </P> <P> Analyzing the bodies of 136 ticks preserved in alcohol in the Museum of  Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Mass., and the Smithsonian Institution in  Washington, researchers found evidence of the microbe that causes Lyme disease  in some ticks that roamed eastern Long Island 44 years ago.  </P> <P> Lyme disease was not recognized as a distinct illness in the United States  until 1975, when patients were first diagnosed in Lyme, Conn.  </P> <P> More than 14,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 43 states since  1980, with most cases occurring in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic coastal  states and Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Oregon.  </P> <P> The first symptoms usually are a distinctive rash at the tick bite site and  flu-like symptoms. The disease can usually be treated with antibiotics. But  without treatment, complications such as chronic arthritis, neurological and  organ damage can occur.  </P></p>

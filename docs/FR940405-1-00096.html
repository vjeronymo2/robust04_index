			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> By applying the lower and upper ranges of exposure, OSHA estimates that the number of nonsmoking employees exposed to ETS to be 13.9 to 36.1 million employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> C. Nonregulatory Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> (1) Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating occupational safety and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' It is on the basis of this congressional directive that OSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to indoor air pollutants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion below assesses the requisite preconditions for optimal safety in the context of a free market economy, and real world economic factors are compared with the free market paradigm to illustrate the shortcoming of the nonregulatory environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> (2) Market Imperfections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor markets where employees, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and ultimately by the consumers who pay for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized, private employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the total cost to the firm, the work force, and society of the expected injury or illness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conditions of perfect competition do not need to be completely satisfied in order for the forces of the market to approximate an efficient outcome. However, some market imperfections can produce sub-optimal results that can be improved upon with regulatory action. In the case of this rulemaking, employees face a significant health risk which is not adequately addressed by current nonregulatory alternatives. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions to provide greater health protection for workers exposed to toxic substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although OSHA believes that adequate job safety and health could exist in the private market under perfect conditions, the private market often fails to provide acceptable levels of safety and health in instances where these conditions are not met. It appears that at least two of several conditions traditionally considered essential components of perfect markets are absent from the environment in which employees are exposed to hazards associated with exposure to indoor pollutants: (1) Perfect employee knowledge of risks and (2) perfect employee mobility between jobs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that in the absence of immediate or clear-cut danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term effects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatory payments may, in fact, have a disincentive to provide information to employees. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development of chronic disabling disease. Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related or could have other causes_employees and employers may not link disease with such occupational exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances, many face limited employment options. Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemployment rates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better paying but more hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay and risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demands of more mobile workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware of job risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not be fully compensated. Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflect accurately the value that workers place on health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these market imperfections, externalities occur if employers and employees settle for an inefficiently low level of protection from hazardous substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced diseases, including the costs of premature death, chronic illness, and disability. Those individuals who suffer from occupationally related illnesses are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If private employers do not have to pay the full cost of production, they have no economic incentive to reduce hazards whenever the cost of hazard abatement is greater than the cost of the expected illness. In this way, the private market fails to produce optimal levels of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

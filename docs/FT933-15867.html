			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / New high-speed Stena ferry in service by 1995 STENA Sealink Line, the Swedish-owned UK ferry operator, is to put the world's largest high-speed ferry into service in 1995 on its Irish Sea route between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire, Richard Tomkins writes. Parent company Stena has ordered two of the vessels from Finnyards in Rauma, Finland, at a cost of about Pounds 130m. The second vessel, to be delivered in 1996, will be available for charter. The 124-metre ferries will be able to carry 1,500 passengers plus 375 cars or 100 cars and 50 lorries. The largest design at present in service, the 74-metre SeaCat operated by Hoverspeed, takes 400 passengers and 80 cars. Stena said the new ferries would travel at 40 knots and would be less sensitive to rough weather than smaller vessels. P&amp;O European Ferries, Stena Sealink's biggest rival on UK routes, said it continued to watch developments in high-speed ferries but was not yet convinced of their advantages.</p>

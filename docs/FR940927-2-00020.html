Enterprises, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Con-Freight Marine Line, Inc. (``Respondent'') was served September 21, 1994. Complainant alleges that Respondent is a non vessel operating common carrier that violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;1709(d)(1). Complainant states that Respondent prepared a bill of lading incorrectly showing the Port of Discharge to be St. Petersburg, Russia on two shipments to Riga, Latvia, corrected the port of discharge while the two shipments were in transit without correcting the delivery contact agent which Complainant later found handled shipments only to Russia, refused to reimburse Complainant for costs of a Latvian driver to transport the shipments from St. Petersburg to Riga after promising to do so, and caused both shipments to arrive late. Further, Complainant alleges respondent refused to return a security deposit that was required for release of the second shipment in St. Petersburg, after promising to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges.

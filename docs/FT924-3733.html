			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions WITH the market reaching new peaks, one might have expected the volume of directors' purchases to have eased. On the contrary, purchases are increasing, with some deals being of a significant size. Recent interim results from Cable &amp; Wireless revealed it is still able to produce earnings growth even under the most difficult conditions. Brian Pemberton, a director of Cable &amp; Wireless, exercised an option over 196,932 shares and subsequently sold the lot at 646p. At the same time, he sold another 42,579 shares at 650p, leaving him with 50,000 shares. Since the sale, Cable &amp; Wireless shares have fallen sharply in the wake of mounting concern in Hong Kong about the prospect of a clash between China and Britain over the proposed political reforms. The separation of Claremont Garments from Alexon has proved one of the more successful retail developments of the last two years. David McGarvey sold 20,000 shares at 263p leaving him with 50,000 shares. The share price has outperformed the market by 18 per cent over the last year and brokers expect further growth this year and next. Michael Swan, deputy chairman of Merchant Retail Group, attracted attention 12 months ago when he sold 500,000 shares at 34p, buying 1m shares at 14.5p five months later. Philip Newton has now bought 750,000 shares at 15.5p.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  No of Company               Sector    Shares  Value  directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National          Bank     4,592     16      1 Cable &amp; Wireless        Tele    42,579    277      1 Claremont Garments      Text    20,000     53      1 Dalgety                 FdMa    11,258     54      1* Enterprise Oil          O&amp;G      4,100     19      1 Johnston Press          Med      4,600     17      1 Liberty n/v             Stor    25,000     84      2* Next                    Stor     8,755     11      1 Portmeirion Potter      Misc     5,300     12      1 Reed International      Med     37,600    220      1* Smith (WH) A shares     Stor     4,706     22      1 Town Centre Secs        Prop    30,000     22      1 Unilever                FdMa    88,967    923      2* Vodafone                Tele    53,500    212      1*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Castle Comms            H&amp;L     45,000     59      1 City Merchants H Yd     InTr    25,000     23      1 Cornwell Parker Ord     Misc     7,000     20      2 Fairhaven Intl          O&amp;G     95,000     14      1 Filofax                 Pack    15,000     10      3 Gardiner Group          BuSe   250,000     24      2 Greggs                  FdRe     3,040     12      1 Hardy Oil &amp; Gas         O&amp;G     15,000     18      1 Hewetson                BdMa   120,000     31      1 Holmes Protection       BuSe    32,500     18      1 Merchant Retail         FdRe   750,000    116      1 Mercury Asset Man       OthF    20,000     70      1 Micro Focus             Elec     2,000     49      1 Ramsdens (Harry) B      H&amp;L     50,000     50      1 Reuters                 Med      2,000     26      1 Vickers                 EngG    15,500     13      3 Wills Group             BuSe   100,000     13      1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

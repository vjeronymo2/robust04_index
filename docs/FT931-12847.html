			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Test for Clinton MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has recommended that the Security Council take 'whatever measures are required' to compel Israel to allow the return of 396 Palestinians whom it deported to Lebanon last month. It would be quite wrong to dismiss this as the partisan advice of an Arab or an Egyptian. In just over a year in office Mr Boutros Ghali has shown himself quite willing to confront his fellow Arabs with unpalatable truths, including the fact that Security Council Resolution 242 does not order Israel to withdraw unconditionally from occupied Arab territory, and therefore is not equivalent to the resolutions on Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait passed in 1990. But Resolution 799, demanding the immediate repatriation of the Palestinian deportees, is a much more clear-cut affair. Israel's failure to comply with it, and the council's failure to enforce compliance, does contrast glaringly with the treatment of Iraq in a way which casts serious doubt on the council's authority and credibility. The question is widely regarded as a test case of the new world order. Inevitably it is also a test case for the new US administration. Mr Bill Clinton, like most newly elected US presidents, arrives in office festooned with pledges to back Israel to the hilt. But he has also had a lot to say about the importance of the UN. If he is to have any hope of getting others to share the burden of world leadership, as he clearly wishes, he badly needs to build up the UN, and especially the Security Council, rather than undermine it. It is inconceivable that the US would allow the UN to take military action against Israel; scarcely less so for it to agree to economic sanctions. Yet Mr Clinton must surely point out as forcefully as he can to the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, that in asking the US to use its veto in such circumstances Israel is drawing very deeply on its reserve of goodwill, in a country on which it remains heavily dependent. The trouble is that Mr Rabin, very unwisely, has made the affair a test of his own credibility with Israeli public opinion. If he is now seen to buckle under international pressure, his room for manoeuvre when it comes to concessions on bigger issues, ultimately of greater importance to peace and to Palestinian interests, may well be reduced. The best hope is that Israel's supreme court will let him off the hook by ordering that the deportees be allowed to return pending appeal. Failing that, the US could perhaps negotiate a compromise under which some would return immediately while the period of deportation for the rest is drastically shortened. What is certain is that all parties should treat the affair as one of extreme urgency. Every day it lasts makes it harder for the Palestinian delegation to return to the peace talks on the basis of anything less than a complete Israeli capitulation.</p>

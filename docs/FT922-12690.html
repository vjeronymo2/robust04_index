			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Leading Article: Gadaffi in the dock THE MANDATORY sanctions imposed on Libya yesterday by the UN Security Council were characterised by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, as persuasive rather than punitive. It is an important distinction, since it underlines the difficulties involved in further increasing the pressure on the regime of Col Muammer Gaddafi as a result of its alleged involvement in the bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people. This crude act of terrorism was universally condemned. The desire to bring those responsible to justice is powerful. Col Gadaffi has for the past 20 years enjoyed fanning the flames of conflict within the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, where small groups of violent people have been encouraged to attack governments disliked by Libya. However the depth of international distaste for the man and his methods should not be allowed to dictate the response to the Lockerbie outrage. The effectiveness of sanctions, including the relatively modest ones just imposed on Libya, must always depend on the willingness of the international community to stick to them. The US and British governments, in co-operation with France which has its own arguments with Libya, have won majority support within the Security Council for the measures so far adopted. But they would face far stiffer hurdles in persuading others, including European friends such as Germany, to impose further sanctions and most especially a ban on Libyan oil exports. Alleged criminals There has already been some unease over the apportionment of blame for the Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent use of the Security Council as a vehicle for pursuing alleged criminals. The finger of suspicion, officially guided, pointed first at Syria and Iran. Sceptics suggested that only after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait did it become politically more expedient to concentrate on Libya. The evidence against the two Libyans has been gathered by British and US intelligence. It is not possible for other governments to test the strength of that evidence. By working through the Security Council, Britain and the US are making the UN body the sole instrument of a policy which, if carried to its conclusion, could lead to military action against Libya. Considering the scale of the diplomatic effort needed to put together and hold a common UN position on achieving the liberation of Kuwait, there can be little chance of that process being repeated over the extradition of two men from Libya who have yet to be proven guilty. Strike out The US, supported by Britain, can of course strike out alone as it did in the 1986 bombing raids on Libya. It can be argued that the 1986 raid forced Col Gadaffi to limit support for terrorism. Equally, Lockerbie might have been the response to it. US and Israeli military dominance of the region ensures that such attacks can be carried out with little immediate risk. But whether that is primarily the message which Washington wants to send the Middle East - at a time when it believes the opportunity has never been better for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israel conflict - is another matter. Arab friends of the west have been trying to find a compromise, not liking the prospect of sanctions against another Arab state, or of Col Gaddafi being offered a further opportunity to posture as a defiant leader. The majority of Arab League members are happy to see Libya restrained but are concerned about the political impact on their own populations of western actions which could appear vindictive. As they might note, there are other identifiable international criminals against whom there is no threat of prosecution, domestic or international. The international response to terrorism has always had to be one of containment rather than direct retribution. The latest UN sanctions recognise that. Libya should be made to feel the weight of western ostracism for so long as refuses to surrender the two men and does not co-operate more broadly in the battle against terrorists. But Britain and the US would need to think very carefully before adopting harsher measures that fail to win the backing of their main allies.</p>

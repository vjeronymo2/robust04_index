			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANIZALES MAKES THE CUT; GONZALES LOSES IN TWO;  </P> <P> BOXING: FORMER OLYMPIAN CRIES FOUL, BUT REFEREE RULES THAT A PUNCH WAS  RESPONSIBLE FOR INJURED EYELID.  </P> <P> It took Paul Gonzales six years to get a shot at a world title after he was  voted the outstanding fighter of the 1984 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> It wasn't worth the wait.  </P> <P> Gonzales' bid for the International Boxing Federation bantamweight championship  ended unsuccessfully at 30 seconds of the second round Sunday at the El Paso  County Coliseum.  </P> <P> However, it wasn't until 15 minutes later that the ring announcer finally  declared champion Orlando Canizales the winner.  </P> <P> Referee Barry Yeats had been advised by Dr. Paris Bransford to stop the fight  because of a cut in Gonzales' left eyelid.  </P> <P> The question was whether there had been a head butt, which would have resulted  in the bout being called a technical draw.  </P> <P> Yeats said that a right hand had caused the cut 30 seconds into the first  round.  </P> <P> But the ringside IBF and Texas Athletic Commission officials decided to huddle  anyway.  </P> <P> Gonzales got the news that he was officially the loser while being interviewed  by NBC announcers Marv Albert and Ferdie Pacheco.  </P> <P> "That was ridiculous," said Gonzales, insisting he was the victim of a head  butt.  </P> <P> "I didn't lose to Canizales. I lost to a butt. He butted me in our first fight,  too. He came out throwing punches, but he was using his head at the same time."  </P> <P> None of the four angles of the NBC replay indicated a head butt.  </P> <P> "Paul's reaction reminded me of Muhammad Ali's after the anchor punch against  Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine," Pacheco said.  </P> <P> "When he watched the film of the fight, Ali said he couldn't see the punch  because it was toofast."  </P> <P> Canizales was positive that a punch had done the damage.  </P> <P> "It was a clean right hand over the top," he said.  </P> <P> Whatever, the champion from Laredo, Tex., came out fast in a manner prescribed  by manager Bob Spagnola.  </P> <P> "We lost the first fight because Orlando wasn't aggressive enough," Spagnola  said.  </P> <P> "If he tried those same tactics again, it would have been a long afternoon."  </P> <P> Instead, Yeats first called Bransford into the ring to look at the cut after  only 37 seconds of the first round.  </P> <P> Gonzales was permitted to keep fighting and counterpunched decently, but the  round belonged to Canizales.  </P> <P> Cornerman Chuck Bodak was able to stop the bleeding between rounds, but the cut  was re-opened after only 10 seconds of the second round.  </P> <P> Canizales, who weighed in at the bantamweight limit of 118 pounds, improved to  25-1-1.  </P> <P> Gonzales, 117 pounds, is 14-2.  </P></p>

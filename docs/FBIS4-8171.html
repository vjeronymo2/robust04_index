			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "em" and "krzem:" "Diplomats and Politicians"] </F>   [Text] The foreign minister agrees to deputy  ministers coming from the coalition, but first he wants to  reform the ministry by separating the political top from the  apolitical rest of the ministry.    "I want to have two deputy ministers submitted by the  parties  of the governing coalition in the Foreign Ministry [MSZ] by 1  July at the latest," announced Minister Olechowski. What must  happen first is the introduction of a reform of the MSZ, which  has been prepared and was presented by the minister to the Sejm  Foreign Affairs Commission yesterday. The new deputy ministers  will be performing political roles, and they will not perform  managerial functions with regard to anything in the MSZ. The  current deputy ministers will most probably take up the posts of  director generals.    If the government approves the project, the MSZ will be the  first ministry in which the political top (the minister, his  deputy, and his cabinet), which usually changes with every  government, will be statutorily separated from the apolitical  office chaired by a secretary general.    The new concept, which was prepared over a period of three  months by a hundred experts led by Jerzy Kozminski, a secretary  of state in the MSZ, is said to be liked by the president.    For a few months, Sejm deputies for the coalition were  critical of Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the former MSZ chief, for a  "disastrous personnel policy." Yesterday, Olechowski outlined  some new principles of recruitment, promotion, and assignments  to posts abroad. We know unofficially that he was hoping that  this would lead to termination of the infamous Sejm  subcommission for MSZ personnel, which was established in  January in order to "settle accounts with the MSZ."    Olechowski's ideas were enthusiastically received by the  Sejm  deputies, but Andrzej Micewski (an independent) unexpectedly  moved for an extension of the subcommission's mandate by three  months. Olechowski responded with anger: "This contributes to  an atmosphere of scandal surrounding the ministry. Neither the  MSZ nor Polish foreign policy nor the interests of the Polish  state benefit from the subcommission's activity."    Micewski's proposal was rejected by one vote, but it is not  known how the conflict will end because the Sejm deputies for  the coalition put the results of the vote in question.</p>

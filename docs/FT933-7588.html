			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK car output hit by export sales fall THE FALL in car sales in continental Europe has thrown UK production into reverse after 18 months of almost uninterrupted growth to the highest levels for nearly 20 years. Short-time working has already occurred in parts of the UK car industry and there was mounting concern yesterday over a further sharp deterioration in production in the already depressed commercial vehicles sector. Statistics showing a 49.68 per cent fall in commercial vehicle output last month were described as 'extremely serious' by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The figures are considered by the industry to reflect the patchiness of economic recovery in the UK and falling export demand because of the recession elsewhere in Europe. Total car output in July was down only marginally, by 2.42 per cent to 115,648 compared with 118,514 in the same month last year. For the first seven months it remained 6.63 per cent ahead of the 1992 period at 858,617, compared with 805,261. But, in the first significant fall this year, production for export dropped by 16 per cent in July, to 33,578 from 39,977 in the same month a year ago. The industry fears that it can no longer escape the effects of a drop of about one-fifth in continental car sales since the start of this year. 'As far as car production is concerned, we are now seeing the influence we forecast of the sharp fall in sales in virtually every market throughout continental Europe,' said Mr Roger King, the SMMT's public affairs director. 'Production for the home market was slightly ahead of last year, but overall production levels are clearly at risk in the face of shrinking exports,' he added. Continuing growth in UK new car sales, the only main European car market undergoing a recovery, is expected to prevent any deep downturn in UK car output. New domestic car sales in the first seven months were 9.1 per cent higher than a year ago, and most estimates are that sales will reach 1.75m-1.8m this year, compared with 1.59m in 1992. Production for the rest of this year would have to fall by more than one-third of 1992 levels not to reach last year's total of 1.29m. Most industry forecasters still expect the final outcome to be about 1.4m, which would be the highest since 1975. Ford last night denied reports that it was planning to introduce a four-day week at Dagenham, where it makes Fiestas, or at its Escort plant at Halewood on Merseyside. However, it said it was keeping the situation 'under constant review'. On previous occasions this year it has cut 24 shifts at Halewood and five on the Dagenham assembly line. Peugeot Talbot has suspended production of its UK market mainstay, the 405, at its Ryton plant near Coventry and is reducing output from 1,900 to 1,600 cars a week of only one model, the 306. Some 300 jobs are being cut. Ford-Werke chief fights decision to move him, Page 2</p>

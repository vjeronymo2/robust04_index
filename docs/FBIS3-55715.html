			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua by Eteri </F> Kakabadze; place and date not given: "Tengiz Sigua:  `Gamsakhurdia Had a Choice; the Opposition Did Not'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kakabadze]Could you  tell us how and by whom was the decision taken to bring  Shevardnadze back to Georgia? Why was he specifically chosen?  After all, the opinion about him in Georgia was far from  unanimous.    [Sigua] I can tell you how I viewed it. This is a person  with enormous international prestige and it would not have been  serious on our part had we dismissed this aspect.  Shevardnadze's return to Georgia could have given us two big  advantages. He could have ensured Georgia received  international recognition and its entry into such influential  international organizations as the United Nations, CSCE, and so  forth. It is wholly natural that these processes would have  been connected with the name of Shevardnadze. Indeed, this is  what subsequently happened. The second advantage lay in the  fact that he could have developed international action on a  broad scale and attracted foreign credits into the country with  the help of which we would have been able to get the economy  back on its feet. According to my calculations, just some four  to five months after his return, we would have received $300-400  million in the form of preferential credits. Unfortunately,  this did not happen. However, there were also two big  disadvantages. The first was western Georgia; with his return,  the situation there would have become even more acute. The  second was the attitude of the Russian generals to the  Gorbachev-Yakovlev-Shevardnadze [alliance]. However, when I  weighed the pros and cons, the former outweighed the latter.    [Kakabadze] Did you have any opponents in this  matter?    [Sigua] Yes. However, I managed to persuade them that  Shevardnadze was no longer the same person whom Georgia used to  know. Moreover, I sincerely believed this myself.    [Kakabadze] Why have you said this with such regret?  Do you think you made a mistake?    [Sigua] Of course, I made a mistake. Life has shown that he  has not changed a bit since he was first secretary of the  [Georgian] Central Committee. I can see that no genuinely  democratic -- not pseudo-democratic -- transformations have  occurred in the country since his arrival. There is just the  appearance of democracy. Tell me, how can one simply justify  the fact that the law on elections was changed by him five times  as a result of which people entered parliament who now make up  the majority. This was just the start. One voluntaristic  decision followed another.... The appointment of God knows who  as ministers. Who can explain to me what guidelines one needs  to follow in order to appoint a person with two criminal  convictions as minister of internal affairs? One can go on and  on. I admit that I made a mistake regarding this person.    [Kakabadze]However, can one suppose that what is at  play here is not so much the subjective factor but objective  conditions? Do you think that anyone else in his place could  have done more?    [Sigua] I know that Shevardnadze's double game with the West  was our ruin. It was already clear at the Malta summit that  something had occurred in the division of spheres of influence  and that Georgia and perhaps the whole Transcaucasus would be  the first to leave Moscow's sphere of influence. At least, I  felt that Shevardnadze knew what we simple mortals did not know  and, therefore, he set his sights exclusively on the West.  However, I realized as early as April that this was not the  case. In such a situation, it would have been necessary to  change one's policy and speak with Russia in a different way and  not use the language of intrigue while playing up to the West.  When those 88 UN observers did not come to Georgia, I already  knew that the West, if not completely, had started to give us up  as a bad job. On whose support had we been counting on all that  time? Shevardnadze refused when [Russian Defense Minister]  Grachev suggested bringing a contingent of Russian troops into  Ochamchire [Abkhazia], Poti, Zugdidi, and Senaki [Mingrelia].  As a result, we experienced the Sukhumi tragedy. Who will  answer for this? And one more thing -- why, if we are opposed  in principle to the introduction of Russian troops, should we  destroy our principles and bring them in no matter but with less  effective results? Where is the logic in this?    [Kakabadze]Where does the solution lie today? The  people are already saying that independence is costing us too  much.    [Sigua] There is a solution. First, we have to retrieve  the credits issued by the National Bank and this should be done  as a matter of urgency. I have already stated that, according  to my calculations, some $70-100 million from these credits have  ended up in foreign banks. They must be returned and, in order  to do this, our police should join Interpol whatever it may cost  us and, thereby, establish ties with European banks. We should  retrieve at least half of this money. This is the first thing.  Second, for some five months now, no one has said a word about  the fact that the IMF has elaborated a special mechanism aimed  at giving support to system changes in Georgia. It is stated in  the letter, which I handed to Shevardnadze and to which he has  not reacted in any way, that the fund is ready to grant 50  percent of our quota in this organization right away. This  amounts to $200 million. These $200 million plus the returned  credits plus the work done in order to obtain more preferential  credits from developed capitalist countries.... I believe that  approximately $400-500 million, which can be collected in this  way, is wholly sufficient for the initial stage of establishing  Georgia's economy. Of this amount, approximately $70 million  has to be allocated to the Georgian National Bank in order to  strengthen the new national currency -- the lari -- that will be  introduced in the near future. Otherwise, the same thing will  happen to it as happened to the coupon. I view this way as a  realistic one. We will then be able to purchase the necessary  quantity of energy sources and the necessary raw materials and  get our industry off the ground. According to my calculations,  on this basis, we could achieve 65 or possibly 70 percent of the  level of production that was attained in 1987. This is the  figure that will bring our economic depression to an end.    I am often being asked why am I opposed to our joining the  CIS. I am not against our membership, provided it is officially  established that we were forced to take this step. In that  case, I will know that there was no other way out. However,  when we are being told that joining the CIS is our only chance  of survival, I do not agree with this. Russia will not feed us  for free and trade with us at dumping prices. It is another  matter that we should maintain very close financial and economic  relations with all the former republics of the USSR as, at  present, we basically do not have the means to conduct trade on  new alternative markets. However, it is not necessary to join  any new alliances in order to do this.</p>

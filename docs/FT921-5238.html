			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders, management and the need for greater regulation Sir, In postulating 'the reality that the shareholders, having provided the capital, are thereby in effect the owners of the business' Dr Gillibrand ignores one crucial point. Whereas the managers of a business have to stay and run the business, shareholders can, by picking up a telephone or touching a screen at a bank, sell their shares and sever their limited and totally selfish connection with the company. Someone who provides finance for a defined period could be said to be an 'owner of the business', but shareholders - who can sell their shares on a whim with no real thought for the company's well-being - cannot claim any right to 'own' the business, still less any right to control its management.

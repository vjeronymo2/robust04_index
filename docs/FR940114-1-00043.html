			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Develop performance measures for PTS that are both qualitative and quantitative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Resource Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States should encourage law enforcement agencies to develop and maintain a comprehensive resource management plan to identify and deploy resources needed to effectively support enforcement programs. The resource management plan should include a specific component on traffic enforcement and safety, integrating traffic enforcement and safety initiatives into a total agency enforcement program. Law enforcement agencies should: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Conduct periodic assessments of service demands and resources to meet identified needs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Develop a comprehensive resource management plan, including a specific traffic enforcement and safety component; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Define the plan in terms of budget requirements and services to be provided; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Develop and implement operational policies for the deployment of resources to address program demands and to meet agency goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Traffic Law Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The enforcement of traffic laws and ordinances is a basic responsibility shared by all police agencies. The primary objective of this function is to encourage motorists and pedestrians to comply voluntarily with the laws. Administrators should apply their enforcement resources in ways that ensure the greatest safety impact. Traffic law enforcement programs should be based on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Accurate problem identification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Countermeasures designed to address specific problems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement actions applied at appropriate times and places, coupled with a public information effort designed to make the motoring public aware of the problem and the planned enforcement action; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A system to document and publicize results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Public Information and Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Necessity of Public Information and Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public awareness and knowledge about traffic enforcement are essential for sustaining increased compliance with all traffic laws. This requires a well-organized, effectively-managed public information and education program. The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, should develop a statewide public information and education campaign that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Identifies and targets specific audiences; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addresses enforcement of safety belt use and child passenger safety, drunk and drugged driving, speed, and other serious traffic laws; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Capitalizes on special events, such as Operation C.A.R.E., Child Passenger Safety Awareness, Buckle Up, America! and Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness weeks; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identifies and supports the efforts of traffic safety activist groups to gain increased support of and attention to traffic safety and enforcement; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uses national themes, events, and materials; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motivates the public to support increased enforcement of traffic laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The task of public information can be divided into two interconnected areas: external and internal information. Both areas, properly administered, will benefit the agency and work in concert to accomplish the goal of establishing and maintaining a positive police-public relationship. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Development of Public Information and Education Functions by Law Enforcement Agencies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> External <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Educate and remind the public about traffic laws and safe driving behavior; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disseminate information to the public about agency activities and accomplishments; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhance relationships with news media; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide safety education and community services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide legislative and judicial information and support; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increase the public's understanding of the enforcement agency's role in traffic safety: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Internal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Disseminate information about internal activities to sworn and civilian members of the agency; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhance the agency's safety enforcement role and increase employee understanding and support; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognize employee achievements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Data Collection and Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The availability of valid data is critical to any approach intended to increase the level of highway safety. An effective records program provides fast and accurate information to field personnel who are performing primary traffic functions and to management for decision-making. Data are usually collected from crash reports, daily officer activity reports that contain workload and citation information, highway department records ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  traffic volume), citizen complaints, and officer observations. An effective records program should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

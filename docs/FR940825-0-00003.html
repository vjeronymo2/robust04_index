			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OPM agrees with the commenters that replacement of the obsolete basic uniform when costs are high should be included in the higher initial allowance rate. Therefore, we have added paragraph &sect;591.104(h) to provide that an agency may use the higher initial maximum uniform allowance procedures to establish a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate when a new style or type of minimum basic uniform is required for a category of employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a related comment, one agency inquired whether the proposed procedures for a 2nd year of a higher initial rate under &sect;591.104(c) were intended to address obsolescence of uniform components. It is unlikely that such obsolescence would regularly occur the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to a requirement to wear a uniform or the year following the obsolescence of a minimum basic uniform. OPM has clarified the regulations regarding obsolescence by adding paragraph &sect;591.104(h) concerning the replacement of an obsolete basic uniform. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Providing a Complete Uniform <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One agency requested that another higher initial allowance be allowed at the agency's discretion for individual employee needs, such as a dress uniform, a maternity uniform, a different size, or a uniform burned in a fire. Similarly, a labor organization was concerned that the proposed regulations provide relief only for the 1st year the employee becomes subject to the uniform requirement. However, the labor organization noted that it may take several years to acquire the full complement of required uniform items and suggested extending the higher allowance until the employee acquires the full complement of required uniform items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations provide that agencies may spread the higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate over 2 years for a category of employees when the minimum basic uniform is very costly. We believe the combination of the higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate and the ongoing maintenance allowance are sufficient to meet individual needs. Therefore, a change in the regulations is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM notes that under &sect;591.104(d)(3), an agency's published notice must list the specific uniform items required by an affected category of employees to ensure that needed items are included and that the selected higher rate represents the average  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> total <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  uniform cost. For example, possible basic uniform items for a hypothetical category of employees required to serve outdoors part of the time could be: Three shirts, two slacks or skirts, two pairs of boots, one outerwear garment, one pair of gloves, and one hat. If a second year higher initial uniform allowance is required because of great expense, the agency may implement an extension of &sect;591.104(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Administrative Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two agencies and an employee raised several administrative questions that, they suggest, should be resolved in the regulations. One agency asked whether moving an unused initial higher allowance amount from the initial year into the following year would require OPM approval. A higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate applies to the year an employee first becomes subject to a uniform requirement (and may apply to the year following that year under &sect;591.104(c)). In unusual situations, when an employee who has not purchased the designated uniform has not also been required to wear it, the higher initial allowance could be canceled and reauthorized when the employee actually becomes subject to the uniform requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other agency stated it would like the regulations to include the methods for paying a recurring uniform maintenance allowance. This would include rules to state the increments in which the allowance would be paid (e.g., biweekly, quarterly, or annually), to whom it should be paid (e.g., the vender, the employee, or another method), and the appropriate conditions for each method of payment. OPM believes these administrative matters are best determined by each agency in consideration of the methods that best fit the needs of the agency and its employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The employee was concerned about circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to wear the designated uniform. For example, could the uniform be worn off duty, or could various parts of the uniform be worn along with personal clothing? Agency policy and employee discretion should determine the proper wearing of a required uniform. OPM does not believe it is necessary or desirable to regulate this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

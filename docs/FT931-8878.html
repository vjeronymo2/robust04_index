			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Finnish paper unit reduced to FM190m ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, cut its 1992 loss after financial items to FM190m (Dollars 35.1m) from FM950m a year earlier as net sales rose 10 per cent to FM10.24bn. 'Increase in sales volume and higher export revenue as a result of the devalued Finnish markka were the main reasons behind the growth,' said Mr Jukka Harmala, Enso chief executive. The group benefited from lower wood prices and from increased productivity at its mills and within central administration. However, the group's recovery was held up by lower prices for many products in the face of continuing industry overcapacity. Its deficit was exacerbated by FM80m in exchange rate losses for financing items. The group's operating profit was FM1.63bn, or 15.9 per cent of net sales. Asset sales produced extraordinary profits of FM550m, leaving the group with a profit of FM360m before adjustments and taxes, compared with a FM515m loss in 1991. The group said FM300m in exchange rate losses on foreign currency loans connected to the unfinished Enocell pulp mill project had been entered against the project.</p>

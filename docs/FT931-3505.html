			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Traffic side bolsters Peek PEEK reported pre-tax profits up 18 per cent, from Pounds 6.06m to Pounds 7.13m for 1992, on turnover ahead 6 per cent from Pounds 84m to Pounds 88.8m, despite a setback in its field data business. The traffic division, which includes systems for junction signals and road offence monitoring in the US, Europe and the Far East, saw operating profit rise 75 per cent to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 3.77m). Most of this was attributable to acquisitions - notably of four companies in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden - which helped push turnover up 56 per cent to Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 34.6m). Results for the field data side declined with sales of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 49.5m) and operating profit of Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 3.54m). Peek said this was due to weak performance of Peek Measurement, which produces measuring equipment for the petrochemical and water industries in Europe. Earnings per share advanced to 4.2p (3.6p) and an unchanged final dividend of 2.35p is recommended for a maintained total of 3.4p. Mr Allen Standley, group managing director, said he was relatively cautious about 1993, noting there was a reluctance in the present economic climate in Europe for customers to make commitments to big capital investments such as traffic systems. He predicted profits growth in single figures this year. Peek was optimistic, however, about prospects for growth over the next decade, particularly in 'smart' traffic systems which increase efficiency of road use. It is looking to expand in the Far East and has negotiated a 41 per cent holding in a control systems company based in Chengdu, China. Mr Standley said Peek was also planning to concentrate on producing strong growth in its field data side. This will come through its wholly-owned Husky computers subsidiary, which last year introduced two new 'rugged' computers and increased turnover and profits.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``NTC News'' newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff today clarified his office's position regarding the case  of the bishop being in Cuba:    [Begin recording] Reporter: De Greiff  said this morning that his office has never been deceived. He  explained that the Prosecutor General's Office has evidence --  evidence that includes testimonies and documents -- which proves  a church representative was involved in a guerrilla summit in  Havana, Cuba.    De Greiff: Whether I should recant is not an issue  here. The Prosecutor General's Office cannot base its opinion  on anything but the evidence it has. As I told you, we have  such evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence countering this  evidence is respectable. We will have to compare their evidence  to ours. As for the case of the bishop, we have decided that  this not our responsibility. [end recording]    De Greiff also said his evidence will have to be compared  with the evidence of other investigative organizations to  determine which is genuine. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General's  Office said Bishop Nel Beltran is not the person in question, as  has been claimed from the very beginning.    [Begin recording] Reporter: Is it  necessarily Nel Beltran?    De Greiff: Not necessarily. One piece of evidence  involves a priest. Like I said, this is only one piece of  evidence. The integrity of this evidence has yet to be  determined.    After comparing all of the evidence, the Prosecutor  General's  Office will present documents to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal,  the organization in charge of investigating church  representatives.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 21 (CTK) -- The leaders of the  five political parties which took part in the formation of the  new Slovak government of Jozef Moravcik signed a coalition  agreement today.    The agreement was signed by Moravcik (Democratic Union of  Slovakia, DUS), Peter Weiss (Democratic Left Party, SDL), Jan  Carnogurksy (Christian Democratic Movement, KDH), Milan Knazko  (Alliance of Democrats) and Ludovit Cernak (New Alternative).    The agreement is to help preserve harmony within the rather  heterogeneous coalition comprising post-communists (SDL), the  right-orientated KDH and the centrist bloc formed by  "dissidents" from Meciar's part of Slovakia's political scene.    Coalition talks are also to be attended by the Hungarian  parliamentary parties, the Egyutteles movement and the Hungarian  Christian Democratic Party (MKDH), which have not signed the  agreement and which are not represented on the new government,  but which have pledged support for it under certain conditions.    MKDH Deputy Chairman Pavol Farkas said the Hungarian parties  would cooperate with the new government if it fulfilled  recommendations from the Council of Europe concerning the use of  bilingual road sign-posts and the use of names and surnames for  ethnic Hungarians, and if it carried out "certain personnel  changes" at ministries and acceded to the European charter of  minority languages and the charter of regional self-rule.    Moravcik said he hoped the agreement would allow his  government to submit to the citizens an alternative of further  progress towards Slovakia's development and political stability.    Under the agreement, concrete decisions will be considered  by  a special council consisting of the chairmen of the coalition  parties and the chairmen of the party deputies' groups who will  coordinate cooperation in the Parliament.    Carnogursky said "the principle of consensus, that is the  right of each subject to veto, will be applied in the coalition  on the most important questions."    He stressed the agreement contained no secret supplement  like  that concluded by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS).    The programme statement, which the government is to submit  to  the parliament within 30 days of its appointment on March 16, is  expected to be a much more difficult test of its ability to  reach compromise.    The government will be in power until early elections are  held on September 30-October 1.    Cernak said the statement would be submitted to the  parliament on April 12.    Knazko said "today put an end to the myth that agreement  could not be reached in Slovakia's political life."    Cernak said the effort to reach a broader political  consensus  was proved by the fact that the new coalition had offered to the  opposition posts in the presidium and supervisory council of the  National Property Fund at which personnel changes would be  carried out. The HZDS as well the SNS have already proposed  their candidates, Cernak added.    The new coalition commands a total of 83 votes in the  150-seat parliament if the 14 Hungarian and two independent  deputies are included.    Observers do not rule out that the quality of the  functioning  of Moravcik's government, whose initiators were united mainly by  opposition to Meciar, will indicate chances of a similar  coalition being formed after the early elections.</p>

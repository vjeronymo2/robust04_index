			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: France opens up a second front - Paris is trying to squeeze concessions from its EU partners France has now opened a second front in the Gatt negotiations by demanding from its European Union partners compensation for concessions EU negotiators have failed to wring from the US. The question is whether it is prepared to go as close to the brink with its partners as it has been with the US, and in the process risk scuppering the whole Gatt deal. France's demands for guarantees that its farmers will not have to take 'one single extra hectare' out of production as a result of a Gatt deal, and its insistence that Europe arm itself with 'the same instruments of commercial defence' as the US may have come as a shock to some EU partners. But they should not be a surprise, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said yesterday. 'As far back as April,' when the Balladur government came into power, 'we have been sending memos' to Brussels on the need to reinforce EU anti-dumping and retaliatory powers and to ensure any Gatt farm deal involved no greater 'set-aside' than the EU's existing reforms, he said. Now, 'our partners have got the message' France is 'ready to give a Gatt farm deal the green light only if there are simultaneous changes in the common agricultural policy,' Mr Jean Puech, the agriculture minister said yesterday. Paris' appetite for brinkmanship seemed yesterday only to have been whetted by what Mr Juppe admitted yesterday were very significant gains on agriculture. Mr Juppe should, by virtue of being also secretary general of the RPR Gaullist party, have a very good idea of what the Balladur government needs to satisfy its backbenchers. But he and other ministers almost seemed to relish the fact that for them the negotiations were only just beginning. In the intra-EU negotiations to come they can play a direct part, instead of being sidelined in talks with the US by the European Union system which delegates the bargaining on foreign trade to Brussels commissioners. So, Mr Juppe blasted away at 'total US intransigence' on audiovisual broadcasting and other issues still to be sorted out by Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU negotiator in Geneva, and gave the impression that his energies in the next few days would be devoted to squeezing France's EU partners for new money and measures. But this could be a brink too far, one French farmers' leader suggested last night. 'We should not get into the compensation game,' said Mr Pierre Cormoreche, president of France's chambers of agriculture, 'because other (EU) countries have their interests to defend'. He expressed doubt that the EU farm budget would stand the strain, an issue not addressed by French ministers yesterday.</p>

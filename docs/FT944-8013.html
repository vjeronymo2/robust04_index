			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television It comes as a shock to realise that Henri Cartier-Bresson is still alive. So many of his photographs have passed into the common currency of images it's sometimes hard to remember they are the work of an individual vision rather than a mass race memory. The French photographer, now 86, is the subject of Omnibus (10.25, BBC1), that fascinatingly tries to pin-down the elusive, to freeze the momentary and preserve the fleeting - like photography; particularly Cartier-Besson's own. Like his compatriot, Olivier Messiaen, who composed his Quartet for the End of Time as a result, Cartier-Bresson was in a wartime prison camp. If Jean Renoir was right in maintaining that Hollywoood needed a few bombs dropped on it, does suffering really sharpen the creative juices? More visual art, or possibly not, in Without Walls: the Turner Prize (9pm, Channel 4). The brouhaha contrasts agreeably with the cosiness of last night's Evening Standard Drama Awards or tonight's Royal Film Performance (11.40pm, ITV). What with that and royal variety shows, HM deserves a large tax rebate.</p>

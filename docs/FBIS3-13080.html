The sources said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher offered Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the  Palestinian president, during the latter's visit to Washington  the U.S. Administration's willingness to host a high-level  meeting in Washington to discuss Palestinian demands, resume the  negotiations, and impart impetus to the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, because that "would be considered an  achievement and a victory over the forces of extremism."    The Palestinian sources stressed "Palestinian eagerness to  continue the negotiations and implement the agreement."  However, they expressed the "PLO's insistence on the adoption  of an international resolution, inasmuch as Security Council  resolutions should not be ignored as an authority, nor should  this disregard be perpetuated, as reflected in the U.S. offer."  The sources stressed that the "PLO cannot ignore angry  Palestinian reactions inside the the occupied territories."    The sources said that "a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin  in  this atmosphere will not be successful." However, they pointed  out that "the U.S. position is being studied, as is the  possibility of holding such a meeting" -- that is, if suitable  conditions are available to ensure its success, "first and  foremost the adoption of an international resolution." The  sources went on: "It is the U.S. Administration which is in an  embarrassing position, not the PLO, which enjoys collective  international -- with the exception of the United States and  Israel -- support for its demands." [passage omitted]    Asked whether the PLO would accept Israeli proposals that  respond to PLO demands, provided an international resolution is  not adopted, the Palestinian sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that  "that is ruled out, because it would constitute a precedent."  They also said: "The international organization's disregard  for a massacre committed within the context of a conflict on  which a considerable number of international resolutions have  been adopted is a precedent with regard to the Security Council  and represents the first real nail in the United Nation's  coffin."</p>

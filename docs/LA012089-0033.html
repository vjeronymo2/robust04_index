			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEADY AS SHE GOES, ON COURSE TO DISASTER?;  </P> <P> LACKING A COMPASS, BUSH TEAM MAY TOO EASILY ACCEPT A TILT TO LEFT  </P> <P> "The Establishment is back," a Washington Post editor wrote a few days ago,  "not just the individuals and the pedigrees but the state of mind." David  Ignatius, the editor of Outlook, noted that Secretary of State-designate James  A. Baker III was busily consulting with his predecessors in a way that was  reminiscent of "the best and the brightest" at the outset of John F. Kennedy's  Administration. Andover, Yale and Princeton are back in the saddle. The new  buzzwords in President Bush's Washington are said to be bipartisan foreign  policy and partnership with Congress.  </P> <P> How long is this chumminess likely to last? Lurking beneath the comparison with  the best and the brightest is the implicit prediction of disaster ahead.  Kennedy's Ivy Leaguers soon strolled into the quagmire of Vietnam. Does a  similar fate await Bush's team, so many of whom come from a comparable  background?  </P> <P> Conservatives fear that this might be the case. Bush clearly regards  conservatives as one among many interest groups to be placated, not as the  source of a philosophy that is perilous to ignore. By all accounts, policy in  the Bush Administration is to be determined by a pragmatic weighing of  conflicting advice. This sounds fine, but in practice it doesn't work.  </P> <P> In the absence of a philosophy of government it is difficult to assess the  merits of advice given by conflicting experts. President Jimmy Carter stayed up  till midnight in the Oval Office agonizing over rival reports on energy policy.  To deregulate or not to deregulate? Meanwhile, we waited in gasoline lines.  Armed with a philosophy, President Ronald Reagan decided right away, and by  mid-afternoon could usually head off to the family quarters upstairs. This is  not to say that a free-market philosophy (Reagan's, in the case of energy  policy) is always right, but some philosophy is needed when decisions have to  be made every day, and often quickly.  </P> <P> It is not clear at present that Bush has such a philosophy. The public service  that his patrician father urged on him merely restates the problem of  government. It does not solve it. Washington is currently celebrating the  belief that the new skipper has arrived at the White House without a compass.  This is a pleasant prospect for Beltway hands, who have a compass of their own  and will be only too happy to let Bush use it. It comes with a built-in  Democratic "tilt," and suggests a course to the left of center.  </P> <P> It is considered tactless to point out that the present consensus in Washington  was achieved by the Reagan Administration's latter-day adoption of Democratic  policies. Somehow in the last two years Reagan mislaid his compass and borrowed  the Beltway's model. Bush has strongly signaled that he intends to continue  using it.  </P> <P> Conservatives believe that this course -- steady as she goes -- will end in one  disaster or another. And they note the irony: Reagan's capitulations came late  enough in the day that their effects would not be experienced on his watch, but  on that of his successor.  </P> <P> The principal architects of Reagan's emerging pragmatism, it is widely believed  in Washington, were Secretary of State George P. Shultz and James Baker. Now,  as the incoming secretary of state, Baker will justly inherit the whirlwind.  Here are a few of the storm warnings.  </P> <P> A new agreement in Southern Africa, signed after the November election, could  easily lead to the Marxist takeover of Namibia and its permanent enthronement  in Angola.  </P> <P> In Nicaragua the Contras have been abandoned in all but name. Cubans and  Soviets will now have a freer hand to continue their surreptitious military  advance in that country, from which tens of thousands of Nicaraguans are  fleeing to the United States. Bush has suggested that he will "take a look at"  our refugee policy, and has hinted at the worst solution: more federal aid for  refugees.  </P> <P> El Salvador's economy has been reduced to shambles by U.S. economic aid, and  its government is propped up by U.S. military aid. Nothing has been done to  address the Latin American debt problem, the "Baker plan" having failed. Only a  move toward free markets will help Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Peru. Yet  bailing out U.S. banks as a prelude to further loans, which appears to be  Baker's strategy, is the one course of action guaranteed to postpone the shift  to free markets.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, all these countries are threatened by leftward-moving governments.  But the real danger lies in the Soviet Union, precisely because their economy  appears to be collapsing. No longer can the Soviets believe that they will  overtake us by peaceful means. Militarily they are still strong, but this  cannot long outlast economic decline.  </P> <P> Prudently, we should calculate that their military commanders may soon start  thinking what is for us the unthinkable: Use it or lose it. And so we should be  thinking of defense -- strategic defense. But the Establishment, the one that  is now "back" and running things in Washington, does not want to defend  America. And it does not want to because it is afraid to. "This tremendous  opposition to introducing a defensive element to the U.S. deterrent strategy,"  Air Force Chief of Staff Larry D. Welch said recently, "has to be one of the  most mysterious pieces of political chemistry we've seen." Meanwhile, James  Baker wants to continue pursuing arms control. In this connection, arms-control  director Gen. William F. Burns told me recently that the nearly completed START  agreement will entail dismantling half of our existing nuclear submarines.  </P></p>

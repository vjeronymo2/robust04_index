			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 4 Jun -- The United Kingdom's ambassador to  Kuwait stressed that British-Kuwaiti relations were deep and  solid, and expressed his country's keenness to increase and  develop these relations in various fields, particularly trade  and defense.    In a statement to AL-QABAS newspaper, published here today,  Ambassador William [Hugh] Fullerton said Britain "puts great  importance on its relations with the State of Kuwait and these  relations have been characterized by consistency and strength."    He added that on the political, trade, and defense level,  the  relations between the State of Kuwait and Britain were  "progressing continuously as has been illustrated by the mutual  visits of senior officials from the two countries and the visits  of the British naval units to Kuwaiti ports and the royal  airforce. For instance, seven trade missions visited Kuwait  during the last few months at the end of which trade agreements  were concluded.    William Fullerton stressed the need "to continue the  imposition of economic sanctions on the Iraqi regime in order to  comply with the UN resolutions, on top of which is the  recognition of Kuwait and its sovereignty and the release of the  captives detained by the Iraqi regime."    The ambassador made clear that "Kuwait enjoys a democracy  with special vitality where Diwaniyahs [guest houses] exist  alongside the National Assembly and there is an interest in  human rights issue in Kuwait."    William Fullerton stated "Britain is keen to have balanced  relations with all the region's countries and believes that  stability in the region does not come by waging wars."</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ewart consolidates its recovery with Pounds 1.13m Ewart, the Belfast-based property company, continued the recovery seen at the interim stage with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the year to April 30, compared with losses of Pounds 155,721. Turnover advanced from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5.9m, generating operating profits of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 768,871). The pre-tax result was struck after a Pounds 546,358 profit on the sale of investment properties and net interest payable of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 924,592). Mr Paul McWilliams, chairman, said further progress had been made on the Laganbank development near Belfast city centre. Also, the first phase of the retail development at Hamilton, Scotland, had been completed. Proceeds from the sale of the retail investment in Newcastle upon Tyne had been reinvested in an industrial property at Livingston, Scotland, and in a retail warehouse north of Belfast, adding about Pounds 160,000 to the company's rental base, Mr McWilliams said. Earnings per share emerged at 5.21p (0.44p) and a proposed final dividend of 0.6p brings the total for the year to 1p (nil). On July 25, dealings in Ewart shares began on the Dublin Stock Exchange.</p>

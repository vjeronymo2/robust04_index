			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: JJB resumes plans for listing JJB (Sports), the UK's largest independent sports retailer, which postponed a summer flotation due to 'adverse market conditions', is resuming its plans to seek a listing. However, going against the current trend for scaling down flotations, Mr David Whelan, chairman, said the move would aim to raise around Pounds 20m of new money, which is at the top end of previous forecasts. He also expected the group to be valued at Pounds 60m, rather than the Pounds 50m envisaged in April. The listing will be achieved through a placing of 35 per cent of the shares with institutions. Mr Whelan and his family interests will retain 63.4 per cent, while management will control the remainder. The pathfinder prospectus is expected to be issued tomorrow. 'My belief is that the market will accept good companies whatever the conditions, but I was persuaded otherwise', said Mr Whelan. 'However, the improving environment will enable us to achieve a better value for the company.' JJB, which started as a single sports shop in Wigan 21 years ago, achieved operating profits of Pounds 2.5m from turnover of Pounds 25m for the six months ended July 31 1994. The company's 107 stores are concentrated in the north west of England, the Midlands and Scotland. Charterhouse Tilney Securities are the sponsors and stockbrokers to the issue.</p>

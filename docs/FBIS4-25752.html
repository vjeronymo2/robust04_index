			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland,  director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), today urged the acceleration of talks on China's  re-entry into the world trade body in the next few months.    During a meeting with a Chinese trade official here,  Sutherland said that "positive" and "constructive" changes have  taken place in the negotiations on the re-entry and the momentum  should be kept.    The 112-member GATT will be part of the World Trade  Organization (WTO) after the agreement on the Uruguay Round  trade talks takes effect in early 1995.    All the GATT members will certainly be WTO members while  those who are not in GATT before the date when WTO is set up  will have to apply for WTO membership.    In his meeting with Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese  delegation to negotiations with the European Union (EU) and the  United States, Sutherland expressed his hope that all the sides  show biggest flexibility, stressing that there should be further  progress in talks on services.    The meeting took place after the Chinese delegation finished  a round of talks with the U.S. and the EU on the resumption of  China's status in GATT.    Long, also an assistant to Chinese Foreign Trade and  Economic  Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, briefed the GATT chief on Sino-U.S.  and Sino-EU negotiations.</p>

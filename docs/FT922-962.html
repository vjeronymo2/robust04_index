			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Consultant's critique The effective use of consultants is surprisingly rare. Many companies treat their advisers as if they were junior clerks and get them to perform tasks that they could easily do themselves. Few consultants complain as they are paid by the hour in most cases rather than by the job. Cowie at Lay &amp; Wheeler demonstrated how to get full value out of the experience that consultants bring. He employed Coopers &amp; Lybrand to advise, but released them once the advice had been taken. As it happens, the recommendation was identicalto his own empirical research. However, he now had confidence that the choice was rational since it was confirmed by an outsider. So often a solution which is logical for the computer is unusable by humans. If not controlled, the computer rapidly becomes the master rather than the servant. Eight character codes can be neat and tidy but wines are rarely called 'ZX456GF'. Any system which relies on short codes must provide help for the poor user. It must be considered a black mark against Kerridge that it ignored this obvious problem in the first implementation. Modern database systems all incorporate the sort of name finding required as a standard part of the package. However, they have learned from the mistake and adapted the system to a more human- centred approach. It is always important to ensure that any system offers a path for growth. The two common options are to choose a manufacturer with a wide range of computing power available or to develop the system in a portable fashion. The advantage of open systems is their ability to switch to other hardware. Lay &amp; Wheeler has demonstrated that it can be done in reality, not just in the salesman's patter. Lay &amp; Wheeler suffered some disruption and the benefits have not come as quickly as expected. However, this is balanced by the reduced stockholding (saving Pounds 50,000 in interest charges alone) and better management information for the future.

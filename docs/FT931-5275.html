			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: US markets struggle to understand Clinton - Investors are confused Although it has been more than two weeks since President Bill Clinton formally unveiled his bold tax-raising and deficit-cutting budget, US stock markets remain confused about what the plan means for the economy, corporate earnings and share prices. When the new president presented his economic plan in mid-February, the markets wasted no time in expressing displeasure at the scale of the tax increases and the timidity of the spending cuts, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by almost 100 points. Yet, in the next week and a half, the Dow recovered all of its lost ground, so that the index now stands at almost exactly where it was before the Clinton budget was unveiled. At first glance, it may look as though the markets have been unusually indecisive and slow off the mark: normally, Wall Street takes only a short time to digest economic and political news and spit out a judgment. Yet, there are some good reasons why the markets have struggled to come to terms with 'Clintonomics'. To begin with, the scope and ambition of the president's plan has been more than a mouthful for dealers and investors. Among his proposals are tax increases on middle and top income earners, on corporations and on energy use; tax breaks on investment and tax cuts for the working poor; an assortment of spending increases on infrastructure projects, education, science and technology and certain social programmes; and selected spending cuts. Working out how these measures will affect the economy is not easy. The simpler certainties of the Reagan era and the policy inertia of the Bush years have been replaced by activist, reforming, big government. The markets will take time getting used to the changed political, economic and policy landscape. To make matters worse, not only has the White House hinted that the Clinton economic blueprint may be amended, updated or expanded before it reaches the legislators, but anyone with a basic understanding of how Washington works knows that there is no chance that the budget will make it through Congress in one piece. Hence it makes sense for the markets to be wary of passing judgement on a radical new economic policy until it does become policy. Secondly, the introduction of the budget and the first weeks of its life have been played out against a background of economic 'noise' that has been distinctly discordant. The statistics released and surveys published since the State of the Union address on February 18 have painted an inconsistent picture of the nation's economic health. If anything, the message in the figures, which have included sharp declines in home sales and consumer confidence, weak factory orders, and inconsistent growth in labour markets, has been that economic recovery may have slowed after the post-election spurt of growth seen in the fourth quarter of 1992. This has only added to the confusion. The markets would love to come up with a conclusive answer as to what the budget means for the economy; but it is difficult when they no longer know where the economy stands. Finally, equity investors have been unsettled by the extraordinary recent rally in the Treasury bond markets, where prices have risen sharply on growing confidence that the president's policies will simultaneously slow economic growth, dampen inflationary pressures, and reduce the deficit. Since Mr Clinton won the election on November 3, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond has fallen from 7.65 per cent to 6.72 per cent, and on the two-year note from 4.42 per cent to 3.72 per cent. The 30-year bond is now recording the lowest yield since the issue was first sold to the public in 1977. Given that Democratic presidents are generally regarded as the enemy of fixed-income investors because of their tendency to use government spending to generate economic growth (a policy approach roundly criticised by free-marketeers for its inflationary consequences), the performance of the bond market under Mr Clinton has been nothing short of remarkable. Which is why the equity markets do not know quite what to make of it all. Traditionally, stocks can get a lift from a bond market rally because lower interest rates are good news for corporate and individual borrowers, and for the economy. So dramatic has the decline in bond yields been, however, that there is a worry that the booming government securities market will lure investors' funds away from the struggling equities markets. It is difficult to ascertain how long the confusion and uncertainty will last - the political road ahead for the budget is long and strewn with obstacles. As for fundamentals, the good news is that interest rates are low and corporate earnings are improving; but the bad news is that price valuations are high and the economy may be cooling off. The indication is that US stock markets, over the short-term at least, will remain on a faltering course.</p>

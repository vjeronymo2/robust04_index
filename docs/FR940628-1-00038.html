			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This decision was based on the premise that the statute required all areas required to implement an I/M program to have adopted regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority for this rulemaking is not based on section 110(k)(4), but on sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4), which applies only to areas required to submit basic I/M programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the Act, basic I/M areas must submit a SIP revision that includes any ``provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle inspection and maintenance program'' of no less stringency than either the program that was in the SIP at the time of passage of the Act or the minimum basic program requirements, whichever is more stringent. Basic areas have a nominal requirement only for a schedule for implementation pursuant to section 172(b)(11)(B) of the 1977 Amendments and sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the 1990 Amendments, plus any other requirements established by EPA in guidance. The statutory language of section 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and section 182(b)(4) provides a degree of flexibility compared with the statutory language in section 182(c)(3), which requires enhanced I/M areas to submit a SIP revision ``to provide for an enhanced program''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although for most purposes EPA will continue to interpret ``provisions to provide for'' a basic I/M program to require full adoption and expeditious implementation of such a program, EPA believes based on this flexible language, that it is appropriate to revise the SIP revisions requirements applicable to basic I/M areas that ultimately will qualify for redesignation. For states which have attained the ambient standard with the benefit of only the current program, or no program at all, EPA does not believe it is necessary to revise or adopt new regulations and undertake other significant planning efforts which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation occurred because they are not necessary for maintenance. It would be a wasteful exercise to force the state to go through full adoption of regulations only to have these regulations converted to a contingency measure the moment the redesignation is approved. EPA believes that such states need not submit an actual I/M program as long as there are ``provisions necessary to provide'' for an I/M program as required by statute. For areas that qualify for redesignation to attainment and ultimately are redesignated, EPA is proposing to amend Subpart S to interpret that statutory phrase to allow such areas to be redesignated if they otherwise qualify for redesignation and submit a SIP that contains the following four elements: (1) Legal authority for a basic I/M program (or an enhanced program if the state chooses to opt up), meeting all of the requirements of Subpart S such that implementing regulations can be adopted without further legislation; (2) a request to place the I/M plan or upgrades (as applicable) in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation as described in the fourth element below; (3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or the Governor's designee to adopt regulations to implement the I/M program in response to a specified triggering event; and (4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adopting and implementing the I/M program, including appropriate milestones, in the event the contingency measure is triggered (milestones shall be defined by states in terms of months since the triggering event). EPA believes that for areas that otherwise qualify for redesignation a SIP meeting these four requirements would satisfy the obligation to submit ``provisions to provide'' for a satisfactory I/M program, as required by the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without these amendments states that are being redesignated to attainment would have to adopt a full I/M program for the purpose of obtaining full approval of their SIPs as meeting all applicable SIP requirements, which is a prerequisite for approval of a redesignation request. Once redesignated these states could discontinue implementation of this program as long as it was converted to a contingency measure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With these amendments the determination of whether a state fulfills the SIP requirements will depend, for the purposes of redesignation approval only, on whether the state meets the four requirements listed above. EPA believes that this flexibility is built into the basic I/M requirement and should apply only for the limited purpose of considering a redesignation request to attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be understood, however, that, pursuant to section 175A(c), while EPA considers the redesignation request, the state continues to be required to meet all the requirements of this subpart. This would include the submission of another SIP revision meeting the existing requirements for fully adopted rules and the specific implementation deadline applicable to the area as required under 40 CFR 51.372 or the I/M rule. If the state does not comply with these requirements it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. Because the possibility for sanctions exists, states which do not have a solid basis for approval of the redesignation request and maintenance plan should proceed to fully prepare and plan to implement a basic I/M program that meets all the requirements of Subpart S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

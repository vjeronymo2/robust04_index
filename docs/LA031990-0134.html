			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ARTS FUNDING;  </P> <P> FOR TAXPAYERS, NOT A PRETTY PICTURE;  </P> <P> SETTING REASONABLE SELECTION STANDARDS IS THE LEAST THAT SHOULD BE DONE TO CURE  ILLS OF THE FEDERAL ARTS ENDOWMENT PROCESS.  </P> <P> The U.S. House of Representatives has begun the reauthorization process for the  National Endowment for the Arts. As this process continues through the spring  and summer, the taxpayers have good reason to ask tough questions as to the  legitimacy of this agency and its decision making process.  </P> <P> The issue of arts funding came to the fore last year when working Americans  discovered to their dismay that they were subsidizing through their taxes such  so-called art as "Piss-Christ," depicting a crucifix submerged in the artist's  urine, as explicit and bizarre photographs featuring nude children, acts of  sodomy and sadomasochistic sex. This is not a debate over artistic nudes.  </P> <P> Contrary to what is said by defenders of the NEA, who repeatedly told us that  only two of the thousands of grants are questionable, new examples are  emerging. Recently, a series of live performances by porno queen Annie Sprinkle  at the Kitchen Theater in New York City was indirectly subsidized by the NEA.  An exhibit which just ended at Illinois State University by David Wojnarowizc  certainly is in this category. In the catalogue that accompanied this  taxpayer-financed show was a depiction of Jesus Christ as a heroin addict,  complete with a rubber tourniquet and syringe stuck in his arm.  </P> <P> In times when we are hard pressed to find funds for health care for our  elderly, prenatal care for poor women and school lunch programs, spending tax  dollars on art is questionable, at best. Spending our tax dollars on trashy art  is outrageous.  </P> <P> As one might predict, the artist community's reaction to attempts to set  standards is to cry "censorship." Who's kidding whom? We are not debating  whether the federal government ought to pay for artistic folly, no matter how  much it may offend the morals of taxpayers or denigrates. No one debates  America's artists' self-proclaimed rights to photograph and urinate on whatever  they wish -- as long as it's on their own time and on their own dime. The idea  that any "artist" has a right, on the basis of the First Amendment protection  of free speech, to collect our tax dollars for sleaze is ridiculous.  </P> <P> If the U.S. government is going to underwrite art, choices must be made about  where to spend those tax dollars. Of course, as far as I'm concerned the  federal government should be out of the arts altogether. And I am somewhat  surprised by the reaction of some artists who argue for such government  involvement in the artistic realm. History teaches us that when the government  gets its hands on the arts, like in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Nazi  Germany, freedom, creativity and the search for truth and beauty suffer.  </P> <P> So why do many artists insist on a federal subsidy program? It seems to me many  recipients of NEA funds would be hard-pressed to attract customers or voluntary  support. These questionable artists are more confident of support from the  avant-garde art elite in the peer-review panels of the NEA, people who are not  investing their own money. And don't let NEA Director John Frohnmeyer convince  you these panels, like the legal jury system, are imperfect but the best we can  do. If similar peer-review system were followed in American courtrooms, we  would only have lawyers on juries.  </P> <P> In fact, if Frohnmeyer is so big on having the peer-review panels modeled on  juries, then non-artist, non-arts professionals, everyday working Americans  ought to be asked to sit on NEA panels and make the decisions about art  funding. I can guarantee the decisions would be far different from what they  are now.  </P> <P> If one wants to see censorship in the arts, one need only see how the NEA  excludes beautiful, more traditional art. Realistic art or pro-religious art  suffers even as weird, freak art triumphs. This seems so systematic that  several realist artists are planning to sue the NEA. The NEA clique's rule has  had a powerful and negative influence on art in America, according to several  prominent art critics.  </P> <P> Short of abolishing this Soviet-style committee system, Sen. Jesse Helms and I  propose that the NEA director and the peer review groups -- the same people who  already make decisions about what art to fund -- operate with certain standards  of decency in making their decisions. In other words, we're asking them to come  to their own conclusions about whether a project in question is obscene,  indecent, anti-religious or racist; and if the answer is "yes," don't subsidize  it with our tax dollars.  </P> <P> At this time, such criteria are not part of the process. The NEA decision  makers are totally unaccountable to the moral standards of the people forced to  pay the bill, and that's the way they want it to stay.  </P> <P> The dollars spent on art are far better left in the individuals' pockets for  them to spend on the art they appreciate. But, if Uncle Sam insists on making  artistic decisions for us, the least we should do is set some reasonable  standards on how our taxes are spent. One doesn't have to be a prude or a  puritan to see that the federal government shouldn't be spending our tax  dollars on some of the trash the NEA calls art.  </P></p>

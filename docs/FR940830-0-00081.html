CLPHA also indicated that previous participation forms should be valid for two to three years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In an effort to streamline procurement procedures and reduce HA requirements, HUD published an interim rule at 59 F.R. 31521 on June 20, 1994, which eliminates the previous participation approval requirement (submission of Form HUD&hyph;2530) for all HA contracts. This interim rule became effective on July 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Force Account <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Seven commenters were strongly in favor of eliminating prior HUD approval for use of force account labor, but four of those commenters recommended limiting this proposal to high performers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For PHAs that are designated as both over-all high performers and mod-high performers under the PHMAP, and IHAs which are not high risk, HUD has eliminated prior approval for use of force account labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Seven comments were received on HUD's proposal to monitor each HA's Section 3 efforts. One commenter noted that HUD did not specify which division or department would do this, and recommended that training should be provided. One commenter cautioned HUD on the impact its proposals would have on CGP and recommended HUD gather input from people who work in this area. To further Section 3 efforts, a PHA suggested that residents registered with the HA as trainees be exempt from the HUD-determined wage Rates and Davis-Bacon wage rates. The resident trainee rates could be approved by HUD the same as HUD determined wage rates. By analogy to Connecticut law, one PHA noted that their housing construction programs required 25% of the dollar value of the contract be sub-contracted to Minority Business Enterprises and that 25% of that amount be awarded to Women's Business Enterprises. This was stated to produce verifiable results and has been very effective. Another PHA supported HUD's effort and suggested HA's focus more of their resources on the Section 3 process and involve more residents in the distribution of work and training program. CLPHA indicated that by FFY 95, HUD expects to have an effective final rule implementing the amended Section 3 which proposes that PHAs certify as to compliance with Section 3 and provide anticipated projections based on best efforts. PHAs can certify as to compliance with Section 3 but CLPHA stated it was unreasonable to expect projections as to the number of jobs or type of training available through various contracts. This was found to only be determined by the successful contractor. The additional costs of carrying out Section 3 training should also be taken into account in evaluating bids according to CLPHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAHRO disagreed with any request for numerical targets because annual targets are influenced by a number of factors beyond the PHA's or contractor's control, and monitoring and reporting regarding such targets creates paper games. NAHRO did not find a program-by-program approach to necessarily be effective in creating real employment for residents. NAHRO recommended that PHAs establish goals authority-wide to comply with Section 3, of which CGP is one component. To foster successful implementation of Section 3, HUD should work with public housing industry groups as well as contractors and unions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

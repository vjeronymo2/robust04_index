			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Time To Close All The Refugee Camps"] </F>   [Text] Nearly 20 years after their war ended, Indochinese  refugees continue to tax the conscience and resources of other  nations. A generation after the communists captured Vietnam,  Cambodia and Laos, refugee camps dot Southeast Asia. The  existence of these camps, and the people in them, sorely test  the very concept of refugees. When the first Indochinese fled  in 1975, they were fleeing violence, and either the real or  perceived oppression they felt would occur from new regimes. In  short, they left their countries because of fear. They were  welcomed, or at least accepted, in neighbouring countries such  as Thailand. The sympathy for refugees was clear, and it was  warranted.    Today, it is a far different story. The three Indochina  countries-- especially Vietnam and Laos -- are settled. All of  these nations and their regimes have rejoined the world  community. They deal with day-to-day problems like any other  nation. Small battles still erupt in Cambodia, and when these  occur at a border, it is natural that the innocent flee across  the frontier to safety. But none of the three countries is  embroiled in war. No large segments of the Indochina  populations are singled out for oppression by any of the three  governments.    It is, therefore, possible to understand the Hmong, Lao,  Vietnamese and Khmer refugees in Thailand and elsewhere who are  reluctant to return home. The lands they left were in turmoil,  and many of the refugees feared for their lives. The dread of  jail, "reeducation," forced separation of families and even  worse caused the refugees to pack up and move. Since then, they  have effectively lived in a closed society. Rumour and hearsay  about their homelands have been the predominant form of  information.    It is impossible, however, to sympathize with their claims  to  remain in their refugee camps or emigrate elsewhere. Their  times of trouble have ended. The refugees are mistaking the  warmhearted and compassionate asylum they once received with  some sort of worldwide social welfare programme. There is  little doubt that many would have been victims of vengeful  regimes at home in the past. But 19 years after the fall of  Saigon, there is clearly no such danger. It is past time for  the Indochina refugees to pick up their lives again, in their  own countries.    This task must be handled gently, but it must be handled.  The few violent and militant refugees aside, humane officials  must convince the Indochinese it is in their own interest to  resume normal lives. It is to be expected that a tiny minority  of the refugee camps will react angrily to repatriation. In the  Vietnamese refugee camps of Galang, Indonesia, and Hong Kong,  fighting, fasting and self-immolation has occurred. This is  regrettable, and such acts must be carefully regulated.  Outsiders have manipulated Hmong refugees in Thai camps with  baseless rumours of actions both by the Thai and Laotian  governments. Such actions must be overcome with information and  truth, rather than force.    At the same time, it is vital for the refugees as well as  neighbouring nations that these problems are, indeed, overcome.  It is a mistake for the former refugees to believe they can  continue to receive special treatment. Only true victims of  great political or natural upheavals should expect such  attention from others. The continuing claims of the Indochinese  upon the limited resources of their neighbours and the world  cheapens the true meaning of "refuge" as a reliable haven from  such misfortunes. Thailand continues to award refugee status to  both Burmese and Khmers who flee any current fighting in their  homeland. The Indochinese who have been "refugees" for so many  years effectively endanger even such logical aid to innocent  people.    Voluntary repatriation of Indochinese should be pressed  vigorously. The men and women in Southeast Asian camps may  apply for emigration to other countries. But if this fails,  they must accept -- as all other world citizens -- that  returning to their homeland is the only possible option. Their  dislike of their own regime should drive them to try to change  it, if they wish. That is what dissatisfied citizens of all  countries must do. The claim to special status by the  Indochinese is unwarranted, in the end. Their great wars and  political shocks have ended. It is time for both the refugees  and those who have given them refuge in their time of turmoil  and need to get on with their normal lives.</p>

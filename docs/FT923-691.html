			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Aerospace, the blunder years: The sad story of commercial aircraft production in the UK In the 84 years since the first powered flight in Britain, there have been few moments when one could feel confident about the commercial future of the UK aircraft industry. This is not one of those moments. On Wednesday, British Aerospace announced half-year results so bad that the stock market wiped another 43 per cent off the already depressed value of its shares. In reaching that verdict, investors were stigmatising an entire industry: BAe is the repository of the UK airframe industry's history, the inheritor of the traditions of such companies as Hawker Siddeley, Gloster, de Havilland, Blackburn, Armstrong Whitworth, English Electric, Bristol and A V Roe. Foremost among those traditions, alas, has been a persistent inability to make money on the sale of commercial aircraft. The profits of BAe's military sales are matched, with eerie precision, by the losses of its civilian aircraft. 'For every Pounds 1 made by the military division, the civil aircraft division loses 96p,' BAe said this week. The contrast between the two arms of the business has rarely been so stark, but it has always existed. The government's Plowden report of 1965, which laid the foundations of the industry's current structure, summed up the post-war story in mandarin's prose: 'British civil aircraft of the new generation of advanced jets have failed in general, in spite of their technical qualities, to realise the commercial expectations with which they were launched.' That judgment is as true today as it was 27 years ago. BAe's half-year figures tell the story: its 146 regional airliner lost Pounds 167m; its turboprops Pounds 111m. The stock market has tended to blame the company's recent poor performance on the distractions offered by its acquisitions in the 1980s - a Dutch construction business, a property developer, Rover cars. Sir Raymond Lygo, BAe's managing director in the 1980s, says much of the trouble lies in the attitudes fostered during four years in state hands in the 1970s. But the roots of BAe's difficulties go back much further. In 1918, says the economic historian Keith Hayward*, the British aircraft industry was the largest in the world: 122 companies producing 1,250 aircraft a month. When the war ended, such huge output was unnecessary. The government kept a core industry alive by spreading orders out, job by job, among favoured companies, 'the family'. The industry remained highly fragmented; even when five companies merged to form Hawker Siddeley in 1935, they retained their independent design and production centres, each scrambling for the 'penny packets' of orders the government offered. As a result the industry had no expertise in mass production; when rearmament was necessary, much of the manufacture of aircraft was farmed out to other companies. Two-thirds of all Spitfires, for example, were built in factories run by the Morris motor group. Design - sometimes brilliant design - was the companies' raison d'etre; there was no cadre of middle-level engineers, production managers and cost accountants. There were design triumphs - the Spitfire fighter, the Lancaster bomber, the Gloster Meteor jet fighter - but little attention was paid to the mundane task of simplifying production. The Spitfire took 13,000 man-hours to build, while the Messerschmitt 109, its German rival, took 4,000. As long as the government was prepared to pay for this style of industry with cost-plus contracts, the companies could prosper. After the war, however, with much of continental Europe's aviation industry destroyed, British companies were poised to exploit the newly emerging market for civil airliners. One such attempt was the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner, which made its maiden flight in 1949 and entered service in 1952. Technically, the Comet was a success. Commercially, it was a failure - not just because of two fatal crashes in its early years, caused by the inadequate state of scientific knowledge about metal fatigue, but also because it was the wrong size to appeal to US airlines, the largest group of potential purchasers. The Boeing 707, a later entry, was the decisive victor. The pattern was already clear: military contracting made money, civilian production - with the exception of the Vickers Viscount - lost it. Hawker Siddeley, the only airframe maker to steer clear of civilian business in this period, was twice as profitable as its rivals. By the late 1950s, the government had decided to cut its defence spending. It encouraged a series of mergers, creating two big airframe groups: British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley's aviation division. In the merger process, said one participant, 'tough and astute tycoons' fought over company names and fine print. 'But at the technical and engineering levels it all took place with scarcely a ripple.' Perhaps that was the problem. There were no technical ripples because the individual centres of operations - 19 in BAC, 10 in Hawker Siddeley Aviation  -remained intact, working on individual projects, among them the Concorde. This was the industry on which the Plowden committee reported. It concluded that the hope of competing with Boeing was already an empty one: 'We do not think it will ever be worthwhile for a British manufacturer to embark alone on a new long-range aircraft, or on any new aircraft that is particularly large and complex.' Collaboration with overseas companies would be necessary, the aim being to promote a European aircraft industry. Most important, the industry was so hampered by second-guessing by the government that only a degree of state ownership would allow it to re-establish operational freedom. 'The majority of the committee feel that over half the equity should be in government ownership to achieve this purpose.' Nothing came of this suggestion for another decade. In the meantime, the emphasis on Concorde and the Jaguar strike aircraft squeezed out other potentially worthwhile projects, such as an enlarged version of the BAC 1-11 airliner. There was one stroke of luck: BAC won a contract to supply aircraft to Saudi Arabia, which has become, in later years, BAe's lifeline. In 1977, the Labour government nationalised the airframe makers, merging them to form British Aerospace. The new company joined the European Airbus project, for which Hawker Siddeley had already been making the wing with great technical success. By joining as a full partner, BAe opened itself up to a share of Airbus's losses. And in making this decision, the government rejected the less glamorous but arguably more commercial alternative of a link with Boeing. Though the change to a Conservative government soon took BAe back into the private sector, there was little integration of the business. Sir Raymond Lygo says that a policy of spreading work around the group's many sites - the logical successor to the 'penny packets' of pre-war days - continued. The 146 regional airliner, which Hawker Siddeley had cancelled in pre-nationalisation days, had been reinstated during the state-owned years. Decisions were made on internal political grounds: to keep the balance between BAC and Hawker Siddeley. There was still a prevailing 'cost-plus' mentality; and though in 1989 the civil side of the business made a profit, it was clear that there was no crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. With the military budget also under pressure, crocks of gold would have to be found elsewhere: in property development, or in buying the Rover car business cheaply from the government. These were the stratagems to which Sir Roland Smith, chairman between 1987 and 1991, turned his attention. They proved ill-timed: Arlington Securities, the property developer, was bought at the top of the market; and Rover cars was not the bargain it appeared. Both have been losing money recently. With cash running short a year ago, a mishandled rights issue led to Sir Roland's departure, and the arrival as chairman of Mr John Cahill, formerly chief executive of BTR. It was Mr Cahill's first set of interim results that the stock market greeted in such a hostile fashion this week. His decision to take a Pounds 750m charge for reorganisation costs, coupled with a sharp deterioration in the group's operating performance, left the market unhappy. Investors were also nervous about a plan to solve the 146 problem by putting it into a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace. BAe's future is unclear. So are the conclusions to be drawn from its story. Is it simply part of the long decline of British manufacturing industry? Is it a qualified success story now fallen on hard times? Or is it a straightforward case of industrial mismanagement? The long-decline theory relies in part on familiar arguments about a lack of commercial culture among British engineers and of an engineering commitment among British financiers. Britain had an over-sized aircraft industry at the end of the war; it was inevitable that it would lose ground over the years. Government policy interfered too much, or too little; at any rate, it was unsatisfactory. Dedicated people tried hard; but there were bound to be more defeats than victories. The second view - that BAe has been a qualified success - stems from the way that the group has been able to retain a range of design and project management skills. The group remains a formidable repository of technological depth. Some of its products - such as the 125 executive jet - are commercial successes; on the military side, it is highly competitive internationally, as its continued ability to win business from Saudi Arabia shows. Overall, the UK aerospace industry has been holding on to its world market share. BAe remains a vital technical contributor to the Airbus, a European success story. Temporary financial problems at BAe should not, on this argument, be allowed to tarnish this. On the third view, those achievements merely serve to emphasise the management weaknesses of the company and, before that, of the industry. The group as a whole has suffered from weak financial controls and has never achieved the transformation to world-class standards of cost and quality that Rolls-Royce has undergone. Its dependence on military business for its profits has blinded the company to the need to design products to meet customers' needs. Until Mr Cahill's arrival, the group was run by administrators, or politicians, or engineers, or theoreticians - not real businessmen. All three views probably contain part of the truth. For anyone who grew up with the Comet and the Meteor, however, all three contain mingled sadness and frustration. * The British Aircraft Industry, Keith Hayward, Manchester University Press, 1989.</p>

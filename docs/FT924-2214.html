			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Concern over trade figures blackout ECONOMISTS fear incomplete trade figures over the next six months will foster fresh uncertainty on financial markets at a critical time for the UK economy. Figures will not be available for UK trade with the rest of the EC, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the total, for the first half of next year. The partial blackout comes at a sensitive time for the UK economy, as the effects of sterling's devaluation begin to work through. It will also make it difficult to gauge the effect on imports if the economy starts to recover. Analysts expressed concern over the effects this may have on sterling. 'The more worried overseas investors become in the absence of these vital statistics, the lower the pound will tend to settle,' said Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson. The decision not to issue comprehensive figures in the first half of next year has been made because a new EC-wide system - Intrastat - is to be adopted by each of the 12 member states next month. Based on VAT returns, it will replace the current method of collecting trade data based on customs declarations. Other EC members also expect a delay in the publication of intra-EC trade figures, but the UK is the only one to have decided on a formal six month gap. Other countries, such as Germany, hope to produce a first quarter estimate in April. Blackout on figures, Page 19 Samuel Brittan, Page 16</p>

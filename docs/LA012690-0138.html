			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS' RETURN SPARKS PEPPERDINE  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury had said earlier this week that Tom Lewis could  give the team a lift if he came back from a suspension and played well at both  ends of the floor.  </P> <P> Lewis did just that in the first half Thursday night against Gonzaga.  </P> <P> He made all three three-point shots he attempted en route to 13 first-half  points, spurring Pepperdine to a 74-69 victory before 2,987 at the Martin  Centre.  </P> <P> The Waves, who won their second consecutive game from Gonzaga, improved to 9-9  overall and 3-2 in the West Coast Conference. The Bulldogs fell to 6-12, 1-4.  </P> <P> Lewis, who lost his starting forward spot when he was suspended for three games  after missing curfew following a road game at the University of San Diego, was  jeered by the Gonzaga student section before the game. The students hooted, "We  want Lewis."  </P> <P> They got their wish about six minutes into the game.  </P> <P> In the next six minutes, Lewis scored his three three-pointers and was four of  five from the field, boosting the Waves to a 41-30 halftime advantage.  </P> <P> Gonzaga pulled within five points of the Waves several times in the second  half, largely on Kendall Simmons' outside shooting.  </P> <P> But Geoff Lear made three tough baskets off offensive rebounds late in the  game, and Craig Davis made a three-point shot with 1:24 to play to give the  Waves a 71-61 lead.  </P> <P> Asbury said that Lewis, who scored 15 points and had six assists, had played  very well on offense and "pretty well" on defense until he tired in the second  half.  </P> <P> Lear, who scored 11 of Pepperdine's last 20 points, led his team with 16 points  and eight rebounds. Asbury praised him for making "some big-time plays."  </P> <P> Asbury said that winning two consecutive close games from Gonzaga should help  the Waves the rest of the way in conference play. Last Saturday, the Waves  trailed the Bulldogs by 15 points midway through the second half, but came back  to win, 68-67, in Malibu.  </P> <P> Simmons scored a team-high 18 points for Gonzaga, and Brian Frederickson and  Bret Holmdahl each added 15.  </P></p>

In addition to other calamities, the UN peace-keeping  operation has brought Croatia an AIDS epidemic. This was  confirmed by research done by pathologists belonging to the  American Mobile Army Surgical Hospital after the death of  several members of UNPROFOR's Kenyan battalion and a statement  by the peace-keeping forces' spokeswoman, Shannon Boyd, that  symptoms of this disease have been discovered in the blood of  several UNPROFOR soldiers from East Europe, Separovic said.    Thirty-six persons have died from this terminal disease in  Croatia so far and some 60 have been infected, but the real  figures are certainly much higher.</p>

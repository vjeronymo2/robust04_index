			<p>BFN     [Text] A source close to the General Headquarters of the  Haitian Armed Forces [FADH] points out that transfers have been  carried out within the military institution. Thus, Lieutenant  Colonel Erwin Mehu has been transferred from the General  Headquarters to occupy the post of commander of the Croix-des-  Bouquets garrison, replacing Col. Mondesir Beaubrun who has been  transferred to the General Headquarters. The source pointed out  that Warrant Officer Lamour of the fourth company and another  sergeant of the same garrison have been dismissed from the FADH  and will be handed over to the justice department very soon. By  the way, the source dismissed reports of the death of Warrant  Officer Lamour following possible physical abuse, saying that  the warrant officer is just fine.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A contingent of the task force stationed in Tamale  was yesterday called upon to observe an imminent attack by a  group made up of predominantly Dagomba youths on Kokomba  elements, who are reported to have gone to the Tamale branch of  the Agricultural Development Bank to transact business. The  contingent was also called upon to forestall a possible invasion  of the bank by the group.    A statement issued in Accra today by the Ministry of  Information said attempts to restrain the mob by peaceful means  failed to bring the situation under control. The contingent was  therefore compelled to fire warning shots in order to calm the  situation and to disperse the crowd. Again, this failed and as  an attack on the contingent itself became imminent, it was  forced to fire in self-defense resulting in the death of eight  persons in the crowd while 21 others were injured.    The statement said the government deeply regrets the  incident  and conveys to the families of the deceased its deepest  condolences. The government also deplores the latest attack on a  policeman by a mob in Tamale, as a result of which he is in  coma. The statement reiterated the government's appeal for  restraint on the part of all factions involved in the clashes in  the conflict areas of the Northern region.    Meanwhile, a government delegation, led by the minister of  defense and chairman of the Emergency Committee, Alhaji Mahama  Iddrisu, is on its way to Tamale to assess the situation. The  minister of interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, is also on the  delegation.    [In the same newscast, the radio also carries in its press  review section, the following related item: "The DAILY GRAPHIC  and the GHANAIAN TIMES carry reports of a heavy bomb blast last  Monday at the Korle-Dudo Hawkers' Market within the premises of  the Kokomba market in Accra. The blast, which observers believe  is a spillover of the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region,  seriously injured three persons, who were asleep. A victim of  the blast alleged that earlier, three persons in military  uniform came to the market at about 1030 that night and ordered  children who were playing around the area to leave. According  to the caretaker of the market, a small boy around the area was  also found holding a live grenade with the pin intact showing it  to his mother as a crab he had found."]</p>

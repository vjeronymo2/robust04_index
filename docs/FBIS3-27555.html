Zhu made the request during a 30-minute meeting with  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai.    Kumagai said China must do more on environmental issues if  the government is to receive full public understanding on aid to  China.    Zhu promised that projects to be financed by Japan's yen  loan  program will contain measures designed to address China's  environmental conditions.    Chinese companies failing to meet environmental standards  would not be allowed to take part in yen loan projects, Zhu said.    Kumagai called for Beijing's efforts to narrow the  industrial  gap between inland and coastal areas.    Zhu replied that Beijing will formulate ways to upgrade its  traffic system in the inland area while doing its utmost to  create new industries there, taking advantage of abundant  natural resources.    Kumagai voiced hope that Japan's yen loan and other economic  assistance will help promote industrial restructuring in China.</p>

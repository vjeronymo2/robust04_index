			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: OIL ON THE BEACH;  </P> <P> MANNING THE BARRICADES;  </P> <P> THOMAS J. MAYS;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH MAYOR -- AND FORMER SURFER -- BECAME CITY'S CHIEF SPOKESMAN ON  THE NATIONAL SCENE.  </P> <P> He is tall, slim, boyish-looking. Although he is 36, Huntington Beach Mayor  Thomas J. Mays could easily pass for a college graduate student in his early  20s. He also could pass for being a hot-dogging young surfer, the kind who  happily frequent the city's famous beaches.  </P> <P> Mays, in fact, is a former surfer, as he told about about 50 radio, television  and print reporters from throughout the nation at a news conference last week.  </P> <P> "I can remember from my surfing days about how the wind conditions on the ocean  would change," Mays said.  </P> <P> Mays, elected mayor by his fellow City Council members about three months ago,  has been catapulted into national attention by the oil catastrophe that hit his  city on Wednesday. By virtue of his position, he has become the city's chief  spokesman.  </P> <P> He has been low-key in his news conferences and national TV talk-show  interviews. He has not engaged in emotional hand-wringing over the oil spill,  nor has he angrily pointed fingers of blame. His statements have been objective  recitations of facts and figures involving the oil slick and the city's  response. He seldom uses adjectives; he almost never raises his voice.  </P> <P> "That's just my style," the mayor said. "I get more accomplished -- I get  better results -- by getting the facts first and not overreacting."  </P> <P> When asked about his personal sentiments about the spill, Mays also was  low-key. "I feel really bad about it and disappointed it happened. I've surfed  on these beaches. When you live in a city like this, you become emotionally  involved," he said.  </P> <P> Mays, who is married and has two daughters, has a master's degree in political  science from the University of Chicago. He is staff manager in charge of  strategic planning and market analysis for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.  in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "My background is in planning for future needs," he said.  </P> <P> The oil disaster has taught him a major lesson involving future needs with  intergovernmental relations, Mays said.  </P> <P> "It's become very obvious to me that Huntington Beach -- and every city for  that matter -- needs to become a little more involved in national issues," he  said. "Those national issues, such as what has happened here, really do affect  us in our cities." BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

Consumer Products. <FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) FIP Promulgation of Existing CARB Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(a) and (b) control VOC emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from consumer products and antiperspirants and deodorants. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP measures reflect previously adopted CARB limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because CARB has not submitted the measures as SIP revisions, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is promulgating these measures, which are needed for progress and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment in the three FIP areas. These measures would also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the framework for additional future FIP reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As specified under section 183(e)(3) of the CAAA of 1990, EPA is required to study emissions of VOCs from consumer and commercial products and to investigate the development of a national regulation or CTG for selected consumer products. While in all likelihood EPA will be developing a national regulation or CTG for many of the consumer products covered by the proposed FIP regulations, the proposed FIP regulation is not an attempt on EPA's part to meet its 183(e)(3) responsibilities. When and if EPA promulgates a national regulation or CTG for consumer products, EPA will reevaluate its FIP strategy for consumer products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Consumer Products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(a) controls VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer products, with the exception of antiperspirants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deodorants, aerosol paints, and a few other consumer product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories. <FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>  Consumer products are chemical formulations used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in households and institutions and includes products such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detergents, cleaning compounds, polishes, floor finishes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal care products, disinfectants, and automotive specialty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. The proposed regulation limits the VOC content in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products sold, supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use within California. The rule establishes VOC limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with limits previously adopted by CARB. 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statewide emissions from consumer products are estimated at 250  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tpd, 14.2 tpd in Sacramento, 108 tpd in South Coast, and 6 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> While CARB has attempted to regulate most consumer products, some products have not been regulated at this time. These include: lubricants, hand washing detergents, toilet bowl cleaners, disinfectants, paint strippers, laundry detergents, and herbicides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CARB and proposed FIP regulations for consumer products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including antiperspirants and deodorants, cover just over half of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consumer products in the inventory or approximately 130 tpd  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide. The CARB and proposed FIP consumer product rules are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to achieve a VOC emission reduction of over 25 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these reductions will be partially offset by growth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer product sales. The FIP area reductions after growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were estimated at 1.3 tpd (1999) and -1.6 tpd (increase in 2005)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Sacramento, 1.6 tpd in South Coast, 0.2 tpd in Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the FIP consumer product requirements are almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to the CARB rules, the cost of the consumer products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP measure is expected to be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the proposed FIP measure is very similar to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously adopted by CARB, minor differences exist between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP regulation and CARB's regulation. Differences are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to simplify or reduce the administrative burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected manufacturers or to correct rule deficiencies. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP consumer products rule differs from the CARB rule in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it deletes: requirements for certification of charcoal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lighter materials; a variance section; and a federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceability section. Otherwise the rules are virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Antiperspirants and Deodorants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(b) controls VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiperspirants and deodorants. The regulation limits the VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of products sold, supplied, offered for sale, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured for use within California. The rule establishes VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits based on those previously adopted by CARB. The rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes a percent VOC by weight limit for both aerosol and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-aerosol products (e.g., sticks and roll-ons). Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosols make up approximately 25 percent of the market, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for approximately 90 percent of the emissions from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. Statewide emissions and expected reductions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the consumer product totals described under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.4.c.(1).(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the proposed FIP measure is very similar to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously adopted by CARB, minor differences exist between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP regulation and CARB's regulation. Differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the proposed FIP antiperspirant and deodorant rule and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CARB rule include: the compliance date <FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>  for aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products has been extended to January 1, 1999; deletion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative requirements that aerosol product manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to CARB by January, 1994 for a compliance date extension to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999; deletion of the section restricting toxic air contaminants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletion of certain reporting requirements; deletion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance section; and deletion of the federal enforceability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. Otherwise the rules are virtually identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CARB's regulation allows manufacturers to apply for the January 1, 1999 compliance date if certain requirements are met. Based on conversations with CARB, EPA believes that most if not all aerosol product manufacturers have or will apply for the 1999 compliance date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Aerosol Paints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2958 reduces VOC emissions from aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings. Aerosol coatings are self dispensing, pressurized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products containing coating solids (i.e., pigments, resins, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binders) and solvent designed to dispense product ingredients by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of a propellant. The solvent and propellant are typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOCs which make up from 70&hyph;95 percent of the product by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The VOCs are emitted into the atmosphere during the coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery and curing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aerosol spray paints account for approximately 25 tpd of VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions in California. FIP area 1990 emissions were estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1.3 tpd in the Sacramento area, 11.6 tpd in the South Coast,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 0.6 tpd in Ventura. The use of aerosol paints has grown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steadily since the 1950s. Growth peaked in 1977, but in 1978,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the federal government restricted the use of chlorofluorocarbons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as aerosol coating propellants and hydrocarbons were introduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a replacement for the CFC propellants. Since the mid 1980s,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of aerosol paints has continued to steadily grow, with annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales reaching historical highs during the early 1990s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aerosol coatings have previously been regulated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAAQMD (Regulation 8, Rule 49) and the SCAQMD (Rule 1129). CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently assumed authority to regulate the VOC content of aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints. The FIP aerosol paint rule is based on a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation workshopped by CARB on November 10, 1993. The draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is not scheduled for adoption until after EPA's court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordered deadline for the FIP proposal. In addition, current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State law giving CARB the authority to regulate aerosol coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also limits CARB's ability to submit some future-effective limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reductions to EPA as SIP submittals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the need to demonstrate attainment in each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP areas, EPA is proposing an aerosol coating rule which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally consistent with the regulation expected to be adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by CARB in 1994. Minor differences exist between the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal and the CARB draft, however. The proposed FIP aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paint rule does not include sections for a special recognition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label, variances, and federal enforceability. Also, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP measure does not include a provision for a five year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance date extension as found in CARB's draft rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, EPA intends to monitor industries progress and CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999 determination regarding the coating limits. If necessary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider amendments to the FIP aerosol coating rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where appropriate. By adopting the FIP aerosol coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, EPA hopes to avoid having to impose more stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on other VOC sources which would need to compensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the reduction shortfall pending SIP submittal of the adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB regulation. While this proposed FIP aerosol coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation will be published prior to CARB's adoption of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, EPA expects to modify the FIP regulation, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, to be consistent with the final CARB regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP regulation will build upon the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work by the BAAQMD and the SCAQMD and closely parallel CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. The proposed FIP regulation would apply to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person who sells, supplies, offers for sale, applies, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactures for use in California any aerosol coating products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in the proposed regulation. Because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversity of uses and coating types, the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes VOC limits for a variety of product coating types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial 1996 limits are based on limits in the BAAQMD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. A second phase of lower limits goes into effect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Bangkok outpace Nikkei rise SHARE prices were supported by index-linked and small-lot buying on the back of a stronger yen and firm bond prices, and the Nikkei average gained 1.8 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed up 334.00 at the day's high of 18,555.00, remaining in positive territory after opening at the day's low of 18,221.70, and surging in the late afternoon on arbitrage-related buying. Volume fell to 180m shares from 242m. Most large-lot investors remained sidelined due to corporate earnings announcements, and dealers, who have been active recently, refrained from trading in the final week of May trading. Advances led declines by 566 to 389, with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 12 to 1,383.70. The absence of foreign investors due to the long weekend contributed to the low volume. Mr Masami Okuma, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the current spate of personnel changes at Japanese financial institutions and companies was another factor in the low turnover equation. Speculative favourites dominated activity. Tsugami, a medium sized machine tool maker, was the most active issue of the day, advancing Y15 to Y755. Morinaga Milk Industry, rose Y17 to Y852. Bank shares were sought on short covering. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y10 to Y1,800 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank advanced Y10 to Y1,410. Transport companies were sought on brisk earnings results. Kawaski Kisen, the shipping company, rose Y14 to Y395 and Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, gained Y24 to Y665. Nippon Formula Feed, the farm feed maker, gained Y14 to Y575 as it advanced for the third straight day. Investors have been encouraged by the company's plans to start cultivating the endangered blue-fin tuna. Forecasts that the company's pre-tax profits for the current year to March 1993 will rise by 70 per cent also buoyed interest. Chiyoda, the plant engineering company, rose Y80 to Y1,700 on the company's forecast of a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y10bn for the current year to next March. The company is also promoted as a environmental-related stock. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 65.07 to 20,956.48 in volume of 9m shares. Speculative issues gained amid low volume. Ono Pharmaceutical advanced Y70 to Y6,120. Roundup A MONETARY initiative in Hong Kong and political change in Bangkok took these markets, with Manila, ahead faster and more enthusiastically than Tokyo yesterday. HONG KONG shot up to register its second all-time high in three sessions, boosted by Friday's unexpectedly large interest rate cut and a huge influx of overseas funds. The Hang Seng index closed 133.43, or 2.2 per cent higher at 5,993.11, breaking the 6,000 barrier in the morning to hit an intraday high of 6,032.10 soon after the opening, but easing back on profit-taking thereafter. Turnover was also a record, at HKDollars 6.4bn against HKDollars 4.6bn last Friday. BANGKOK responded enthusiastically to the resignation of Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon, the SET index climbing 23.91, or 3.3 per cent to 742.42 in active turnover of Bt5.98bn. After the close, an amendment reducing the military's power in Thailand's parliament won initial approval yesterday as legislators began a democratic overhaul of the constitution. AUSTRALIA traded in a narrow band and in thin turnover, subdued by the UK and US holidays later yesterday. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.4 to 1,684.1 in turnover down from ADollars 214m to ADollars 143m. NEW ZEALAND, similarly, saw the NZSE-40 index up 2.27 to 1,554.04 in turnover down from NZDollars 25.7m to NZDollars 20.9m. Bank of New Zealand was one of only three stocks to exceed volume of 1m shares as it rose 2 cents to 78 cents in 1.1m. units. BNZ is expected to produce improved results after the close today. SEOUL's composite index fell 4.37 to 571.40 in lacklustre trading, weakened by doubts about any government initiative to bail out financially troubled investment trust houses.</p>

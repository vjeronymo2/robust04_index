			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PAN AM BOMBING VICTIMS MOURNED ON 2 CONTINENTS  </P> <P> Relatives of the dead of Pan Am Flight 103 mourned on two continents today for  the 270 people killed exactly a year ago by a bomb that blew the plane out of  the sky and sent flaming wreckage raining onto tiny Lockerbie.  </P> <P> About 150 people -- local residents and relatives of U.S. victims -- gathered  in a rain falling from leaden skies for a service at Lockerbie's Dryfesdale  Cemetery on the first anniversary of the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster.  </P> <P> The plane was blown apart by a terrorist bomb at 30,000 feet, showering the  Scottish border town with liquid fire and pieces of aircraft. All 259 people  aboard the plane -- many of them going home for the holidays -- and 11 people  on the ground were killed in Britain's worst air disaster.  </P> <P> Mourners, their eyes brimming with tears, also marched in New York City in  memory of Flight 103. Hope Asrelsky of Manhattan lost her daughter Rachel, 21,  in the explosion.  </P> <P> "She was coming home for Christmas, and like all of them she didn't make it,"  Asrelsky said.  </P> <P> "Christmas will continue to be a hard time," she said, her voice cracking. "Our  lives have changed, totally changed. We lost an important person. All of us  have. Every last one. These weren't worthless people. They were the very best  people that were taken."  </P> <P> Representatives of Pan American World Airways, which today placed notices  mourning the dead in international newspapers, attended the service at the  Lockerbie cemetery.  </P> <P> But the chairman of the group representing British Lockerbie victims, Jim  Swire, stayed away. Swire, who lost his daughter in the disaster, said he was  too upset to attend.  </P> <P> More mourners and sympathizers were expected to jam Lockerbie streets for an  evening memorial service.  </P> <P> Pan Am held its own services today at London's Heathrow Airport, West Germany's  Frankfurt Airport and New York's Kennedy Airport. The airline flew its flags at  half-staff all day.  </P> <P> The mourners in Manhattan marched through icy winds and a light snow to a vigil  at the Pan Am Building on Park Avenue, clutching red tulips and carrying  placards that read: "When will we take a stand against terrorism?"  </P> <P> "I want to know why this terrorist act that could have been so easily  preventable wasn't preventable," said Mary Ellen DeSantis, whose 25-year-old  nephew was killed.  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon denies SE investigation HARLAND Simon, the troubled controls systems group, yesterday responded angrily to reports that the Stock Exchange was investigating possible misleading statements. Mr David Mahony, chairman, said: 'To the best of my knowledge the Stock Exchange is not investigating the company.' It is understood, however, that the Stock Exchange has been monitoring the situation at Harland Simon. Its shares have plunged from 585p in February following a profits warning, just two months after the interim statement. Last night the shares closed up 1p at 17p. Harland has also come under scrutiny from shareholders for its holding in Perfect Information, a network information company. Earlier this week Harland said that no director or company associated with it had been the beneficial owner of the shares purchased from a Liechtenstein trust. Mr Mahony said he would not comment further on any investigation by the Stock Exchange.</p>

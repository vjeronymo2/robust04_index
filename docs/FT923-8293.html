			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Aspiring to an evening on the old green sofa - Television LIKE the child who asked 'Mummy, what is that man for?' one is occasionally inclined to ask 'What is television for?', especially after three weeks spent on an Umbrian hillside with BBC Radio's World Service as your sole source of news and entertainment. (Incidentally, what possessed the excellent World Service to add that ghastly jazzed-up version of the famous Lillibullero signature tune to the conventional one?) Perhaps those of us who earn a living from writing about television should not admit this, but, to be honest, once you turn your back on the box you do not miss it. Deprive me of print and I suffer withdrawal symptoms. Left without a book I would probably behave as I did when I used to smoke: drive any distance for fresh supplies. But take away the television and I do not even notice its absence. To return to London and the near hysteria concerning television is an odd experience. We are, of course, in the silly season, but can there be any justification for the hectares of newsprint devoted to the 'crisis' of the latest BBC soap opera, Eldorado? Are there really people who regard this as being, in news terms, on a par with events in Bosnia, Russia and Somalia? Like every other soap opera ever launched, Eldorado has not reached the top of the ratings in its opening weeks. It has had a particularly hard time because, in the middle of the summer when ratings are always at their lowest, the Olympic Games have been dominating the figures. Yet you would have to be brave or foolish to bet folding money against the ability of BBC1 Controller Jonathan Powell and series originator Verity Lambert to pull it round within the next six months. No doubt there are faults to be ironed out: as with so much drama on television (and radio) these days, the dialogue is often difficult to hear, the male characters are uniformly contemptible, and so far there may be too few familiar points of reference to allow most viewers to identify. But it could be argued that, far from the general quality being too low, it is actually a bit too high. Offer soap opera at the lowest of low levels and it is instantly recognisable and acceptable to dispiritingly large numbers of people. Go for something rather better, even though set in the same social milieu - Minder, say, another of Lambert's series - and it takes longer to build a dedicated audience willing to put in the slightly greater effort needed for the sake of slower, richer rewards in the end. Gleeful detractors of Eldorado insist that soap must be set amid the working classes or - given the middle class tendencies of the hugely successful Australian soaps - amid tight-knit old fashioned families. But since you can achieve high ratings with serial drama as disparate as Crossroads, Dynasty and The Bill, such 'rules' look like nonsense and there is surely no reason why Eldorado should not be the first smash hit sunny ex-pat Euro-soap. Provided they are given the time, my money is still on Powell and Lambert. So is this what television is for? Having never been able to get hooked on any soap opera, hard as I have tried, my answer is no. In the first week of my return television's purpose seemed to be the relaying of hours and hours of Olympic coverage, something which I expected to enjoy greatly. However, having missed the big build-up and the opening days it was difficult to feel properly involved. Desmond Lynam, seated somewhere in limbo, with intimations of hell in that perpetually flickering flame on the studio wall (dreadfully distracting during interviews) was professional enough. But if, on the first three occasions that you switch on, you happen to see two lots of so-called synchronised swimming and one lot of dancing horses you do begin to wonder whether this is any longer a serious sporting occasion. The closing ceremony suggested it is not. We had a mime company, a display by mounted police, a Spanish ballet, big production numbers from Placido Domingo, Victoria de Los Angeles, Jose Carreras and one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ex-wives, many fireworks, speeches from committee men, a fire-dance with devils repeatedly described by David Coleman as 'traditional', and an introduction to the peculiarly nasty mascot for the next games, presumably to give commercial promoters as much help as possible. Finally, with proceedings running half an hour late, the athletes began to pour out of the stands and into the centre of the arena, whereupon an amplified voice repeatedly demanded that they leave the stage. The competitors were getting in the way of television's big event. It was all a far cry from that unforgettable closing ceremony at the Commonwealth Games a few years ago, when the athletes linked arms in a laughing, dancing parade which ended the occasion on an inspiring note of sporting camaraderie. A massively unwieldy mixture of commercial promotion and overblown spectacle may indeed be what television is for nowadays. Had you switched on without knowing the occasion, you might have guessed it to be a special edition of a game show with royal guests, an international rock concert, or a charity telethon. To look at, they are indistinguishable. Yet it would be dishonest to pretend that, even in midsummer, there is nothing worth watching. One of the things that television is really for, surely, is the programme which you flick to in the vague hope that it may hold your interest for a while only to find yourself utterly engrossed and incapable of switching off. It occurred on Friday with successive programmes: BBC2's Business Matters which investigated Kenichi Ohmae's ideas about the global companies which we are now beginning to see develop, and the third in ITV's Around Whicker's World, an account of an amazing globe-circling package tour, costing Pounds 37,000 a head. Whicker, the total professional, not only conveyed the touchy atmosphere of the whole business but induced helpless laughter with his account of the film crew's disastrous midnight skinny-dipping. This was entertainment of a high order. It happened again on Saturday with BBC2's Video Diaries, a fascinating, agonising account of 25-year-old Edel O'Brien's job as chaperone to a party of Irish teenage ballet dancers, all girls, who were among the first westerners to pay to attend a Russian ballet school. Their treatment, which appears to have been cynical and disgraceful, will have done nothing for Russia's market enterprise ambitions. However, the real interest of the programme was in the meeting between Irish and Russians, whether at the barre or in the food queues. There was yet another example on Sunday in Channel 4's profile of Chad Varah  -The Good Samaritan. It will win no prizes for revolutionary technique: we saw Varah speaking to camera, heard from some of those who were inspired by him to join in starting The Samaritans, and revisited some of the places where he has worked; nothing complicated, nothing difficult. It was simply the character of the man that made the programme, though it probably helps to bring that out if you are as experienced as producer Michael Darlow. So what is television for? To a large extent, it seems to be for filling in the time which modern man has gained by no longer having to chop his firewood, carry his water or tend his animals. All over the world, apparently, peasant farmers aspire to the lifestyle of western industrial nations. There seems little hope of persuading them they are better off on the old green hillside than the old green sofa.</p>

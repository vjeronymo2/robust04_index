			<p>BFN     [Summary from poor reception] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President  Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and chief of the Palestinian  negotiating team to the ongoing Cairo talks, has stressed that  settlement activities are "a major obstacle" to the peace  process. Regarding the failure to achieve withdrawal on the  fixed dates and the frequent stoppage of talks, Dr. Sha'th said  that peace can be achieved step by step, adding that "peace must  result in the repatriation of refugees to their country and the  establishment of a state with Jerusalem as its capital." Sha'th  said that peace must also results in a strong Palestinian  economy, noting that "peace provides Israel with peace and  security" and strengthens its economy without depending on U.S.  support.    The chief Palestinian negotiator also dwelt on the  developments in the peace process. He said: We are in the first  phase of the "four-phase" peace process. In this phase, "which  will last several weeks," withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will  take place and the Palestinian Political Department will enter  Gaza and Jericho. The second phase is the deployment of 4,000  Palestinian police one week after Israeli withdrawal.  Meanwhile, we will be ready to receive economic aid and work on  the infrastructure will be launched. During this period, a  committee will arrange for the return of (?88,000) refugees.  Dr. Sha'th said that the interim phase should not exceed five  years. He added that during the third phase, Israeli forces  will withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and then a force  of 15,000 Palestinians will become in charge of security  affairs. Then, international forces will come in to prepare for  the election of a "Palestinian legislative council." In the  fourth phase, more important issues will be discussed such as  security, settlements, borders, [words indistinct].    Palestinian-Israeli talks resumed in Cairo yesterday with  the  aim of removing the obstacles preventing the implementation of  the self-rule agreement in Gaza and Jericho. Responsible  Palestinian sources said that the two delegations "are drafting  a general agreement." The sources added that the Civilian and  Legal Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later. The  Palestinian sources said that "progress was achieved" on various  issues. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators reached agreement,  during the Taba talks, on setting up the Palestinian radio and  television station. Reports said there are major obstacles to  the work of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees  following the paper presented by Israel at the end of the  previous round of talks with regard to the legal jurisdiction of  the Palestinian self-rule.</p>

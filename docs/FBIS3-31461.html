"Most convoys will return to base tomorrow evening and  should  be moving again on Tuesday," said UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) spokeswoman Sylvana Foa.    The decision would be reviewed Saturday morning, then again  Sunday in light of the latest developments on the NATO  ultimatum, which threatens air strikes if the two warring  factions have not demilitarized Sarajevo by midnight Sunday.    She said it was taken both to avoid any needless risks over  the NATO warning and because some of the UN units based along  corridors used by UNHCR vehicles had been temporarily redeployed  closer to Sarajevo. [passage omitted]    On Friday, aid convoys headed to the cities of Mostar in the  south and Zenica in central Bosnia. Another convoy also set out  for Maglaj, northwest of Sarajevo, which has only seen one  convoy since last October, she said.    On Wednesday, a UNHCR convoy managed to get into the  besieged  Moslem enclave of Srebrenica, where a Canadian UN battalion is  blocked as Bosnian Serbs forces have refused to allow its  replacement by Dutch UN troops.    Foa stressed that the situation in several cities remained  desperate, such as in Mostar, Gorazde and Maglaj where the  everyday life of residents was much more difficult than for  those in Sarajevo.    Most people in these locations "are living like rats in  sewers."    "People could be fed if there were enough movement on the  ground," Foa said, saying the UNHCR would like to see commercial  traffic being resumed.</p>

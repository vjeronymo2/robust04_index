			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Books: More black marks for the human race THE VOICE OF THE EARTH by Theodore Roszak Bantam Press Pounds 17.99, 368 pages IMAGINE, says Theodor Roszak, a motion picture of planet Earth filmed from space over the last million years. In the closing minutes, after long periods of slow change, we see the emergence of human beings and the marks they have made on the planet: canals, cities, roads. In the closing seconds a startling phenomenon occurs. In the Midlands of England black dots appear, 'like strange, smouldering sores' breaking out on the planet's surface. They belch smoke as they spread across the face of Europe and then North America. 'Focusing in more closely,' says Roszak, 'we can see heaps of slag and rubble forming around them like weltering flesh . . . Rivulets of oily waste and noxious fluids issue from these fuming sites, draining into nearby lakes and streams.' This graphic tale is the history of industrialisation as viewed from the heavens. It dramatises the approaching crisis; a pox of pollutants is eating the planet away, spewing out more garbage than the planet can handle. The process, Roszak grimly warns, 'may be nearing its terminal stage'. What has brought us to this pass is a kind of madness - 'ecomadness', so to say - which has resulted from a psychological divorce between people and the planet. Viewed rightly, people and planet form a continuum; planetary and personal needs and well-being are inextricably linked. The link, Roszak argues, is deep. Human beings have an 'ecological unconscious' and in order to save both mankind and Earth a new form of psychological therapy is needed, to heal the rift between people and planet which is leading to today's destructive insanity. This healing is to be effected by rewaking our inherent sense of the mutual dependence between us and our natural environment, thus prompting our sense of ethical responsibility for it. The new form of therapy is 'ecopsychology', and Roszak's book culminates in a description of its principles. Its aim is to recover mankind's oneness with nature. The materials for this remarriage are to be found, Roszak tells us, in ecology, 'ecofeminism', animism, the Gaia hypothesis, the Anthropic Principle, and more. On the back cover US vice president Al Gore waxes enthusiastic over this New Ageism, describing it as 'powerful, compelling, extraordinary'. It is extraordinary, all right; for its sheer catholicity. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink. The message of this book is a simple and unimpeachable one which we have heard many times but which we need to hear constantly. It is that we will destroy the human race, and other species besides, if we do not stop polluting the planet. But Roszak enfolds this manifesto in 600 pages of lost opportunity. There is much new thinking at present about the natural environment and mankind's relationship to it. Some of it is valuable, some of it nonsense. Roszak does not discriminate between the two. He invokes anything that will achieve a rhetorical effect, which means that he undermines his argument by making it depend on too many doubtful and suppositious notions, for example 'mystical-religious-feminist environmentalism', which are more likely to disaffect than persuade readers. The main fault in Roszak's argument is his claim that mankind is killing the planet. This is untrue. Ecological anxiety over the environment is, in truth, a more parochial matter: it is anxiety over our threat to ourselves and some of the world's current flora and fauna. Yes, there is a serious danger to humankind, but the planet itself will survive, and within thousands or millions of years it will regenerate itself, just as it did in the past after collisions with meteors, climate changes, ice ages, and other catastrophes. What Roszak should have explained is why we ought to guard against their own extinction; why a distinctively human presence, with human values, should survive on the planet. But this thought seems not to have occurred to him.</p>

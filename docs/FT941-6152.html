			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Three to be jailed over engineering bribes The long-running series of prosecutions over corruption in the engineering industry is set to end today with the jailing of three businessmen who admitted accepting bribes to help companies win valuable contracts. Mr Robert Wilcox and Mr Colin Read, both former employees of NEI Thompson Kennicott, and Mr Donald Richards, head of Donnar Services, a marketing company, had pleaded guilty to various charges of conspiracy to corrupt over the awarding of 13 contracts. The bulk of these were sub-contracts awarded by NEI which had won contracts for engineering work on the Sizewell B and Drax power stations. Yesterday, at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Valerie Pearlman said she would sentence the three men later today. In releasing them on bail, she warned she would impose immediate prison sentences. The sentencing will end the series of investigations into the use of bribes to undermine the tendering systems for important engineering contracts. This has also included investigations into contracts awarded by BP and Shell for engineering work in the North Sea and to TransMarche Link (TML) for work on the Channel tunnel. The investigations by the Serious Fraud Office have centred on the role of middlemen to bribe company employees into releasing confidential information about bids for tenders. The information was then sold to other bidders who were able to win contracts by underbidding their rivals. Yesterday Mr Stephen Batten QC, for the SFO, said that Mr Richards had set up his own company, Donnar Services, which specialised in marketing and personal services and advised NEI to hire both Mr Read and Mr Wilcox in its project service and purchasing divisions. Both men then passed him inside information about bids made for sub-contracts which he then passed to other bidders. One company which benefited from the information was Scomark Engineering of Burton-on-Trent. Mr Wilcox received Pounds 32,832 for the information and Mr Read Pounds 46,000. Mr Richards was paid a total of Pounds 230,000 by those he acted for. The series of investigations began when the police started inquiries into the activities of one middleman, Mr Jozef Szrajber. Police raided his home and found documents which revealed details of a network of similar 'information-brokers' operating throughout the industry. Of 13 individuals eventually prosecuted, 10 were convicted, including Mr Szrajber. His records also enabled police to uncover similar corruption in the awarding of Shell contracts. Further inquiries led police to investigate companies such as Scomark. These eventually led to prosecutions of individuals linked with TML and NEI.</p>

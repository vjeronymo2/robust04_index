			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: A worrying analysis Sir, Mr Bijan-Daniel Khezri's analysis of the Swiss debate about European integration (Letters, December 9) is somewhat worrying. He asserts that 'Europe's political class and business leaders have failed to make the . . . notion of subsidiarity and supranationality accessible to the public . . .' Faced with this problem, a conventional liberal might opt for a campaign of public education. According to Mr Khezri, however, this would be to no avail since the issues at hand 'simply surpass the comprehensive capabilities of the average masses'. To suggest the Swiss rejected the EEA because they did not understand what it meant is patronising. Further, to suggest that people should not be asked for their opinion because they cannot understand what is at issue smacks of elitism (one shudders at the thought of students of Etudes Internationales using terms such as 'the average masses'). It is time we took democracy a little bit more seriously. Alain Deckers, student, PREST, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PI</p>

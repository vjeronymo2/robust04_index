			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Vostokov] </F>   [Text] Khabarovsk May 18 TASS -- The 12-day meeting of the  joint Russo-Chinese commission for the demarcation of the border  was rounded off here by the signing of a joint protocol.    "We did not tackle any territorial disputes during our  negotiations, but merely fixed the borderline in keeping with  earlier signed Russo-Chinese treaties," ITAR-TASS was told by  Genrikh Kiriyev, roving ambassador and leader of the Russian  delegation. "The adopted joint protocol reflects many problems  linked with demarcation. We have studied very carefully the  depth of border rivers. Not all the problems have been solved  and the negotiations will be continued at the next session of  the joint commission."    Kiriyev noted during a press conference here that he did not  deem it possible to revise separate articles of the agreement  concluded with the People's Republic of China in 1991 on the  eastern stretch of the Russo-Chinese border, because their  revision was tantamount to the revision of all the agreement. A  denunciation of the agreement is also out of the question," he  stated.    Asked about the future of the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and  Tarabarov Islands near Khabarovsk, Kiriyev stressed: "We insist  firmly and persistently that these islands belong to Russia.  The population of the Amur region can rest assured that nobody  wants to give up the islands."    The Russian delegation included representatives from the  Foreign Ministry, the chief command of the Federal Borderguard  Service, the Defence Ministry, and heads of the governing bodies  of the border territories and regions of the Russian Far East.</p>

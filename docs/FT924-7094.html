			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / 'Time ripe' for farm trade deal: Dunkel says US and EC must prepare for painful compromises MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, insisted yesterday that the time had come for the US and the European Community to settle the farm trade dispute, saying agreement would involve painful compromises. Settlement 'will mean we will not get everything we want,' he warned. The director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was also emphatic, after meetings with EC trade negotiators, that he detected a new determination to reach agreement when talks resume in Washington tonight: 'I have found two commissioners in Brussels who are convinced they are coming to Washington this week to settle. I have found the same mood here,' he said in the US capital. As he left Brussels for Washington, Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, said: 'I'm there to do business and I hope they are there to do the same. The world wants it and the world needs it.' US officials were more cautious on the eve of the first US-EC talks since the collapse of farm trade negotiations in Chicago two weeks ago. Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, said: 'We feel that we are clearly at the outer limit of what we can do.' The dispute, which focused on EC oilseed subsidies as well as demands for reform of the EC farm subsidy regime, has brought the two sides to the brink of trade war, and put in jeopardy six years of negotiations aimed at liberalising international trade. In the negotiations, the US will, above all, press for the EC to provide methods of enforcing the farm production levels that are eventually agreed. So far, the EC has said that it cannot offer any specific enforcement mechanisms. The French farm lobby yesterday displayed mounting concern about an imminent Gatt agreement on agriculture. It pressed the French government to veto any EC deal on US terms. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, indicated that a veto by Paris was unlikely. He appeared to state France's price for a Gatt deal: 'a review and renegotiation' of last May's EC agricultural reform 'to take account of French farmers' legitimate interests.' Mr MacSharry insisted any Gatt deal would be compatible with the new Common Agriculture Policy. 'I have the most up-to-date statistics available to the Community,' he said. 'We are working within the impact of the CAP,' he added, 'and I'm blue in the face with saying it. Maybe people should start believing the facts.' While US officials believe Mr MacSharry may be able to resume talks after two weeks of EC upheaval without fear of his position being undermined, they are far from confident that bottom-line positions can be reconciled. US negotiators insisted they had had no contact with EC counterparts since the collapse of talks in Chicago, and had no knowledge of whether the EC was bringing any proposals that would enable a settlement.

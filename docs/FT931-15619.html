			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: An independent bank governor would avoid stop-go policies Sir, Mr Persaud (Letters, January 7) dismisses the argument for central bank independence as 'populist'. The question is whether the stability of the currency is one of the 'framework' or 'constitutional' issues which should be removed from the direct control of the executive, like the administration of justice. Why not a comparable limitation of 'democratic accountability' in fiscal policy? There are precedents for imposing constraints on governments' ability to finance expenditure by borrowing or printing money. The West German constitution originally contained a provision that the federal government should not run a deficit on current, as against capital, expenditure. It was - with hindsight probably unwisely - repealed in the interests of 'Keynesianism'. There are admittedly difficulties of definition involved, but many countries would have benefited from such a constraint on 'democratic accountability'.

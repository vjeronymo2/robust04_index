			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1 celebrates 40 years of weather forecasting in Sunny Intervals (8.30). They surely won't be able to gloss over Michael Fish's notorious dismissal of the idea that Britain was about to be hit by hurricane force winds .. C4's new series Undercover Britain (9.00) which promises to bring us 'camera-in-the-bag exposes' begins with an investigation of slavery. It is, we are assured, alive 'and well', whatever that means, and living in London. Sima Rey takes a job as a domestic servant to replace a girl who ran away from the job complaining that she was treated like a dog. 40 Minutes takes another look at anorexia and bulimia, this time in a sufferer who was 'brutalised by her mother and sexually abused by her father' (9.50 BBC2). ITV's new weekly documentary, Network First, considers 'Women Who Kill': five women who suffered abuse at the hands of their partners and killed them (10.40). BBC1 begins a series which sounds from its title as though it may be more a part of the problem than the answer: Living With The Enemy about parents and teenage children (10.20). What a jolly evening.</p>

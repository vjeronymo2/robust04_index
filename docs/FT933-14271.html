			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ouzo moves to the back shelf Scotch has become the national drink of Greece, outselling the native ouzo by 40 per cent. A country of only 3m households and with a struggling economy, it imported 2.4m cases of mainly bottled-in-Scotland brands, worth Pounds 78m, last year. Since 1988, Greece has increased import volumes by 65 per cent and climbed from 10th to fourth place in the list of the industry's overseas markets. Growth was stimulated by reductions in the tax on imported spirits in 1987. After further cuts last year, Greece now has one of the lowest spirits taxes in Europe - close to a fifth of the UK rate. Lower prices and increased marketing encouraged a shift in consumer habits, particularly among young people who began to desert the tavernas for modern night clubs and bars. In these clubs Scotch has become the favourite tipple, selling for up to Pounds 60 a bottle, mixed in tall glasses with ice and water or ice and cola. The opportunity has been seized and exploited most successfully by United Distillers (UD), the Guinness spirits division. The old Distillers Company (DCL), taken over by Guinness in 1986, was weakly placed in the Greek market. Andrew Morgan, UD's regional director for southern Europe, recalls: 'DCL had 13 brands of Scotch on the market, handled by seven different distributors. The brands competed against each other as well as against those of our rivals.' Cutty Sark, owned by Berry Bros and Rudd, and Ballantine's from Allied-Lyons were the market leaders. UD's Johnnie Walker Red Label was a poor third; Dewar's trailed further behind. Morgan was sent to Greece to sort out the situation. 'The plan was to exert more clout by segmenting the portfolio and repositioning the brands, to develop our own local resources and recover profit margins,' he says. The portfolio was split into complementary halves: one focused on Dewar's, Bell's and Dimple; the other on Johnnie Walker Red Label and Black Label. It was decided to position Dewar's as the stylish drink for young people frequenting bouzouki clubs and bars. Volume sales were small, but the brand appealed to the young because of its market leadership in the US and because it was not associated with older drinkers in Greece. A joint venture, UD Kanellakis, was formed with the Greek distributor, Nektar, to handle the brand, and a portfolio which also included Bell's and Dimple, number two to Seagram's Chivas Regal in the deluxe sector, Rebel Yell bourbon and Tanqueray gin. UD retained strategic marketing control but used the Nektar sales force. The Johnnie Walker brands were targeted on the take-home trade and modern night clubs; given a slightly older, less brash, advertising image than Dewar's, designed to appeal to the Greek fondness a chat with friends over a drink. The take-home trade, with premium Scotch such as Red Label priced at about Pounds 7 and deluxe Black Label at twice that price, is growing fast. Last year it accounted for 55 per cent of total whisky sales compared with 30 per cent in 1988. To handle these brands - together with Gordon's, UD's best-selling gin - a joint venture was formed with Boutari, the country's leading wine producer and distributor. Constantine Boutari has transformed the country's wine industry, improving quality and developing new brands. As growth slowed, however, the group had been seeking opportunities to enter other drinks sectors. The partnership - recently formalised in the creation of UD Boutari and renewed for 20 years - provided the strategic opening it needed. Boutari now also imports and distributes Guinness stout and Carlsberg lager, as well as producing Kronenbourg and Henninger beers under licence. But the joint venture company, with Ian Meakins, a former member of UD's European marketing team as managing director, concentrates on the marketing and sales of UD's spirits and Boutari's wines. Profits go to the brand owners and costs are shared on a formula based on volume sales. It employs 80 salesmen in the clubs and bars, and supports its advertising with a stream of promotions. The two joint ventures have rapidly built UD's strength in the market. Its brands have grown faster than those of its rivals. In five years, UD Boutari has tripled sales of Johnnie Walker Red and made it market leader. UD Kanellakis has increased Dewar's sales tenfold. In the process, UD has more than doubled the trading profits of its operations in Greece.</p>

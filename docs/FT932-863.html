			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Rosyth fears almost 1,000 jobs will be lost MANAGERS at the Rosyth dockyard believe the number of jobs to be lost over its failure to win the Trident refitting contract may be more than double the 450 stated by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, the company that runs the yard, said it was likely that nearly 1,000 jobs would be lost there. The yard employs 3,700 people. The dockyard, however, said it was too early to give an exact figure for the number of jobs that would go. Workers and management at Rosyth reacted angrily to a statement by Mr Mike Leece, managing director of Devonport Management in which he said Devonport would be interested in taking over the Rosyth yard if the government put it on offer. He said he thought Devonport Management could make a better job of running Rosyth than Babcock Thorn. Babcock Thorn said: 'Mr Leece has totally failed to understand the process we have been going through for the past six months. The Ministry of Defence does not want one company to have a monopoly. We have every intention of staying at Rosyth.' While awarding the Trident contract to Devonport, Mr Rifkind announced that Rosyth would be allocated refitting work on 18 big warships. These would include two aircraft carriers, one of which would be Ark Royal, and eight Type 42 destroyers. The remaining 50 per cent of the surface-fleet refit work would be open to competitive tender. The size of the award of surface-ship work to Rosyth has dismayed private-sector shipyards which now see fewer opportunities to bid for refitting work. Sir Robert Easton, chairman of Yarrow, the GEC-owned shipyard in Glasgow, yesterday expressed his disappointment at the size of the cake now likely to be on offer. But others said Scotland would benefit in another way from Thursday's decision. Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, owns 30 per cent of Devonport Management and would be expected to work on refitting the pumps of Trident submarines at its plant in Glasgow. While Mr Smith called for a period of stability for the yard after the intense lobbying of the past few months, politicians and businessmen in Fife demanded that the government set up an independent review of Thursday's decision to award the Trident contract to Devonport. Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife Central, said the government had to realise that it had a fight on its hands. Mr McLeish, a shadow Scottish Office minister, said any review should consider Rosyth's last-minute proposal to cut the cost of refitting Trident at Rosyth by Pounds 70m by using an emergency dock. That submission was rejected by Mr Rifkind, who described it as 'quite unreasonable'. Scottish sources close to the dockyard battle believe the last-minute offer put extra pressure on the government and considerably increased the amount of surface-ship repair work which the Scottish dockyard has been awarded. It is understood that Rosyth's surface-ship allocation was completed in telephone calls between the Ministry of Defence and the dockyard as late as Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, and may even have been doubled in that period. Before yesterday's announcement, some of those campaigning to save Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, had expressed concern that a political carve-up of Navy work between Devonport and Rosyth could do further damage to Tyneside's marine industry by disadvantaging ship repairer A&amp;P Appledore. But yesterday A&amp;P Appledore, which also has repair yards at Falmouth in and Southampton, said Thursday's announcement did not affect the company. That was because Rosyth had been given warship, rather than support vessel, work.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Clash of Titans draws the crowds Baroness Thatcher's appear-ance before the Scott inquiry was billed as a constitutional battle of the Titans. In the blue corner, immaculately turned out in a dark green tailored suit and double rope of pearls, was the first British ex-premier to appear before a public judicial inquiry. Facing her, in the grey corner, were Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, wearing a loud houndstooth black and white check jacket, and Lord Justice Scott, a picture of judicial gravitas in half glasses and double breasted suit. Their goal was to wrestle from her whether sales of military equipment by UK companies to Iraq during the late 1980s, in apparent contravention of stated government policy, were made with or without her knowledge and approval. The arena was Number 1 Buckingham Gate, once a seedy hotel, now refurbished as a slightly vulgar government office, with brass chandeliers and wood panelling. For the first time since the inquiry began six months ago, it was packed. Most of the crowd were journalists, who had queued since 7.30am to secure places. When the contest began at 10am, Lady Thatcher appeared tired and defensive. Ms Baxendale - whom Lady Thatcher insisted on calling 'Miss' in a slightly deprecating tone - was enthusiastic and rigorously analytical - qualities which have terrified the officials and ministers she has already examined. But appearances were deceptive. Lady Thatcher had carefully studied the 76 pages of questions the judge sent her a month ago. She parried every attack and on one occasion congratulated herself for providing a convincing reply to the one question she had not 'spotted' in advance. Her overall strategy was simple. The most hands-on prime minister in recent history argued that she never got involved in the detailed application of the arms sales policy. Lord Scott looked at her quizzically when she repeatedly said that she concerned herself with 'policy-making', never with 'detailed administration'. But he had no evidence to the contrary. In six-and-a-half hours of cross-examination, only five substantive questions were put, which can be summarised as follows: Baxendale: Why was there a gap of a year between the formulation of a new policy banning sales of arms to both Iran and Iraq in late 1984 and its disclosure to parliament in October 1985? Thatcher: Don't know. Baxendale: Should parliament have been told earlier? Thatcher: That might have been preferable because it would have saved me a lot of this bother. Baxendale: After the Gulf war ended, official policy appears to have been changed so that sales of some military equipment to Iraq was now permitted. Is that so and why was parliament told that the 1985 policy was still being followed? Thatcher: On the one hand, I was not told of a change of policy. On the other, it seems to me - from my subsequent examination of government documents - that although there may appear to have been a change in policy, in fact there was a change in circumstances leading to a 'modicum of flexibility' in the implementation of the existing policy. Baxendale: Were you informed about sales of machine tools, which have military applications, by the engineering company Matrix Churchill? Thatcher: No. Baxendale: Why were you and other ministers unaware of information gathered by the intelligence services that the engineering company Matrix Churchill was selling to Iraq equipment with a military use? Thatcher: The system did not work properly. Baxendale: Were you aware of warnings from the intelligence services that sales of military equipment to Jordan were being diverted to Iraq? Thatcher: No. By four o'clock Ms Baxendale was looking tired and had lost her customary eloquence. Lady Thatcher was positively buoyant. When told there was to be a short break, she looked annoyed. 'I do hope we go on till we finish,' she challenged. Ms Baxendale may have met her match.</p>

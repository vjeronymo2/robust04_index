			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lebanese Forces [LF] Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' has  emphasized that the media campaign against the LF is the biggest  falsification in the entire history of Lebanon. What is  assuring in this falsification process, he said, is that dubious  sources are creating this impression about the LF while the  judiciary has not yet spoken. Furthermore, the judiciary  sources that have been contacted asserted that all newspaper  reports have nothing to do with the investigations. He rejected  all detailed reports carried by newspapers and considered them  totally untrue. He said: We will give 24-hour notice, after  which we will be forced to resort to the normal legal measures  against any mass media report harming the reputation of the LF.  We will be compelled to resort to this method because the  process took on the characteristics of defamation and slander  and held the LF responsible for the consequences of acts with  which the forces have nothing to do, neither closely nor  distantly.    In an interview with AL-DIYAR newspaper today, Ja'ja' said:  What is happening is that we are being subjected to a political  harassment campaign. He noted that every party or any other  political faction in Lebanon are subjected to the same campaign  and that this is the whole story.    On the latest developments in Ghidras [where LF headquarters  and Ja'ja's residence are situated], the LF commander said the  atmosphere has not changed but the situation gets harder every  now and then because the security measures taken around the LF  headquarters in Ghidras have been stepped up to the point that  all people coming to Ghidras are subjected to thorough  inspection.    He very strongly urged the Lebanese judiciary and the  state's  political and military agencies to uncover all the circumstances  and details of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing and insisted  that the trial of the criminals involved in this tragedy be  public and open to all people and mass media. He pointed out  that politics should not intervene in legal issues and arrest  suspects. He noted that the security agencies say they have  arrested the perpetrators of the massacre and thus they will  have performed their duty in the best possible way. He said  these agencies are supposed to have criminal evidence that  should be turned to the judiciary which, in turn, will initiate  a trial. He stressed that the investigations and their  publication are the responsibility of the judicial authorities,  not the duty of dubious sources. Noting that no LF personnel  are in detention, he said no LF personnel are held in custody,  at least not at present, and that what is happening is false  accusation. The LF, he said, are subjected to the largest  premeditated campaign of injustice and defamation in their  history to contain the LF both politically and at the popular  level but the results will surely be counterproductive. He said  such methods will lead nowhere and noted that the LF are the  victims of a process aimed at curbing political and media  freedoms in the country.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEDGECOCK CASE ENDS WITH COMPROMISE  </P> <P> After two trials, more than 6 1/2 years of litigation and what he termed "a  lifetime or two . . . on an emotional roller coaster," former Mayor Roger  Hedgecock's political corruption case ended abruptly Thursday with Hedgecock  accepting his conviction on a single felony in return for no jail sentence and  no retrial.  </P> <P> In a carefully worded settlement crafted to permit face-saving on both sides,  Hedgecock agreed not to appeal a felony conspiracy count stemming from illegal  campaign contributions to his 1983 mayoral race. However, under terms  negotiated with the San Diego County district attorney's office, that count  will be reduced to a misdemeanor early next year.  </P> <P> Under the agreement signed before Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez,  Hedgecock will file for outright dismissal of the charge after his three-year  probation period ends in about six weeks. In addition to not contesting that  request, prosecutors also agreed not to retry Hedgecock on 12 felony perjury  counts that he had been convicted of in 1985 but which were overturned by the  state Supreme Court last summer.  </P> <P> Hedgecock also agreed to pay a $5,000 fine -- five times higher than his  original fine -- and accepted a one-day jail sentence, which he will not have  to serve because of one day's credit being granted for his initial booking.  </P> <P> Although both sides expressed satisfaction with Thursday's settlement,  Hedgecock appeared to gain more from the unexpectedly quick finale to a case  that he has often described as "the country's longest-running political soap  opera." Until the agreement was reached, the case appeared headed for another  protracted round of legal maneuvering next week, when Hedgecock's motion for a  new trial -- a request based on allegations that a court bailiff tampered with  his jury during its deliberations -- was scheduled to be heard.  </P> <P> The settlement not only wiped out the one-year jail sentence to which Hedgecock  had been sentenced after his October, 1985, conviction on 13 felony conspiracy  and perjury counts, but also will ultimately remove the felony charge that  could have cost him his law license and barred him from running for public  office.  </P> <P> Though Hedgecock, now a popular radio talk-show host, reiterated Thursday that  he does not intend to either practice law or resume his public career, the  former mayor stressed that the settlement will "finally clear the slate . . .  and let me move on."  </P> <P> Describing himself as having "mixed emotions" about the outcome, Hedgecock said  that, although he is delighted to have the case behind him, he also was  disappointed over not being vindicated either by being found innocent or via  prosecutors' dismissal of the charges.  </P> <P> "Justice was not done in this case, because I did not commit these crimes,"  Hedgecock said outside the courtroom. "As I said to the judge, I may have to  accept some consequences here to compromise and put this behind us. But I did  not commit these crimes, and I think that history will so judge."  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, meanwhile, emphasized that the settlement enabled  prosecutors to "salvage a conviction, a felony conviction . . . which is  exceedingly important. It means that the acts upon which we based our  prosecution have been confirmed."  </P> <P> During the brief court proceeding, Rodriguez, referring to the lengthy,  circuitous route the case has taken since prosecutors began investigating  Hedgecock in early 1984, characterized the settlement as being fair "both to  the parties . . . and the public."  </P> <P> "It's time to end this case, put this case to rest here today," Rodriguez said.  "To further continue with this case, we will have nothing but extensive and  expensive criminal proceedings."  </P> <P> Thursday's settlement will have no direct effect on a civil lawsuit filed  against Hedgecock by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. That  lawsuit, which stemmed from many of the same charges at issue in Hedgecock's  two felony trials, had been postponed pending resolution of Hedgecock's  criminal case. However, Hedgecock said late Thursday that the case may "simply  dry up and blow away" because a five-year statute of limitations has expired.  </P> <P> After his first criminal case ended in a mistrial in February, 1985, Hedgecock  was found guilty in his second trial eight months later of conspiring with two  former principals of the now-defunct La Jolla investment firm of J. David &amp;  Co. to funnel more than $350,000 in illegal donations to his 1983 mayoral  campaign. The perjury counts alleged that Hedgecock intentionally falsified  campaign and personal financial disclosure statements to conceal that aid.  </P> <P> Days after Hedgecock's conviction, however, two jurors signed sworn affidavits  alleging that a court bailiff had improperly discussed the case and their  deliberations while they were sequestered in a local hotel. According to the  two jurors -- whose claims were contradicted in part by statements from the 10  other jurors -- the bailiff helped jurors define the legal term reasonable  doubt, pressured them to reach a verdict quickly by reminding them of the cost  of the hotel where they were staying and provided jurors with alcoholic  beverages after their daily deliberations.  </P> <P> In overturning all 12 perjury counts and setting aside the remaining conspiracy  charge pending a hearing on the jury-tampering allegations, the state Supreme  Court ruled that then-Superior Court Judge William L. Todd Jr. erred by ruling  that omissions on Hedgecock's financial statements were sufficient -- or, in  legal jargon, "material" enough -- to support the charges.  </P> <P> Todd also made a mistake, the high court ruled, by not allowing a full-blown  hearing on the jury-tampering charges, deciding the issue solely on the basis  of the jurors' and bailiffs' written affidavits and the competing attorneys'  arguments.  </P> <P> Now a justice on the 4th District Court of Appeal, Todd was recently asked to  conduct the new trial hearing by Presiding Superior Court Judge Judith  McConnell. Because Todd's own conduct and that of his bailiff were central  issues in that proceeding, Hedgecock attorney Charles Sevilla questioned his  ability to be impartial.  </P> <P> Todd's assignment to the case, Hedgecock said, convinced him anew that he  "could not get a fair trial in San Diego" -- a factor that prompted his  attorney to begin settlement talks with prosecutors several weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It became clear to me that the district attorney was not going to leave well  enough alone," Hedgecock said. "He was determined to continue retrying this as  many times as it took to try to nail me with something. After six years . . . I  think we've made our point, and it was time to end this."  </P> <P> Beyond trying to preserve -- albeit temporarily -- a felony conviction, Miller  said that prosecutors' incentive in trying to reach a settlement lay primarily  in ending a case "that's beginning to get barnacles on it."  </P> <P> "The time had come for a compromise settlement, which it was," Miller said.  </P> <P> Although the Hedgecock case riveted public attention here throughout the  mid-1980s, the passage of time, coupled with the repeated earlier failures to  resolve it, caused interest in it to wane except among those whose lives were  most directly touched by the compelling legal and political drama.  </P> <P> "I think the only people who are still interested are those who were there,"  said lawyer Michael McDade, Hedgecock's former City Hall chief of staff and a  key witness in both trials. "There is so much in-migration in San Diego that,  when the subject comes up, people say, 'Who's Hedgecock? What's this all  about.' A lot of people just don't remember it. I wonder what we would have  testified to at another trial, it's been so long. It's just a relief to have it  all finished."  </P> <P> His own "exhausted relief . . . and gratification" with Thursday's court  developments notwithstanding, Hedgecock remained firm in his belief that the  prosecution had been from the first a vindictive political act.  </P> <P> "The district attorney has used the criminal justice system in this case to  prosecute a political opponent and to continue that prosecution until that  political opponent was out of politics," Hedgecock said. "He did what he set  out to do."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Alan Abrahamson and Armando Acuna contributed to this  report.  </P> <P> THE MAJOR PLAYERS, A41  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF THE LEGAL WOES OF FORMER MAYOR  </P> <P> ROGER HEDGECOCK  </P> <P> Feb. 9, 1984: The J.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xia Wensi (1115 2429 1835): "Peasant Discontent </F> Sparks Riots"]    [Excerpts] China today has five principal contradictions,  so says the Sociology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences [CASS] in its recent analysis of the social situation  in China and forecasting of the year to come.    First, central-local relations are being tested across the  board. Second, the war against corruption is facing a serious  test. Third, the gaps in regional development are widening, as  are income disparities between the different strata, which has a  substantial impact on the public psychology. Fourth, there is  the possibility of serious sudden incidents breaking out in some  localities. Fifth, law and order is in serious trouble.    These five major contradictions, which cause the CPC  authorities much anxiety, are the very factors that may touch  off unrest in China today. They also epitomize what is wrong  with Chinese society at the moment.    As far as central-local relations are concerned, the most  likely trouble spot, if the current situation is any guide, is  Muslim areas in the northwest. Shaken by riots by the Hui  nationality in Qinghai in the fall of 1993, Zhongnanhai is now  very nervous about the situation in the northeast. Its  instruction to the local governments is that they absolutely  must do a good job in nationalities work and prevent anybody  from stirring up trouble in the name of religion. The government  is scrutinizing what is being said in the press in the Hui areas  most closely, fearful that the slightest linguistic indiscretion  would again anger the Muslims and ignite a disaster similar to  the Qinghai riots.    Dominated by the Han nationality, many people believe, China  does not face the prospect of dissolution in the manner of the  Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Yet Chinese history is replete with  examples of instant disintegration after the demise of a  centralized imperial authority. Besides, the CPC regime today is  very similar to the centralized monarchies in Chinese history.  Will the Chinese mainland remain unified as central power wanes  and CPC authoritarianism further declines after Deng Xiaoping's  death? Hard to say right now.    The takeoff of the Chinese economy has brought prosperity,  but prosperity is not exactly the same thing as stability.  Prosperity itself has spawned new social problems such as  corruption and the unequal distribution of wealth, all breeding  grounds of social unrest. The more prosperous the economy, the  bigger the problems. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone is the  nation's corruption and degeneration capital. The officialdom in  Shenzhen, the ordinary people say, is a hotbed of corruption;  there is not a single cadre in the city who is not on the take.  Measured by the charges against the several economic criminals  whom the CPC has openly executed by shooting, two-thirds of the  members of the CPC municipal committee should also be killed by  the firing squad. Then there are the relatives of the cadres and  officials who speculate in land and stock, making a killing  thanks to their power and influence. The common people see  everything and feel bitter at heart. There is a groundswell of  resentment.    In the booming coastal areas, individual-household upstarts  and bureaucratic capitalists wallow in dissipation and luxury,  their way of life consisting of the so-called "one big and three  smalls," that is, "big brother" and "minor wife, small car, and  small villa." Side by side with the nouveau riches, however, are  tens of thousands of low-paid workers from the provinces in the  interior, toiling in factories and experiencing the brutality of  what Marx called capitalist primitive accumulation. After seeing  how they lived, a Beijing reporter said it was as tragic as the  lot of the "indentured laborers" in Shanghai in the 1930's as  portrayed by veteran writer Xia Yan [1115 5888].    After witnessing the shocking polarization between the rich  and the poor in the coastal areas, he could not help but sigh  with feeling, saying he would not be surprised if there occurred  another round of unrest similar to the Shenzhen stock market  riots.    Owing th the erosion of social values and the gradual  decline  of the authoritativeness of the CPC dictatorship, the mainland  society is showing signs of getting out of control. Law and  order on the mainland is in worse shape today than in 1949 when  the KMT was in power. Serious crimes such as car theft, highway  and river robbery, armed robbery, drug-trafficking,  prostitution, abduction, and kidnapping have been on the rise  relentlessly.    There were over 70 bank robberies in broad daylight on the  mainland in the first 11 months of 1993 and 11 bank employees  were killed. Most of the bank robbers carried firearms. A Taiwan  businessman who traveled back and forth between two cities  regularly reported witnessing three major hold-ups by gangs  within 5 days. He said he had travelled on business to countries  like the Philippines and India, nations notorious for their  lawlessness, but had never before seen anything this  frightening. He said, "In terms of law and order, the mainland  is about even with the black neighborhoods of New York City."    According to the internal documents of the Ministry of  Public  Security, law and order has broken down in many border areas and  villages and at numerous locations along the highways and  railways, where serious crimes like smuggling, prostitution,  drug-trafficking, and gang robberies are commonplace.    Mainland sociologists predict that social law and order will  continue to deteriorate as the urban unemployment rate keeps  climbing because of economic reform and as haphazard rural  migration worsens by the day.    Inadvertently or otherwise, the Sociology Institute of CASS  has omitted the most serious problem in China today, namely  agriculture.    The most dangerous thing today, both the mainlanders and  people overseas say, is peasants making trouble. [passage  omitted]    In early 1993 peasants in Renshou County, Sichuan Province,  staged anti-tax riots lasting five months. This time around the  CPC regime did not despatch tanks and AK-47 rifles to put down  the uprising, which was how it dealt with the students on  Tiananmen Square. Not only did it stress appeasement, but it  even released Zhang Dean [1728 1795 1344] and Xiang Wenqing  [0686 2429 5237], two peasant leaders who headed the tax  protest, but was also forced to take practical measures to ease  the heavy burden on peasants in the county.    It has been said that this was the first time in 40 years  that the CPC buckled under popular resistance.    It had no other choice, people in the know say. Already the  flames of the peasant movement in Renshou County and neighboring  areas were spreading. During the disturbances, 17 peasants'  associations sprang up spontaneously in Renshou County  overnight. Trouble was also brewing in the surrounding counties.  Any forcible suppression would have ignited a mass uprising  throughout the province. [passage omitted]    The peasant riots in Renshou County should not have taken  the  CPC by surprise. By the time Deng Xiaoping toured southern China  in 1992, fueling a second bout of "economic reform fever," the  seriousness of China's agricultural crisis was quite pronounced.    In the beginning, reform--fixing farm output quotas for each  household--generated a measure of short-term prosperity in  Chinese agriculture. But this was followed by stagnation and  decline. Reformers were wholly preoccupied with industry and  investment in agriculture began a steady decline. Investments in  capital construction in agriculture in 1992 accounted for a mere  3 percent of all fixed assets investments in the whole country,  a historic low. Because of inflation, agricultural production  costs also rose continuously, increasing the burden on peasants  and causing bankruptcies in agriculture, a bad omen. Reports say  that villagers in Sichuan Province, long known as the land of  milk and honey, were so overwhelmed by the burden that they went  on strike. Peasants in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, pulled  up rice seedlings that they had planted painstakingly, declaring  that never again would they grow crops. Or turn over grain to  the state.    But the peasants' woes are not limited to these. Caught in a  cash squeeze, the Chinese Government in recent years has been  shifting its fiscal difficulty to the most impoverished members  of Chinese society: the peasantry. Consequently, peasants turn  over grain to the state only to be given IOU's. When the  children of peasants who have found jobs elsewhere remit money  home, the post office refuses to cash them, issuing "green  slips" instead. Furthermore, peasants are slapped with all sorts  of the most outrageous and exorbitant taxes and levies. Mainland  newspapers frequently carry reports of peasants being driven to  commit suicide by drowning or hanging, an entire family ruined  in the process.    Chinese peasants have gotten to the point where they could  no  longer continue living.    In many localities peasants gang up with one another and  turn  to banditry, robbing trains and cars and stealing public  installations mostly just to survive; one can no longer feed and  clothe one's family doing legal work alone. There is a village  in Sichuan inhabited by poor peasants. Driven by poverty, the  peasants dug some big holes on the highway, making it impassable  by car. Only when the drivers paid a toll did they fill up the  holes and let the cars go through.    Leaders of the CPC, including Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046],  inspected the countryside in 1992. What they saw made them  tremble with fear and gave them many a sleepless night.  Reportedly they asked the peasants, "What do you need?" Answer:  "Chen Sheng [7115 0524] and Wu Guang [0702 1639]." Asked what  they would like to do, the peasants said, "Sweep Li Zicheng's  [2621 5261 2052] grave."    Peasant riots in Renshou County may very well be the  harbinger of a more extensive peasant uprising in the future.  Experts on the Chinese peasantry note that sporadic peasant  disturbances are now springing up all over China. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / A new broom: The challenges for Ireland's Mr Albert Reynolds Mr Albert Reynolds, sworn in today as Ireland's prime minister, inherits a country saddled with economic and social problems, which have gone unresolved under a divided political leadership for the past decade. Yet he has the opportunity to unify his Fianna Fail party and to revive hopes that, in 1994, it will win its first parliamentary majority since 1979. Mr Reynolds assumes office at a time when political solutions to the problems of Northern Ireland have entered a vacuum. However, his cordial working relationship with UK prime minister Mr John Major, another pragmatist, may provide scope for new initiatives in the troubled province. The challenges are enormous. Mr Reynolds inherits record unemployment of 20.3 per cent, twice the European Community average, and accumulated public sector borrowings of IPounds 25.4bn (Pounds 23.6bn), or 107 per cent of gross national product. While the debt level has been reduced since 1988, it is still one of the highest in the EC. The challenge of harmonising the Irish economy with its European partners in the run-up to monetary union requires that the debt/GNP ratio must be steadily reduced, and the government has set itself a target of 100 per cent of GNP within two years. Mr Reynolds's party and the country are also looking to him to clean up the image of pork-barrel politics which for many Irish people had become the hallmark of government in the era of the former prime minister, Mr Charles Haughey. In five general elections during the 1980s, Mr Haughey failed to win an absolute majority. The party's traditional tenets of republicanism, populism and conservative Catholicism were increasingly out of tune with the aspirations of under-30 voters who form about a quarter of the electorate. In his last term of office Mr Haughey tried to be more European-looking, but internal squabbles left the party weak and defensive. The surprise presidential victory of Labour party candidate Mrs Mary Robinson in 1990, on a programme of job creation and social reform, was a signal to Fianna Fail. As the then finance minister, Mr Reynolds led the first push against Mr Haughey in eight years last November. Although he failed to topple him, a rising tide of scandals and controversies forced Mr Haughey to step down two weeks ago. Mr Reynolds faces the task of healing party wounds, stabilising its coalition with the Progressive Democrats and restoring the image of Fianna Fail ahead of the 1994 elections. If he is successful, he could call an early general election. Mr Haughey's controversial political legacy overshadowed the main success of his government, which was to tighten the reins on public sector borrowing. As finance minister from 1988 to 1991, Mr Reynolds slashed the current budget deficit from more than IPounds 1bn when he took office to IPounds 244m last year. A buoyant economy until the end of 1990, accompanied by rising tax revenues, enabled the government to freeze public spending without incurring significant job losses. In 1990, the powerful Irish Congress of Trade Unions was persuaded to put its signature to a Programme of Economic and Social Progress (PESP), which promised industrial peace in return for a series of phased pay awards to 1994 and progress in job creation. The PESP is now under strain. The promised jobs have not materialised and part of the 1992 pay awards have been deferred to keep public sector borrowing under control. Mr Reynolds said yesterday that job creation 'will be brought to the top of my political agenda'. He was less precise about how to achieve this goal, but he ruled out any big public spending programmes: 'That policy was tried before and failed and left us with a big overhang of debt,' he said. Instead, his emphasis is on the creation of 'sustainable jobs'. Since 1979, when Ireland entered the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, industry and the services sector have been forced to become more efficient to compete with rival European economies. This has meant a shedding of traditional industries such as textiles and footwear and the introduction of new ones such as pharmaceuticals and electronics. Now faced with declining EC farm subsidies, Ireland's relatively large agricultural population will be looking for jobs in other areas. Many of these could potentially come from an expected doubling of EC Structural Funds to IPounds 6bn for 1994-99 compared with the previous five years, to pay for improvements to Ireland's deficient road and rail transport systems. Mr Reynolds hopes that, with improved communication networks in place, Ireland will be well-placed to attract inward investment and to capitalise on the EC single market. Presenting the 1992 budget last week, finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern said his aims were 'sustainable economic and employment growth, the preparation for the single European market and Emu, and a better and fairer tax system'. He said the 'containment of debt and borrowing is not simply a matter of prudent national book-keeping. It is central to the government's strategy for establishing and sustaining economic confidence in all its aspects - confidence in the currency, the confidence to invest and expand'. Mr Ahern's income tax concessions for the lower paid are calculated to increase the personal disposal income of about 1m taxpayers by 2 per cent this year, and at the same time to ease wage pressure in the economy. He sees this move as vital to achieve another goal: reforming the system of wage-bargaining in the public sector. 'We have spent 20 years in making annual awards with no increases in productivity. The present system is not giving the required increases in efficiency. (Its change) will be important for public finances in the years ahead,' he said. The budget has won the cautious backing of business and the trade unions. The prospect of such widespread support for his economic policies will give Mr Reynolds more room to bring several outstanding and contentious social issues back on to the political agenda, such as the constitutional ban on divorce and condom sales. On the condom issue, for example, a proposed bill to introduce sales from slot machines and non-pharmacy outlets has still to reach its first reading in parliament. Sales through pharmacies to over-18-year-olds were legalised in 1985, but their use is not widespread. In 1989, figures supplied by the principal distributors showed total condom sales of about 5m, or about five a year for every adult male. Many pharmacies only sell them from under the counter. Social reform will be important not just to attract younger voters to Fianna Fail, but also to improve Ireland's relationship with Northern Ireland. Several Unionist leaders in Ulster cite the Catholic Church's dominance of political affairs in the Republic as a reason for blocking any role for the Irish government in Northern Ireland's affairs. Mr Haughey's trenchant republicanism, epitomised by his accusal and acquittal in an IRA arms trial in 1970, his initial opposition to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, and his stormy interchanges with former UK prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher over the H-block hunger strikers and extradition in the early 1980s, did little to endear him to the Unionists in the north. There will be expectations of fresh initiatives under Mr Reynolds's leadership. He said yesterday he wanted to create more cross-border projects 'to build trust between the two communities' and to look for 'a possible involvement of the EC' in a new political initiative. 'The economic borders of the community will be gone next year, so we have to try to find a structure to allow the political borders to go as well,' he said. However, the possibility of a hung UK parliament after the upcoming general election, with a Conservative government that might have to rely on Ulster Unionist support, is not a prospect likely to encourage political flexibility in Dublin. Having grasped the leadership nettle, Mr Reynolds has now to prove that he will give the country a fresh start. He is widely viewed as fair and honest. He promises to appoint a new cabinet on personal merit rather than on a basis of repaying political favours. 'It will be a government of openness, not defensiveness, a government of consultation and consensus, not diktat. 'My overall aim is to create a modern society; progressive, enlightened and socially caring,' he said. These are messages calculated to appeal not only to ordinary Irish people but also to investors in Japan, the US and Europe. It would be a wasted opportunity indeed were Mr Reynolds to compromise them too readily when faced with the political realities of office.</p>

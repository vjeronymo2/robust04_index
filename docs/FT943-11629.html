			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Few companies likely to take deregulatory initiative Only a few tens of thousands of companies are likely to take advantage of the government's deregulatory initiative allowing them to gain exemption from an annual audit, the head of Companies House said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Mr David Durham, chief executive and registrar of companies for England and Wales, estimated that there were about 300,000 companies with annual turnover of less than Pounds 90,000, which would make them eligible. He said that a further 200,000 companies had turnover of Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 350,000, which would allow them to have a 'compilation report' - less rigorous than a full audit. He expected most companies not to take advantage of the exemption because they would still want audited accounts to gain references from credit agencies. The Institute of Credit Management has persistently criticised the government's deregulatory initiative on audit exemption. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced exemption from mandatory audits in his November Budget speech.</p>

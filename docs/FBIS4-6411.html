			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, who is certain to become Japan's next prime minister, said  Monday [18 April] that cabinet changes must be minimal after the  establishment of a new government.    Hata, 58, head of key coalition party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], told reporters late Monday night, "I think it's  difficult to replace many cabinet members who worked out the  fiscal 1994 budget if the present coalition agrees to establish  a new government."    Hata, who is also deputy prime minister in the cabinet of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said the new government must  be a full- fledged one and not a provisional government, because  Japan needs to meet expectations from the rest of the world.    On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to  Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe  indicated to have second thoughts about his plan to leave the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run  in a Diet election for the premiership.    Watanabe, who declared Sunday that he will quit the LDP, met  LDP President Yohei Kono on Monday and conveyed his desire to  run for the premiership.    But Watanabe told reporters later that he has found major  differences with coalition parties over security policies,  indicating that he was having second thoughts about his bid for  premiership.    Kono and Watanabe are scheduled to hold another round of  talks Tuesday, LDP officials said.    Meanwhile, the chairman of the House of Representatives  steering committee said Monday he wants to convene a plenary  session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the premiership.    Keiwa Okuda told reporters that the lower house will convene  the vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the  coalition parties pick the coalition's nominee for the next  prime minister.    Representatives of the coalition parties are scheduled to  resume discussions Tuesday on policies for a new cabinet.    In Monday's two rounds of talks, they failed to reach  agreement on two issues of immediate concern, Japan's stance  toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development  program and tax system reform.    The forum comprised representatives at the secretaries  general level of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito,  Komeito [Clean Government Party], Japan New Party (JNP),  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Democratic Reform Party and  Kaikaku No Kai [Reform Party].    New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that  it  will not take posts in a new government, stayed away from the  session.    The coalition executives confirmed Monday that the ruling  parties will stick to a policy accord reached before the  formation of the Hosokawa administration last August, said SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo, chairman of the forum.    They also shared the view that early Diet approval of the  overdue 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 is the top  priority for the next government and that the new administration  should formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring spending for  improving living standards, Kubo told a news conference.    On basic policies, the coalition representatives ironed out  differences on such key issues as political reform, economic  reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. ties and  administrative reform and decentralization, he said.    Hosokawa, who declared on April 8 that he is resigning as  prime minister, will stay in office until the Diet picks a new  prime minister.</p>

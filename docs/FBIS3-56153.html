"I  fear... that the president wants to sign two agreements: first,  on general principles of relations, which will evidently be a  political document; second, on reducing atomic armaments.    "Because we do not have the document itself it is difficult  to talk specifically about its content, but I would very much  like the resolution, which the Supreme Council adopted on issues  of Ukraine's nuclear armaments, to be adhered to. I think the  resolution is a fair one and truly in the interests of the  Ukrainian people. We are interested in Ukraine getting  compensation for the nuclear materials of tactical atomic  missiles, which Ukraine once moved to Russia, and the  dismantlement itself should take place with the participation of  foreign funds. We should get political guarantees of our  independence from nuclear states and from the G-7."    The Committee of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine  believes, Levko Lukyanenko stressed, that the 12 reservations  expressed in the Supreme Council resolution are directed at  protecting Ukraine, and any kind of retreat from them is  inappropriate.</p>

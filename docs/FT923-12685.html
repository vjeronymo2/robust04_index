			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Tokyo languishes but the China factor helps to lift Hong Kong - Equities THINGS COULD hardly look gloomier for the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei Stock Average is down more than 30 per cent since the beginning of the year, and market participants foresee no short-term recovery. The past quarter's bad news included worries over the stability of the financial system, weak corporate earnings results and bankruptcies at leading companies. The index fell through 19,000 at the start of April, despite a 75 basis point cut in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan on the last day of March. Traders blamed the central bank's slow response to the weakening economy, and the fact that that the anticipated move had already been discounted into share prices. Share prices weakened further as anxiety about bad loans at the leading banks and the soundness of the financial system itself spread among investors. The index plunged through 17,000 and 16,000 on worse-than-expected corporate earnings forecasts by leading brokerages, following the results season, and rumours of bankruptcies at leading property-related companies. Investors have remained absent from the market as the Nikkei has fallen to its lowest levels since 1986. Forecasts of its next support level range from 14,000 to 12,000. However, analysts have become reluctant to point to a bottom, because of investors' lack of confidence. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Pacific Rim region, things look brighter. Traders in Hong Kong raised their glasses in May, as the Hang Seng Index surged above the critical 6,000 level. The Hong Kong market has seen substantial buying by US pension funds; and recently the return of the locals, who had been reluctant to come in due to sour memories of the crash of 1987, has doubled daily turnover to around HKDollars 3bn. In addition to the downward pressure on interest rates, political statements by Chinese leaders, supporting economic reforms using capitalist methods, have sparked a rally in China-related stocks, encouraging buying by investors who want an indirect exposure to China's potential economic growth. However, the Hong Kong market remains vulnerable to political events. Uncertainty about the renewal of China's 'most favoured nation' trading status with the US, and the debate about the financing of the new airport, could cause volatility as the Hang Seng index continues to test new highs. Australian equities - after a rally in late April helped by lower inflationary pressure and lower bond yields - remained in the 1,625 to 1,675 range for the most of May and June. Evidence of an economic recovery has been slow to emerge, and the All Ordinaries index may remain within that range until clear signs of a rebound appear. Bangkok, which was hit by civil unrest, seems to offer the most potential on the upside. Towards the end of the quarter, the SET index was more than 9 per cent off its peak at 750. 'The market is oversold,' says Mr David Shairp, research director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, in Hong Kong. After a firm first quarter, the SET index climbed to the year's peak of 832 at the beginning of April. However, it weakened on political uncertainty surrounding General Suchinda Kraprayoon's government. The market has since recovered from the 660 level, its lowest since December 1991, posted after the military crushed protests against the appointment of General Suchinda. Efforts by financial authorities and the new government to restore confidence in Thailand's political system and financial markets have been welcomed by investors. Additionally, prospects of an economic slowdown and a narrowing current account deficit point to scope for lower interest rates, a positive sign for share prices.</p>

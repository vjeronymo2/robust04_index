			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Expansionist mood for Gerard Worms Wheeling and dealing is part and parcel of corporate life at Suez, the sprawling French holding company; yet Gerard Worms, its chairman, can have greeted few deals with quite so much relief as last week's sale of Abeille Re, the reinsurance business, to the SCOR group, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The deal marked the end of three years of arduous negotiations over the disposal of Victoire, the French insurer that owned Abeille Re and was recently sold to the UK's Commercial Union. It also marked a turning point for Worms himself who, having spent his first four years as chairman embroiled in disposals, is now free to indulge in expansion. Worms, 57, is an easy man to underestimate, as his fellow French financiers now realise. His genial air and mild manner prompted some to dismiss him as a paler shadow of Jean Peyrelevade, his former boss who is now chairman of the Credit Lyonnais banking group. He did little to confound his critics during his first few years at Suez when tussling with the task of instilling some sort of strategic direction into its vast and varied interests. But he soon showed his mettle by fiercely resisting the attempts of Peyrelevade (then head of Union des Assurances de Paris) to achieve an easy - and cheap - takeover of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. The two men finally struck a deal late last year but Worms was generally seen as having struck the better bargain. He then went on to auction off Victoire and, having completed that task, can now settle down to convincing his critics that he is as good at buying as he was at selling.</p>

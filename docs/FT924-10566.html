			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Trouble at the regulators' ball IT SEEMS like a very technical issue on which to go to war. Yet there has been no hiding the passion generated at this week's meeting in London of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco). Mr Richard Breeden, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, says that a proposed international standard for the capital to be held by securities firms and banks is imprudent in the extreme, and could lead to financial disaster in the event of a sharp stock market setback. The European reaction to this idea has been apoplectic, not least because the standard has already been enshrined in the EC's capital adequacy directive. Is Mr Breeden right to be so gloomy? Probably not. The directive imposes tougher standards across the Community than were in place on Black Monday, 1987 - a drama which did not lead to spectacular failures among European securities firms. Does it matter that securities regulators have so far been unable to agree on so basic an issue as capital adequacy? Again, the answer is probably not. There are benefits to be derived from a harmonised approach to such regulation, but there are dangers as well. Basle model Although some Iosco members think otherwise, the Basle model for bank regulation, which lays down centrally agreed standards for capital, may not be appropriate for the securities industry. Securities firms and banks have different regulatory requirements. If a bank gets into difficulties, it is likely to face claims that are hard to meet because its main assets, loans, are not easy to sell. A securities firm, by contrast, holds its assets in marketable securities, so there is less risk of a collapsing securities firm causing a liquidity crisis in a financial system. On the other hand, because securities firms trade in vast volumes of securities, there is a risk of systemic problems from any large-scale failure to deliver stock to purchasers or payments to vendors. Thus international agreements on payment and settlement systems may be more important to reducing systemic risk in the securities industry than are capital agreements. The main benefits of an international agreement on the supervision of securities firms and banks would be threefold. It would prevent financial centres seeking to gain advantage by lowering regulatory standards; it would reduce duplication of effort; and it might help to limit the risk of contagion, where trouble in one part of a financial firm or market leads to disaster in another. Against that, monopolies in regulation have the same drawbacks as they do in other spheres of life. They reduce competition and innovation and encourage complacency. It is healthy that the Europeans have had their assumptions about capital adequacy tested so roughly this week. Inherent trade-off The main public policy issue is the trade-off which exists between the need for orderly and properly regulated markets on the one hand and for competition and choice on the other. If regulators seek to establish standards which apply across a broad front, how do they set them at the level which underwrites the one without damaging the other? And if they push things too far, they will be held accountable for market failures over which in reality they may have had little control. That in turn will lead to demands for ever more stringent regulations in order to protect the regulators' jobs and the taxpayer's pocket. So unless there is a clear danger that the absence of such standards presents a threat to the system, a more pragmatic approach seems sensible. As it happens this is just what Iosco has achieved in its principles for the supervision of financial conglomerates, also published this week. These set out what is described as a spectrum of possible approaches to group-based risk assessment, and leave it up to individual regulators to decide which position to adopt. Over time, regulations covering the workings of the securities industry are likely to converge across national borders. But for the moment, Iosco serves a useful purpose in debating the main issues and in improving contact and co-ordination between regulators across the world. It does not have to be a standard-setting body.</p>

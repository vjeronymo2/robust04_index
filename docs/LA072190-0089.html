			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THEY NOW?: HANK BAUER;  </P> <P> TRUE GRIT ;  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN RECORD SETTER ATTACKS BROADCASTING CAREER WITH SAME ZEAL HE  DISPLAYED ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD  </P> <P> His spirit remains relentlessly bright, like the summer San Diego sun. As Hank  Bauer often shouted when he walked onto the football field: It's a great day to  be alive.  </P> <P> Bauer rises at 4 a.m., and within an hour is taping his morning sports  broadcast for KKYY radio in San Diego. Next, he dashes over to KFMB-TV and is  on the air at 6:40 as sports anchor. Then he cuts back to the radio station for  an 8:20 broadcast. The rest of the day is spent collecting news for his  afternoon TV broadcast.  </P> <P> Bullish and buoyant, Bauer keeps moving but never leaves the spotlight. Rivers  of adrenaline still rush through his veins. Bauer, 36, personifies the  overachieving underdog; once again he has built a career from the ground floor  through determination and ingenuity.  </P> <P> "There are direct parallels between playing football and broadcasting," he  says. "When the whistle blows, I'm in control. I know when I stink and I know  when I'm great. There is the instant gratification and the public scrutiny that  most players miss when they retire.  </P> <P> "The news business is ever-changing, just like a football game. No two plays  were ever the same and no two broadcasts are ever the same."  </P> <P> Variety has always spiced the life of Bauer, Cal Lutheran's only 1,000-yard  rusher and a three-time NFL special-teams player of the year with the San Diego  Chargers. Throughout his six-year NFL career, he delighted everyone from  teammates and coaches to fans and the media by being unpredictable yet  reliable, unheeding yet prepared, reckless yet attentive.  </P> <P> "Anybody can play on special teams, but to be good, I think you have to be kind  of sick, where you really don't care about your body," Bauer used to say during  his playing career. "Actually, getting your bell rung doesn't feel too bad. It  feels kind of good."  </P> <P> At 5-foot-10 1/2, 205 pounds, Bauer was a bowling ball gone berserk. In  addition to single-handedly making special-teams play fashionable in the NFL,  he was a short-yardage rushing specialist. In only 22 carries in 1979, he  rushed for nine touchdowns and eight first downs. A crucial play against the  Pittsburgh Steelers in a game at San Diego that year illustrated his popularity  -- and effectiveness.  </P> <P> The Chargers led, 21-7, and faced fourth-and-goal from the two-yard line late  in the game. Coach Don Coryell called timeout to confer with quarterback Dan  Fouts. Bauer stood nearby, hoping to enter the game, when a teammate tapped his  shoulder and said, "Hank, do you hear that?"  </P> <P> The crowd of more than 50,000 was on its feet, chanting, "Bau-er, Bau-er,  Bau-er." Coryell turned to Bauer and said, "I'm no dummy. Get on the field."  </P> <P> Recalls Bauer: "I ran out and (Steeler linebacker) Jack Lambert stared at me  with his hands on his hips, spitting out blood. He said, 'You aren't gonna get  in this time.' I blurted back some expletive."  </P> <P> Fouts handed off to Bauer, who barreled into the end zone. The chants continued  through the ensuing kickoff, on which Bauer made the tackle. "I enjoyed a  special-teams tackle as much as scoring a touchdown," he says.  </P> <P> Nicknamed "Howitzer" for his gung-ho style, Bauer was the most special of  special-teams players. "He's the best I've ever seen," Coryell said.  </P> <P> Quite a compliment for a fellow who signed with the Chargers as a free agent in  1977 after teaching high school for a year. Bauer set nearly every school  rushing record during four years (1972-75) at Cal Lutheran, but he weighed only  190 pounds and was not drafted.  </P> <P> Bauer, who helped the Kingsmen get to the NAIA final his senior year, holds Cal  Lutheran records for career carries (502); touchdowns in a game (four), a  season (17) and a career (38); and yards in a season (1,024) and a career  (2,700).  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys offered him a free-agent tryout in 1976 but he was cut after  three weeks.  </P> <P> "I knew I was good enough to play in the NFL," says Bauer, still irked at being  snubbed by the team that trained at Cal Lutheran during his playing days there.  </P> <P> Bauer spent the next year teaching and working out. Although he added 15 pounds  of muscle, there was little interest from NFL teams. At times, his efforts  seemed fruitless, like banging his head against a wall. But then, Bauer never  had an aversion to that sort of behavior at Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> "I hated the first hit of a game, so I'd always take a few head butts against a  concrete wall during warm-ups," he says.  </P> <P> Bauer also played outfield on the Kingsmen baseball team. While chasing a fly  ball one day with his typical fervor, he slammed face-first into the chain-link  outfield fence.  </P> <P> "His face looked like a waffle in the pattern of the chain-link," recalls Al  Schoenberger, a Cal Lutheran assistant coach at the time.  </P> <P> With the ball at his feet, Bauer stepped back from the fence, grunted, and  pounded his forehead on the adjoining fence post. Then he picked up the ball  and threw it to the infield.  </P> <P> Such intensity is more appropriate on the football field. "If ever there was a  guy who played offense with a defensive mentality, it was Hank," said Keith  Richard, a former Cal Lutheran football teammate of Bauer's. "It seemed like  every day at practice, a fight would break out. Hank and I rolled around on the  grass a couple of times.  </P> <P> "Then it was over and, boom, we were best of friends. There were never hard  feelings."  </P> <P> Bauer, in fact, was a leader. The night before a game in 1975, he and teammate  Dan Morrow loosened the support in the fence behind Mount Clef Stadium at Cal  Lutheran. The next day during introductions, rather than lead the team through  the gate, Bauer and Morrow dashed straight through the weakened fence, and were  followed by 35 inspired Kingsmen.  </P> <P> "I saw guys get fired up who never had before," Morrow recalls. "That started a  trend that the players used for years afterward. They'd run through that  fence."  </P> <P> Certainly, there had to be a place in the NFL for a maniacal motivator like  Bauer.  </P> <P> When the Chargers made a lukewarm offer to let this small back from a small  school get a second chance at trying out with the big boys, Bauer excitedly  packed a few T-shirts, jocks and socks in a duffel bag and puttered his beat-up  Volkswagen to San Diego.  </P> <P> "Every week, Hank would call and say, 'I stuck, I stuck,' " recalls Jim Bauer,  Hank's older brother and a Cal Lutheran standout from 1968-71.  </P> <P> The Chargers played the Rams in The Times Charity Game that summer and several  of Bauer's former Cal Lutheran teammates attended. On the opening kickoff, the  new Charger flew down the field intent on making the tackle.  </P> <P> "The Rams ran a reverse and Tom Mack blindsided Hank, caught him right in the  ear hole," Jim Bauer recalls. "Hank's head hit the ground first and I got a  real sick feeling in my stomach."  </P> <P> In a daze, Bauer pulled himself off the ground and ran to the Rams' sideline,  where an opposing player pushed him back on the field. He wandered aimlessly  through the end zone until a Charger official grabbed his arm and led him to  the proper sideline. Later in the game, Bauer was back on the field.  </P> <P> After spending his first year solely on special teams, Bauer shared time at  running back in 1978 and 1979, scoring 17 touchdowns. However, the Chargers  acquired talented running back Chuck Muncie in 1980 and made running back James  Brooks their first draft choice in 1981.  </P> <P> "I knew my backfield days were numbered," Bauer said.  </P> <P> Rather than demand a trade or grouse to the media, Bauer carved out a new role.  "I decided to out-study everybody and make special teams my life," he says.  </P> <P> In his career, Bauer played every position on the kickoff return, punt return  and kickoff teams. He played everywhere on the punt team except punter and  snapper. He was honored as special-teams player of the year in 1980, '81 and  '82 and paved the way for a special-teams player to be named each year to the  Pro Bowl.  </P> <P> "At the time, nobody did the job I was doing," he says. "I relished it. It was  a blue-collar job. If I left a legacy at all, it was to legitimize special  teams."  </P> <P> Despite his kamikaze style, Bauer never missed a game at Anaheim Magnolia High,  Cal Lutheran or San Diego. He injured his neck in practice midway through the  1982 season, however, and although he finished out the year, he retired before  the 1983 season rather than risk permanent damage.  </P> <P> Bauer was only 29, but Coryell immediately hired him as an assistant coach. He  had dabbled in broadcasting as a player, and when the team's ownership and  coaching staffs changed after the 1986 season, Bauer went behind the microphone  full time.  </P> <P> "This isn't the story of a huge star getting his first broadcasting job handed  to him based on his reputation as a player," Bauer says. "I started at the  bottom and I've earned what I've gotten.  </P> <P> "It's just like when I was trying to make it in the NFL. I knew in my heart I  could be a sportscaster and I've put in a lot of hard work. I've paid the price  and am still paying the price."  </P> <P> And just as in his playing days, it's one he is pleased to pay.  </P></p>

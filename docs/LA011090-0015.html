			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT AND PLO  </P> <P> What is the difference between a Noriega, a Ceausescu or an Arafat? The world  condemns Manuel Noriega because he murdered Panamanians who opposed him, and  prevented his people from having the freedom to choose their own leaders. The  world condemns Nicolae Ceausescu because his military murdered people who  opposed him.  </P> <P> Yasser Arafat and PLO factions have assassinated fellow Palestinians who  opposed them. Why doesn't the world condemn them?  </P> <P> The world understood that Panamanians should be freed from the control of  Noriega, and that Romanians should be freed from the control of Ceausescu. Why  isn't it obvious to everyone that Palestinians must be freed from the control  of Arafat and the PLO?  </P> <P> If Arabs and others wanted justice for Palestinians, they would not have  deliberately obscured the fact that Arafat and factions of the PLO have the  same kind of control over Palestinians that Noriega had over Panamanians and  Ceausescu over Romanians. There will be hope for a just peace for Palestinians  when Arafat and the PLO are eliminated.  </P> <P> ALBERT BENGUIAT  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

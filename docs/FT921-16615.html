			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Time to face pensions reality Sir, Mr Busk's argument (Letters, December 18) that the 'future service equality' (FSE) amendment to Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome may be invalid is, on his own admission, based on the assumption that the judgment in Barber v GRE 'does have some degree of retrospective effect'. In Barber, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to interpret the meaning of Article 119 and went out of its way to state that the judgment was not intended to have retrospective effect. Claims have subsequently been made that in the context of pension rights 'no retrospection' does not mean quite what it says. Any doubts should have been resolved in one or more test cases in the pipeline. As the ECJ has not yet conclusively determined that Barber does have retrospective effect, Mr Busk's assumption begs the very question which is now answered by the FSE amendment to Article 119. True, the ECJ may be called upon to deliberate on the status of the amendment during the brief interregnum before its formal ratification by all member states. But there is no reason why it should not take a pragmatic view and have regard to the amendment when making its determination. The Barber industry has kept pension lawyers busy for 18 months. Subject only to the ECJ's formal acceptance, of the realities, surely the Maastricht settlement provides the opportunity to call it a day, rather than seek excuses to keep the Barber bandwagon rolling.

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland's hopes stay high after phenomenal gains - Helsinki's prospects Ask Finnish analysts whether the Helsinki stock market can continue its phenomenal performance and they will probably answer in the affirmative. Far from being overbought, they will say, many shares still look cheap on international comparisons and the fundamentals are still strong enough to ensure that any setbacks are only temporary. The Hex index closed another 40.2 higher yesterday at a new high of 1,426.0, 72 per cent up this year and comfortably more than double its 541 level on September 7 last year. Its upward momentum is being fuelled by falling interest rates - the Bank of Finland yesterday announced a half percentage point cut in base rates to 6.0 per cent - and the rapidly improving position of the country's leading exporters following the sharp depreciation of the markka in the last two years. In addition, there has been heavy foreign buying following the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of the year. The belief that the market has further to go stems from expectations of yet lower interest rates, hopes for a gradual recovery in the Finnish economy, and a belief that the earnings of leading Finnish exporters will improve strongly in 1994 and 1995. Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF Fund Management Ltd, believes that the Hex index will exceed its all-time high of 2,009, which it struck in April 1989, either next year or in 1995. Mr Esko Haavisto, head of investment research at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, though slightly more cautious, still expects the upward trend to hold firm. He believes that domestic investors were wrong-footed by a more than usually active summer trading session (shares rose by 10.7 per cent in July alone) and that they have returned from their holidays in a buying mood. The continued rise in the index is the more extraordinary because of bleak conditions in the domestic economy. A recent forecast suggests that the Finnish economy will shrink 2 per cent this year, the third consecutive year of decline, and grow only slightly in 1994. But this only underlines the ambivalent nature of the Helsinki stock exchange, which is dominated by large exporting groups and has comparatively few companies, such as construction groups, which are exposed to the domestic situation. Undoubtedly, some of the buying has had a speculative flavour to it, none more so than in the banking sector, which has risen by around 150 per cent this year in the face of the country's continued financial sector crisis. The downside risks are all too obvious, given that many of the country's main banks may not be back in profit until 1996. More generally, the market remains subject to nervousness about developments in its eastern neighbour, Russia. And there are fears about squabbles on the political front at home - either because the government is unable to agree its budget in the current environment of austerity or because this autumn's wage round proves difficult. There are fears that workers will demand big pay rises because of the improving performance of the export companies, but the ability of domestically-orientated groups to increase wages is almost non-existent. A final factor which could unsettle the market is evidence that corporate profits are not improving as much as expected, given that analysts are already valuing companies on their prospects in 1994 and 1995. KOP Investment Research, for example, is expecting net profits of Finnish companies (excluding banks) to rebound to a FM911m surplus this year from a FM6.65bn loss last year, before moving ahead to a FM5.83bn profit next year. This could prove a tall order in the current international recession, at a time of more volatile currency movements, notwithstanding a 23 per cent rise in Finland's first half exports.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- The Russian foreign  intelligence service denied Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's  allegations on Wednesday that Russian secret services are  planning to stage a local nuclear explosion in the Chechen  Republic.    "Such statements are absurd," foreign intelligence  spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said.    Dudayev said on Chechen television that following the failed  attempt on his life, Russian secret services may stage a local  nuclear blast. He also said that should this happen, they will  then accuse the Chechen Republic, saying that it possesses a  nuclear component.</p>

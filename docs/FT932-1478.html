			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A general wave of long liquidation brought base metals prices down from earlier highs at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Three months COPPER rebounded from well-signposted resistance at Dollars 1,900 as another rise in exchange warehouse stocks was announced, and ended Dollars 7 down at Dollars 1,878 a tonne. ALUMINIUM'S retreat gathered pace after support at Dollars 1,200 for three months metal was breached and final business was at Dollars 1,187 a tonne, down Dollars 18.50 on the day. NICKEL stocks registered another substantial fall, the fourth in succession, but that did not prevent the three months price surrendering most of Monday's advance. And the ZINC market lost most of the modest gains that had been encouraged by Monday's news of a European producer plan for co-ordinated output cuts. At the London bullion market precious metals continued Monday's drift. Dealers blamed GOLD'S failure to attract sufficient speculative interest for its Dollars 1.35 fall to Dollars 368.15 a troy ounce. But they did not expect a significant retreat to ensue. London COFFEE and COCOA futures prices ended the day higher in relatively quiet trading. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Eximbank nuclear loans criticised The US Export-Import Bank has come under attack from environmental groups for supporting projects such as the Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at Temelin near the Czech border with Austria. Mr Peter Jankowitsch, former Austrian foreign minister, is in Washington at the head of a government delegation to voice concerns about 'the unprecedented merger of old eastern bloc technologies with western nuclear equipment' that could, he said, pose a safety risk for the whole region. Speaking at a House banking subcommittee hearing, Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, said the bank plans to proceed with its Dollars 317m loan guarantee backing the sale of a Westinghouse instrumentation and control system and advanced-design nuclear fuel to Temelin, unless opponents produced new, convincing information about the risks. Improvement of procedures to assess environmental risk is already under way, he said. However, the bank could not carry out its mission if it had to conduct full-scale environmental impact statements for every transaction.</p>

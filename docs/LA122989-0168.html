			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORKERS AT RACE TRACKS CHANGE MINDS, OK PACT  </P> <P> Union workers at Pimlico and Laurel race tracks voted today to accept the  five-year contract they had rejected a week ago, averting a strike Monday.  </P> <P> The contract replaces one that expires at midnight Sunday and covers about 660  pari-mutuel clerks, guards, parkers, admissions personnel, jockeys' room valets  and the starting gate crew.  </P> <P> The members of Local 27 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union had  rejected the offer last week and authorized a strike despite the recommendation  of union leaders that the track management's offer be accepted.  </P> <P> The ratification vote was 310 to 39. It calls for top-scale wages for  pari-mutuel clerks after eight years of continuous regular service.  </P> <P> Today's vote meeting was tightly secured. The press was barred, as well as  friends and family of union members.  </P> <P> Union and track management officials met for about four hours Wednesday at a  series of meetings arranged by federal mediator Leo Gant.  </P></p>

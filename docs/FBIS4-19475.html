			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kemal Bilget, deputy chairman of the </F> pro-Kurdish Democracy Party, by Zeynel Abidin in Istanbul; date  not given: "The Junta Constitution Continues To Be Valid in  Turkey"]    [Text] [Abidin] What is the situation of the Democracy  Party [DEP] at the moment?    [Bilget] At the moment our party is fighting a juridical  struggle. As you know, six of our deputies were arrested in the  Parliament in Ankara on 2 March after their immunity had been  rescinded. In addition, investigations are underway against our  party, which have the goal of banning it. We will defend  ourselves for the last time at the Constitutional Court tomorrow.    [Abidin] What do you think are the reasons for the  investigations?    [Bilget] In Turkey the Constitution is very reactionary. It  is still the fascist Constitution of 12-September (date of the  military putsch in 1980 -- NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editor's note).  This makes it very difficult for someone to even just talk  about the Kurdish problem, as the DEP does. Even stricter are  the penal code and the law on political parties, which are  particularly rigid regarding the Kurdish question. However, we  have founded the DEP while observing these laws and we are  orienting our work toward them, that is, we try to observe the  existing racist laws. For instance, as representatives of the  party, we have never used the term "Kurdistan." Instead, we  speak of the "east" or the "southeast" so as not to give the  state any trump card against us.    [Abidin] What are you officilly accused of in the  proceedings?    [Billet] The state has decided to destroy us and it is  looking for any reason: Our former Chairman Yasar Kaya  participated in the congress of the Democratic Party of  Kurdistan in Iraq in 1993 and held a speech at a Kurdish  festival in Bonn. Proof of that is a video tape, which was  probably made by the Turkish intelligence service. However, the  law says that video tapes cannot be used as evidence in court.    The second pretext is almost tragicomic: Shortly after the  founding of the DEP, we started a peace campaign in August 1993.  In a flier we wrote: "Be it soldiers or Kurdish youths -- in  any case, it is our people who are dying in the east and the  southeast. As of now no militant methods should be used  anymore; instead, democratic solutions must be looked for."  Saying this is obviously a reason in Turkey to be banned. In  the investigation proceedings, our deputies are even accused of  having entered parliament while having cloths in the Kurdish  colors of green-yellow-red in their pockets.    [Abidin] But that means that the juridical grounds for  banning your party are, actually, very meager.    [Bilget] Nevertheless, it looks as if the DEP will be banned  just as its predecessor, the People's Labor Party (HEP). This  is a political decision by the state, not a juridical one.    [Abidin] In the Turkish public much excitement is caused by  the fact that the DEP allegedly supports the Workers Party of  Kurdistan (PKK). This was also an argument for lifting the  immunity of the deputies. The comment by your arrested party  chairman Hatip Dicle about the PKK bomb attack on a railroad  station in one of Istanbul's suburbs was given as an example.  The attack killed several army cadets.    [Bilget] This is the demagogy of Prime Minister Ciller and  the other leading officials of the state, who want to flatter  Turkish chauvinism. However, in reality, the DEP has nothing to  do with the PKK. The PKK is an illegal organization that  pursues an armed struggle. We, on the other hand, are a legal  organization that struggles on a democratic basis; a mass party  founded by educated Kurds from various fields of society.    It is true that the PKK and we are supported by the same  people, namely by the Kurdish population. It may be that some  of our demands are similar. However, this is not so because we  support the PKK but because we work for the interests of the  Kurdish people.    Let me use the above example: After the PKK bomb attack our  party chairman said: "It is said that both sides use such  places as military targets.... We want the war to come to an  end as quickly as possible. The reaction to individual actions  is no solution for that. There are other solutions than  militant ones." The media wrote afterwards: "Dicle called the  train with army cadets a military target."    [Abidin] Will you found a new party if the DEP is indeed  banned?    [Bilget] We have not yet come to a decision on this matter,  but we have not immediately started to prepare for founding a  new party, as was done when the HEP was banned, because we do  not want to make it so easy to ban the DEP. We will defend the  party up to the last minute. If necessary, this time we will  also turn to the international courts. According to Turkish  laws, if the party is banned, our 2,500 local and city  councilors are not permitted to exercise any political functions  for 10 years or to become active in any other party for the same  period. Therefore, it could be that shortly before the ban we  will call on all members -- with the exception of our leading  functionaries -- to leave the party so that they do not have to  suffer under these consequences. For our parliamentarians,  however, this is not possible.    [Abidin] Your party is massively threatened not only  juridically but also in physical terms. What are the  consequences of this fact for your future political work?    [Bilget] The DEP has had to pay a high price. When we add  the HEP, a total of 70 of our representatives have been  murdered. The assassination attempt on our parliamentary Deputy  Mehmet Sincar could have hit me -- I was standing beside him  during the attack, he died in my arms.... More than 20 of our  party offices have been devastated by bomb attacks more than 300  delegates have been imprisoned. Our voters have been  threatened, we ourselves aware not able to run in the local  elections on 27 March.    The sacrifices must not have been in vain. I think, in the  future we must try to get closer to the Turkish working people,  too, and to abolish the negative image we have among them.    [Abidin] In many Kurdish areas, for instance in Diyarbakir,  the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) won the local elections. Did  your voters vote for the RP?    [Bilget] Only a minority of them. Most voters either did  not participate in the elections or handed in empty ballot  slips. Thus, they behaved in line with our suggestions. By the  way, in the Kurdish areas the RP was not able to increase its  number of votes to the same extent as in the Turkish areas. It  won in some communities only because there it did not have any  serious competition and because very few voters cast valid  votes. If we had participated in the elections, the DEP would  have become the strongest party in this region.    [Abidin] Where do you see the reason for the advance of the  Islamic fundamentalists?    [Bilget] In the Kurdish areas the RP was supported by the  sate. The Government, which does not at all welcome this party  in the Turkish areas, strengthened it in the Kurdish region. In  particular the Turkish officers, soldiers, policemen, and the  members of the special units stationed there voted for the RP.    In western Turkey the situation is different. There the RP  has indeed gained considerably more votes. The success of the  Islamic fundamentalists is a result of the crisis of Kemalism  (the official state doctrine of Turkey -- the editors) and of  the weakness of the left.    [Abidin] You have certainly heard about the events that took  place at the Newroz celebrations in Germany. What do you think  about that?    [Bilget] It looks as if the German Government has still not  understood the Kurdish problem properly. I think it is trying  to give positive signals to the Turkish government with its  actions. However, the Germans should now that this is not  correct and a danger to democracy in our country, because under  the slogan of "preventing terrorism" the uncivilized actions of  the Turkish Government are virtually supported.    The Kurds do not want to disturb peace in Germany, that  would  not be of any benefit to them, either. I think that German  politicians sometimes exploit the sensibilities of the  population, and if the Kurds become loud as people, they present  it in a wrong light.    [Abidin] What would the deportation of "Kurdish activists"  from Germany mean?    [Bilget] From my own experience I would like to say: It may  be that the deported people will not be executed. However, in  the prisons in Turkey there are neither rights nor rules. If it  is not one's body that is executed, it is at least one's honor.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Halifax talk hits banks Merger plans by the Halifax and Leeds Permanent ruffled the banking sector with the stock market quick to mark down the big mortgage lenders Lloyds Bank and Abbey National on the news that the new entity would seek to become a listed, public limited company. Lloyds, which is absorbing the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, shed 10 to 564p while Abbey National dipped 2 1/2 to 407p, having been as low as 404p at one stage during the day. Most banking specialists thought the initial share price responses were overdone, however, arguing that the merger was aimed as much at removing mortgage capacity as supplying the stock market with a bigger, more aggressive lender. The two societies, numbers one and five respectively in the building society pecking order, have combined assets of Pounds 88bn and are likely to have a market capitalisation of around Pounds 5.5bn when they come to the market - possibly some time in 1996, according to best bets among analysts yesterday. This would would put any Halifax/Leeds bank roughly on a par with the Abbey National and is likely to propel the new entity directly in to the Footsie 100 index. With a 23 per cent share of net new mortgage lending, it dominates the field in this area, with Abbey National holding down 10 per cent and NatWest some 6 per cent.</p>

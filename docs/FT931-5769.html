			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / US urges talks on latest Serb attacks: Christopher denies air drops linked to renewed fighting in eastern Bosnia PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, yesterday said the air drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia would continue. The US also called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider the latest Serb attacks on Cerska, eastern Bosnia. Council members were due to go into closed session last night to discuss the crisis, which dashed hopes for progress in a new round of peace talks begun on Monday by the UN and European Community mediators. On Tuesday night, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, had given the impression that the air drops, which he described as 'symbolic' and 'a great success', would be suspended indefinitely. But Mr Christopher said there was 'no evidence at all' that the air drops had prompted greater Serb assaults on the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. He added that in view of the 'disturbing' reports of greater fighting and refugee flows 'the air drops will be continuing'. A ham radio operator from Konjevic Polje, about 11km south of Cerska, which was the third target of the US air drop, yesterday said villagers had found 18 aid pallets in snow about half a metre deep. Sarajevo radio said heavy Serb artillery fire made it impossible to conduct a wider search of the rugged terrain. At least 18 people were yesterday reported killed and dozens wounded in Cerska, as thousands of refugees tried to flee the Serb advance through the region. 'We have reports that Konjevic Polje is under heavy bombardment by Serbs . . . and on amateur radio we hear they are coming under tear gas, shells, and small arms fire', said Ms Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd discussed the situation with the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, yesterday in a visit to New York that took on enhanced significance because of the worsening situation. He also met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali and endorsed the UN secretary-general's views on the need for the use of force by UN troops to implement any agreement. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in a letter to President Clinton, urged the US to abandon the air drops, because they threatened to ignite a wider war. A Serb mayor in eastern Bosnia also urged the US to stop the drops, saying land corridors were safer and more efficient. The renewed US commitment to the air drops appears much influenced by Tuesday's announcement in Moscow that Russia was willing to join the US airborne relief efforts. A US air force spokesman yesterday said the US European Command would be sending a person team to Moscow to discuss details.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEVERE STORMS IN WASHINGTON SINK SECTIONS OF FLOATING BRIDGE  </P> <P> Sections of a closed interstate highway bridge across Lake Washington sank  Sunday after a round of stormy weather, and engineers said the rest could  collapse at any time.  </P> <P> About one-third of the 1 1/2-mile-long floating bridge across the lake sank,  another piece sank about five hours later, and other sections appeared to be  breaking loose, witnesses said. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> The four-lane bridge, which parallels the new Interstate 90 bridge that opened  last year, was being rebuilt to serve as eastbound lanes for the roadway across  the lake.  </P> <P> State transportation engineers and police closed the new seven-lane bridge,  which carries an average of about 110,000 vehicles a day, out of concern loose  pieces of the old bridge could damage it.  </P> <P> The new bridge's anchoring cables, which stretch under the old span, were  damaged by the collapse, a state Transportation Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> The old bridge floats on the water like a ship anchored in place and has  flotation chambers that can be pumped out.  </P> <P> The bridge was not the only casualty of Washington's rough weather.  </P> <P> Record rains, high winds and rampaging floodwaters on major Washington rivers  chased more than 2,000 people from their homes.  </P> <P> One man was feared drowned when he drove past a barricade and into the  floodwaters of the Snoqualmie River near Duvall, about 15 miles east of  Seattle, police said. The man's wife and daughter were rescued.  </P> <P> At least 2,125 people were evacuated in six counties, Red Cross and local  officials said. The Red Cross had 20 emergency shelters in operation,  spokeswoman Hope Tuttle said.  </P> <P> "My state is falling apart on me," Gov. Booth Gardner lamented after a  helicopter tour of the region. Gardner added a dozen counties to five others  for which he had sought federal disaster aid to recoup from severe floods two  weeks ago.  </P> <P> The most severe flooding appeared to be about 40 miles northeast of Seattle,  east of Monroe in Snohomish County, where some houses were completely under  water from the Skykomish River.  </P> <P> Water poured through a 150-foot break in a dike at 16-square-mile Fir Island,  which was about three-quarters under water.  </P></p>

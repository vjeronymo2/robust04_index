			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister  voiced hope Friday [1 April] that this year's U.S. report on  foreign trade barriers will not lead to sanctions against Japan.  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also  suggested at a press conference that Japan would bring its case  to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the world  trade body, if the U.S. used the report as a basis for imposing  trade sanctions.    Japan was among 39 countries and trade blocs the U.S.  Government quoted as unfair traders in its annual trade barrier  report published Thursday. The report lists 43 trade barriers  in Japan under seven industry categories.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a separate  press meeting that Japan should "not be now glad, now sad" with  the annual report. "It is only a reference for the U.S. in  specifying (unfair traders) at the end of September," he said.  Washington plans to draw up a list of "priority" countries that  will be subject to "Super 301" trade measures.    Hata also indicated that Japan has no fresh plans to allay  the growing U.S. frustration with its trade deficit with Tokyo.  He said Japan will focus on drafting macroeconomic measures  which the market-opening package unveiled earlier this week  suggested will be drawn up by June.</p>

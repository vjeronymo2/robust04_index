			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The Markets: Marital economics - Economic Eye In 1991 there was one divorce in the UK for every two marriages, twice the rate in 1971. More than 30 per cent of all births were outside marriage in 1992, six times as many as in 1961. More than a half of those births were registered by the mother alone or by couples living apart (see chart). Finally, lone-parent families were a fifth of all families with dependent children in 1992, up from a mere 4.5 per cent 30 years before. Patterns of marriage and child-rearing have been revolutionised in just one generation. Why has this happened? Economics can help provide answers, for marriage is an economic institution: a partnership to rear children. The characteristics of child-rearing make this partnership necessary. Directly or indirectly, child-rearing is the greatest expense most adults bear; an upbringing that equips children for success takes at least 20 years; and a parent can hardly look after children full-time, while earning an adequate living. Sole-parents need someone to look after their children, if they work, or resources from somewhere else, if they do not work. They can manage the first, unaided, only if their earning power is substantially greater than the cost of childcare. That would make them exceptional, by definition. Sole parents can enjoy the second, unaided, only if they are wealthy, which would make them still more exceptional. The main problem faced by single-parent households is, it is argued, that they are poor. While true, this misses the point. That is precisely why people have found it necessary to combine their resources, including their time, in order to bring up their children. Marriage regulates this partnership. Its essential feature is enduring commitment. This matters because a parent who forgoes future earning opportunities for the sake of children is taking a large risk. Marriage is worthwhile to the extent that it binds future behaviour. The easier divorce becomes, the less reason to marry. So one reason for a more than three-fold increase in the proportion of children born outside wedlock is that it is 'just a piece of paper'. Marriage may no longer embody an enduring commitment. But having children does. To understand the implications, forget gender neutrality, since the tastes of the two sexes evidently diverge. One has a greater preference for having and looking after children. The other has a greater preference for partners who are young. These differences may be the product of conditioning, or they may be biological. It does not matter for this analysis, provided they exist. Set these differences against the nature and costs of child-rearing, the fact that children are consumption rather than investment goods and the disappearance of the binding element in marriage. What are the implications? First, women are bound to end up as the caring parents, because men will exploit them: in 1991, 94 per cent of lone-parent families with dependent children were headed by women. Second, men who gain little pleasure from their children will see little benefit to themselves in bearing the costs, particularly if doing so reduces their attraction to other women. Third, women will limit the size of their families to what they find enjoyable. Perhaps the most important implication, however, is that the choice of mate matters more to women than to men, because they end up with the irreversible commitment: the one to their children. Men may propose, but women dispose. The least they will want is someone able and (ostensibly) willing to provide the resources needed for rearing their children. Unfortunately, the proportion of such men is in decline. The labour force participation rate for men aged 15 to 64 shrank from 93 per cent to 83 per cent between 1973 and 1993. There has also been a big increase in the inequality of male earnings. In the late 1980s the ratio of the earnings of men in the top 10 per cent of earners to that of those in the bottom 10 per cent was 3.4 to one. In the late 1970s it had been only 2.4 to one. Women are competing for a reduced pool of useful husbands. The unsurprising result is polygyny (multiple matings by men), mostly serial. The female search for men with significant earning potential matches the male yearning for younger partners. For the past 20 years the rate of marriage by widowers and divorced men (as a proportion of widowers and divorced men) has exceeded that for bachelors, while the reverse has been true for women: the remarriage rate for widows and divorced women is less than half the marriage rate for spinsters. These differences are sexist and ageist: the positive gap between male and female re-marriage rates appears in the 30 to 34 age group and increases rapidly thereafter. So successful older men find new partners; their former spouses, unless divorced young, become single-parents; second families compete for limited resources with first ones; and less successful men enjoy little chance of marriage. It is possible then to explain the increase in the choice of sole-parenthood by women from poorer classes. It is also possible to explain the rise of serial polygyny. But most women can still not bring up their children unaided and most men cannot - and, even if they can, do not wish to - support more than one family, unaided. There has to be another actor. That actor is the welfare state. The hated Child Support Agency was an attempt by the government to re-privatise costs that had been socialised. Why this has been tried and why it is failing will be the subject of a second column.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRWINDALE LENS PRODUCER SUES FEDERAL AGENCY  </P> <P> An Irwindale-based manufacturer of high-technology artificial lenses that  replace natural lenses following cataract surgery on Tuesday sued the federal  government to overturn the Medicare reimbursement rate for the lenses.  </P> <P> In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Ioptex Research  Inc. alleged that the Department of Health and Human Services' Health Care  Financing Administration violated federal law when it set a flat $200  reimbursement rate to ambulatory surgical centers for all intraocular lenses  they use.  </P> <P> Executives of Southern California companies, which represent 75% of the  nation's intraocular lens industry, have been trying since 1988 to prevent  implementation of the rate. They contend that the rate, which became effective  on March 12, is too low.  </P> <P> Since most cataract surgery is performed on elderly people eligible for  Medicare benefits, the Medicare reimbursement rate is critical to the success  of the industry.  </P> <P> Ioptex's court complaint said HCFA relied on an "outdated and scientifically  flawed" report to establish the payment rates for intraocular lenses.  </P> <P> Ioptex President Joseph Mandato said in an interview that the federal agency  audited 28 of some 500 ambulatory surgical centers and chose to set the rate  based on prices for lenses paid by the 11 centers with the lowest-cost lenses.  It did not take into account the cost of making different types of lenses, he  said.  </P> <P> Mandato said the industry is very competitive and the centers paying the lower  prices were getting generic, out-of-style lenses. Ioptex, a subsidiary of  Britain's Smith+Nephew PLC, with revenues of $57 million a year, sells standard  intraocular lenses. But 60% of its lenses are high-technology lenses, he said.  </P> <P> The $200 uniform rate "unreasonably depresses the reimbursement rate for  high-technology lenses," thereby making it impractical for ambulatory surgical  centers to buy them, the complaint said. It added that Ioptex will be harmed  unless Medicare sets a rate that is "accurately based on the reasonable cost"  of the class of lenses sold by Ioptex and other manufacturers.  </P> <P> The suit asks for an injunction barring the new rate and a directive for  Medicare to establish a rate for different classes of lenses. Additionally, it  seeks retroactive reimbursement to surgical centers for the "reasonable" cost  of lenses they purchased after March 12.  </P></p>

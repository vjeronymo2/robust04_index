			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second in series of reports entitled: "Sights and Sounds </F> of Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342  7160): "Largest Prison in Far East -- Past and Present"]    [Text] Shanghai 21 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At No. 147  Changyang Road, in Shanghai, the strong fortifications, and  solemn, severe atmosphere are quite out of place with the busy,  bustling, and boisterous life around it; for there is an  "arsenal" inside this metropolis -- a prison holding some 3,500  hardened robbers, killers, rapists, embezzlers...    When one walks through the three iron gates, one finds that  the active atmosphere inside the prison does not coincide with  high walls, electric barbed-wire network, dark and worn prison  cells: To the accompaniment of roaring motors, prisoners are  found sewing, processing shirts; on the basketball court,  prisoners in gray prison uniforms dash to and fro, contending  for the ball; now and then, we see squads of prisoners moving  along in formation.    This is the Shanghai Municipal Prison, and its popular name  has been "The Tilanqiao [the Basket Bridge 2251 4691 2890]  Prison," which was first built in 1901. This offspring of  colonialist rule over China was said in those days to be "the  largest prison in the Far East." Over the years, it has come  under the jurisdiction of Britain, Japan, the Wang Ching-wei  Collaborationist Government, and the Kuomintang Government. In  these prison cells were held such well-known figures as Zhang  Tai-yan, Zou Yong, Ren Bishi, and Zhang Aiping.    One finds such questions as "Who are you? What is this  place? What are you doing here?" written everywhere on the  prison walls. According to Warden Mai Linhua's briefings, most  of the inmates held here are felons, serving prison sentences of  10 years or more. They are put in different cells, and they  undergo different kinds of education and transformation  according to their different inclinations, based on whether  their offenses involve property, sex or violence. The inmates  work eight hours each day; in the evening, they take part in  cultural or technical studies.    This reporter visits the rubber cell, the "pavilion for  trouble- makers," and the "indoor execution ground," which were  set up in the old days. They remind him of a commentary carried  in "DONGFANG ZAZHI" [Oriental Journal], which was published in  those years. The commentary read: "The maltreatment of inmates  in the prison run by Westerners in Shanghai is the talk of the  town. In recent years, cases of inmates' dying in prison have  been numerous, and Chinese residents turn pale, even at the  mention of the prison."    Today, the inmates here manage their own affairs to a great  extent. A committee for activists in transformation through  labor is set up in every unit which is responsible for the  inmates' study, food, and labor, and for safeguarding prison  rules, regulations, and discipline. The committee is re-elected  every year, and those found ineligible are removed. An  assessment of each inmate is conducted at the end of each  quarter, and is treated differently according to his/her  behavior. In 1993, 966 inmates were granted commutation of  sentence or parole.    On each floor of cells, this reporter finds a "letterbox for  procuratorial personnel," as well as a "letterbox for the  Warden." This reporter is told that inmates may conduct  accusations or appeals via the first letterbox so as to protect  their own legitimate rights and interests. This letterbox can  be opened only by the cadre from the procuratorial organization  who is stationed in the prison. Through the second letterbox,  inmates may offer opinions and suggestions on prison management  and labor transformation.    Each inmate spends 62 yuan on meals every month. Those who  overfulfill their production quotas are given bonuses. In  recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Prison has prepared its  cafeteria in a scientific way, based on the general diseases  surfacing among the inmates during their imprisonment. The  cafeteria categorizes its meals into the following categories:  regular, nutritious, elderly, minority nationality, medical  treatment through diet, and birthday celebration. The prison  authorities conduct scientific analysis of the menu each week,  and in the following week, they improve certain dishes found to  be less nourishing.    Cultural and sports activities behind the iron bars are rich  and colorful. There is a radio station, a television station,  and a transformation-through-labor paper, in addition to a  poetry society, a fashion-show team, and an artistic performance  troupe. A large sports meet is held every three years, a  theatrical festival every two years, and a fine arts exhibition  each year. Bridge tournaments and flower and book exhibitions  are held often.    Owing to limited conditions, this classic prison has not  gone  through any significant transformation or expansion, and the 3.3  square meters floor space of each cell in the British design  remains intact. To meet the needs of the situation, Shanghai  Municipality has built a high-standard prison in suburban  Qingpu. Qingpu Prison is one of the most modern prisons in  China today, and will become a showcase for China in the  transformation of criminals.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Feb (INA)--Lt. Gen. Engineer 'Amir  Muhammad Rashid, director of the Military Industrialization  Organization [MIO], has expressed amazement over the  contradictions contained in the statements Ambassador Rolf  Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special Commission, made to  the U.S. television Cable News Network [CNN], yesterday,  Tuesday, 15 February.    In a statement to INA, Lt. Gen. Rashid added that in his  statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq continues to  withhold information on chemical weapons.    The MIO director urged the chairman of the UN Special  Commission to shoulder his responsibilities fairly, to confine  himself to the tasks of the UN Special Commission as spelled out  in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and to steer  clear of the U.S. anti-Iraq political maneuvers and pressures,  which have nothing to do with the UN security Council  resolutions.    The following is the text of the statement:    MIO Director General Lt. Gen. 'Amir Muhammad Rashid has  said:  We have received with extreme amazement the statements  Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special  Commission, made to CNN on 15 February 1994.    In these statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq  continues to withhold part of the information pertaining to  chemical weapons. As a matter of fact, Ekeus has made it clear  in letters addressed to me that Iraq has provided the required  information regarding its previous programs, that this  information is credible and comprehensive, and that it is  sufficient for the purposes of the UN Special Commission, as  enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  Hence, his recent pronouncements and statements to CNN  misrepresent facts, and contradict the documents he himself has  submitted to the UN Security Council.    Lt. Gen. Rashid said: It has become clear to us,  particularly  after Iraq accepted Resolution 715 in November 1993, that  Ambassador Ekeus makes himself part of the U.S. political  maneuvers which seek to prolong the unjust blockade imposed on  Iraq. Therefore, he makes contradictory statements serving in  fact the purpose of U.S. maneuvers.    Rashid continued: We ask the chairman of the Special  Commission to shoulder his responsibilities in an objective  manner, adhere to the Commission's tasks as defined by the UN  Security Council resolutions, and dissociate himself from the  U.S. anti-Iraq maneuvers and political pressure which has  nothing to do with the Security Council resolutions.    On Ekeus statements on the effects of the blockade on the  Iraqi people and his arbitrary criticism of Iraq for not  implementing what he called a mechanism presented to it by the  United Nations to sell a fixed amount of oil to buy food and  medicine under international supervision, Rashid said: First,  this subject is not within the jurisdiction of the chairman of  the Special Commission. It is within the jurisdiction of the UN  general secretariat. Second, Ekeus wants to dissociate himself  from being largely responsible for continuing the blockade  imposed on Iraq and hence the continuation of the Iraqi people's  suffering. This is because under U.S. pressure, Ekeus is  reluctant to tell the truth which he knows only too well;  namely, that Iraq has abided by UN resolutions. Had he  possessed the courage and objectivity required from an  international official, he would have presented his report on  this issue to the Security Council, thus, leading to the  implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and ending the  Iraqi peoples suffering. The blame he levels at Iraq because it  rejects arrangements that infringe on its sovereignty and  dignity is blatantly ridiculous.</p>

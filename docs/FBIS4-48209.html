			<p>BFN     [Text] As the tribal infighting within ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] continues, Krahn  loyalists have captured Suehn, some 25 miles outside Monrovia.  Reports say scores of civilians are fleeing the combat zone and  pouring into Veginga outside Monrovia.    The latest upsurge in fighting comes in the wake of repeated  failure by the two opposing sides to honor a cease-fire  agreement to end the fighting.</p>

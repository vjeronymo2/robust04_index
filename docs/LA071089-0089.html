			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAGEANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN ART  </P> <P> Laguna Beach's Pageant of the Masters has always taken the long view,  delighting its adherents and annoying those who decry the event's lack of  contemporary relevance.  </P> <P> In the pageant's 56th year, the grounds for the debate were never so clear as  during the narration for the showing of "Spirits of the Chinese Pagoda,"  sculptures of legendary beings that watch over the rooftops of Chinese  villages.  </P> <P> No mention is made of the current repression in China, in which the Communist  leadership is carrying out mass arrests of artists and film makers along with  the usual political suspects. Instead, the Chinese art is presented in nearly  timeless fashion, with narrator Thurl Ravenscroft noting, "As this Eastern land  opens its doors to the West," the spirit-statues "bid welcome and offer their  blessings to all."  </P> <P> The brief historical reference is to China's previous opening to the West at  the turn of the century. But given current events, the irony of that hopeful  view is inescapable.  </P> <P> Over the years, the pageant has either avoided the temptation to comment or --  as detractors have charged -- lacked the courage or imagination to do so. Its  milieu is human diversity as recorded by the Monets; the Van Goghs; the  Renoirs; the ancient Greek, Roman and Hindu sculptors, the "masters" whose  works outlived the immediate. The thrust seems to be of eternal consequences,  the things of the soul. The thread connecting all these, we are told by the  narrator, is beauty, which requires of the viewer the ability to appreciate.  </P> <P> Because of the pageant's nature -- the posing of live models for a minute or so  in re-creations of artworks -- people are essential to the enterprise. You will  not see a modern work on the order of "White Dot on Black Background" because  it does not meet the pageant's twin criteria: It does not have people in it,  nor is it beautiful to more than a handful of people who must explain why it is  beautiful.  </P> <P> In this sense, the pageant is a bald-faced thumb of the nose at the current art  world, and at current philosophies that, in ratchet-like fashion, relegate  human beings a notch lower every year in the cosmic scheme of things.  </P> <P> Within the context of the pageant's history and mission, one would have to  conclude that director Glen Eytchison succeeded this year as well as in any in  conveying an appreciation of human diversity and beauty -- without controversy,  or at least current controversy.  </P> <P> The pageant opens with a nostalgic look at Laguna Beach's founding through a  series of sepia-toned photos tracing the city's beginnings from a patchwork  collection of shacks by the seaside in the 1880s to an artists' colony  confident enough to put on its first Festival of Arts in the summer of 1933.  The first pageant artwork ever presented was "Girl of the Golden West," in  which Josie Durkem Rice, the original model for the 1914 Louis Betts painting,  reprised her role. This was re-enacted this year, as were James McNeil  Whistler's "My Mother," followed by Sir Thomas Lawrence's "Pinkie" and Sir  Thomas Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," also mainstays of the early pageants.  </P> <P> Then it is on to the current offerings, starting with Donna Schuster's  sunshine-dappled "On the Veranda," followed by the guardian Chinese spirits,  the Currier &amp; Ives' skating-pond paean "Winter Pastime," Maxfield Parrish's  lush "Garden of Allah," Gaston Doin's lively "Carnival" and several other works  before the first-act finale, a multiscene presentation and history of Hopi  kachina dolls.  </P> <P> The crowd-pleasing Hopi exhibit, which takes place on several spots on the  hillsides around the Irvine Bowl as well as on the stage, employs a historical  narrative and sound and lighting effects simulating a thunderstorm to tell the  story of how the kachina dolls are used as spirit surrogates to ward off evil  and to chastise wayward children. It all hangs together nicely.  </P> <P> Other works presented range from an Etruscan fresco circa 480 BC to an ancient  Egyptian necklace to Ken Auster's "Pier Shot," a 1988 watercolor depicting two  surfers approaching the moment of truth in front of pilings at the Huntington  Beach Pier. This last was not quite as well received as some of the others,  perhaps because it lacks the detail characteristic of the early masters' works.  It doesn't look as if it was as hard to bring off, and difficulty of execution  is a criterion for eliciting oohs and ahs.  </P> <P> Despite the pageant's overall lightness of mood, some of the works conceivably  could be controversial, or thought-provoking, depending on the viewer's  ideology. Louis Maurer's 1895 oil, "Great Royal Buffalo Hunt," depicts an  Indian slaying a buffalo as Buffalo Bill Cody looks on as a co-conspirator.  Animal-rights activists can't be happy about such a work presented in  nonjudgmental or even approving fashion.  </P> <P> Women are sent a mixed message at one point in the program. A Nepalese bronze,  "Durga Slaying the Demon," recounts the epic battle when the Hindu goddess  drives out an evil demon lord by magically changing her shape. In the  incarnation at hand, she sports 18 arms. It is a stirring sight, and it could  be a fitting symbol for the modern woman who is supposed to -- and often does  -- do it all. But just as the females in the audience might be starting to hum  "I am woman, hear me roar," the next work presented is "Conversation Plaisir,"  a 19th-Century painting by Victor Gabriel Gilbert that depicts a group of women  quietly enjoying a day by the river -- doing laundry.  </P> <P> Well, at least women are anything but under-represented in the pageant's works.  And women get a break two presentations later with a male nude under glass,  George Thompson and Tom Vincent's 1961 "Orpheus." This acts as a counterbalance  for Robert Krantz's "Fantasy of Wings" earlier in the program, which features a  naked young woman surrounded, but not obscured, by sea gulls.  </P> <P> During the entire pageant, an orchestra fronted by music  director-composer-conductor Richard Henn showed sprightly versatility in as  eclectic a program of accompaniment as one could imagine.  </P> <P> Also adding to the mood -- or, more appropriately, moods -- were anecdotes and  quotes in the narration from commentators as disparate as Mark Twain ("I don't  like work -- even if someone else does it"), James McNeil Whistler (who, when  confronted by a student who had announced "I paint what I see," answered, "Yes,  but the tragedy of this is when you see what you have painted") and current  humorist Dave Barry (New York "is the only city in the country with an official  arm gesture").  </P> <P> Lighthearted moments in the program were provided by the Tiffany Circus  Collection, a colorful group of figurines of circus performers, and by the  Victorian Valentines, a series of lacy, ornate paper cutouts that celebrate  romantic love.  </P> <P> Oops, there they go, trumpeting traditional values again. No wonder the cynics  hate this pageant. Chaste romantic love is so uncool, don't you know, in an age  of herpes, AIDS and palimony suits. And, of course, unrealistic.  </P> <P> Well, they haven't seen anything yet.  </P> <P> The pageant delivers a coup de grace to cynicism in a finale that, while  infused with Christian symbolism, transcends religious doctrines through a  careful narrative.  </P> <P> Since 1936, every pageant but one has ended with Leonardo da Vinci's "Last  Supper." This year, the presentation is preceded by a quote from da Vinci, who  explained his quest in painting Jesus' disciples this way: "There could be no  greater challenge than to reflect the intent of a man's soul."  </P> <P> At this point, confirmed cynics might be advised to close not only their eyes  but also their ears, for the narration ends with the words of Saint Paul, who  declared that the way of the righteous is to cling to "faith, hope and love."  </P> <P> No, the pageant will probably never include "White Dot on Black Background," or  "Keg O' Plastic Inner Tubes."  </P> <P> But then, that's not what it's all about.  </P> <P>  The Pageant of the Masters continues through Aug. 27 at the Irvine Bowl, 650  Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Show time: 8:30 nightly. Tickets: $9 to $35,  including admission to the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts, an exhibition by  local artists and crafts people that is running concurrently on the festival  grounds. Admission to the festival only is $1 to $2. Information: (714)  494-1145.  </P> <P> </P></p>

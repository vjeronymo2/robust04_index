			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Tough action urged to cut government borrowing - State indebtedness threatens growth prospects / More turmoil on foreign exchange markets forecast GOVERNMENTS across Europe should take tough action to reduce state borrowing despite the strains this might cause on already weak economies, central bankers said yesterday. According to the annual report of the committee of European Community central bank governors, measures either to reduce state spending or increase taxes are required to avoid the risk of an 'overburdening' of monetary policies which may reduce growth prospects over the longer term. The committee, in only its second annual report since it was set up in 1964, is far from upbeat about economic prospects. It forecasts EC growth of less than 1 per cent this year, even less than the subdued levels of 1991 and 1992. While inflation has fallen generally across the community in the past two years, 'a significant moderation in wage increases is still needed where labour costs rise at a rapid pace,' the governors warn. In the light of the strains since last autumn in the European exchange rate mechanism, moves towards pruning high budget deficits are needed to strengthen confidence in government policies in financial markets, the report says. Ultimately such fiscal tightening should permit lower interest rates and hence allow a resumption of stable growth across the continent. The recent ERM changes - Italy and Britain have suspended membership while Ireland, Spain and Portugal have devalued - 'should have helped to correct the effects of past (economic) imbalances', the governors say. However, they warn that the series of exchange-rate movements, which have helped the competitiveness of specific countries and permitted Britain to cut short-term interest rates by 4 percentage points, 'should not be construed as having eliminated the constraints on domestic economic policies'. The ever-closer integration of EC countries leaves 'no alternative' to close co-ordination of economic policies. Across the EC, public finances have seen a large deterioration, with the ratio of overall government borrowing to economic output rising to 5.3 per cent last year from the 'already unsustainably high' 4.7 per cent in 1991 and 4.2 per cent the year before. The economic outlook for the EC this year is relatively gloomy, after the poor performance last year in which growth across the community fell to 1.1 per cent from 1.2 per cent in 1991. During 1993, economic activity in the EC 'is likely to receive only a modest stimulus from external demand' from big trade partners such as Japan and the US. Consequently growth may dip below 1 per cent. Inflationary pressures are expected to fall slightly. But even with the likely fragility in the European economy in the coming months 'sight should not be lost of the need for fiscal consolidation' because of the long-term need to bring down borrowing to the level envisaged in the Maastricht treaty of 3 per cent. While increases in borrowing are to some degree explained by higher social security spending and a reduced tax take caused by the economic slowdown, EC countries should take steps to ensure increases in deficits go no further than the 'normal automatic effects' of a slowdown in growth. The report says the increase in the budget deficit in the UK, from 2.7 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 6.1 per cent in 1992, was 'particularly striking'. The only other EC nations with higher deficit to output ratios last year were Belgium with a ratio of 6.9 per cent, Greece with 9.1 per cent and Italy with 10 per cent.

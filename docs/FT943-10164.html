			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Halifax in talks to buy BNP's Pounds 1.5bn UK mortgage business Halifax Building Society is negotiating to buy the UK mortgage business of Banque Nationale de Paris, which has outstanding mortgages of Pounds 1.5bn. The move would give Halifax, already Britain's largest mortgage lender, a further 0.5 per cent of the total UK mortgage market, lifting its share to 16 per cent. The two organisations, which announced the move yesterday, expect the deal to be concluded by the end of this year. BNP Mortgages will become part of Halifax Home Loans, the society's subsidiary which already administers some Pounds 1.1bn of mortgages acquired from other lenders. The company, which has 150 staff and 22,000 customers, is being bought as a going concern. In contrast to the position that often applies when a large high street lender buys mortgages from a centralised lender - which sells through intermediaries rather than a branch network - BNP's customers on the standard variable rate are paying less than those of Halifax. BNP's rate is 7.59 per cent, while Halifax's is 7.64 per cent. Halifax has set itself the aim of significantly increasing its share of mortgage lending. Its share of net UK mortgage lending carried out in 1993 was 18.77 per cent, while Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, was just behind with 18.74 per cent. Mr Robert Amzallag, managing director of BNP's UK operations, said the mortgages were almost exclusively residential and almost all were on variable rather than fixed rates. BNP Mortgages was bought by its parent company from Chemical Bank of the US in 1988. Mr Amzallag said BNP bought the company on the basis that large European banks should look to operate across Europe in retail banking in the post-1992 single European market. However, since its privatisation last year, BNP has focused in markets outside France on wholesale banking, corporate lending and private banking. Mr Michel Pebereau, BNP chairman, has said BNP is looking to forge commercial links with other European banks to expand its retail banking. BNP is not the only French bank leaving the UK mortgage market. Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, expects to acquire Credit Agricole's Pounds 600m UK residential mortgage book this month. See Lex</p>

Unocal said it would narrow its exploration focus worldwide, consolidate regional offices and consider the sale of its geothermal and power generating operations. The oil company will incur most of the cost from its restructuring over the next four months. The plan has been designed to boost the division's after-tax cash flow by Dollars 100m annually next year, the company said. The moves are part of a restructuring announced last week. Unocal plans to sell more than Dollars 700m in assets over the next few years, slash its work force and boost after-tax cash flow by Dollars 200m a year. Additional asset sales and job cuts are expected to follow in other divisions. Unocal joins a host of other leading oil companies planning to sell domestic oil and gas assets to concentrate on newer fields abroad.</p>

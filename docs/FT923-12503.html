			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: All the ingredients for a very lethal economic cocktail Sir, Mr Major, in his wisdom, has said that he would like the British public to spend, not save, now that inflation is at present around 4 per cent. Where is the incentive? High interest rates encourage saving and if we all know that in a year's time any goods we may wish to buy will only be 4 per cent more expensive, why bring forward purchases? The high pound is devastating our competitiveness in export markets. Watch the record keepers issuing ever worse balance of payments figures and watch further sectors of the economy disappear as a result of these economic policies. Throw in a massive public sector borrowing requirement (at high interest rates) to pay for the transfer payments within the economy and you have a very lethal cocktail.

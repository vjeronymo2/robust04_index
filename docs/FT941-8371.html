			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fishing: Expert? You must be joking The word has a fine, satisfying resonance to it: 'He's something of an expert on . . .' or 'She's the leading expert in her field . . .' Yes, it must be a grand thing to be acknowledged as an expert. But how do you set about it? It cannot be done by self-proclamation. To introduce your contribution by saying: 'Actually, I'm a bit of an expert on . . .' is to invite derision. I know, because I have tried it. No, it must be done by the acclamation of others. You must infiltrate their collective consciousness, blind them with your science, seize every opportunity to impress upon them that you know infinitely more than they ever thought possible. You also need unshakable self-belief and enough arrogance to silence the doubters. A modicum of expertise helps, too. When considering my own qualifications to join the vast congregation of experts on angling, I must be clear-headed. I have never had an original thought about the techniques of the sport in the 30-odd years I have been at it. I depend now, and always will, on the efforts of others. I should like to think that I am quick-witted enough to have developed the habit of passing off the bright ideas of others as my own, with a fair chance of getting away with it. But the fatal flaw, for me, is self-belief. Sooner or later, the would-be expert has to put himself to the test and expose his expertise to public scrutiny. Having now done this, I have decided to return to the ranks. It happened when I was inveigled into joining a panel of experts summoned to field questions from the Berkshire branch of the Salmon and Trout Association at their annual meeting in January. With me on the platform were two undoubted specimens of the true expert breed: Neil Patterson, a brilliant chalk stream fisher and outstanding fly dresser; and John Maitland, a member of the British fly fishing team and a renowned extractor of monster trout from Rutland Water. The first question concerned barb-less hooks, and I made an ass of myself by regurgitating some theory I had half-read in an American magazine that morning. Then, a lady asked if the panel considered the colour of a fly line to be matter of any importance. 'Tom,' the chairman said to me, 'any thoughts on that one?' Well, my own fly line was once white and is now grey and cracked with age. What concerns me, though, is not its colour but its habit of sinking. I told the questioner that I used whatever line I had until I could use it no more, then bought the cheapest replacement. I could tell from her face that this was not the expert's reply. Someone else wondered if the panel had a particular tactic for those glaring summer days when not a fish will rise. I suggested going home. Patterson proposed using a bluebottle fly. I could tell which answer impressed, and it was not mine. So it went on. Did the panel regard a salmon fly tied on a treble hook superior to a double? The matter had never crossed my mind. Why do so many right-handed fly fishermen hold their rods in their left hand? I could not even remember which hand I use. Someone asked if fish could hear. I said they surely could - but did they dream? At least that got a laugh. Afterwards everyone, from the chairman down, was most kind. But I know now that I do not wish to be an expert, anyway. When you think about it, what is the synonym for expert? Know-all, which isn't half so pleasing. No, let me be an anonymous, amateurish mediocrity any day.</p>

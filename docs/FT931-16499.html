			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Report helps Siddons Ramset resist takeover SIDDONS Ramset, the Australian hardware group fighting two takeover bids, got support yesterday from a stockbrokers' report valuing it higher than both offers. Falkiners, a Melbourne stockbroking firm, said the bids 'seriously undervalue' Siddons, adding its shares were worth at least ADollars 2.65 (USDollars 1.84), including a 20 per cent premium for control. BBA, the UK toolmaker, has bid ADollars 1.81 a share through Pacific BBA, and Illinois Tool Works, the US group, has bid ADollars 2 a share through W. A. Deutsher.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Kuchma invites IMF head to talks in Kiev Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian president-elect, has invited Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to come to Ukraine to negotiate an economic restructuring package 'in the very near future'. His decision to open talks with the IMF even before his inaugaration tomorrow suggests that Mr Kuchma, who benefited from pro-Russian and pro-communist sentiment in last week's election, intends to pursue a different agenda now that he is in office. 'I hope that in the nearest future Mr Camdessus will come here,' Mr Kuchma said at the weekend. 'He promised me that he would come. He said if there are concrete proposals for reforms he will come to Kiev.' Mr Kuchma was swept to power in the election by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea who were won over by his calls for closer links with Russia. Now safely elected, Mr Kuchma is softening his pro-Russian rhetoric. He said he favoured 'a Euro-Asian common market', but not a return to the rouble from its present currency, the coupon. As for political union, Mr Kuchma said that the Commonwealth of Independent States was sufficient, indicating that there would be no transfer of power from Kiev to Moscow. Instead, Mr Kuchma's initial overtures have been toward the west - he met the US ambassador the day after the election - and his early statements have been pro-reform. He is eager to revive stalled negotiations with the IMF, and claims to be committed to the austere policies the IMF could demand. The surprisingly pro-western orientation of Mr Kuchma, who was once director of the factory which built the Soviet Union's most powerful nuclear missiles, extends to nuclear disarmament. 'I will stick to the agreement signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin and Clinton,' Mr Kuchma said of the tripartite deal made in January in which Ukraine pledged to give up all the nuclear weapons on its territory. Mr Kuchma said the Dollars 350m (Pounds 230.2m) Ukraine was granted by the US to help finance dismantling the missiles is insufficient. 'This is an ecological problem and the west, including Europe, should help us.' Western aid officials say that if the Kuchma administration rapidly pulls together a reform programme, Ukraine could reach an agreement with the IMF for an economic restructuring loan of Dollars 700m as early as the end of August.

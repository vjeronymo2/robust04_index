			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkish troops that have been in northern  Iraq since last Tuesday [26 April] have reportedly started to  establish a buffer zone on the border to cut off logistic  supplies to Kurdish separatists.    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday that a massive  operation against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)  was continuing in the region, and made "a final appeal" to  separatist militants to surrender before the summer. "Our state  will embrace anyone who surrenders," Ciller said, as local  sources in the southeast reported an immense troop deployment to  the region and a buildup of Turkish forces on the Iraqi border.    Sources said Tuesday that there was a heavy bombardment of  separatist targets in the Shiva and Haftanin regions of northern  Iraq and that a land operation was continuing near Sinah. A  major deployment of Turkish troops was also observed in the  vicinity of Kani Masi, an area previously cleared by warplanes  and helicopter gunships. An unofficial Turkish military  headquarters was established in Kani Masi on Monday, and  helicopters were ferrying in new troops the following day. One  unconfirmed report had it that Turkish troops had also crossed  into northern Iraq near the Iranian border and were accompanied  by peshmerges of Mas'ud Barzani's Kurdistan Democrat Party (KDP).    Operations in Turkey also continued, with new vehicles and  troops arriving in the border region and land and air operations  continuing on Gabar mountain. Local sources said villages on  Gabar and Mt. Cudi had been evacuated and that the civilians had  fled either to Kumcati or northern Iraq.    Addressing her ruling True Path Party (DYP) group meeting on  Tuesday, Ciller implied that the Turkish campaign would gain  momentum by this summer and defined the struggle against  terrorism as "Turkey's most important problem."    She denied separatist claims that Turkey mistreated those  who  surrendered and said: "Come and surrender before it's too late.  Your end should not come in sorrow. Come and let us enjoy the  resources of this country together."    Her statement came a day after a senior PKK leader claimed  that Turkey aimed at creating a permanent security zone within  Iraq and official sources in Ankara said that the Turkish  presence in the region would last throughout the summer. In an  interview he gave to the PKK-affiliated Kurd-A news agency on  Monday, Military Council commander Cemil Bayik (Cuma) claimed  that Turkey wanted to occupy part of the region.    He alleged that troops would be advancing southwards in the  coming days and suggested troops might even reach Zakho and  Dahuk. Bayil also described the operation as more important than  Turkey's incursion into Iraq in 1992 and said that this time  Turkey intended to stay put.    Local sources claimed on Monday that Turkish tanks moving  out  of the Zap region of Turkey's Hakkari Province had moved into  Iraq and had reached Kani Masi via a mountain road. Turkish  commandos, supported by warplanes and military helicopters,  entered the region last week and local sources have put the  total number of troops currently in northern Iraq at around  5,000.    Witnesses said hundreds of paramilitary village guards were  assisting the troops. As part of the operation on Gabar  Mountain, troops have seized nine mortars, seven anti-aircraft  guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70  anti-personnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000  rounds of ammunition, in one week.    Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the  Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security  personnel, including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers  and village guards, to fight the separatists in the region. PKK  leader Abdullah Ocalan said earlier that this was "the final  conflict" between his organization and Turkey, warning all  militants to be prepared for a massive crackdown.</p>

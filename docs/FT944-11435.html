			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Tragedy of the useless arts: Philip Crowe asks whether poems and opera can make the human species less brutish Last year it was a concrete house which won the Turner Prize. It was denounced by one expert in modern art as the 'biggest piece of junk ever'. This year's hot tip for the Pounds 20,000 award is five solid iron sculptures of a naked man, each bent in a 90' angle and arranged in different positions. The entry, called 'Testing a World View', is said by the sculptor to show the 'western culture's right-angled psychological dimension. Flung around the room, they demonstrate the current crisis of this kind of world view.' Someone once said that the definition of the highest art is that one should feel that life is this, and not otherwise. It may be hard, but not necessarily impossible, to feel that life is the concrete inside of a house or the random arrangement of solid iron figures. The highest art gives a vision of what human life can be. It opens up possibilities dimly seen. It lifts the spirit, and because it has the power to make people feel that 'life is this and not otherwise,' it has the power to transform human life. Yet, in spite of all this, art remains essentially useless, particularly when usefulness is measured by the criteria of the market economy. In his earlier life, Leo Tolstoy, author of War and Peace, was strenuously opposed to any idea that art can be useful. The true purpose of art, he maintained, was 'to make people love life in all its countless, inexhaustible manifestations. If I were told,' he wrote, 'that I could write a novel whereby I might irrefutably establish what seemed to me the correct point of view on all social problems, I would not even devote two hours to such a novel; but if I were to be told that what I should write would be read in about 20 years by those who are now children, and that they would laugh and cry over it and love life, I would devote all my own life and all my energies to it.' Sadly in his later life, Tolstoy abandoned this view. Instead he held that art should be made to serve good moral purposes, and he tried to buttress his arguments by telling a famous story. It is the story of a princess who goes to the theatre, driven there in her coach by her old and faithful coachman. The tragedy on stage moves her to tears. Meanwhile outside the night is bitterly cold and a real tragedy takes place. Her faithful coachman, waiting to take her home, freezes to death. Tolstoy intended the story as a dreadful example of the failure to make connections between art and good behaviour; but all his passionate arguments failed. They proved less telling than the story itself, of the weeping princess and the freezing coachman, which is in fact a parable of the uselessness of art. Kenneth Clark, whose personal view of civilisation was so cultured and compelling, grew up to love and trust paintings more than people. His son tells that 'he found that art could give him tenderness and solace and energy and tranquillity and a beauty without asking for anything in return.' Human beings he found more problematic. His wife, crushed by the casual nature of his many transient relationships, found solace not in art but in alcohol. The irony is greater even than in Tolstoy's story - Lord Clark on television eloquently extolling the glories of civilisation and art, while at home his wife drank herself into uncivilised oblivion. Exposure to centuries of great art does not seem to have done much for the morality of either nations or individuals. Art is useless. It has no immediate, practical value. Technological progress has done more than art to soften the brutishness of the human species. Looking at paintings does not feed the hungry, listening to Beethoven does not house the homeless. But art has a deep, essential uselessness. Like religion, art is concerned with ultimate ends, with what human life is really about. Art which degenerates into propaganda, which has to be useful in some practical way, misses the point. In itself, art is impotent. To experience great art may transform human life, but it will not necessarily do so. Great art invites us to see things as they truly are. It illumines the world, and shows us what might be. It can take us out of ourselves. Art, at its best, is a living experience, as profound as that which TS Eliot describes when he writes of: 'Music heard so deeply That it is not heard at all, But you are the music While the music lasts.' What we make of that living experience is up to us.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philips lines up Dollars 2.5bn facility Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has concluded a Dollars 2.5bn revolving stand-by credit facility with a consortium of 53 international banks. The deal, the largest facility arranged for a Dutch borrower, marks a step forward in the company's efforts to restructure its debt. The stand-by credit facility, arranged by CS First Boston, is a first for Philips. It underlines the company's improved position in world capital markets, after grappling with heavy corporate losses in the early 1990s. Philips has been pursuing a policy of better asset management. It said yesterday it would use part of its existing cash surplus to pay off the remaining Dollars 800m of a Dollars 2bn loan taken out in 1990 to help fund part of the 'Centurion' package of reforms and restructuring. This money is expected to be paid back by the end of this month. News of the credit facility helped Philips' shares to close up Fl 0.60 at Fl 53.70. The electronics company said it felt able to reduce its cash surplus now that it knew it could draw on large credit facilities if needed. There were no specific plans for spending any of the Dollars 2.5bn which the company is allowed to draw under the facility. Philips' credit also includes a 'swing-line' facility for 'same-day' borrowing of Dollars 500m, if necessary. This is usually a prerequisite for starting a commercial paper programme, but Philips said it had no immediate plans for such a move. Philips will pay an annual fee of 0.1875 per cent for the availability of the stand-by credit.</p>

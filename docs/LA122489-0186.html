			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P>  CALARTS ALUMNI  </P> <P> "The revival of Conceptual Art in the last five years can be traced to some  extent to CalArts graduates who moved to New York," said journalist Richard B.  Woodward in a recent article in the New York Times. "CalArts students have  swarmed over both coasts like a pack of elite professional soldiers."  </P> <P> Like the Bauhaus in the '30s, Los Angeles' California Institute of the Arts  revolutionized art school in the '80s. A small private academy located in the  Valencia area, CalArts took higher learning out of the ivory tower and into the  marketplace. A theoretically rigorous school that emphasized idea over craft,  CalArts trained students to talk about their art with sophistication (how to  deliver a sales pitch in other words), and considers it a central  responsibility to enlighten young artists to the harsher realities of the art  business.  </P> <P> Drilling their students to be media savvy, CalArts has been faulted for  producing artists whose sense of careerism takes precedence over all else, but  you can't argue with results. Prominently featured in all the Whitney Biennals  of the '80s, CalArts graduates also dominated MOCA's recent "Forest of Signs"  exhibition -- 11 of the 30 artists in the show graduated from the school. Among  CalArts thriving alumni are Matt Mullican, Mike Kelley, Barbara Bloom, Ross  Bleckner, Troy Brauntuch, Eric Fishl, David Salle and Ashley Bickerton.  </P> <P> Artist John Baldessari is widely credited with shaping the school's aesthetic  (he recently left his post there), but he had help. Michael Asher and Douglas  Huebler are major campus gurus, and the roster of artists who've taught there  is a who's who of contemporary culture. Jonathan Borofsky, Ravi Shankar, Laurie  Anderson, Susan Rothenberg, Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, Elizabeth Murray,  Sherrie Levine, Roberto Rossellini, Judy Pfaff and Barbara Kruger all did  stints there.  </P> <P> CalArts' days as the the country's leading art think tank may be numbered,  however. The CalArts aesthetic currently dominates the art world, so a  stylistic insurrection is bound to be brewing someplace else.  </P> <P> And, as art critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe observes (having taught at the school  for several years), "CalArts was once an alternative, but it's now become the  academy."

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: European chemicals face the acid test / A look at the market implications of increased competition from eastern manufacturers THE WEST European chemical industry has been making vociferous complaints about the damage being wrought by increasing levels of east and central European imports. Last week, Cefic, the European chemical industry's trade association, urged the EC to implement trade instruments against some imports from the region. The grumbling comes in spite of the large overall benefits to the EC's chemical industry from the opening of east and central European markets. EC chemical exports to Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania increased from Ecu1.38bn (Pounds 1.06bn) in 1990 to Ecu2.10bn last year, according to figures from Eurostat, the EC's statistics institute. The EC's surplus in chemicals trade with its eastern neighbours rose to Ecu1.01bn last year from Ecu527m in 1990. A large proportion of that improvement has been in high value medicines. The EC's surplus in pharmaceuticals rose from Ecu175m in 1990 to Ecu371m last year. However, such successes in high-value products are of little consolation to west European commodity chemical companies suffering the brunt of east European imports. The loudest complaints have come from west European companies manufacturing fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of nylon), and melamine (a plastic). Imports of east European PVC, for example, have increased from 84,000 tonnes in 1989 to 270,000 tonnes last year. Soda ash imports from the east have risen from 27,000 tonnes to 162,000 tonnes. And imports of caprolactam have gone up from 606 tonnes to 33,000 tonnes. These imports have replaced west European production at a time when manufacturers have been grappling with sluggish or falling demand. Western manufacturers also argue that the flood of eastern imports has depressed west European price levels, because the imports have been sold at unduly low prices. Admittedly, some sectors were suffering from significant structural overcapacity before the appearance of large-scale eastern imports. Nevertheless, the problem is serious in some markets, claims Mr Hugo Lever, director general of Cefic. Mr Richard Bauer, secretary general of the European Fertilisers Manufacturers' Association (EFMA), warns: 'We want to help these countries, but not if it means committing suicide.' Last year, the west European fertiliser industry lost Dollars 1.1bn on a turnover of Dollars 8.4bn. Between 1988-89 and 1991-92 imports of nitrogen fertilisers from central and east Europe, excluding the former Soviet Union, have more than doubled from 366,000 tonnes to 827,000 tonnes, according to the EFMA. Their share of the EC market has increased from 4 per cent to 9 per cent. Imports from the former Soviet Union have increased from 59,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes. 'It's not just a question of the increasing penetration by east European imports. It's the prices at which they are coming in. They've got no idea of costs,' says Mr Bauer. The position in PVC is broadly similar to that in fertilisers. Manufacturers claim east and central European imports have aggravated an already difficult situation. Nearly half of PVC imports are now from eastern European suppliers. Polish imports have increased from 17,000 tonnes in 1989 to about 67,000 tonnes last year, according to Cefic. Over the same period, imports from the Czech and Slovak republics have risen from 28,000 tonnes to 75,000 tonnes. By 1992, east European imports captured about 9 per cent of the EC market. Mrs Josee Lafleur at Cefic argues most of the damage in the PVC market has been generated through low-price imports undermining the pricing structure. In Germany, Europe's largest market, the price of pipe-grade PVC slumped last year from about DM1.75 a kilogramme to DM1. The industry needs about DM1.45 to break even. Western soda ash manufacturers, which include Solvay, Rhone-Poulenc and BASF, also claim they are suffering, although their case is less convincing than in the other sectors. Imports from Bulgaria, the largest eastern importer, more than doubled from 42,000 tonnes in 1991 to 91,000 tonnes last year. But American imports have caused far much more damage in volume terms, increasing from 350,000 tonnes in 1991 to about 600,000 tonnes last year. Meanwhile, in the caprolactam sector, Mr Hans van Liemt, president of DSM, the Dutch group, says competition from eastern Europe has contributed to a fall of up to 40 per cent in prices. The reaction of the chemical industry as a whole to the east and central European problem is one of ambivalence. So far, Cefic is not considering anti-dumping action. Firstly it does not want to, and secondly, there are difficulties of comparing prices in east Europe with those in the west. 'In principle we support the EC's efforts to liberalise trade with that part of the world,' says Mr Lever. 'If we do not help they will never become significant markets for our products. We must explain to these manufacturers about marketing techniques.' Even without western help, central and east European manufacturers are beginning to learn about the adverse effects of aggressively priced imports. Mr Lever says they too are suffering low-price imports - this time from the former Soviet republics. With just a hint of Schadenfreude, he says: 'Hungarian fertiliser manufacturers are really beginning to suffer from Russian imports.'</p>

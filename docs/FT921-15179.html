			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Ratner steps down as chairman MR GERALD RATNER, who built Ratners Group into the world's biggest jewellery company, stepped down as chairman yesterday and revealed a severe fall in sales over the Christmas period. The flamboyant businessman, who last year caused a furore by publicly labelling one of his company's products as 'crap', will remain chief executive and continue to play a central role in trying to improve the fortunes of the financially stretched group. Mr Jim McAdam, 61, former deputy chairman of the Coats Viyella textiles group, will fill the position of executive chairman of the group, which includes the Ernest Jones and H. Samuel jewellery stores. His appointment was welcomed by the company's principal bankers. Following a 15 per cent fall in UK jewellery sales in the vital six weeks before Christmas, Ratners announced that it was likely only to break even in the year to February 1. But interest payments of about Pounds 27m and exceptional costs of Pounds 45m will drag the company into a total loss of Pounds 72m. The company would not confirm whether it had been in breach of its banking covenants - as had been widely suggested in the City - but revealed that debt at December 27 stood at Pounds 217m. No material change was expected by the end of the financial year. The company said no final dividend would be paid on the ordinary shares and the payment on preference shares would 'be kept under review'. The results were worse than the City had feared. One fund manager said: 'I don't suppose anyone expected trading conditions to be so tough - we certainly didn't expect Christmas to be cancelled.' Mr Ratner was unusually taciturn as he talked about developments at his Mayfair headquarters. But he said that Mr McAdam would be a 'tremendous asset' to the company. 'He has got a lot of experience - in retailing as well - and is well known by the banking community,' he said. Ratners has been looking to appoint another chairman for almost a year and the two men will share executive responsibilities. Mr McAdam said tight cash management and cost controls would be enforced and he held out the possibility that some of the company's 1,000 UK stores might be shut. 'There is going to be no quick fix. It is going to be a long, hard slog,' he said. Some analysts speculated that the 246-store downmarket Ratners chain might be run down or transformed into one of the group's other chains. The company has accounted for some of the costs of its anticipated rationalisation programme in the Pounds 45m exceptional charge. The other exceptional costs relate to the 10 per cent reduction in the workforce in the current year and bad debt provisions from Kay Jewelers, the US business it acquired in 1990. Ratners shares closed 2p down at 21p. Men in the news: Gerald Ratner and Jim McAdam, Page 6 Lex, Page 22</p>

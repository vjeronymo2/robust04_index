			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Washington announces big cuts in military bases abroad THE US defence department yesterday announced the largest cuts in its overseas bases for three years, including the closure or reduction of operations at 92 installations, AP reports from Washington. Thirteen big installations are affected, including Bitburg air base in Germany, which will have reduced operations. The announcement brings to 840 the number of US sites overseas where operations have been trimmed since 1990, 773 of them in Europe. The department said the cuts were the first to be guided by President Bill Clinton's decision to reduce US forces in Europe to 100,000 by September 1996, rather than the 150,000 planned by the Bush administration. Some of the closures have been reported in Europe. Facilities to be shut down include the units in Germany that guarded the Fulda gap, which military stategists consider the traditional invasion route into southern Germany. The department said the changes in the overseas bases would affect 24,000 US military jobs, 6,600 US civilian jobs and 7,800 local employees. Some US individuals may be transferred to the US or elsewhere but many are losing their jobs because of the overall reduction in forces under way since the Bush administration. Most of the affected facilities are in Germany, but a few are in the Netherlands, the UK and Korea. The department said it was reviewing other sites worldwide for full or partial return to host governments. Mr Clinton is preparing to send to Congress a list of dozens of domestic US bases that will be closed or reduced.</p>

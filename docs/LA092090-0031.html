			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONORAIL SYSTEM COULD SHRINK BURBANK'S GRIDLOCK, STUDY SAYS;  </P> <P> PUBLIC TRANSIT: AS ENVISIONED, THE $158-MILLION PROJECT WOULD LINK UP WITH  OTHER RAIL PLANS.  </P> <P> A $158-million monorail system connecting Universal City with downtown Burbank  could relieve its congested traffic, especially in the bustling Media District,  according to a study exploring alternative transportation.  </P> <P> The study says a monorail system similar to the one at Walt Disney World in  Orlando, Fla., could eventually connect Burbank's three major employment  districts and reduce cross-town and commuter traffic by providing an  alternative to surface streets that already are near gridlock in some areas.  </P> <P> The proposed system would intersect with other transportation projects planned  for the area, such as the Metro Rail extension through the San Fernando Valley  and commuter rail lines operating on Southern Pacific tracks.  </P> <P> The study was commissioned by the city of Burbank and Los Angeles County.  Edward C. Friedrichs, vice president of Gensler and Associates, the Los Angeles  architectural firm that prepared the study, said the monorail system would  depend heavily on other forms of public transportation to provide passengers.  </P> <P> The first phase of the project, which would take about three years to build,  would connect Universal City with downtown Burbank via the Media District,  where nearly half the stops would be located. The 6.5-mile route would follow  raised tracks built on existing street medians.  </P> <P> A combination of public and private funds would pay for the monorail.  Friedrichs suggested that as other construction projects are approved,  developers be required to contribute to the monorail rather than to more common  traffic mitigation projects -- for instance, street widening or additional stop  lights. The project would be supervised by officials from Burbank and perhaps  the county.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey said the study was commissioned after  discussions with Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a supporter of monorails. Helvey  was unaware of any similar joint studies and said the county's role in the  project has not been determined.  </P> <P> Future phases would include a four-mile leg connecting downtown to Burbank  Airport, which would cost $95 million, and a three-mile section linking the  airport with the Media District, cost unknown.  </P> <P> Ideally, Friedrichs said, commuters would begin their trips on the system at  collector stations in Universal City, downtown and at the airport, all of which  would have access to other rail lines and ride-sharing pools.  </P> <P> Commuters who share rides would leave their cars at the station instead of  driving them to work. Friedrichs said the system would encourage ride sharing  because it would allow mobility during the day.  </P> <P> The first leg of the system could carry 10,368 passengers an hour. There are no  monorail projects in the United States built for public use, but Friedrichs  said similar systems operate in Japan.  </P> <P> Although the project is still in the preliminary stages, Friedrichs said his  firm has encouraged city and county staffs to complete preliminary work -- such  as environmental impact reports and traffic studies -- to move ahead with the  plan within the next year.  </P> <P> At separate presentations Tuesday, the monorail proposal got mixed reactions.  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council generally reacted favorably to the idea and is  expected to decide its next move later this year. Some county supervisors  expressed skepticism about the technology involved in the project, but  Antonovich praised the work done to date and urged the board to move forward.  </P> <P> "An aesthetically pleasing monorail is smog-free and enhances an area," he  said.  </P></p>

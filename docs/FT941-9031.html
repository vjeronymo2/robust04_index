			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / US groups win Dollars 6bn Saudi airliner order The US has won a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) deal to modernise Saudi Arabia's airline fleet with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft, dealing a heavy blow to their European rival, Airbus Industrie. The order for about 50 airliners, announced by President Bill Clinton yesterday with an unusual White House fanfare, follows a year of intense lobbying by many in the US cabinet. Mr Clinton said the work would create 60,000 jobs in the US. The White House's direct involvement in clinching the order is expected to heighten trade tensions between the US and Europe over the overt use of political pressure to win commercial aircraft sales. Saudi Arabia's decision to choose US manufacturers over Airbus to supply Saudia, its national airline, is a particularly significant setback for the Airbus consortium, which had hoped to win much of the order. Big commercial aircraft orders are still rare because of the financial difficulties faced by many airlines. However, Airbus, whose partners are British Aerospace (20 per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent), yesterday said it had still not heard from Saudia whether its competing offer had been rejected. 'We have as today no indication from Saudia as to whether they accept or reject our offer of planes, whose validity has been extended to March 1 at their request,' Airbus said. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said details of the contract, including which precise aircraft would be supplied, had not been worked out. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said representatives of the two US aircraft manufacturers would be invited to Riyadh to start negotiations after the end of Ramadan, around March 20. McDonnell Douglas has been offering its MD-11 long-range jet while Boeing has been discussing 747s, its new 777 twin-engine widebody and the smaller 737. Airbus has offered its A340 long-range aircraft and its smaller A320. At present the Saudia fleet includes aircraft from Boeing, Lockheed and Airbus. The negotiations have involved an unprecedented degree of US government export promotion, cemented by visits to Riyadh by three US cabinet secretaries and by Mr Clinton's own telephone lobbying of King Fahd. It has been matched by high-level lobbying by the four European Airbus partner countries. Mr Clinton said in the televised announcement that the US administration would continue to be 'aggressively involved in this kind of (sales) endeavour when it is appropriate'. European aerospace industry officials last night said the Saudia deal was 'an important lesson' for Europe, underlining the US's commitment to put political weight behind big export deals. 'It certainly slams shut the door on the US contention that Europeans have been putting on political pressure to win Airbus export sales,' a French official noted. Confirming the US's aggressive stance, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said: 'We have finally broken out of the shackles that have caused a several-decade debate about the role of government. Our international competitors figured out that role a long time ago, and that's why they are doing much better.' London stocks, Page 38</p>

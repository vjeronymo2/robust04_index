			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH HORMONE IN MILK SUPPLY  </P> <P> I had read some time ago that new genetic growth hormones were being introduced  to promote milk production and I wondered what the need was for increased  production when, for years, we have subsidized the dairy industry.  </P> <P> Epstein's article gives us the answer -- $500 million in annual worldwide sales  by five chemical manufacturers -- and the FDA is ready to approve it! What  about the health and growth of infants and children, the threat of cancer and  other consumer health risks?  </P> <P> It really burns me up that medications, tested, tried, approved and  successfully used in Europe, are being held back in the United States by the  FDA that is about to allow a potentially dangerous drug into our food chain.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY WOLF  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

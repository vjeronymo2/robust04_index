			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Ups and downs of inflation - Serious Money EVERYONE would agree that inflation is a 'bad thing'. Unfortunately, it is much less easy to agree on what the inflation rate actually is. This week, Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, asked for a review of the way that housing costs are treated within the Retail Prices Index. Now, the cynic would assume that any change in a government statistic must be bad news for the public. And certainly, it was only in 1990 that government ministers were arguing that we should concentrate on the 'underlying' rate of inflation, and not the headline RPI rate. But there is a respectable intellectual case for changing the system. When the government causes interest rates to increase, it normally does so to control inflation. But the inclusion of mortgage payments within the RPI means that an interest rate increase causes the index to rise. Since many wage bargainers use the RPI as the basis for pay negotiations, the result is that the government's chosen definition of 'headline' inflation can cause underlying inflation to rise even faster. Furthermore, most other countries do not include mortgage rates in their inflation indices. So the present system makes our position look worse than that of our competitors. Hang on, you might reasonably interject. Any inflation index is supposed to measure the cost of living. If I have a mortgage, and the interest rate increases, my cost of living has risen. Taking the mortgage rate out of the RPI defies common sense. Nevertheless, the critics retort, not everyone has a mortgage. Some people rent; others own their homes outright. A different measure of housing costs (such as imputed rent - the rent an occupant would pay if he did not own the property) might be a more realistic guide to 'true' inflation. This might seem an arcane economic debate, but the rate of inflation is very important to the modern economy. Many social security benefits, occupational pensions and utility prices are tied to the RPI. And investors buy RPI-linked gilts and National Savings, to protect themselves against the effects of rising prices on their savings. There thus might be a lot of winners and losers from a sudden change in the composition of the index. At present, recent declines in interest rates mean that the measure of inflation which excludes mortgage rates is higher than the RPI (the April yearly rates were 5.7 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively). So a change in the calculation of the RPI might be good for those who rely on index-linked benefits or investments for income. By the time the review of the index is completed, things could have changed. The UK could be at a different stage of the interest rate cycle. Those who own index-linked gilts and National Savings might feel that they ought to have some protection from the effects of statistical manipulation. After all, how far could the process go? Could the government start excluding the effect of, say, excise duties or VAT in an attempt to keep the RPI at an artificially low level? In the case of National Savings, the answer is: tough luck. The value of certificates will rise in line with the RPI, however the government deems it to be constituted. Gilts are different. The issue prospectus refers to a change in the basic calculation of the RPI which 'in the opinion of the Bank of England, constitutes a fundamental change in the index which would be materially detrimental to the interests of stockholders.' Such a change, the prospectus continues, would result in investors being given the right to redeem their gilts. There was a jump in the price of index-linked gilts this week as investors speculated that this clause might be triggered. Index-linked gilts trade below their indexed value and thus redemption would be highly profitable for investors. But Simon Briscoe, gilts analyst at Greenwell Montagu, thinks this unlikely. First, he argues that if mortgage rates are replaced in the index by some other measure of housing costs - such as imputed rent - the change would not be regarded as fundamental. Second, he argues that the change would not be 'materially detrimental'. 'Over the long run, there would be negligible difference between inflation judged by an index that includes mortgages and one that excluded them, as interest rates tend to fluctuate around a certain level' says Briscoe. In other words, periods when the headline rate of RPI is above the rate excluding mortgages (as in 1990) are cancelled out by periods when the reverse is the case (as now). So those who have bought index-linked gilts cannot expect a sudden profit. On the other hand, the logic of the Briscoe argument is that index-linked investors need not worry too much about a change in the index. Indeed, recent changes in National Savings rates may have made index-linked more attractive. The 37th issue pays 8 per cent; since the 5th index-linked issue pays 4.5 per cent over the rise in the RPI, inflation would only have to average more than 3.5 per cent to beat this return. The days of 10 per cent inflation may have gone for a while. But, given the UK's economic record, it is surely not a wild gamble to assume that inflation might be above 3.5 per cent.</p>

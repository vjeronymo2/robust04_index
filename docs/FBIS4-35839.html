			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan said Saturday [4 June] that  by test-firing its short-range ballistic missile India has  unleashed a race of sophisticated weapons in South Asia.    The Pakistani reaction came hours after India test-fired  Prithvi, which can carry a payload of one ton up to 190 km (150  miles), in the bay of Bengal.    "By test-firing the missile India has brought all major  Pakistani cities, except the southern most city of Quetta, under  its range," said Munir Akram, a spokesman for the Pakistan  Foreign Office.    He said India was also looking for locations to test-fire  the  medium range Agni missile which can carry a payload of one ton  up to 2,400 km.    On his return from a visit to the United States on Friday  president Farooq Leghari told reporters that he has conveyed  Pakistan's concerns to the US administration over India's  efforts to deploy medium- and short-range missiles in the region.    "It is a new phase in the arms race in South Asia. It will  now unleash a missile race in the region," said Akram.    The deployment of these missiles, according to him, will  shorten the warning time of any surprise attack against Pakistan  down to a few minutes "and, therefore, increase the hair-trigger  environment in South Asia".    He said Pakistan has advised all countries concerned,  especially the members of the Missile Technology control Regime,  to urge India not to go ahead with the development and  deployment of these missiles.    He said Pakistan had so far been talking to the United  States  and had established no direct contact with India over the matter  "but we will consider other diplomatic options as well".</p>

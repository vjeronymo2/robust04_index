			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WORLD'S TOP SAVERS: JAPANESE  </P> <P> For the third year in a row, the Japanese were the world's top savers last  year, salting away nearly four times as much money as Americans, a survey  released today showed. Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands were  next on the annual, dollar-denominated list published by the International  Savings Banks Institute.  </P> <P> At the end of 1989, the average Japanese had placed the equivalent of $40,119  in savings and term deposits, the survey said. In Japanese money, the figure  was up 11% from 1988 to about 5.7 million yen. The dollar total dropped about  2%, mostly because the yen weakened against the U.S. currency.  </P> <P> The United States ranked 14th, with per capita savings of $10,822, up 4% from  1988. The United States ranked eighth in last year's survey and seventh in  1987. Many countries' figures, however, were boosted by the weakened dollar.  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Euromarket challenged by regulatory convergence THE development of inter-national regulations for the securities industry is forcing Eurobond market participants to ask a searching question of themselves: what exactly defines the international bond market? The most challenging piece of legislation hanging over the market is the draft European Community investment services directive, which lays down rules for the conduct of investment business. As currently drafted, the directive would force securities trading to take place on 'regulated markets'. The Eurobond market would not count as a regulated market - primarily because it has no formal listing and no trade publication requirements. It is unlikely that the current text of the directive will be adopted. However, the debate has underlined that many of the structural differences between the domestic and international bond markets have already disappeared: Withholding tax has been removed in nearly all leading industrialised countries. Where it remains, mechanisms for international investors to reclaim tax have improved. Even in Italy, infamous for complex administrative procedures, international investors have at least an even chance of reclaiming withholding tax paid on domestic bonds. The international market is slowly opening to a greater spread of investors as regulations limiting the foreign asset holdings of institutional investors have been relaxed. For example, until 1990 Canadian pension funds were limited to holding 10 per cent of their assets overseas and were penalised by a heavy tax penalty if the limit was exceeded. The ceiling on foreign assets is now 20 per cent, leading them to diversify away from the domestic market. Similarly, while some categories of US investors are still prohibited from participating in the primary Eurobond market, all can now buy international bonds 40 days after payment date - reduced from 90 days in the late 1980s. A more homogeneous clearing and settlement 'infrastructure' has developed as institutional investors have spread investments across markets. Both Euroclear and Cedel, the clearing houses which used to be almost exclusively devoted to the international bond market, each now clear and settle transactions with 20 domestic bond markets. Partly as a result of these changes, the Eurobond market is less dominated by retail investors than in the past. One sign of this is the spate of bonds with maturities of more than 10 years launched this year  - such as Credit Foncier's Ecu750m 12-year issue last week - aimed mainly at institutional fund managers with long-dated liabilities. The development of the off-shore Ecu bond market can take some of the credit for tempting conservative investment institutions out of domestic markets. The Ecu bond market has been transformed from a sector based on small corporate bond issues and retail investors to one dominated by governments, supranational agencies and big investment institutions. The launch of 'global' bond issues - deals sold under the same documentation and under the same pricing in European, US and Far Eastern markets - has accelerated the process of integration. Since the World Bank launched its first Dollars 1.5bn global issue in September 1989, the structure has been extended into other currency sectors. Last year saw global issues in Canadian and Australian dollars. The World Bank is now preparing a global issue in yen. Such deals underline the extent to which debt securities can now be traded between markets. One sign of convergence is the narrowing of pricing differentials between the Eurobond and domestic markets. Where there are no barriers to the free flow of funds, anomalies tend to be arbitraged away by investors dealing between markets. At the start of the 1980s top-rated Eurodollar bonds could yield 70-80 basis points less than US domestic issues. Now the differential is much narrower, rarely more than 40 basis points. Different constituencies of investor still have different tastes. The domestic US market is often a cheaper source of funds for corporate issuers, especially US companies. For example, Mobil, the US oil company, last week launched a five-year domestic bond issue at a yield spread of 26 basis points over US Treasury bonds. In the Eurobond market the same deal would probably have been priced at a spread of 45 basis points. Yet supranational institutions often achieve a better cost of funds by issuing Eurobonds. But while some anomalies remain, the cost-of-funds gap between the Eurobond market and domestic markets has certainly narrowed from a borrowers' perspective. New syndication techniques and standardised fee structures introduced into the Eurobond market over the past two years have eroded any advantage it held over the US market in terms of underwriting costs. While underwriting fees in the US are variable, there is rarely more than a fractional difference between the two markets. The fixed price re-offer method of syndicating new Eurobond issues - whereby the lead underwriting firm can hold the bonds at issue price until it is satisfied that most of the paper is placed - is now accepted in most currency sectors of the international bond market. This is close to US new issue techniques. The technique is now reaching Japan. Last year Nippon Telegraph and Telephone announced its intention to launch a domestic bond issue based on the fixed-priced system. It remains an open question whether the Eurobond market can keep its share of global investment business or whether investors will retreat to deregulated domestic markets. So far, the international bond market appears to be gaining as much as it loses. However, the process of regulatory convergence means the Eurobond market will have to convince the regulators that it still has a role to fill.</p>

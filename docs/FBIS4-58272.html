			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In the article "The Entire Golan", AL-BA'TH writes:  Since the peace process kicked off in Madrid two and one-half  years ago, our declared position has not changed. Inspired by  the principles on which the peace process was launched, our  position has been absolutely clear. In contrast, Israel has  consistently sought to throw the peace process off course.    The Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has put forward  fresh proposals under the heading "Majdal Shams First" along the  lines of the Gaza-Jericho First. Syria will have nothing to do  with a first or second. This is because if we engage in such  phrases, it will lead to our engagement in the labyrinth of  separate settlements and deals, something to which we are  totally opposed as it threatens the foundations of the peace  initiative itself.    Syria advocates a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the  occupied Arab territories as the road leading to the peace of  the brave. All that Syria wants is full peace as envisaged by  the peace initiative.    Out of a commitment to a universal solution as laid out by  the peace initiative, Syria wants the entire Golan Heights back  and a full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories.  Any other options are a waste of time and an attempt to gain  time and evade the requirements of peace. This is where the  responsibility of the sponsors of the peace conference come in.  It is a test of their ability to put an end to Israel's  continuing maneuvers, AL-BA'TH concludes.</p>

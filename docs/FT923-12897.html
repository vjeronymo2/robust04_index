			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Black leaders come in to their own WHEN it comes to stirring the emotions, Mr Jesse Jackson is still unmatched within the Democratic party, writes George Graham in New York. Although relegated to a less prominent speaking slot at this year's party convention, he did it again on Tuesday night, rousing his audience in Madison Square Garden with a powerful sermon on inequality and compassion. But the convention has brought to the fore a different style of black leadership, with men and women who have chosen to take elected office. They include, in Congress, Representatives Bill Jerrson of Louisiana and Mike Espy of Mississippi; in the states, governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia; or, in the party, Mr Ron Brown, the Democrats' first black chairman. Many of Mr Jackson's supporters were disappointed that he ducked the opportunity to follow the same path by running for mayor of Washington DC, choosing instead to take the more symbolic role of 'shadow senator' lobbying for Washington to be allowed statehood. Mr Brown served as convention manager for Mr Jackson's presidential campaign in 1988, but he moved on to become a senior political adviser to the Dukakis campaign. Since taking over as party chairman in 1989 he has worked to create a Democratic campaign apparatus ready to work for whoever emerged from this year's primaries as the party's presidential candidate. A 50-year-old partner in the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow, Mr Brown is a smooth-tongued and sharp-suited operator behind the scenes. In the last three years, however, he has taken a prominent role as the Democrats' spokesman, filling the void left by the low-key leadership of Congressional Democrats like Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives. Governor Bill Clinton, in his campaign for the presidential nomination, has been perceived by some as shunning black votes by pointedly distancing himself from Mr Jackson. In fact, however, he has developed strong support from the new generation of black leaders such as Congressman Espy. 'I think the Clinton campaign has been very smart. They have gone directly to indigenous leaders and elected officials,' said Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, a legendary figure from the civil rights era who bridges both wings of the black community, and who has backed Mr Clinton in his home state of Georgia and in the south. On Tuesday Mr Clinton won the endorsement of Mr Wilder, the country's first black governor since Reconstruction after the Civil War, who was briefly a candidate for the Democratic nomination. The strategy is risky. 'Don't Mess With Jesse' is a cry that reverberates strongly, particularly with big-city black leaders like Congresswoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and Congressman Charles Rangel of New York. But Mrs Hillary Clinton's enthusiastic welcome by the Democratic national committee's black caucus suggests that her husband's bridges to the community have by no means been burned. 'We will speak for you in November at the ballot box,' said Dr C. DeLores Tucker, the caucus' chair.</p>

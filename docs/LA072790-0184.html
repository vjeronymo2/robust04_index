Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROCK GUITARIST POINTED SOUTH  </P> <P> Carlos Santana, the rock singer-guitarist known for the song "Black Magic  Woman," says a higher power is pointing him South.  </P> <P> "Lately, I've pretty much been getting a fax message from inside my soul that I  should go South.  </P> <P> The Lord has put my mind in places South -- South Africa, South America, the  southern United States," he said.  </P> <P> "That's where people's hearts seem to be the hardest. The Lord wants me to take  my message of peace and harmony there. I'm going where things most need to be  plowed."  </P> <P> During his 20-year career, he has recorded 26 albums and has had hit songs such  as "Evil Ways." His latest album, "Spirits Dancing in the Flesh," contains  references to spirituality and the emotions of love, joy and peace.  </P></p>

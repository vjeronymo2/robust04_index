(Atkins, B.J. and Hancock, A.K.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). The continuum can be seen as four major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stages: Acute HIV Disease; Chronic Asymptomatic HIV Disease;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chronic Symptomatic HIV Disease; and Advanced Disease (AIDS). It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is known that HIV affects every cultural, social, economic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sexual, racial, and geographic group in this country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated that ``HIV is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to impact every household in America in the 1990s.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of people who have AIDS is significant: the Centers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HIV/AIDS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surveillance Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1994, noted that, as of December, 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 361,509 cases of AIDS had been reported in the United States. Of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these, 138,223 individuals were known to be living with AIDS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These figures do not include individuals who have been diagnosed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as HIV seropositive, but have not yet developed full-blown AIDS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that number is estimated to exceed one million. Racial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethnic minority populations have been disproportionately affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by HIV infection and AIDS. In 1992, 47 percent of all reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIDS cases were among African-Americans and Hispanics although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these two groups represent only 21 percent of the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population (1992 CDC Newsletter). HIV infections are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing rapidly among women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although HIV disease is chronic, progressive, and, so far,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately fatal, the average period of time from onset of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infection to death continues to grow longer, due to improved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health care interventions, and is now estimated to be 11.5 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Whitman-Walker Clinic). Individuals may well begin to live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer at each stage of the disease process. Thus, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural course of the disease changes, it will be important to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track the changing needs for rehabilitation and community support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. Most ``Persons Living with AIDS'' (PLWA) aspire to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain as normal a life as possible during the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease and disability and have both the potential and the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit from appropriate service programs. It is extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical that culturally sensitive, community integrated service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems to promote rehabilitation, independence, employment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community integration and to reduce barriers be developed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and section 504 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, define an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a disability as one who ``has a physical or mental impairment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that substantially limits his or her ability to perform one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more major life activities, has a record of an impairment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially limits a major life activity, and/or is regarded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an employer or other covered entity as having an impairment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially limits a major life activity.'' This definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes people with HIV/AIDS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals with HIV/AIDS may be entitled to income transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments and medical assistance benefits; they also may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible, depending on specific criteria in the various statutes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for services under a number of public service programs, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vocational rehabilitation and independent living, mental health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and drug abuse services, veterans' services, and housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

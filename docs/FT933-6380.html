			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling sees first Mexican offering in two years THE Eurosterling bond market yesterday saw its first Mexican offering for two years when Bancomext, the state-owned import and export bank, raised Pounds 75m through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 200 basis points above the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000. This represents a price improvement of 25 basis points for a Mexican state-owned entity in the Eurosterling market. When United Mexican States raised Pounds 100m through a seven-year issue two years ago, it paid 225 basis points over the underlying gilt. Although the spread has since tightened to 215 basis points, the price has risen to a large premium to par and the bonds have become illiquid. Syndicate managers said yesterday's deal indicated Mexico had bowed to market pressure regarding the pricing of its Eurobonds, at least for now. In recent months, Mexico has been pushing for a spread of less than 200 basis points. Investors, however, are unwilling to buy its Eurobonds below this threshold until the country has achieved an investment grade rating. The lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said Bancomext was seeking to diversify its funding base by issuing in sterling. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly. Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a speculative grade rating of BB- to Argentina's dollar-denominated foreign debt. The S&amp;P rating is one notch above Argentina's B1 rating assigned by Moody's. S&amp;P said although the rating was supported by Argentina's economic transformation, it was constrained by the country's large foreign debt burden relative to exports. Argentina's net external debt, estimated at 205 per cent of exports, is the highest among sovereigns rated in S&amp;P's BB category. 'Strict fiscal discipline will be essential for some time to come to secure recent improvements in credit-worthiness, given the country's past record of economic and political instability,' S&amp;P said. Elsewhere, Tchibo Holding, the German chain of high street coffee shops, made its debut in the international bond market with a DM300m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 43 basis points over underlying bunds. The spread tightened rapidly to 35 basis points, reflecting the strong demand from domestic retail investors for this household name. The yield pick-up of Tchibo's issue over other Eurobond issues with the same maturity also contributed to the success of the deal. For example, Volkswagen's 10-year Eurobonds were trading at a spread of around 33 basis points over bunds. Tchibo, which is unrated, said proceeds from the issue would be used to improve the balance sheet. It said Tchibo had wanted to take advantage of the favourable market conditions, but that it had no further plans to tap the international bond market.</p>

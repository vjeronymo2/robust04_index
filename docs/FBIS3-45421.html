Africa should not be neglected or marginalized."    Qian made the statement at a press conference held here  today  at the end of his visit to Kenya.    He said, "though Africa faces many difficulties, it also has  its own strong points. Africa is not hopeless its future is  bright."    On his current East Africa trip, he said he has come to see  developments in the region by himself and promote bilateral  relations between China and the countries he visits.    On the major problem facing African countries, Qian said  African countries are not able to concentrate their efforts to  develop economy, adding many problems cannot be solved without  real development of economy.    He said Africa is under great political and economic  pressures from the outside world. Under such circumstances  there are turmoil and unrest in some African countries.  "Without stability, it is hard for them to develop economy," he  pointed out.    On the democratic process in South Africa, Qian expressed  his  hope that the planned non-racial general election on April 27  will take place on schedule and a new democratic non-racial  South Africa will be established. "China is willing to develop  relations with a new South Africa in various fields on the basis  of the principles of peaceful coexistence," Qian said.    As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between  China and South Africa, Qian said South Africa should follow  international regulations. "It should not have diplomatic  relations with China and China's Taiwan province at the same  time."    On the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and  Lesotho, Qian said this has once again demonstrated there is  only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of  the Chinese territory, the government of the People's Republic  of China is the sole legal government of China, and the attempt  of the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China,  one Taiwan" has no popular support and will never succeed.</p>

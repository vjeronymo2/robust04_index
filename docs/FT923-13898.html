			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Brazil reaches outline debt accord THE Brazilian government and its commercial bank creditors yesterday reached an outline agreement aimed at easing the burden of servicing more than Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn) of its foreign debt. Leading bankers said they hoped to thrash out a detailed accord with the government by August, allowing for its approval that month by the Brazilian senate. The deal could be closed, after approval by all bank creditors, by the end of the year. The agreement was greeted by the Brazilian economy minister, Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, as a 'watershed, closing a long chapter overshadowed by foreign debt problems and opening a new chapter full of opportunities. This is the new Brazil, reinserting itself into the international community in a dynamic, competitive and sovereign way.' Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, said that, after the Brazilian agreement, more than 90 per cent of the commercial bank debt of major debtor countries had been dealt with. 'It represents a milestone in finally putting the Latin American debt crisis behind us,' he said. However, there remain doubts about whether the agreement will reach fruition. These have been substantially heightened by the corruption crisis enveloping Brazilian President Fernando Collor. This has called into question his retention of office and, if he does stay on, his ability to wield effective power. Some bankers argue that the Brazilian accord may be the first deal signed under the Brady debt initiative - named for Secretary Brady - to fail. The accord would allow banks to exchange their loans for one of five varieties of concessionary bonds, or to make new loans equivalent to 18.18 per cent of their current exposure. The concessionary bonds are each designed to yield an equal sacrifice to banks, equivalent to about 35 per cent write-down in the face value of the debt. Some concessionary bonds are backed by guarantees of principal or interest. The accord also calls for Brazil to increase its interest payments on existing debt from 30 per cent at present to 50 per cent of contracted payments, once senate approval has been obtained. It also addressed past arrears of interest and allowed debt-for-equity concessions. The news of the accord was broken in Brazil through a hand-written note from Mr Collor to his spokesman. In the letter, the president described the accord as 'a good solution after a year of negotiation and one which does not compromise our capacity to pay principal'. Mr Collor claimed: 'No other country got the advantages that we have achieved, either in terms of the percentage of reduction, the multiplicity of options or in the modality of guarantees.' The Brazilian stock market reacted cautiously to the long-awaited news, the Sao Paulo market index rising by only 1.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: USAF contract will boost Zenith Data ONE OF the largest computer contracts ever awarded by the US federal government has been won by Zenith Data Systems (ZDS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupe Bull, France's largest computer manufacturer. The contract, for administrative computer systems, is known as 'Desktop 4' and involves the supply of up to 300,000 personal computers worth potentially Dollars 740m over three years. The award should prove a substantial boost to the fortunes of Zenith and its parent. Bull has had several years of losses because of falling prices, narrowing profit margins and stagnant sales. The 'Desktop' contracts are awarded by the US Air Force. Zenith was awarded Desktops 1 and 2 between 1983 and 1989 when it was the computer arm of the US-owned Zenith Electronics. It failed to win Desktop 3 in 1990 after its acquisition by Groupe Bull, sparking fears that the US government was unwilling to place large orders with foreign-owned suppliers. Mr Enrico Pesatori, Zenith chief executive, said he was relieved and surprised that ZDS had been given the whole contract; awards of that size were usually split between several suppliers. He said the award was significant because: It would boost ZDS revenues and provide substantial extra volume, enabling the company to offer keener prices. It was a strong endorsement of the quality of the company's products. Earlier this year ZDS completely revamped its product line, announcing some 40 new models. It indicated that foreign ownership was no longer a barrier to the award of big contracts. Sources close to the deal say that although the ZDS price was not the lowest, the air force had been impressed with the quality and reliability of the systems supplied during Desktop 1 and 2. In particular, the company supplied at short notice thousands of systems for military use during Desert Storm in Iraq. ZDS' success will be a big relief to Bull, which is relying on the Chicago-based manufacturer for growth as the market for traditional mainframe and mini computers slackens. It expects ZDS to provide 40 per cent of revenues by 1994. Companies in the fiercely competitive personal computer industry are now critically dependant on large product volumes, which enables them to work on lower margins and offer lower prices. Earlier this year Bull announced a tie-up with International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, involving the manufacture and supply of 150,000 portable computers annually. It is understood that Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, has already visited Bull's Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's newly appointed chief, to cement the relationship. Mr Pache, formerly head of the French coal board, was controversially appointed earlier this year when the French government decided against reappointing Mr Francis Lorentz, architect of Bull's transformation plan. Mr Pache has already won a reputation for openness and approachability. 'It is a case of so far, so good,' said one senior Bull executive.</p>

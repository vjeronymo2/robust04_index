			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Lasmo bid cost Enterprise Pounds 24m Enterprise Oil continues to pay the cost of its failed bid for rival explorer Lasmo with the disclosure yesterday it was writing down by Pounds 18m the shares it controversially acquired in the final days of battle. Total costs of the Pounds 1.6bn all-share bid came to nearly Pounds 24m, including Pounds 5.7m in fees paid to the company's numerous advisers. Lasmo is expected to report charges of about Pounds 25m when it announces interim results next week. The costs helped to depress Enterprise's interim net profits from Pounds 80.1m to Pounds 8.5m. The return was also hit by low oil prices, changes to the North Sea tax regime and a Pounds 20m swing in interest to payments of Pounds 15m. Excluding Lasmo-related provisions, profits after tax were Pounds 32.3m. Enterprise has written its 9.8 per cent stake down to Pounds 142m, valuing the shares at 150p. This compares with an average 169p paid by Enterprise just two days before the bid closed, and yesterday's close of 159p, up 2 1/2 p. The purchase, largely from one investor, angered some shareholders who claimed thay had not been given the chance to sell. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said Enterprise intended to keep the shares as an investment for the immediate future. The 150p share price was a 'conservative view of what the long-term value of the shares would be', he said. Enterprise's failed bid and the resultant costs have put pressure on the group to come up with a strategy for replacing reserves because production from its successful Nelson and Scott fields is expected to peak over the next two to three years. 'By the end of the year we will expect a clear statement on where Enterprise thinks it is going,' said one investor. 'As they stand, they are effectively liquidating themselves.' Mr Shilston said the company was not worried about its post-Lasmo future. 'Our basic approach is the same now as it would have been with Lasmo,' he said. Enterprise would continue to exploit opportunities such as farm-ins and asset swaps. The first move into South America is expected within the next six months. In areas such as Norway and the Black Sea, he said, 'We can make a meal of prospects that probably lie below the horizon for companies such as Esso'. Results, Page 20</p>

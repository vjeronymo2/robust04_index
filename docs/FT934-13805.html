			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Improving business with the community's help Involvement in the community through training, economic regeneration, education and equal opportunities policies can improve corporate performance, according to a new survey of top business executives and other opinion formers. Companies with active community affairs programmes are likely to have a more committed and happy workforce, the survey found. There are also benefits in public image and customer loyalty. Over 80 per cent of those polled said that a reputation for being socially responsive and responsible is becoming a competitive advantage. The findings of the survey were presented last night to the annual meeting of the Per Cent Club in London, a group of large companies which devote a proportion of their profits to community activities. Sponsored by six, blue-chip companies, with well-developed community involvement programmes, the survey was based on interviews with 700 opinion leaders around the country, including more than 120 top executives from both industry and the City of London. The survey will offer some reassurance to business leaders who must justify every expense in the current adverse climate. However, it also suggests ways in which companies can maximise the returns from their community involvement: City investors should be informed of the rationale for community involvement programmes - at present, they are often unconvinced of the commercial benefits. Senior managers also need more convincing of the value of community programmes - they are often less clear about their objectives. Local managers should be given greater responsibility for community investment programmes, as this will result in more effective links with community organisations. New forms of partnership are needed with national charities to support the aims of both businesses and charities through strategies such as cause-related marketing.

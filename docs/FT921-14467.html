			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Olszewski battles to curb deficit POLAND'S economic situation was much worse than he expected before taking office Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, told the Senate yesterday. Appealing to parliament's upper chamber to pass the government's first quarter budget provisions, the newly appointed head of government added: 'Maybe I wouldn't have taken on this responsibility if I had known what I know now.' Speaking on the eve of a threatened one-day protest strike by members of the former communist trade unions, Mr Olszewski warned that even after cuts in government spending aimed at reducing the budget deficit target to Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m) the real budget out-turn could be overwhelmed by the volume of overdue 1991 payments. These could add another Zl 20,000bn to the total, he said. In an attempt to bring the deficit under control the government has cut energy subsidies and reduced unemployment pay, setting off a wave of labour unrest. Preliminary figures issued by the Central Statistical Office, however, show the depth of a recession which has cut industrial production in the state sector by nearly 40 per cent over the last 2 years and seen unemployment rise from practically zero in 1989 to 2.1m, or 11.4 per cent of the work force last month. Year on year inflation, however, fell to 60.4 per cent in December from 249 per cent in December 1990 while real incomes grew by 3.1 per cent after a 25 per cent decline in 1990.</p>

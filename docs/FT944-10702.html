			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Westpac profits advance sharply Westpac yesterday began the Australian banks' reporting season by announcing an after-tax profit of ADollars 704.7m (USDollars 533.8m) in the 12 months to end-September, up from ADollars 39.2m the previous year and a ADollars 1.56bn loss in 1991-92. The profit figure translated into earnings per share of 35 cents, on a diluted basis, compared with 1 cent previously. The final unfranked dividend was set at 10 cents a share, compared with 6 cents, making a total for the year of 18 cents. The bank attributed the substantial improvement to higher net interest income, cost reductions, improvements in the efficiency ratio and a significant reduction in both the bad debt charge and the size of its impaired loan portfolio. Net interest income for the year stood at ADollars 2.76bn, compared with ADollars 2.63bn, while non-interest expenses fell to ADollars 2.56bn from ADollars 2.92bn. The charge for bad and doubtful debts was almost halved to ADollars 694.9m from ADollars 1.29bn in 1992-93. Westpac also said that the ratio of net impaired assets to shareholders' equity stood at 30 per cent by end-September, compared with 65 per cent a year earlier. The general provision for doubtful debts at year-end was ADollars 735m (ADollars 700m) - including a ADollars 35m provision for drought-related problems - while specific provisions stood at ADollars 1.61bn (ADollars 1.98bn). The group's tier one capital ratio at year-end was 8.9 per cent, compared with 7.4 per cent previously. The bank said it had moved from 'a recovery phase to one striving for improved performance and growth'. Its main focus in the current year would be on implementing a retail branch restructuring programme, further reduction in impaired assets, new product development and additional efficiencies. It said that it was budgeting for further profits growth - with some analysts suggesting it could make between ADollars 1bn and ADollars 1.1bn.</p>

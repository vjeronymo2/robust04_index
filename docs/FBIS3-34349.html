In  a statement to the daily EL MOUDJAHID, Dr. El Khatib expects  that the parties which boycotted the national conference will  take part in the running of the transitional stage through  participation in the Transitional National Council. He said:  Such an expectation is possible and this is what made us leave  the doors of the council open.    In another statement published by the daily EL WATAN, Dr. El  Khatib affirmed that the national dialogue will continue under  the leadership of the new authority in the country, and at the  same time he confirmed reports that the national dialogue  committee has held contacts with personalities representing the  dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. Mourad Medaoui gives  us the details:    [Medaoui] The chairman of the National Dialogue Committee  today announced that the task of the committee has ended and  that the question of organizing dialogue is now a matter for the  new authority. In a statement to the daily EL WATAN Dr. Youcef  El Khatib said that the committee has indeed held contacts with  personalities representing the dissolved FIS, and he pointed out  that these personalities had secured the blessing of the FIS  leaders in Blida prison. He stressed that these personalities  were from inside the country and that there was no contact at  all with leaders now abroad.    Dr. El Khatib considered these contacts as positive for two  reasons: First, the fact that this tendency has accepted the  principle of dialogue, and second the fact that this tendency  has expressed its readiness to contribute to taking the country  out of the crisis by helping to bring an end to bloodshed. Dr.  El Khatib expects national dialogue to be easy now because of  the existence of a platform that defines everything including  relations between the various parties to the dialogue.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Official retail sales total counters CBI gloom Official figures for retail sales showing a 0.6 per cent increase in January, yesterday painted a brighter picture of consumer demand than had been indicated by the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey on Tuesday. January's rise took the annual growth in the volume of sales to 3.5 per cent, down from 4.1 per cent in December. This decline, however, was largely because a strong January 1993 rise dropped out of the comparison. The Central Statistical Office also revised its December figure to show a 0.1 per cent decline, instead of the previously announced 0.2 per cent fall. The Treasury said the figures showed that the trend of economic recovery was continuing, with retail sales volume figures at record levels. But concerns that consumers are cutting back on spending ahead of pending tax increases were expressed by the British Retail Consortium. Mr James May, director-general of the consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of the retail industry, said: 'January results indicate that consumers may be taking a cautious view not helped by the pending personal tax changes, the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel, nor the increase in NHS charges.' For three months to January - a better guide to the trend - the volume of retail sales was 0.8 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 3.8 per cent higher than for the period a year earlier. The rise in retail sales was lower than commentators forecasted but better than the CBI survey, which said the balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales in January was the lowest for 12 months. The CSO said that the official figures were the more reliable guide since they were based on qualitative data on sales rather than statements from retailers and included a wider sample of businesses. Detailed CSO figures showed that there were large gains in household goods in January, up by 2.6 per cent on December. In the three months to January sales by food retailers increased by 1.4 per cent compared with the previous three months. Sales by mixed businesses were 1.5 per cent higher while those by specialist non-food retailers were unchanged. Sales of clothing and footwear rose by 1.9 per cent. In non-seasonally adjusted value terms, the average weekly value of retail sales in January was 5.1 per cent higher than in January 1993.</p>

The parties that have support in the "towns and villages"  have assembled their congresses. Of the democrats, Konstantin  Borovoy (Party of Economic Freedom) (PEF) operated the most  promptly, and he was followed by Gavriil Popov, who conducted  the Second Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms (RMDR)  Congress.    It is interesting that the PEF congress was for the first  time held behind closed doors. Party activists were clearly  reluctant to present for general review the profound mutual  discontent. The Yekaterinburg delegation accused the party  leadership of having made a hash of the elections. This position  was supported by PEF Cochairman Irina Khakamada in addition to  rank-and-file delegates from the localities. She hinted that her  party membership would depend on whether the PEF could work with  the regions or would confine itself to the "individual political  statements" of its leader. Yielding to the pressure of the  obdurate regionals, the congress inserted in the leadership  three cochairmen from the provinces. Konstantin Borovoy, despite  the "intrigues," remains leader of the party and he called on  his comrades for "strict opposition to the policy of the  president and the government." The party hopes to rehabilitate  itself as quickly as possible for the 12 December defeat by  active participation in the local elections.    The burden of the report of Gavriil Popov at the Second RMDR  Congress amounted to the proposition that the Western idea of  reforms in Russia had been defeated and that now "those who have  made a mess of the reforms are being removed." Disagreements  emerged over the assessment of the situation in the movement.  Sergey Krasavchenko dissociated himself from the leader of the  RMDR and declined to run for the Political Council.    Popov formulated the reasons for the failure at the  elections  briefly: the RMDR had been too gentle in its criticism of the  government and had failed to put forward its alternative, local  structures had not been formed, too much time had been spent  looking for allies, the propaganda campaign was insipid....    Judging by everything, the strategic miscalculations of the  movement are connected with the protracted search for political  self-identification. The RMDR simply cannot find its niche (or  does it just not have one?). Were the government to be  criticized harshly, how would the RMDR differ from "Yabloko" or  the Democratic Party of Russia? If the pro-West course of the  reforms does not suit the movement, why does it not form a bloc  with the moderate patriots?    Simply having failed to find for itself a place in the  political spectrum, the congress decided "to strengthen  party-mindedness" and expand the social base of the RMDR. In  addition, the movement opposed early parliamentary and  presidential elections and advocated a three- or fourth-month  postponement of the local elections. The RMDR is proposing this  timeout, probably, because it is well aware that it is not ready  for the struggle for seats.    The Russian Union of Youth (RUY), a founder of the Russia's  Future-New Names election bloc, has also discussed its problems  at a congress. The young people's thoughts on the election  failure were, obviously, so bitter that as a result they decided  to engage mainly not in political but cultural-educational  activity. The reasoning is simple: The youth are apolitical, and  the RUY has not found its niche.    Against the background of the certain revitalization  mimicked  by the nonparliamentary parties of a democratic persuasion, the  patriots have been totally inconspicuous. After not one  patriotic party had made it to the second lap of the election  marathon, they receded for a long time into the background.    Why was this? As a rule, the leaders of the patriotic  opposition attribute their failure to the unfair authorities.  Mikhail Astafyev, chairman of the Constitutional Democratic  Party (CDP-PPF): "We collected 103,000 signatures, but we were  debarred from the elections. We consider this step purely  political, and its purpose, to clear the way for Zhirinovskiy."    The patriots are themselves even embarrassed to acknowledge  that they lost not so much to the authorities as to the LDPR and  that Zhirinovskiy took away their electorate and put them on the  sidelines. The traditional national-patriotic ideology appealing  to the deep past proved less attractive than Zhirinovskiy's  rhetoric addressed to the "glorious future." The doctrine has to  be changed, of course, but in this case a modernized  national-patriotic ideology could be a second edition of the  LDPR program. This despite the fact that no patriot can rival  Zhirinovskiy in a personal capacity.    And these parties' "living space" is diminishing also.  Sergey  Baburin, for example, "has the impression that the government  and the president are joining the patriotic movement." In his  opinion, what the patriots have achieved over the course of two  or three years is now recognized "even by Kozyrev."    Virtually the sole patriotic organization that has retained  its niche is the Congress of Russian Communities (CRC). No one,  apart from it, bothers seriously with Russians from the near  abroad, and the CRC has no rivals, therefore. In an interview  with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, Dmitriy Rogozin, the leader of this  organization, declared: "The Second Congress of Russian  Communities, which was held recently, showed that we are the  sole mass organization which is developing rapidly. We are now  working on separating out from the Congress an organization with  purely political functions and uniting in it under the  provisional name of Union of the Fatherland both  patriot-fundamentalists and some democrats. And on the Congress  retaining the function of a public ministry for the affairs of  the Russian-speaking population in the near abroad."    The Russian National Union (RNU) of Sergey Baburin is  preparing a congress. It is contemplated introducing individual  membership (it is not clear as yet how many members the RNU  has), enhancing intra-Union discipline, and, generally, talking  about what comes next.    The activity of the RNU is today objectively receding into  the background--for its leader, at least. The organization's  main strategic mission, virtually, is the creation for the  leader of a trampoline for a jump "into power." Baburin has  "jumped" into the State Duma, and it is now important for him to  assimilate this platform. He has formed the Russian Way group of  deputies. It has just 17 members as yet, but Baburin is an  optimist: "The Russia faction in the last parliament was formed  over several months. I believe that our ranks will increase on  this occasion also."    The plans of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement  (RCDM)  are, as its leader, Viktor Aksyuchits, declared, "to unite and  fight." Deprived of its headquarters, the movement has drifted  apart into its separate quarters. Aksyuchits has complained that  his own apartment is reminiscent of a party archives, and he  does not have room to turn around. "How can a party lacking  official channels of financing exist," the leader of the RCDM  laments. According to him, the banks have been ordered, on pain  of punitive measures, to freeze all accounts of patriotic  organizations.    The Constitutional Democrats (KDP-PPF) have split yet again.  And although the split has not been recognized officially, no  one is any longer in any doubt about it. At the recent KDP-PPF  conference representatives of 11 regions (approximately half the  party's active organizations) deemed the recent December party  congress invalid and decided to hold it anew in March.    The splitters are reproaching party leader Mikhail Astafyev  with "left-extremist sentiments" and "nonparliamentary forms of  work in the Supreme Soviet," which, in their opinion, caused a  drift of supporters away from the party. In addition, Astafyev  has been guilty of a "violation of intra-party democracy." The  Kadets will in March, most likely, split into right and left--it  could well be down the middle.    Suspecting that they will not survive on their own, the  patriots from time to time make attempts to unite. Without thus  far the aid of the Communists, nothing has come of this. But the  attempts have not been abandoned, and a new coalition began to  be put together at the end of December. Its working name is the  Movement of Civil and Patriotic Forces, the sponsors of the  alliance including Viktor Aksyuchits, Oleg Rumyantsev, Aleksandr  Tsipko, and Andrey Golovin. What brought together the RCDM and  the social democrats and Astafyev's Kadets and the centrists who  associated with the Civic Union? Only the severe shock following  the election defeat, obviously.    But as soon as the shock passed, the plan for unification  began to crumble. Aksyuchits is now obsessed with the idea of  resuscitating the Russian National Assembly, which was formed a  year ago and which departed this life almost immediately. The  patriots to the left of the RCDP and the Kadets (Rumyantsev,  Tsipko, and others) intend to build an autonomous formation--a  National Alliance. True, both give assurances that a union  between them is still possible. The rest of the information is  being kept most strictly secret. Insofar as it is hard to  reproach the leaders of the future organizations with a dislike  of publicity, it may be assumed that there is as yet nothing  about which to speak in more detail. The contemplated  association lacks not only an organizational basis but a  theoretical base also.    This is yet further testimony that the failures of the first  multiparty elections were defeated for objective reasons. Some  of them will attempt to restructure their organizations and  modernize their programs, perhaps. But for many their best years  are already behind them, and they will, most likely, depart the  political arena without having found their electorate.</p>

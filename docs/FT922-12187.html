			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Personal View: An unexplored territory Political analyses of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in particular of relations between its most powerful member, Russia, and the smaller republics, regions and provinces, suffer from one fundamental flaw: commentators have assumed that the latter are stable. This is not the case. In many respects, the future of the republics is insecure. There is both internal unrest within individual CIS members and open external hostility between some of them. Bloody clashes have erupted between Moldova, Gagauz, and the Dniestre republic (in the territory of the former Moldavia); in Belorussia, radicals are demanding the dissolution of their present parliament. But even if we suppose that the smaller new states are fortresses of stability, the region's geopolitical future is still hazy because of the uncertainty over the future of the Russian federation itself. In recent months the following examples of tension have emerged between the Russian federation and its territories: the territory of Krasnoyarsk intends to proclaim itself a republic; more republics have declared the supremacy of their laws over the laws of the Russian federation; Tatarstan announced a referendum on the independent status of the republic. In the past year several autonomous republics of the former Soviet Union have proclaimed their sovereignity while a number of administrative territories have declared their wish to acquire the status of republics. National self-determination is clearly being supplemented with regional identities. In many more cases, regions and provinces are not merely making dramatic gestures by proclaiming themselves republics but are simply adopting a selective approach to relations with Moscow. They carry out only those federal decisions that coincide with what they were going to do anyway. Two developments have provoked these devolutionist sentiments. First, local bosses of political and economic institutions expected strong leadership from the Russian administration, but they have been disappointed. Second, in the transition to a market economy, local bosses want to control and distribute resources themselves. The former command system of economic relations between the centre and the provinces has now been replaced by a more democratic 'give and take' system. However, under this arrangement, republics will not be treated seriously if they only take and not give; this is the present position of Moscow. If this pattern continues, republics, regions and territories will ignore Moscow and other capitals and build their own relations with other elements of the former Soviet Union and with the outside world. Indeed, when these relations are based on commerce this may be a healthy process. 'If Boris Yeltsin is quarelling with Dudaev (the president of the Chechen republic which is not recognised by Russia), this is their problem. My business with the Chechens continues as usual,' said a capitalist from the city of Rostov-on-Don in the south of Russia. Unfortunately, we have too few businessmen and too many politicians. And politicians can conjure up an infinite number of self-serving alignments within our disintegrating heartland to defy the richest imagination. For example, the rebellious President Dudaev of Chechen is calling for an alliance of oil-producing republics of the Russian federation against Russia itself. This may sound crazy, but it is no more so than the frighteningly real armed intervention of the Don cossacks in the conflict between Moldova and the Dniestre republic. How does the west fit into this picture? Perhaps the most significant development in the period following the collapse of the Soviet Union has been the rapid erosion in the west's ability to influence events in the republics. In the Soviet Union the west could have exerted control over events by balancing its support between President Mikhail Gorbachev and the republics' leaders. Today, relations between Russia and its territories are analogous to that which existed between the 'centre' in the former Soviet Union and the republics. I hope I am mistaken but I believe that regionalism in the newly independent republics is unexplored territory for western observers, many of whom are unfamiliar with both the provinces' leaders and their complex political and social processes. Perhaps the best thing that could be done now is for western states to establish a permanent presence in the key regions. There are precedents: there were 16 consulates in Rostov-on-Don before the October revolution. And the consuls successfully combined diplomacy with business. John Martin, the US consul, for example, owned a mechanical plant, a mill, a wool factory and a trading house in Rostov-on-Don. Many useful lessons can be drawn from the past.

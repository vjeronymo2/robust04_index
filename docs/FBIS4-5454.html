			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai Government has promise to honour an  agreement to buy Iranian crude oil, despite problems, and will  bow to a demand for an increase in the supply volume.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak pledged this  yesterday while insisting that attempts will be made to persuade  Teheran to reduce the crude price said to be 50-60 US cents more  than the world market price for the same crude.    His statement is aimed at quelling doubts that Thailand  would  breach terms of the Thai-Iran countertrade deal involving Thai  rice and Iranian crude.    Dr Suphachai said it would be unfair for Thailand to  dishonour the oil deal as Iran has already fulfilled its  commitment by buying Thai rice. He stressed the importance of  Iran as a major export market, especially at the time of market  difficulties.    Teheran has already bought 412,343 tons of Thai rice as part  of the agreement in return for the sale of Iranian crude to  Thailand at the volume of 20,000 barrels a day (b/d).    Suggestions were made by some Cabinet members that Thailand  should yield to Teheran's demand to increase the purchase volume  of Iranian oil from the National Iranian Oil Corp (NIOC) to  15,000 b/d against 5,000 b/d the Petroleum Authority of Thailand  (PTT) was prepared to recelve.    Aside from high price, PTT, the national oil firm, has been  reluctant to buy the Iranian crude which possesses undesirable  high sulphur and metallic content as well as a low yield of oil  products.    That results in higher refining costs and many refiners are  not keen to accept the oil for refining. Oil refiners are also  critical of Iran's ability to commit the delivery at an agreed  tlme.    The PTT has said that two local oil refineries--operated by  Thaioil and Bangchak Petroleum--have the capabilities to process  the problematic crude with an extra cost of 78 million baht,  based on the 15,000 b/d volume.    Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon wi]l fly to Iran on  April 18 to attempt to get a lower price for the Iranian crude  at the level to at least cover the extra refining cost.    Mr Uthai has suggested that the sum be drawn from national  coffers to compensate the PTT.    The minister supports his claims of the need to maintain  Iran  as a market for Thai rice. The volume of rice Teheran bought  from Thailand represents 10-202000060100f total Thai rice exports.</p>

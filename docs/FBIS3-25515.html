			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Nigerian Government has confirmed reports which  surfaced in Cameroon yesterday of a clash between troops from  the two countries in the Bekassi Peninsula. The area has been  at the center of a territorial dispute since late last year when  reinforcements were sent to the area after complaints that local  fishermen were being harassed by Cameroonian troops. President  Biya is even threatening to take the case to the International  Court of Justice. Today's confirmation of the clashes in  Bekassi which happened last Friday [18 February] came from  Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe. On the line to  Abuja, Valerin Sucker asked him what the latest situation was:    [Begin recording] [Kingibe] The situation is rather  quiescent now and the unfortunate clashes which occurred on  Friday have been brought under control, thanks to the efforts of  the two heads of state.    [Sucker] So, you don't foresee any more clashes happening in  the area?    [Kingibe] Well, we are doing our maximum best to restrain  our troops from reacting precipitately to any provocation that  might again come from the Cameroonian side. What I do now is  that we have very disciplined regular forces at that frontier.  They are not these ragtag gendarmes or other paramilitary  organizations which operate along all sorts of instructions  which do not conform to what I suppose a well-disciplined  regular army would recognize and I am sure that on our side, we  will do our level best to ensure that the incidents such as that  which occurred on Friday do not recur.    [Sucker] Were there any casualties?    [Kingibe] The communication and navigation through the  creeks and canals is so difficult that even under the best of  circumstances, it will be very tough to start talking about  casualties. I am sure that if any, they will be minimal and let  us hope that they are. What is important really is that we have  gotten beyond the skirmishes. We are now talking dialogue. We  are now talking peaceful resolution of the dispute that has  given rise to all this unfortunate situation.    [Sucker] You said the two countries are already involved in  dialogue, but already Cameroon has said it would refer the  dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. So  what....    [Kingibe, interrupting] Well, this is what surprises us.  And well, not only a surprise, but somewhat, I might say  disappointed that given the nature of the intense dialogue that  is going on at the very highest level, including regular  telephone contacts, we are surprised and disappointed that there  is this introduction of the possibility of a recourse to third  parties. Of course, the Cameroonian authorities perfectly know  that neither the United Nations nor the OAU, nor indeed the  International Court of Justice will compel Nigeria to submit to  their jurisdiction and quite frankly, the best solution to our  mutual problem is really the bilateral dialogue. Bringing in  third parties only complicates issues further, prolongs the  crisis, and unnecessarily opens some new frontiers, new areas of  opportunity for all sorts of vested interests and parties which  may not wish either of us any good any way. So, I am sure that  the Cameroonian authorities, who might have, in their perhaps  frustration, just thought any recourse to any forum for the  resolution of the problem will be considered.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dai Yong (2071 3144): "Secret News: The U.S. </F> National Reconnaissance Office"]    [Text] For over 30 years, the U.S. National Reconnaissance  Office (NRO) was one of the U.S. Armed Forces' and intelligence  agencies' most secret organs. But in September 1992, the heavy  curtain was pulled back slightly to expose it.  <H5>  A Product of the Cold War </H5>   The NRO was established secretly on 25 August 1960 by the  U.S. National Security Council. Mainly, it was a merger of  several space-related departments from the U.S. Air Force  (USAF), Department of Defense (DoD), and Central Intelligence  Agency (CIA). Despite its public title, the NRO's means of  gathering intelligence and its capabilities were strictly held  secrets.    It is now known that in addition to national photo  reconnaissance satellites, NRO employs telecommunications  intelligence satellites, special purpose reconnaissance  satellites for observing and controlling foreign radar,  meteorological satellites for monitoring the climate at target  sites, and telecommunications relay satellites to transmit  information from space to the earth. The NRO uses virtually no  aircraft.    NRO's chief mission is to furnish accurate target data to  the  USAF's strategic nuclear force, assisting U.S. strategic bombers  and guided missiles in carrying out accurate attacks. At the  same time, it also gathers the topographical data which aids  missiles' on-board computers perform the complex programming  which controls the missiles' flight.    NRO is a principal component of U.S. intelligence agencies,  under the dual direction of DoD and CIA. Its staff is drawn from  DoD, chiefly the Air Force, and with one high-ranking civilian  official of the USAF in charge. The former director was  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Space) Martin Faga.  <H5>  Extraordinary Talents </H5>   The success of NRO's advanced reconnaissance satellites has  been a source of pride for their manufacturer and users alike.    In 1961, NRO satellites discovered the precise number of  strategic nuclear missiles of the former Soviet Union.  Reconnaissance results showed that the number of  intercontinental missiles in the former Soviet Union were much  fewer than Washington had estimated. Satellites took pictures of  the shipping boxes of the first SSX-18 intercontinental missiles  of the former Soviet Union. This new discovery influenced the  superpowers' weapons negotiations for many years. They also  exposed the secret of the former Soviet Union's Y-Class nuclear  submarine: A considerable number of them were huge, expandable,  rubber boats which could be deployed as decoys.    An NRO reconnaissance satellite soaring in the skies  disclosed that the former Soviet Union was constructing a  massive underground concealed command network for use by its  leadership in case nuclear war broke out; that Korea was  building a shrewdly camouflaged nuclear weapon facility near  Yongbyon. In 1988, a satellite discovered a CSS-2  intermediate-range ballistic missile deployment in the Saudi  desert. In this way, Western countries began to suspect that  China had started to export weapons of this sort.    However, NRO analysts have sometimes been fooled, perhaps  due  to the organization's blind faith in the very clear satellite  photographs. When the U.S. found that Libya had a chemical  weapons plant near Rabta, the Libyans played a trick--setting a  fire in the plant area, then coating the plant building with dye  to make it look charred. In this instance, the Americans  believed only in what they saw, decided that the plant had  burned down, and so were taken in.    At the end of 1992, when President Bush decided to dispatch  troops to Somalia, the first question he asked NRO was: "How  long is the runway at the Mogadishu Airport where American  aircraft will land?" This was a key point which the U.S.  military had to know in order for American troops to carry out  "Operation Restore Hope." No one doubted that NRO could answer  this question with no problem.    From the beginning of the seventies to the beginning of the  eighties, Secretary of the Air Force and NRO Director Hans Mark  believed that NRO played an "extremely important role" in world  peace during the Cold War. He says, "NRO made it possible for  the U.S. and the Soviet Union to reach agreement on weapons  control, because NRO could keep watch on them." He also stated  that "NRO plays a major role in providing timely, important  information for policy makers." Some people estimate that NRO  collects 90 percent of U.S. intelligence data.  <H5>  NRO's "Birds" </H5>   It was a long-held, popular belief that NRO's satellite  photographs, taken from 240 km out in space, could differentiate  among the license plate numbers on cars passing through Moscow's  Red Square. When Faga was asked whether they could determine an  individual's sex from the photos, he just smiled. He never  answers questions of this sort.    There is no doubt that NRO has supplied a vast quantity of  detailed pictures from outer space, including Russia's mobile  intercontinental missiles, the mobility status of Iraq's  "Fleetfoot" missile, and the actions of international terrorists  in Libyan training camps. In these instances, timely  intelligence supplied to the U.S. President for grasping the  situation in military or diplomatic confrontations is an  invaluable asset.    Dennis DeConcini, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence  Committee, regards the satellite reconnaissance system as the  most complicated of the various reconnaissance systems now in  operation. He believes that the billions of dollars spent on the  satellite system were worth it for the most part.    Former Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge secretly held  the concurrent post of NRO head during the Reagan  administration. He points out that during the entire Cold War  period, the maintenance of world stability could be attributed  to the success of NRO. Its contribution of pictures which kept  the U.S. in a favorable weapons control position will never be  forgotten. A satellite requires five to eight years from design  to launch.    For more than 30 years, satellites have continued to take on  new telecommunications technology, computers, and optics. In  addition, the microminiaturization of components has greatly  downsized the satellites while considerably improving their  functions and the speed at which they can process data, so their  missions can be assigned or re-assigned rapidly.    NRO satellites operate on an elliptical track, making one  orbit around the earth every 24 hours. It on-board photo  facilities can conduct target reconnaissance and monitoring.  They can take close-up pictures of certain special areas, and  take pictures of wide regions of the globe; researchers can then  look for interesting content in the pictures.    Today, NRO's "birds" are still staring at the strategic  nuclear missile bases in the various countries of the  Commonwealth of Independent States. In the 1990s, in addition to  such traditional assignments as checking on the status of  implementing the agreement to reduce military facilities, the  NRO will assume some new ones.    One of these is monitoring the environment. Such natural  disaster data as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, floods,  earthquakes, etc. will be monitored by satellites of NRO or  other information organs and the data then sent to a group of  specialists doing environmental research. This group consists of  more than 50 specialists drawn from government and localities.  In 1991, the U.S. also set up an environmental operations  contingent under the direction of the CIA.    The demand for political intelligence increases daily.  Examples of this are: taking pictures of the Bo Hei [3134 7815]  POW camp, closely watching the spread of nuclear, biological,  and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles throughout the world  and monitoring the countless regional conflicts which might  threaten U.S. interests.    NRO has received new orders to assist the U.S. military in  rapidly dispatching troops outside the U.S.'s borders. In the  future, more and more U.S. troops will be stationed at home, so  when a crisis situation occurs, intelligence concerning remote  places must be collected in the shortest time possible. At such  times, there is no better way than using satellites.    NRO does not itself assign missions directly to its  satellites; this task is undertaken by a special committee under  the Director of Central Intelligence--the Photo Needs and Use  Committee. NRO's daily assignments come from this committee.  <H5>  The NRO Staff </H5>   NRO is responsible for information satellites and a complex  network of ground facilities. At present, the three U.S.  military branches employ a total of 38 military satellite  control stations throughout the world. The USAF operates 15  stations, most of them used to assist NRO staff.    How many people work for NRO? It is still a secret today.  Its  staff includes civilian technical personnel and engineers who  have undergone intensive training, but it also gets a great deal  of help from the USAF, and its facilities are all hidden in the  USAF.    NRO operators send controlling data to the satellites by  computers, making each satellite travel its required path, as  well as controlling the satellites' entry into space to take  pictures.    Unlike the National Security Agency, the huge U.S.  communications intelligence organization, the NRO does not  itself perform intelligence analysis of the data it gathers, but  it has consumers which do. Examples of these are the CIA, the  Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, U.S. military  intelligence organs, etc.    NRO personnel are very enthusiastic about their work. They  operate complicated machines with thousands of components and  parts; even a slight mistake can have serious consequences as a  satellite could go off track.    The Pentagon's budget has been slashed continuously over the  past eight years, and estimates are that NRO's budget has been  cut to 5 to 6 billion dollars.    In the next several years, it is estimated that the number  of  reconnaissance satellites will be reduced by 25 percent,  although more advanced and longer-lived new satellites will to a  certain degree compensate for some of the reductions. But the  budget reduction means that consumers may not able to get the  intelligence they want on time.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Guatemala rights agreement fails to take root Only four months after the Guatemalan government and left-wing guerrillas signed a human rights agreement, violations have increased. The United Nations has also yet to install a monitoring mission as stipulated in the accord. Political killings, disappearances and kidnappings have doubled in the first six months of this year compared to the equivalent period in 1993, according to the Roman Catholic Church's human rights office. Sightings of tortured bodies on the streets of Guatemala City are becoming more frequent, and the army has continued to recruit youths forcibly in rural areas, violating last March's agreement. Bureaucratic delays at the UN have stalled the deployment of a mission to verify the application of the agreement, say officials, despite a reported commitment by the UN to set up a mission by the end of June. The guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity thought they had won a small victory by insisting on immediate UN verification in the face of long-standing opposition from the powerful Guatemalan army. They have now threatened to suspend talks. 'If the minimum conditions established in the Global Agreement on Human Rights are not met, it is not possible to continue in a process of negotiation,' they said in a statement in national newspapers last week. The delay has led to complaints by local human rights groups that the international community appears more concerned about keeping to a tight agenda to end the conflict than in fostering the conditions for lasting peace where basic rights are respected. 'They are only interested in a ceasefire, not in seeing a resolution of the substantive issues which are considered to have originated and fuelled the armed conflict,' says Monsignor Rodolfo Quesada, a former peace mediator. The two sides who have been negotiating an end to the 33-year civil war for three years agreed in January on a timetable to sign a final peace agreement in December. Since then they have made strong advances, most recently in Oslo last month when they agreed on the establishment of a 'truth commission' to document human rights violations. But the commission has been criticised as merely symbolic by human rights activists, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu, because it will fall short of naming individuals responsible for abuses, and will not provide a moral sanction. Its role will merely be to document events. About 150,000 people have died in Guatemala's internal conflict, mostly killed by the security forces, according to human rights groups. Sources close to the talks say the guerrillas were extremely reluctant to agree to a commission with such small teeth, but were overwhelmed by pressure from the UN and the international community.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gianfranco Simone: "Incisa di Camerana: `We Await </F> Orders From Government; 200 of Our Paratroopers Ready To Leave'"]    [Text] Milan -- "Last Thursday [16 June] I was in the  training area at Ampugnano in Tuscany for an exercise involving  some 200 paratroopers from the Folgore Regiment, organized by  General Loi. I left there at 1800. An hour later, Chief of  Defense Staff Admiral Venturoni issued orders to keep 200  paratroopers on a state of alert with a view to sending them out  to Rwanda." This was said by Gen. Bonifazio Incisa di Camerana,  Army chief of staff, during an official visit to the 3d Army  Corps command in Milan.    "We have been training troops for interventions abroad for  some time. For Bosnia, we trained the Garibaldi Brigade of  Caserta -- 3,000 troops, mostly volunteers on extended service.  A few hundred will be enough for Rwanda, since we have been  talking about a joint action with the French and the Belgians."    It seems that the present preference is for a UN  intervention, however, because the French are not well regarded  by the Tutsi ethnic group, who are threatening to shoot them the  moment they land. So our troops would suffer too. Have the  orders changed?    "We are soldiers, and we go wherever and with whomever the  government orders us; we simply obey orders. It is not my job  to concern myself with politics. I must, rather, consider  technical problems, logistics, which are complicated by the fact  that Rwanda is not on the sea, unlike Somalia, so we could only  use air transportation. So to supply such an effort with the  few C-130's and G.222's that we have would cause us major  difficulties."    These anxieties are well founded. The 46th Air Transport  Brigade has 12 four-engined C-130 Hercules aircraft and 38  twin-engined G-222's, with a potential freight capacity of 20  tonnes and 9 tonnes, respectively. So the problem concerns not  manpower -- a Hercules could carry up to 92 men and a G-222 up  to 53 -- but supplies: from vehicles to water. Furthermore,  the actual availability of usable aircraft is around 50 percent.  Further limitations are imposed by routine tasks in Italy,  exacerbated at present by firefighting activities.</p>

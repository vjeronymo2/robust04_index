Preface </H5>   The economic growth, which started in late 1950s, invited  the  concentration of population into urban areas, and the volume of  city water consumption shows an uneven distribution by area.    For this reason, water is stored once in a dam or the like,  then is used as the water source for city water as necessity  arises; therefore, the water is not fresh enough, besides  presents various problems, including the odor caused by algae,  and the increased possibility of generation of trihalomethane  (THM) due to the deposits of organic substances. Moreover, as  compared with the ratio of population served with city water,  that of sewage does not even reach a half. And, sewage often  contains substances, that are unable to treat with ordinary  sewage treatment method, which in turn invited the increase of  materials that cannot be treated by the ordinary water  purification method. For this reason, there arose the increased  need of advanced water purification treatment; and, the  construction of advanced water purification facilities is  rapidly pushed ahead mostly in the Kanto and the Kansai areas.    Under such circumstances, studies are being made about the  ozone treatment for advanced water purification treatment.    In this report will be explained the recycling of treated  sewage.  <H5>  2. Effects of Improving Water Quality by Ozone </H5>   The most typical water quality improving effects by ozone  may  include (1) decolorization, (2) deodorizing, (3) disinfection,  (4) prevention of adhesion of organic slime, and (5) decrease of  COD.    Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows the examples of  decolorization and deodorizing by ozone of sewage after  secondary treatment. In these examples, both hue and odor were  reduced with as little as 5-10 mg/l. For recycling the treated  sewage to landscaping water, the decrease of hue and odor  becomes necessary; and, the effects of ozone treatment are  recognized in this field too, and the method has already been  applied to over a dozen places.    If colitis germs are dispersed in water, and the ozone  treatment test is realized, only as small as 0.25 mg/l of ozone  would be required for almost completely killing germs whose  initial bacterial count is 10[.sup]6[/] per milliliter.  Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows the results of the ozone  treatment test realized with the waste water after secondary  treatment; the amount of ozone required for reducing the colitis  germs increases to about 10 mg/l. This is because ozone reacted  with contaminating materials; and, when disinfection is realized  by ozone treatment, if the amount of contaminating materials is  large, the amount of ozone required also increases.    The latent heat energy of the sewage after secondary  treatment is increasingly used for heating and cooling of  building, and heating and cooling of a wader area. But, organic  materials remaining in the sewage after secondary treatment or  components of scale may cause organic slime or scale in the heat  exchanger or the piping, thus preventing the collection of the  necessary heating value. For this reason, preventing organic  slimes or scales would be indispensable for the recycling of  heat energy. For preventing the deposition of organic slime,  about 5 mg/l of ozone may be injected intermittently (normally  once or twice a day) for about 5 minutes once a day, thus the  running cost may prove to be economical. If oxygen is used as  the raw material gas, it is also possible to use an ozone  generator, which generates and stores ozone, may be used, when  no ozone injection is realized; in the case, the running cost  and the initial cost would prove to be further lower. [sentence  as published]  <H5>  3. History of the Development of Ozone Generator </H5>   Production of industrial ozone generators was started in  Japan around 1965; but, ozone generators introduced then  resulted in fairly high running cost and initial cost. Since  then a series of improvements was made to the ozone generator in  order to respond to the requirements about ozone at water  plants, sewerage facility, human wastes treatment plants, and  manufacturing plants, thus reaching to the ozone generator we  know these days.    Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows the change in the power  consumption and that in the density of ozone generated. As  compared with when 32.5 kWh power was needed, including  auxiliary equipment, for producing 1 kg of ozone in 1972, at  present the required power dropped to the 18 to 20 kW range,  that means nearly 40 percent saving in energy. And, significant  technological innovation was also achieved, as a result of which  the density of ozone also nearly doubled from 10  g/Nm[.sup]3[/] to 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/]. During the same  period of time, of ozone generating capacity of each unit when  air us used as raw material was 38 kg 03/hr, the ozone generator  by using oxygen as raw material produced 60 kg 03/hr; and, the  number of units produced already exceeded 1,000.    Ozone generators currently available feature high  efficiency,  reduced space required, low price, high controllability, and  high reliability. These advantages may be attributed, mainly to  (1) Thanks to the high-frequency and high-density discharge by  using the constant-current type inverter as the power source,  the charge power per unit area of discharge tube could be  largely increased; thus, the space required for the equipment  could be reduced, and at the same time the density of ozone at  the time of generation was raised, thus successfully reducing  the amount of the raw material gas; (2) As the dimensional  precision of glass electrode was remarkably improved, thus,  making it possible to obtain smaller and ave [as published]  discharge gap length, which in turn brought about optimum  cooling effect in the discharge space and stable discharge, thus  the ozone generation efficiency was improved; (3) Through the  use of the constant-current type inverter, the control range of  ozone generation volume expanded to 5 to 100 percent, besides  the response property of generation volume regulation was  improved; thus, promising superior response to load fluctuations  in the volume of water or the quality of water; and, (4) Thanks  to the development of an integral exclusive ozone generator and  the energy-saving type air cooler/dryer unit, energy saving and  space saving were made possible.  <H5>  4. Ozone Reactors </H5>   In order to cause ozone to effectively react to the object  material, the following should be taken into account regarding  the ozone reactor:    (1) Generally speaking, the smaller the LV is, the better  the  ozone absorption efficiency (ozone use efficiency), and the  smaller becomes the amount of discharge ozone. However, for  reducing the LV, the reactor has to be increased in size; thus,  the LV for sewage should be kept at 25 m/hr or so.    (2) At the same amount of ozone generation, the higher the  supply ozone density, the smaller becomes the volume of ozonized  air; therefore, the value of LV may become smaller, thus the  ozone absorption efficiency may be improved; but, the difference  at 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/] is small.    (3) The greater the water depth, the higher the solubility  of  ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption rate is improved.  But, the ozonization air pressure at the ozone generator output  is 0.7 kg/cm2-G; for this reason, the water depth in many cases  is 4 to 5 m.    (4) The smaller the air bubble diameter, the higher the  solubility of ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption  efficiency is improved. However, in order to reduce the air  bubble diameter, the diffuser pipe's air hole diameter should be  made smaller, which in turn brings about a greater pressure  loss; thus, the air bubble diameter is normally kept at 3mm or  so.  <H5>  5. Treatment of Residual Ozone </H5>   For carrying out the ozone treatment, it is necessary to  treat the residual ozone remaining in the ozone treatment water,  and the discharged ozone (non-reacted ozone) that was not used,  and remains in the gas as redundant ozone.    (1) If there exists residual ozone of high density and high  water volume, ozone comes out of water into the atmospheric air,  causing strong odor. In such event, discharge ozone treatment  should be realized by ventilating air with fan, etc. As the  degradation time of residual ozone in water is short, thus it is  necessary to let the residual ozone self-degrade by setting  aside a sufficient retention time by using the retention time as  needed, by taking into account the effects on to the following  steps.    (2) The discharge ozone (non-reacted ozone), that was not  used in reaction and remains in the gas as redundant ozone  should be treated. If no treatment is realized, there remains a  strong odor of high-density ozone. Moreover, the discharge ozone  in the air corrodes equipment, mainly the electric appliances,  found nearby; and, if the discharge ozone is of high density, it  may cause negative effects to human body.    Activated carbon is normally used for treatment of the  discharged ozone. Activated carbon is filled in the discharge  ozone degradation column, and is replaced once every 3 to 4  months. The ozone degradation capacity of 1 g activated carbon  is about 2 g of ozone for sewage. Ozone is discharged into air  at the safe concentration level of 0.1 ppm or less from the  outlet of the discharged ozone, manganese-based catalyst and  activated carbon may be used together if the scale of the  treatment facility is large.  <H5>  6. Comparison of Ozone Treatment and Other Treatment Methods </H5>   The ozone treatment brings about the water quality  improvement effects and the disinfecting effects. When comparing  the ozone treatment with other treatment methods, it will be  necessary to select the object treatment method depending on the  purpose:    (1) For purpose of the water quality improvement, to compare  with the treatment with activated carbon.    (2) For disinfecting purpose, to compare with the NaClO  (sodium hypochlorite) treatment or the ultraviolet ray treatment.    6.1 Comparison With Activated Carbon Treatment  Method    In addition to the decrease of the hue, odor, COD, and  surface active agent, both ozone treatment and activated carbon  treatment bring about the following effects:    (1) Disinfection and increase of dissolved oxygen by the  ozone treatment.    (2) Decrease of BOD by the activated carbon treatment.    For the water quality items, both methods have their own  advantages and disadvantages; but, in many cases, both methods  would bring about certain positive effects to such problem  points as hue and odor. Moreover, the ozone treatment promises  disinfecting effects, besides reducing space of installation,  and lowering the cost of construction and maintenance. And, as  the quality of the treated water does not change over the  passage of time, the ozone treatment would be suitable,  generally speaking, for the sewage water after secondary  treatment.    6.2 Comparison With NaClO Treatment    The NaClO treatment, thanks to its sustainable disinfecting  effects, is used in many fields whether for city water or for  sewage. But, the ozone treatment may promise a wide range of  compound effects, in addition to disinfection. As compared with  the chlorine-based disinfectants, ozone treatment offer stronger  disinfecting power against bacteria, and stronger inactivating  power against viruses. THM is generated, if NaClO treatment  method is used, but it can be reduced through the ozone  treatment; thus, the ozone treatment method is known to be  superior. In the future studies will be made for the combined  use of the two methods, or using the ozone treatment mainly for  killing germs by making the best of its characteristics; and,  using chlorine-based disinfectant, which is less likely to form  THM, if prolonged disinfecting effects are expected.    6.3 Comparison With Ultraviolet Ray Method    The ultraviolet ray treatment method, thanks to the easiness  of installation, is often used for disinfecting clean water or  air, which is not polluted much. However, for the ultraviolet  ray treatment, the treatment effects may be halved if the lamp  is stained; and, as the irradiation depth is shallow, a large  number of lamps has to be set up. Furthermore, the lamp life is  as short as half year to one year, besides durability is  unpredictable; and, the lamp replacement cost is also high.    As compared with this, the ozone treatment promises stable  effects, besides being able to handle from small to large  quantity. As the running cost is also lower, the ozone treatment  method would be more acceptable as compared with the ultraviolet  treatment method.  <H5>  7. Examples of Advanced Sewage Treatment Facility </H5>   Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows an example of the actual  treatment flow diagram of the advanced sewage treatment (when  used to the intermediate water). The advanced sewage treatment  is often applied to the landscaping water, water used for  hydrophilic (waterfront facility) purposes, intermediate water  system, etc. But, from the viewpoint of preservation of water  quality, the ozone treatment would be increasingly used for  improving the quality of discharged water.    The advanced sewage treatment facilities by using ozone  currently operating in Japan are classified as follows by the  purpose of application (main purposes):       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Landscaping water, hydrophilic (water-|9 facilities                          |  |front) use water                      |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Improvement of quality of discharged  |7 facilities                          |  |water                                 |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Intermediate water system             |3 facilities                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Prevention of organic slime           |2 facilities                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>   The ozone treatment facility already has history of nearly  100 years in other nations; it has a history scarcely 20 years  in Japan. However, in Japan where urban areas are highly  populated, this requiring a large amount of water, the recycling  of treated sewage would be indispensable. And, the expectation  on the sewage treatment by using ozone will continue increasing.  Thus, we are more than ready to push ahead with our R&amp;D  efforts  regarding the ozone generator and the ozone treatment facility.</p>

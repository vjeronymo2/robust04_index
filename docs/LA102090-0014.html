			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS 136, 137  </P> <P> The League of Women Voters is opposing Props. 136 and 137.  </P> <P> Prop. 136 would require that all special taxes put before the voters would  require a two-thirds vote to pass instead of a majority vote.  </P> <P> In addition all cities, counties and possibly special districts would have to  submit all increases in taxes or new tax proposals to a vote. The league  believes this measure constitutes a serious hindrance to representative  government.  </P> <P> Prop. 136 also seeks to nullify any taxes approved by the voters in other  measures on this ballot: namely Props. 126 and 134, dealing with alcohol taxes,  and Prop. 133 which proposes to raise taxes for drug enforcement and education.  While the league takes no stand on these particular measures, it does support  decision-making by a simple majority of the voters. If Prop. 136 passes, future  proposals to raise taxes for hospitals, libraries or pollution cleanup or for  any purpose the voters deem worthy could fail for lack of a two-thirds vote.  Prop. 136 is heavily financed by the liquor industry.  </P> <P> Prop. 137 would require that any change with respect to the initiative and  referendum process, no matter how minor, must be submitted to the voters. The  league believes that this measure is unnecessary and that it would lead to more  clutter on the ballot and more cost. The initiative and referendum process is  already well protected in California's Constitution.  </P> <P> DORIS ROSENBERG, Acting President, LWV-Beach Cities  </P> <P> LYNITTA SCHAFFER, President, LWV-Torrance  </P> <P> KAY CONRAD, President, LWV-Palos Verdes  </P></p>

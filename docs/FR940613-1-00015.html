Therefore, the provisions of that Act regarding an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 603 and 604) do not apply here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Recent FDIC Regulatory Initiatives on Mutual-To-Stock Conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years numerous mutually owned State Savings Banks have converted to stockholder-owned State Savings Banks. Many of the institutions that converted from mutual to stock form first converted from federal or state mutual savings associations regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to State Savings Banks. One consequence of these conversions to State Savings Banks is that the FDIC replaces the OTS as the institution's primary federal regulator. Mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks are generally subject to the rules and entitled to the protections of the applicable state law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some federal laws also apply, such as the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78j.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conversion rules under state law are not identical to and in some cases are less stringent than OTS regulations. The absence of consistent treatment under state laws and the lack of some federal oversight of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock conversions present an opportunity for inconsistency and abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of concerns about prior and potential abuses in the conversion process, on February 1, 1994, the FDIC issued for public comment a proposed policy statement on the conversions of State Savings Banks from mutual to stock ownership (Proposed Policy Statement). 59 FR 4712. The general purpose of the Proposed Policy Statement was to solicit public comment on the issues involved in mutual-to-stock conversions and whether and how the FDIC should regulate this activity. The areas of FDIC concern identified in the Proposed Policy Statement were: (1) Proper appraisal of the institution to be sold; (2) proper pricing of the stock sold in the conversion; (3) fair apportionment of the stock subscription rights; (4) adequate disclosure of information needed to make an informed investment decision; and (5) non-abusive compensation and benefits provided to insiders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposed Policy Statement the Board of Directors of the FDIC (Board) determined that during the pendency of the Proposed Policy Statement it was necessary for the FDIC to review applications filed by State Savings Banks with their respective state banking regulator and any other applicable state and federal banking and/or securities regulators to determine whether the proposed conversions contain any safety and soundness issues and/or issues of insider abuse that reflect negatively on the integrity and competence of the management of the converting institution. The Board's concerns were caused by several recent and pending mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks that had given rise to questions related to management abuse and excessive enrichment of insiders, fairness to depositors and general safety and soundness concerns. These conversions have recently been the subject of Congressional hearings and numerous news articles and reports. The FDIC also had received (and continues to receive) direct complaints from depositors of State Savings Banks about unfair treatment and insider abuse in mutual-to-stock conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, on February 15, 1994, the FDIC issued an interim final rule adding a new section to Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations (to be published at 12 CFR 303.15) prohibiting State Savings Banks from converting to stock form without complying with the requirements of the interim rule (Interim Rule). 59 FR 7194. The Interim Rule requires State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form consisting of a description of the proposed conversion accompanied by a copy of all documentation and application materials filed with the applicable state and federal regulators. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC currently reviews all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in: The use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials; the participation of depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion; the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community. In a proposed merger/conversion, the FDIC pays particular attention to the value offered to depositors of the converting institution and the compensation packages offered to management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

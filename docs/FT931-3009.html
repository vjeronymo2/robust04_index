			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Standard set for excise payments - Oil Duty This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. EXCISE DUTY on oil is to be assessed in future on the volume of the oil at a standard 15 degrees Celsius, Customs and Excise said yesterday. Customs described the change as technical, required to implement the provisions of an EC directive on the duty structure for mineral oils. It said: 'The density of oil products varies with temperature and the actual quantity of oil delivered will vary slightly as the temperature rises and falls. The proposal will require deliveries of oil products to be adjusted to the volume which would have been delivered at a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius and the excise duty calculated on that volume. 'As our climate does not suffer from wide extremes of temperature and the adjustments are in any case very small, this proposal will have only a minor impact. Domestic consumers will notice no change. 'This system is already widely used by oil companies for internal accounting, and is the agreed method of duty accounting in the EC. 'At present excise duty is accounted for on the basis of the volume at the delivered temperature. Conversion to a standard temperature ensures that any difference is cor-rected and that a consistent quantity of product is accounted for.' The Finance Bill will make provision for the conversion methods to be used, and for retaining bulk volume measurement in circumstances where temperature adjustment is not possible (eg importation of oil in drums). A joint Customs/Industry Working Group has been formed to produce guidelines on the introduction and operation of standard temperature accounting. Subject to the recommendations of this group, the change is expected to take effect on 15 October 1993. This coincides with the start of a duty accounting period. The proposal is expected to be revenue neutral.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Donohue turnround in final quarter DONOHUE, a Canadian newsprint producer, returned to profit in the final quarter of 1992 with higher shipments, higher prices, a lower Canadian dollar and strong construction timber markets. Profit for the quarter was CDollars 2.4m (USDollars 1.88m) or 7 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 38.5m, or CDollars 1.20, a year earlier. This was on sales of CDollars 137m, against CDollars 110m. For all 1992, a loss of CDollars 14.7m, or 47 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 58m, or CDollars 1.80, on sales of CDollars 520m, against CDollars 470m. North American newsprint price discounts are due to be reduced by 7 per cent from April 1 but market pulp prices continue to be weak. Donohue is controlled by Quebecor, North America's second largest commercial printer.</p>

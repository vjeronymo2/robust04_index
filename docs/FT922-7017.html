			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Renault stages strong recovery in profits RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, yesterday reported a strong first-quarter profits recovery. Pre-tax profits climbed from FFr298m (Dollars 56.2m) in the first three months of 1991 to FFr2.36bn in the same period of this year, on sales up by 19.3 per cent from FFr40.01bn to FFr47.73bn. The gain comes after accounting for Renault's FFr180m share of Volvo's losses. The group attributed the improvement to record car sales in the first quarter. This was mostly due to the group's performance, though a limited gain also came from the release of pent-up demand, which had built up during last autumn's strike at Renault's main engine and gear box making plant. The latest figures continue the sharp improvement in Renault's profits shown over the whole of last year, and is a mark of the productivity gains achieved under the chairmanship of Mr Raymond Levy. He is due to retire on Friday, after nearly six years at the head of the group. His successor, expected to be the managing director Mr Louis Schweitzer, is likely to be named next week. Renault sold FFr40.28bn worth of cars in the first quarter, 84.4 per cent of total turnover, well up on the 80.9 per cent of total sales they represented in the same period of 1991. Truck making accounted for FFr6.33bn, and the remaining FFr1.1bn came from other industrial activities.</p>

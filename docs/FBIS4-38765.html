			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- "The completion of the  negotiation process between Ukraine and Russia over the division  of the Black Sea Fleet is vital for settling the Crimean  problem," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said.    In his address to the Ukrainian parliament on the situation  in the Crimea on Wednesday, Kravchuk said that "we must not  demand that Russia immediately withdraw its ships from  Sevastopol. This would be wrong from the strategic point of  view in the first place."    Ukraine cannot ban Russia from keeping a navy force in the  Black Sea. History has bound Russia and Ukraine to live in  peace and friendship and be equal partners, Kravchuk said. He  added that the question of the fleet is the "question of Ukraine  and Russia."    He stressed that it must be solved gradually, without  causing  the situation to worsen. He agreed that the fleet should be  divided and based in different places, but stressed the need to  determine the status of the Russian part of the fleet which will  be located in Ukraine.    Ukraine is seeking to find such a solution which would "meet  the national interests and take into account Russia's security  needs in the south," Kravchuk said. He noted that in the future  Russia will have to set up a navy base on its own territory.    The Ukrainian leader emphasised that after the recent talks  in Moscow between the Russian and Ukrainian official delegations  "some details of the agreements on the fleet are beginning to  take shape." He said that the talks will resume in the near  future.    Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue is vital not only  for Ukraine and the Crimea, but also "all European states and  the world community."</p>

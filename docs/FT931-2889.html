			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Brazilian pulp group back in the black ARACRUZ Celulose, Brazil's leading pulp producer, recorded profits last year of Dollars 18m - taking the company back into the black after heavy losses in 1991 - in spite of the country's continuing economic difficulties. Much of the turnround was due to a large increase in sales from 763,000 to 977,000 tonnes, bringing in Dollars 460m and representing 23 per cent of world production in bleached eucalyptus pulp. More than 80 per cent of output was export-ed. Mr Mauro Molchansky, finance director, said the company was helped by an average 7 per cent increase in world prices and a reduction of financial costs through an injection of capital of Dollars 270m, half raised on the Brazilian stock market and half through ADRs in New York. Sadia, a leading Brazilian agribusiness concern, suffered a decline profits to Dollars 28.3m, down by about 40 per cent on the 1991 figure of Dollars 45.8m, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. Sadia is Brazil's leading producer of poultry, beef, and industrialised meat and pork products and second in soya output.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Mesut Ertugay from Bucharest] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In a news conference at the  Turkish Embassy in Bucharest today, President Suleyman Demirel  commented on the recent developments with regard to the Turkish  troops to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Demirel recalled that  until now Turkey has always acted together with the rest of the  world and contributed to UN services rendered for peaceful  purposes.    Underlining the senselessness of the opposition to sending  Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the president declared:  Why should Turkish troops not be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Greece is opposed to this on the grounds that it does not want  neighbors to be involved. Is this the real issue? Actually, it  is not, but the matter has been settled. [passage omitted]    Demirel said that a draft free trade agreement was submitted  to Romania. The two sides also focused on cooperation in the  fields of transportation, free trade zones, energy, tourism,  promotion of investments, and the prevention of pollution in the  Black Sea, Demirel recounted. The president said that he  conveyed to Romania Turkey's views concerning safe passage  through the Turkish straits.    [Begin Demirel recording] The current question consists of  passage through the Istanbul and Canakkale straits. Soon it  will be impossible to cross these straits. Currently there are  50,000 ships passing through the Istanbul strait. Within three  or four years, especially following the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, when Ukraine, Russia, and other countries will  want to reach world markets and vice versa, this number is  expected to reach 100,000. If you attempt to transport 100 or  200 million tonnes of oil via the straits, you will fail  totally. This is impossible. Therefore, this matter does not  only concern us. It is our concern only because of other  countries' free commercial passage right through the straits.  If, however, the straits are clogged, the right to free passage  will automatically disappear. [end recording]    Demirel announced that Turkey has conveyed a technical  statute formulated with the aim of guaranteeing safe passage  through the straits to the relevant countries.

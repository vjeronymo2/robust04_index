During a news conference, Yoshiyama added: "The opposition  is  seeking to politicize the case by involving a general who has  been very successful in the battle against terrorism in  incidents in which he did not participate. Frankly, they are  very mistaken in regard to Gen. Hermoza."    Yoshiyama, who by law is the vice president of the Republic  but who does not perform the duties of the office, said the  opposition is also attempting to involve high-ranking Army and  intelligence officers in this case.    The CCD president also rejected statements being made by  many  people, including Catholic Church Bishop Augusto Vargas  Alzamora, for military justice to impose the harshest punishment  possible on those guilty of the disappearance and deaths of nine  La Cantuta students and one professor.    "I believe a 20-year sentence for the guilty parties, as  requested by the military prosecutor, is a drastic and severe  sentence," the president of the CCD stressed.    The military prosecutor believes that six soldiers  participated in the incident, and the punishment requested for  them is between 15 and 20 years in prison each. The sentences  requested for the other five soldiers, who are all charged with  negligence, range from 30 days to five years in prison.    Since April 1993, the Peruvian opposition has been demanding  "Hermoza's resignation so that justice can be meted out freely,  because, as commander of the Armed Forces, the soldiers involved  in La Cantuta case were under his command." Likewise, the  opposition has also reiterated the charge made by Gen. Rodolfo  Robles, who is currently in exile in Argentina. Gen. Robles has  said "Gen. Hermoza is harboring" the death squad that carried  out the killings at La Cantuta University in July 1992.</p>

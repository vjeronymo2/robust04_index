			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE MISSIONS PRIME PUMP FOR L.A. PORT;  </P> <P> COMMERCE: THE FACILITY HAS SURPASSED NEW YORK TO BECOME THE NATION'S BUSIEST  COMMERCIAL GATEWAY. VISITS TO FOREIGN CUSTOMERS ARE VITAL TO THAT STATUS,  OFFICIALS SAY.  </P> <P> It was a small matter, really, in the multibillion-dollar world of the Sony  Corp. Seven shipping containers crammed with televisions, radios and electronic  gadgets had disappeared from a terminal at the Port of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The incident happened nearly six months ago, but port officials were still  jittery about it when they called on Sony officials here last week.  </P> <P> "The numbers are insignificant," said Ezunial Burts, executive director of the  Port of Los Angeles. But Burts said he was concerned that an important tenant  would lose confidence in the port.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the worrying had paid off. Months of apologies, assurances  and tightened security had satisfied the Sony officials, and the Los Angeles  delegation emerged smiling from their meeting.  </P> <P> The Sony visit was one of dozens made by the seven-member group during a  weeklong trade mission to Korea and Japan that ended Friday. Port officials  said that attention to matters large and small has helped to push the Port of  Los Angeles into the forefront of Pacific Rim trade.  </P> <P> While part of the group headed off to make calls on port customers, Los Angeles  Mayor Tom Bradley, who led the delegation, met with Japanese Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu and had sessions with local and regional government officials.  </P> <P> The trip, like dozens made by port officials in recent years, was part public  relations, part negotiation and part intelligence-gathering.  </P> <P> "I've been here many, many times," Burts said. "You can't do business by fax or  letter. You have to do business face to face and it takes time. That's what  pays huge dividends."  </P> <P> The trip comes just seven weeks after the U.S. Customs commissioner announced  that the Port of Los Angeles has surpassed New York as the nation's busiest  commercial gateway. Port officials said the news gave the delegation a  strategic boost, particularly in dealing with the status-conscious Japanese.  </P> <P> Now a hub of international commerce, the Port of Los Angeles has undergone  remarkable development in recent decades, and the recent milestone represents a  significant east-to-west realignment in commerce.  </P> <P> A century and a half ago, when New York was already a bustling international  seaport, the marshlands of San Pedro were so dismal that they inspired a young  seaman named Richard Henry Dana to describe the place as "the hell of  California," an observation he included in his classic "Two Years Before the  Mast."  </P> <P> Last year, according to the Customs statistics, the equivalent of about 1.4  million loaded, 20-foot cargo containers passed through the Port of Los  Angeles. That volume established the port as the leading source of government  revenue from commercial traffic, with annual collection of tariffs and fees in  excess of $1.7 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New York Ranking  </P> <P> New York ranked second in terms of commercial traffic in 1989, with 1.2 million  of the standardized containers imported or exported. The Port of Long Beach was  a close third, with 1.17 million.  </P> <P> The dollar value of the shipments passing through the Port of New York remains  the highest in the nation, with $117.8 billion to $101.4 billion for Los  Angeles. However, Customs officials said last month it is beyond question that  Los Angeles is taking over from New York and predicted that the trend will  continue through the 1990s.  </P> <P> In large part, the boom in the Port of Los Angeles reflects the growing  importance of Pacific Rim trade and the tremendous population boom in Southern  California over the last two decades. Much of the merchandise and material  shipped to the port comes from Asia and is intended to satisfy the huge  consumer market in Southern California.  </P> <P> However, the port has also developed from a regional point of entry to a major  transshipment center. As much as 50% of the goods shipped to the port are  transferred to destinations east of the Rocky Mountains, including Europe, said  Burts, the port director.  </P> <P> Port officials say a policy of aggressively pursuing opportunities in Pacific  Rim trade has helped to push Los Angeles ahead.  </P> <P> A key means of establishing Los Angeles as a major presence in international  shipping is frequent trade missions to seek out potential customers and call on  existing clients to make sure that their needs are being met, the officials  said.  </P> <P> Last week's trip to Japan and Korea was a pump-priming mission with no specific  result expected, they said.  </P> <P> The seven-member delegation consisted of Bradley and an aide from his office,  Jeff Matsui; Port Commission Chairman Jun Mori; Commissioner Robert G. Rados;  Burts, and two port staff members, Albert B. Fierstine, director of marketing,  and Julia T. Nagano, public relations director.  </P> <P> "What I want to leave Korea with is a kind of inside feeling about what some of  the important people in this country think is happening to trade, politics and  the economy," Burts said early in the week. "It's intelligence-gathering, it's  saying, 'Thank you,' it's getting a feel for issues other than shipping . . .  the kind of stuff that doesn't flow back and forth on telexes."  </P> <P> In Seoul, the group made calls on existing customers as well as some potential  ones who now use other West Coast ports, all of which are engaged in tough  competition for the lucrative Pacific Rim trade.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the delegation crossed paths with a group from the Port of Oakland,  which was on a similar mission. In marked contrast to Los Angeles, Oakland has  been losing its share of the shipping market in recent years, especially in the  area of containerized shipping, the chief indicator of standing in  international commerce.  </P> <P> Los Angeles port officials said the presence of Bradley on trade missions gives  them a secret weapon not available to port representatives from other cities.  Bradley's stature as mayor of the nation's second-most populous city and now  its busiest port opens doors in the Far East that would otherwise be  inaccessible, they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bradley's Role  </P> <P> Bradley attends sessions with government officials and key officials of  shipping lines that are major tenants of the port, a gesture that greatly  impresses the executives, according to Shuji Nomura, a Japanese native who is  the port's full-time representative in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "This gives the customer the sense that the entire organization of the city of  Los Angeles is interested" in his company, Nomura said. Bradley, he said, is  thoroughly conversant in the trade issues and actively participates in the  meetings.  </P> <P> The presence of Mori, the port commission chairman, also is a substantial  asset, Nomura said. Mori, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Kelley, Dreye  &amp; Warren, a New York law firm, speaks flawless Japanese, a fact that  impresses both government and business officials in Japan, Nomura said.  </P> <P> On Thursday afternoon, both Bradley and Mori were invited to meet with Prime  Minister Kaifu, who carved out time for them on what was a highly charged day  in Japanese politics. The grounds of the Imperial Palace were closed to  visitors and security throughout central Tokyo was extremely tight in  anticipation of the arrival Thursday of Korean President Roh Tae Woo. Both  Kaifu and Japanese Emperor Akihito met with Roh on Thursday to offer  long-anticipated apologies for Japan's harsh colonial treatment of Korea prior  to Japan's defeat in World War II.  </P> <P> The significance of Bradley's reception by Kaifu on such a day was not lost on  the 150 government and business officials who attended a reception held by the  Los Angeles delegation Thursday evening, Nomura said.  </P> <P> The reception at the elegant Imperial Hotel, just across the street from the  Imperial Palace, was intended as a grand finale to the mission.  </P> <P> Top officials of Japanese utilities showed up, including Gaishi Hiraiwa,  chairman of the Giant Tokyo Electric Power Co. Hiraiwa's attendance was a  particular triumph for Los Angeles, port officials said, and represented a  public display by Hiraiwa that he supports the port's effort to put together a  joint venture to export coal to Asian nations.  </P> <P> The port is in an exploratory phase of a project to develop the venture, in  which coal companies in the United States, as well as utility companies in  Asia, would invest in a bulk-loading facility at the port.  </P> <P> Such a venture would decrease the cost to the port, as well as the financial  risk, if the market for coal drops off. The port has been attempting to  interest coal-hungry Asian utility companies in such a plan for a decade.  </P> <P> "This meeting tonight, I think, is one of the best indications of how  persistence pays off," Bradley said Thursday. "Ten years ago I was here and we  talked about developing a coal terminal. . . . Nobody was willing at that point  to make a financial commitment."  </P> <P> The response was dramatically different on Thursday, Bradley said, adding that  he heard strong support for the plan.  </P> <P> Twenty-eight business concerns, including American and Japanese companies, have  contributed $25,000 each to conduct a feasibility study. If the firms decide to  go ahead with the project, which will require the construction of a new and  streamlined bulk-loading facility, it should be in operation within three  years, according to Burts, the port director. The port's current annual export  of about 1 million tons of coal could then increase by 10 or 15 times, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Venture  </P> <P> The venture is unusual because the port normally functions as landlord for its  100 tenants, whose leases range from individual stalls at the fish market to  100-acre container terminals. The joint-venture agreement would make the  investors partners with the port, rather than just tenants.  </P> <P> Port officials say their concentration on development of bulk-loading will help  to further diversify the port, which also has developed a major cruise ship  industry.  </P> <P> The officials in the delegation last week acknowledged that their sales efforts  come at significant expense, especially in Japan where the dollar is weak and  rooms in the best hotels cost $500 a night. They repeatedly said they feared  that newspaper reports would make the trip appear as a lavish junket, although  virtually all their time was spent in meetings and business dinners.  </P> <P> They said that the trips, parties and gifts (Japanese officials attending the  reception were given key rings from Tiffany &amp; Co.) are the cost of doing  business in the Far East.  </P> <P> Although officials could not provide a cost estimate for the trip, Burts said  that the Thursday reception cost a minimum of $15,000. It featured women in  traditional Japanese costumes who scurried about the room, refilling glasses  almost before they were empty, and whisking away used plates.  </P> <P> Elaborate buffet tables were covered with sushi, silver trays of smoked salmon,  beef Stroganoff, pasta, pastries and other concoctions. A large ice sculpture  of a bird in flight decorated one table. "This is a triple-A party," said  Burts. "If we had to spend $500,000 on one party, it would be worth it, because  even one client can bring in $10 million in business."  </P></p>

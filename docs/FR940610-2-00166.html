(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and the Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 1015 relating to quotation guarantees, to mirror the text of Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A&hyph;11, with the addition of a ``trade or fade'' provision. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;91&hyph;45, as amended, for text of Advice A&hyph;11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements Regarding the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Rule 1033(a) states that all bids/offers in Phlx equity/index options are deemed to be for one contract, unless otherwise specified; in addition, specialists and Registered Options Traders (``ROTs'') are required to fill public orders to a minimum depth of ten contracts at the best quoted bid/offer. Consequently, orders for public customers are provided with preferential treatment not afforded to other types of orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Phlx proposes to adopt a ``trade or fade'' provision comparable to the proposals of the other options exchanges for the handling of orders other than public customer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, when a non-public order is represented in the trading crowd at the displayed market on the Exchange, the trading crowd would be required to either satisfy the order at that price or better, or fade (withdraw) to a newly disseminated price. If the quote is faded, immediate re-display of the previously disseminated quote without a change in market conditions to warrant such action would be considered conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  which could result in an Exchange disciplinary proceeding. For purposes of this rule, non-public orders include broker-dealer orders and that portion of customer orders exceeding the contract size guaranteed by the respective crowd. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Phlx Rule 707. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is similar to proposals of other option exchanges in that it would expressly require the members of an options trading crowd to respond to non-public orders represented in that trading crowd by either satisfying the order or updating the market in that option series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were either solicited or received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Phlx consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) by order approve such proposed rule change, or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing.

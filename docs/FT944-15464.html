			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Contenders fight it out for Czech prize - Part-sale of SPT Telecom may be biggest foreign investment to date Twelve of the world's leading telecommunications groups are fighting for a 27 per cent stake in SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's telephone operator, in what could become the country's biggest one-off foreign investment opportunity to date. Competition for the stake - valued at between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn - is likely to be fierce. If the price reaches the higher end of expectations it will outstrip Volkswagen's DM1.4bn (Dollars 900m), five-year purchase of 70 per cent of Skoda Automobile as the largest foreign investment yet in the country. 'This is the big one, the one everybody has been waiting for,' says a merchant banker advising one of the bidding companies. The 12 companies must make preliminary bids by mid-December. Those that most fully meet the government's two main criteria - price and operational experience - will go through to a second round, with final offers due to be tabled next February. The winner will be known by March 1. The bidders are American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Ameritech International, Bell Atlantic, Southwestern Bell International Development, GTE Telephone, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Telecom Denmark, PTT Telecom Netherlands, Stet International, Swiss Telecom and Korea Telecom. Analysts say the successful bid is likely to come from a consortium consisting of a private US operator and a wholly or partly state-owned European group. The selection of the 12 companies on October 6 has led to a hectic round of negotiations as they attempt to join forces to bid for the stake. A precedent for the sale is last December's sale for Dollars 875m of a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian equivalent of SPT, to a consortium of Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech. The Matav sale is the biggest telecommunications investment in central Europe to date. In that sale, the proceeds were split between the company and the exchequer. But SPT will receive the entire proceeds, to help it finance a Kcs130bn (Dollars 4.7bn) modernisation programme through to the end of the decade. The programme aims to increase the number of lines from 20 to 35 per 100 people by 1998. The present density is one of the lowest in Europe, although higher than Hungary and Poland. The average in western Europe is roughly one line for every two people. 'Demand and supply should balance by 1998,' says Mr Jiri Makovec, SPT general director. Key elements of modernisation will be to replace outdated analog equipment with digital technology and the construction of 168 digital host exchanges by 1998. The Czech government has laid down strict rules for bids from consortiums. It insists that a bidder be 'a clearly defined entity' with a transparent ownership structure consisting of 'experienced operators'. It must also speak with one voice. 'I will only deal with one person or one company at a time,' warns Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech economy minister whose department is co-ordinating the tender. Already, speculation in Prague suggests that three of the 12 companies - France Telecom, Bell Atlantic and PTT Telecom - are emerging as favourites for the SPT investment. France Telecom has been providing technical assistance to the Czech company for several years, while Bell Atlantic is a partner, along with US West and SPT, in the EuroTel consortium established in 1990 to provide mobile telephone services in the Czech Republic. PTT Telecom, the Dutch operator which was partly privatised earlier this year, has a consultancy and technology joint venture with SPT, and has experience in Hungary, Ukraine and south-east Asia. As a relatively small European operator, PTT 'is not a threat' to SPT, analysts say. Attention is now focused on a detailed examination of SPT. Each company paid Dollars 100,000 for access to preliminary bidding packages. In spite of its underdeveloped network, SPT is highly profitable. Last year it made Kcs6bn (Dollars 216m) on revenues of Kcs18bn. In the first six months of 1994 it recorded pre-tax profits of Kcs3.4bn on revenues of Kcs10bn. SPT has received Kcs7bn in loans from the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance its modernisation project. In July it raised a further Kcs1bn through a five-year bond issue. But the bulk of the cost of modernisation will be met through the sale of the stake and re-investment of future profits. SPT is 74 per cent state-owned, of which 70 per cent is held directly and 4 per cent is owned by two state-run investment funds. The remaining 26 per cent - roughly 6m shares - is held by domestic investors who bought the shares in the second wave of mass privatisation this year. The winner of the tender will receive new shares in SPT, to give it a maximum 27 per cent stake. The issue of new shares will dilute the domestic investors' holding to 19 per cent and the state's directly-held share to 51 per cent. The state will retain its majority stake for up to five years. It may then sell a further block of shares after that time. The 6m shares sold in the privatisation wave have still to be delivered to investors, but a grey market has developed in SPT stock on the Prague bourse. The shares are trading at about Kcs3,500, which values SPT at Dollars 2.96bn. Bidders are somewhat in the dark, however, as to SPT's true worth. This will not become clear until the government establishes a regulatory framework covering future tariff policy for SPT. The framework is due to be announced late next month, and it will have an bearing on the price the government gets for the stake. At present, high international tariffs subsidise SPT's domestic call service. International call prices from the Czech Republic are among the highest in Europe. A call from Prague costs Kcs31.5 a minute to the UK; Kcs63 a minute to the US; and Kcs25.2 a minute to Germany. A local call costs about Kcs2. The tariff policy is expected to rebalance prices by lowering international tariffs, raising local charges to market level, and pegging future price rises to inflation. If it cuts international charges too much it would make SPT less attractive. 'The government can influence the price it gets by keeping international call prices high,' one banker says.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Flaws in argument on wage checks Sir, Peter Ingram (Personal View: 'Give shareholders more power over pay', July 8) suggests that one way of providing a greater check on wage inflation is through greater control being exerted by shareholders, particularly the large institutional shareholders. While greater shareholder activism is to be encouraged in general, Mr Ingram's argument is flawed by failing to recognise the full chain of responsibility. Institutional shareholders, especially the pension funds, are responsible in turn to those on whose behalf they manage these large asset holdings. In most cases, these are the very people Mr Ingram suggests should have their wage increases checked by institutional shareholders. While it is true that fund managers are not as accountable as might be optimal, any wage increases that do occur will usually result in a greater inflow of contributions to the institutional shareholders. Mr Ingram must be a microeconomist, as his arguments fail to acknowledge the whole panorama. Besides, if we need to address the 'problem of wage growth outstripping productivity' we would be better served by concentrating on the productivity side of the issue.

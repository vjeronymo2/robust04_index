"Violent demonstrations, especially against policemen who  are  guarding the nation, democracy, and law and order, are  unacceptable," the president said on receiving a new year's  policy report from Seoul City Mayor Kim Won-chong.    The home affairs minister and the national police  administrator must tackle violent demonstrations with firm  determination, Kim said, adding that he will ask them to take  responsibility if they fail to do so.    The president's comment on demonstrations came a few days  after thousands of farmers and student sympathizers staged a  violent protest in the heart of Seoul against the opening of the  domestic rice market to imports under the Uruguay Round of trade  negotiations.    Kim said his administration, elected by a majority of the  people through democratic means, is different from the  authoritarian governments of the past.    Violent anti-government demonstrations, therefore, cannot be  justified under any circumstances, he said.    Now is the time for the country to establish a  "demonstration  culture," or a correct and democratic way of advancing different  opinions.</p>

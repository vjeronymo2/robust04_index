			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Heseltine faces an uphill task to boost mining industry AS MR Michael Heseltine begins the task of trying to keep more of the coal industry alive, he has to find ways of expanding coal's share of the already crowded energy market. His task is fraught with practical difficulties. Nearly 50m tonnes of coal is lying idle in stocks, and the electricity industry has made clear that its appetite is sharply reduced. In order to sustain more than a few additional pits, the trade and industry secretary would have to find a home for several million tonnes of extra coal. Technically, the government has the power to influence energy producers and consumers - and even to force the buying of coal. Nevertheless, Mr Heseltine's announcement of the pits reprieve had barely left his lips before the energy industry had sprung to the defence of its patch. The most direct route open to Mr Heseltine is to use the government's 40 per cent stake in National Power and PowerGen, the two leading generators, as a lever to persuade them to burn more coal. The next set of long-term contracts between British Coal and the power industry is still being negotiated. But sources in the electricity industry yesterday made clear that they would resist any attempts to make them increase their purchases of coal-based power. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, said the distribution companies were determined not to be forced to sign excessive long-term contracts only two years before regulations were due to be changed to allow more competition. 'We'd be faced with stranded contracts,' he said. One option before Mr Heseltine is to delay the next stage of electricity deregulation. In 1994 the level of protection in the regional distribution markets is due to be reduced - which is why regional distributors such as Midlands Electricity expect their franchise markets to shrink. Mr Heseltine might also try to limit coal imports. Again, he would risk angering the generators that have sunk large sums of money in port handling facilities. Such action would aggravate strained trade relations with the US, one of the UK's largest coal suppliers. Any curb on electricity imports from France via the cross-Channel cable would be highly questionable given the move to an EC single market - although the government might argue that French electricity is state-subsidised. In announcing his reprieve, Mr Heseltine said he would consult Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, who is looking into the effect that the power generators' switch to gas is having on electricity prices. Prof Littlechild has the power to penalise electricity companies that are not buying the cheapest electricity available. He has agreed to speed up his inquiry if necessary, but he is unlikely to have formed any conclusions before early next year. Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity distributor, which is investing in gas-fired stations, said yesterday it was confident that its gas deals would stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords and a former energy secretary, last night told peers that Mr Heseltine's review would discuss with the generators and distribution companies whether the market prospects for coal had been 'correctly assessed'. It would also look at each pit to see whether the case for closure had been made and consider whether some pits should be mothballed or released to private operators. A further sector over which Mr Heseltine will undoubtedly be casting his eye is the state-owned nuclear power industry, which contributes about 20 per cent of the electricity in England and Wales. Nuclear Electric reacted sharply to suggestions that he could bring forward from 1996 the phased shutdown of ageing Magnox reactors to make room for more coal stations. The stations are not due to be phased out until 1996. Any shutdown would, however, entail heavy decommissioning costs, and would remove the only power source that does not produce harmful emissions at a time when the UK is trying to clean up its air. Whichever route Mr Heseltine chooses involves a cost - to subsidise extra coal production, to compensate companies that have to buy more expensive electricity, or, with nuclear, to decommission power stations. In some cases, such as subsidising coal, the cost will fall on the taxpayer. In others, such as postponing electricity deregulation, it will be the consumer who ends up paying the bill. As one electricity industry representative put it: 'Whichever way they move, they come up against new difficulties.'</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report COPPER prices fell back heavily in the afternoon on the London Metal Exchange, pulling other base metals off their highs. Dealers said the selling that engulfed the market led to copper buckling below the Dollars 1,650-a-tonne level (for three months delivery), where consolidation had been attempted. The price finished at the day's low of Dollars 1,639 a tonne, down Dollars 9 from Wednesday's final kerb close and Dollars 20 below the day's high. The ALUMINIUM market was unsettled by the sell-off in copper, with the three months price, which had touched Dollars 1,132 a tonne, falling back below Dollars 1,120 to close at Dollars 1,119.50, still up some Dollars 3 from Wednesday. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended with good gains but off the day's highs. The January position climbed to Dollars 1,219 a tonne but slipped to end Dollars 21 up on balance at Dollars 1,216. Volume was light at 2,945 lots (5 tonnes each), of which 1,094 were crossed. Dealers said the market continued to be plagued by rumours over whether Brazil would continue with the planned retention scheme in the wake of the government corruption scandal.

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (3): No clear view - Ravenscraig could be a development opportunity LITTLE has happened on the site of the Ravenscraig steel complex since it abruptly closed in June last year. The cooling towers and the blast furnaces still stand, the main differences from a year ago being that they are now silent and no vapour comes out of them. British Steel shut the complex two years earlier than had been expected, arguing that poor market conditions overrode the commitment it gave in 1987 to keep the complex open till 1994. The early closure took by surprise development officials who had expected more time to consider the future of the site, and to plan retraining programmes for the redundant steel workers. British Steel is negotiating to sell the equipment from the plant to the Indonesian company Gunawan Dianjaya which plans to reassemble it in North-east Malaysia. The plant will be the largest steel plant in South-east Asia. Pounds 525m has been mentioned as the cost of dismantling Ravenscraig and re-erecting it in Malaysia, but the proceeds of selling the Scottish plant will be only a fraction of this sum. For the Indonesian company the deal should be a cheap way of getting a steel plant. 'Discussions with Gunawan Dianjaya are proceeding satisfactorily,' says British Steel, 'but we don't expect a contract to be signed until later this year.' It is believed that if British Steel is unable to sell the plants overseas it will dismantle it and sell it for scrap. The Ravenscraig complex occupies a 1,000 acre site - twice the size of Hyde park in London - sandwiched between Motherwell and Wishaw. That includes the 110 acre site of the Lanarkshire steelworks which closed in 1983. It is thus potentially a very big urban redevelopment opportunity which will be crucial to the future of Motherwell. So far, there is no clear view on what it should be used for. But an early decision was not to put it into the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone. Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the LDA, explains that this is partly because of the very long time it would take to clear the site, partly because he doubts whether new investors would be interested in going to a site in the middle of Motherwell. But Mr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for Motherwell South, thinks the future of Ravenscraig is being given too little priority. 'Nothing has been done since 1983 with the Lanarkshire steelworks site, and the writing was on the wall for Ravenscraig after 1987, yet nothing was done. Ravenscraig could be a superb site, right on the west coast main railway line.' He fears that the 500 acres of Enterprise Zone and 500 acres of other industrial sites in Lanarkshire will mean there will be no demand for industrial land on the Ravenscraig site. But Mr Andrew Russell, head of a Price Waterhouse team appointed in July to look at the development options, urges a longer view. 'Ravenscraig will have its day,' he says. 'It would be a pity to prejudice longer term possibilities by short term developments on part of the site.' He says the time span for redevelopment 'will certainly exceed 10 years and may be as much as 20.' By then, demand for industrial land may well have been exhausted on the other sites. 'We're urging people to go for a long term fix.' British Steel last year commissioned the environmental consultants Aspinwall to report on the environmental problems of the site. Its preliminary report showed that hazardous waste had been stored for years in disused mine works on the site, and that various waste substances such as steel slag, filter cake, sulphur compounds and ammonia had been dumped there under license. But the report said that 20 per cent of the site would need no action prior to redevelopment, and that a further 25 per cent would need only minimal regrading if the site was to be used for amenity purposes. Industrial development could follow 'relatively straightforward decontamination measures,' but 'much more extensive remedial works would be required on about 70 per cent of the site if the proposed end use was housing.' Aspinwall is now carrying out the second stage of its study. Various figures have been put on the cost of reclamation, mostly ranging between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m. Mr Russell says the Ravenscraig site includes a deep wooded ravine of the river Calder, though the river itself is filled in over part of its length. That could become a valuable amenity. Whether the Ravenscraig site becomes a park, a housing development, an industrial site or a combination of all three, an important planning priority is to use the opportunity to improve Motherwell, which has a poor town centre. Any plan is likely to include a new road to connect the M74 motorway to the A8/M8 east-west road. The former steelworkers, former employees of Ravenscraig, the Clydesdale tube works and some of their subcontractors are entitled to special benefits under the EC assistances for former steel areas. They can claim a supplementary employment benefit of Pounds 16 a week for up to 52 weeks, and up to 52 weeks training. By the of last June 1,006 of them were still in training. Another 90 had found jobs.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / People: Alan Yarrow moves up at KB Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank which before Christmas failed to find an external candidate to head the bank and promoted two existing staff to the posts of joint chief executive of investment banking, has further complicated the management structure by moving Alan Yarrow (right) to become managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities. The task of Sir Nicholas Redmayne, one of the two chief executives who was previously md of the securities side, is now 'to look at the strategy side outside of the day-to-day developments, leaving a gap on the securities side into which I fit,' says Yarrow, who at 42 is 13 years Redmayne's junior. However, David Clementi, the other chief executive, remains head of the corporate finance department as well. Yarrow contends that, despite the uncertainties over management direction last year, KB has made considerable strides in integrating its services to appeal to international clients, mustering 'a lot of the strengths that we were too modest to shout about'. He also acknowledges that 'the (very buoyant) markets have bailed us out to some extent'. Yarrow joined Grieveson Grant in 1972, and was made a partner nine years later. In 1989 he became head of institutional sales at KB, which had acquired Grieveson in the mid 1980s, before being made head of global equity sales and distribution last year.</p>

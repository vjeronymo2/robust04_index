			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Construction side holds back Higgs and Hill to Pounds 0.65m Tough trading conditions in the construction market restricted Higgs and Hill to a first-half pre-tax profit rise of just Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 650,000. Turnover declined by 4 per cent to Pounds 120.2m (Pounds 125.5m). Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said the company's strategy, which involved a Pounds 22.1m rights issue last May in order to bolster its building programme, would not benefit earnings until next year. 'We have moved from a retrenchment phase to a reinvestment phase in the company's development which will see the benefit in the years to come,' he said. While the construction order book rose by Pounds 30m to Pounds 200m compared with a year ago, margin pressure remained intense, with both subcontractor and supplier prices rising. However, Mr Theakston said the company would retain its construction capacity: 'We are a three-core business and intend to remain so. We need to have a good balance to the group's revenue stream.' He added that any future investment in the short term would be aimed at the property and housing businesses. These both saw a modest increase in activity in the first half, the latter boosted by the acquisition of 15 new sites, 10 bought from English China Clays. The land bank increased by about 20 per cent to 2,000 plots with planning permission. Earnings per share advanced 28 per cent to 0.9p (0.7p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1p.</p>

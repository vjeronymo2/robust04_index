			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / C&amp;W quits the biddingfor Hungarian group Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday pulled out of a consortium bidding for a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms concern, only hours before the deadline. C&amp;W withdrew from the MagyarCom consortium, leaving Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned operator, and Ameritech, the US regional Bell company, as the remaining partners. The UK company said it had 'reluctantly concluded' that its strategic objectives would not be addressed by its 'continued involvement as an equity partner'. It is understood that C&amp;W was unhappy with the shareholding structure of the group, which gave 50 per cent to Telekom and 25 per cent each to C&amp;W and Ameritech. C&amp;W was also uncomfortable with Matav's price after fierce competition from the three competing consortia which put in final bids yesterday. Offers are believed to range around Dollars 900m (Pounds 605m), valuing Matav at nearly Dollars 3bn and making the privatisation the largest yet in eastern Europe. C&amp;W's international experience had given credibility to MagyarCom's promise to develop Hungary as a regional telecoms hub. The UK company's withdrawal weakens Telekom in its battle against rival groups led by France Telecom and Italy's Stet International. The outcome is expected on December 17. Stet, which heads a partnership with Bell Atlantic of the US, put in the highest preliminary 'indicative' bid and is believed to have raised its final bid to more than Dollars 900m. France Telecom and its partner US West, the regional Bell company, have mounted a high-profile public relations campaign presenting their bid as the most technically inspired. US West has a stake in Hungary's largest cable television operator and has promised to transfer its experience of multimedia broadband networks, allowing Hungary to make a technological 'leapfrog'. Hungary's budget deficit continues to miss targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund and so proceeds are expected to be a priority in evaluating bids. It is not the first time that Budapest has been hungry for revenue and bidding has become too rich for C&amp;W. This summer Hungary maximised proceeds in the tender for two digital mobile telecoms concessions. C&amp;W's consortium dropped out after refusing to raise its bid from Dollars 12m. The winning bids approached Dollars 50m.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Bass rises 6% in tough market Interim figures from Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, showed an unexpected 6 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 242m. Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said he expected higher profits for the year as a whole, but was 'disappointed' that profits from UK brewing were unlikely to maintain last year's level, as previously planned. Bass's shares fell 8p to 535p. Operating profit in Bass pubs was up 6 per cent to Pounds 104m, despite Pounds 6m profit being forgone through disposals. The volume of beer sold through Bass Taverns, which operated 8 per cent fewer pubs in the period, fell 9 per cent. Drink sales as a whole were up 6 per cent through Bass Taverns, against a claimed average for the competition of 4 per cent, and sales of food rose 8 per cent to pass the Pounds 100m mark on an annual basis. Brewing volume was down 0.2 per cent, in a market estimated to have fallen 2 per cent. 'Brewing remains tough, but Bass are winning,' said Mr Prosser. In the off-licence trade, volume rose 8 per cent. Bass said underlying brewing margins were down by around 1 percentage point, and brewing profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 68m. Profits from hotels rose 22 per cent to Pounds 61m, with a net 70 hotels being added to the Holiday Inn chain in the half-year. In leisure, profits increased 11 per cent to Pounds 42m, affected by an additional dividend of Pounds 7m from Satellite Information Services. Capital expenditure in the half-year fell sharply from Pounds 359m to Pounds 260m, with spending on brewing down from Pounds 72m to Pounds 45m. Bass said its brewing investment had passed its peak with the recent opening of the Pounds 34m Cape Hill brewery near Birmingham. Group sales fell 1.5 per cent to Pounds 2.24bn, chiefly because of the sale of pubs and of the Augustus Barnett off-licence chain. Underlying turnover rose 3.8 per cent. Group operating profit rose 6 per cent to Pounds 283m, after an additional Pounds 5m of pension costs. Net interest payable was Pounds 41m (Pounds 39m), and tax was Pounds 82m ((Pounds 80m). Bass had previously expected its tax charge this year to rise above last year's level of 35 per cent, but it now expected the interim charge of 34 per cent to be maintained for the year. Earnings per share were up 8 per cent at 18.2p, and the dividend was raised 21 per cent to 6.6p. However, Bass emphasised that this was calculated as a third of last year's total payment, and did not reflect a view on the year as a whole. Lex, Page 24; Market, Page 44</p>

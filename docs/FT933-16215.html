			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Oil prices The thought that Bill Clinton and Saddam Hussein would cosy up over oil exports a week after the US bombed Baghdad is a little odd, to say the least. But such reverses are almost par for the course in the murky world of high politics. Iraq seems prepared to be more accommodating about UN security council conditions on the sale of oil. At the same time the US seems now to want to direct Iraq through a carrot-and-stick approach, rather than setting conditions it knows are unacceptable in order to exclude Baghdad from serious negotiations. Much may go wrong in the talks, and the US is also in danger of appearing to usurp the security council's authority. Yet there is now a serious possibility that 600,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil may be on the market by the fourth quarter of the year. Needless to say Saudi Arabia and other Opec members are less than pleased at the prospect of their market share being eroded. And once the oil has started to flow it may be hard to get the Iraqi genie back into the bottle. Given that few had expected Iraq's re-entry, and that oil prices fell last winter despite Opec's production running near its ceiling, the current weakness in crude prices is understandable. Opec has proved at its best in tight spots. Despite the jockeying for position by producers such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, cartel members know that their best interests are served with oil approaching Dollars 20, rather than by pumping the marginal barrel of Dollars 15 crude.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelters seen heading for the scrap heap One third of the former Soviet Union's 3.6m tonnes of aluminium smelting capacity could be expected to disappear in the next five years, driven out of production by high costs and obsolete equipment, according to Mr Horst Peters, managing director of VAW Aluminium-Technologie. He pointed out during a conference in London yesterday that, if they were to meet present Russian emission standards, Russia's aluminium smelters needed total investment of USDollars 3.5bn. A further Dollars 2bn would be required if the country's copper, lead and zinc smelters were to meet pollution targets. Money for this purpose was at present not available in the former Soviet Union, nor in the western financial markets, Mr Peters insisted. So those smelters not worth modernising would be phased out. He suggested that some of the heavily-polluting aluminium smelters could be modernised using a step-by-step approach, which could be financed out of cash flows with some help from international financial institutions or export credits.</p>

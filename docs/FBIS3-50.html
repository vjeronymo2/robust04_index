			<p>The     Japan Association of Defense Industry (JADI), existing in its  present form since 1988 and tracing its origin back to 1951, is an  industry association under the supervision of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Japan Defense Agency  (JDA).  JADI promotes the development of Japanese defense technology  and equipment, monitors foreign technology, lobbies on behalf of its  corporate members for government defense spending, and cooperates  with the government on export controls.      ASSOCIATION OVERVIEW      JADI (Nihon boei sobi kogyokai), an industry association (shadan  hojin) of over 130 corporations, promotes the development of a  strong Japanese defense industry.  According to the latest edition  of the annual guide to MITI's public corporations (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO  KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENAAN 1993 May 93), JADI seeks to "work towards  the sound development of the defense equipment industry and, in so  doing, contribute to the establishment of Japan's defense base" by  promoting research and development of defense equipment and  improving production technology.  The association's stated  activities regarding defense equipment are as follows:  conducting  surveys and research; gathering and disseminating information,  supporting R&amp;D; offering proposals on modernization, greater  efficiency, and support for Japan's defense production base; hosting  seminars; cooperating with other organizations related to the  defense industry; carrying out contract research, helping devise  Standards; and cooperating with the government's export control  Policies.  Central to the association's activities is the promotion  of R&amp;D and Japan's independent development of defense technology and   product ion capacity (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 3 Jun 87, NIKKEI SANGYO  SHIMBUN 1O Jan 87).      CLOSE TIES TO GOVERNMENT      The association has existed at three different levels of  organization, each successively closer to the government.  In  October 1951, five steel companies led the way in establishing the  Japan Technology Production Association (Nihon gijutsu seisan  kyoryokukai), a private company (kabushiki kaisha).  In October  1953, the organization changed its name to the Japan Weapons  Industry Association (Nihon heiki kogyokai) and became a voluntary  association (nini dantai) (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88).      In September 1988, the organization assumed its present name and  status as an industry association under joint MITI and JDA  administration.  One month prior to the change, NIKKEI SANGYO  SHIMBUN (4 Aug 88) reported that the organization had experienced  "difficulties" as a voluntary organization in securing long-term  loans and government subsidies.  YOMIURI SHIMBUN (26 Sep 88)  reported that the organization would now receive government  subsidies due to its "upgrading" to the status of a legal entity  (hojin).      Along with the Promotion in status came enhanced government  supervision.  Chairman Kosaku Inaba, president of Ishikawajima-  Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), and the three vice chairmen, all  corporate executives, retained their positions.  But the insertion  of three members of the government "old boy" network signalled  JADI's closer ties to the government (ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88,  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88).  Tomoyoshi Kabaya, a former MITI official who headed the JDA  Equipment Bureau, assumed the newly created post of JADI director-  general.  Takeshi Moriyama, former chief of JDA's Central  Procurement Office, assumed office under him as executive director.  Both Kabaya and Moriyama continue to hold those positions, according  to the latest edition of TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN  1993 (May 93).  In contrast, IHI's Inaba and the three corporate  executives under him vacated their seats after serving out their  two-year terms.      JADI's chairmen and vice chairmen are drawn from the top ranks of  Japan's defense industry.  Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries (MHI), has chaired JADI since June 1992 (NIKKEI SANGYO  SHIMBUN 28 May 92).  IHI Vice President Kunio Minamizaki, Fujitsu  Vice President Kimio Otsuki, and Asahi Chemical Industry Chairman  Nobuo Yamaguchi are listed as the current vice chairmen  (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1993 May 93).  The  association's chairmen have been chosen from among Japan's top seven  defense companies:  MHI, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), IHI,  Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Toshiba, and Japan Steel Works (NIKKEI  SANGYO SHIMBUN 12, 28 May 92).  Preceding Iida as JADI chairman were  KHI President Hiroshi Oba (199O-92) and IHI President Kosaku Inaba  (1988-9O).  The association's top post has also rotated among  companies according to three categories of defense equipment:  firearms/special vehicles, ammunition/missiles, and electronics  (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 May 9O, ASAHI SHIMBUN 3O May 87, NIKKEI  SANGYO SHIMBUN 2O Mar 85).      MONITORING U.S. TECHNOLOGY      The association has been monitoring U.S. defense technology as  part of its mission to gather and disseminate information on foreign  developments.  For example, Washington and Tokyo reached an  agreement in July 1987 for Japanese corporations to participate in  the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).  JADI's predecessor  organization joined the Keidanren's Defense Production Committee and  the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) in a joint  conference to learn the details of Japanese corporate partici-  pation in SDI research from MITI, the "point of contact" for  Japanese companies interested in the project (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 4  Aug 87).  The association was also to join SJAC and Keidanren's  Defense Production Committee in an "SDI Information Center" slated  to begin operations in early 1988.  The association would cooperate  in gathering information, primarily open-source documents in the  United States, on SDI-related technology (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17  Nov 87).  Moreover, at a New Year's party in January 1988,  association chairman Kosaka Inaba and JDA Equipment Bureau Director-  General Masaji Yamamoto gave speeches on Japanese corporate  participation in SDI, stressing that companies study the technology  involved and maintain liaison with the Japanese Government (NIKKEI  SANGYO SHIMBUN 9 Jan 88).      LOBBYING GOVERNMENT      JADI also lobbies government officials and politicians.  Chairman  Iida joined SJAC's chief and other representatives of defense-  related organizations in an October 1993 "round table discussion" on  the Mid-Term Defense Plan (1991-95) with then-JDA Director-General  Keisuke Nakanishi.  JADI joined the call for increased defense R&amp;D  sPending to sustain the employment and expertise of JaPanese  researchers and engineers in the field (ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 Oct 93).  During the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) years in power (1955-  93), JADI kePt channels of communication to the succession of JDA  chiefs and LDP defense experts.  Among the guests at the  association's annual New Year's party, for example, have been then-  JDA Director-General Koichi Kato (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jan 86).      (AUTHOR:  MERCADO.

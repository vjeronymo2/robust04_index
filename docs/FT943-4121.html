			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Dreaming spires on city rubble: UK universities used to build on greenfield sites. Now they pick run-down urban areas London's docklands may soon have an academic ivory tower to go with the spectacular glass skyscraper at Canary Wharf. Plans were unveiled this week to build a Pounds 60m university campus on derelict land in the Royal Docks, in partnership with the London Docklands Development Corporation, the local regeneration agency. The project is the latest in a series of innovative schemes where universities are taking a leading role in the regeneration of UK cities. These include several other new campuses and a host of smaller projects such as science parks and student housing. The partnership between universities and urban regeneration agencies is bringing benefits for both sides. Universities create jobs, provide training and other support services for business, and stimulate the local economy through spending by students and staff. In return, they get access to government urban regeneration grants at a time when funds for university expansion are limited. The docklands project involves four local universities in plans to build a campus to cater for up to 5,000 students. Centred around a new Technology Institute, it will offer courses tailored to the needs of local employers, such as media, design and communications, business studies and health. The London Docklands Development Corporation has committed Pounds 4.1m to the plan, arguing that it will be a 'powerful stimulant for economic and social regeneration' in the area to the east of the capital. Support has also come from the London East Training and Enterprise Council, Newham Borough Council and London First, the business-led organisation set up to promote the capital. The project's sponsors hope that the new Royals University College will create up to 2,000 permanent jobs. A similar project is just completing its first phase in Sunderland, where the university, a former polytechnic, is building a spectacular new campus on the site of a former ship fitting-out yard and dock. It will provide a home for four faculties, including business studies, computing and information systems, and art and design. Other parts of the riverside will be redeveloped as student accommodation. For the university, the project provides much-needed space for expansion, on a site where the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has been prepared to pump in Pounds 4m. The balance of the cost, forecast to be about Pounds 40m, will come from the higher education funding council and the university itself. 'Funding councils are very pleased when institutions can get financial leverage from other sources,' says Dr Anne Wright, the university's vice-chancellor. For Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the development corporation, the campus is the centrepiece of a strategy to regenerate the mouth of the Wear. Large businesses, such as the Nissan car factory, prefer spacious greenfield sites on the outskirts of the city with room for expansion. The university creates a new focus of activity on a waterfront that once housed the area's heavy industries. 'It will bring new vitality to the area and put Sunderland firmly on the academic map of Britain,' he says. Building the new campus will create the equivalent of 200 full-time jobs in construction. When it is completed, about 1,500 permanent jobs are expected to follow. These include university employees, with 600 new staff in education and support services. The rest will be in the surrounding community, in businesses meeting the needs of staff and students. The value of a university to the local economy is increasingly recognised outside big urban centres. Campaigns have been launched to bring higher education institutions to towns such as Lincoln and Gloucester. In Manchester, the three universities in its 'higher education precinct' employ a third of the city centre's population. 'Higher education means serious money for Manchester,' says Mr John Glaister, Central Manchester Development Corporation's chief executive. 'It was Pounds 517m a year at the last count, and its value to the city's business economy is incalculable.' For many 'new' universities, formerly polytechnics, involvement in urban regeneration is not just an easy way to raise capital when public funds are scarce. Often based on inner-city sites, they see their scope for growth lying in partnerships with local businesses, community organisations and development agencies. Such universities believe something of a virtuous circle could be created: they will be in greater demand if the local economy is flourishing and there is a demand from local businesses for education and training. Moreover, such universities will also do better in attracting students if their environment is safe and attractive, says Professor David Chiddick, an executive pro-vice-chancellor at de Montfort university, which has four campuses in the east Midlands. 'We are more likely to attract women to sign up for part-time business studies courses in the evening if they feel secure about entering the area on their own,' he says. 'I'm very anxious that the area around us is financially viable.' Prof Chiddick is closely involved in the government-funded City Challenge scheme, in the area around its Leicester campus. A town planner by profession, he is convinced that universities have a role to play in bringing businesses back into the city centre. 'We can offer facilities that will attract businesses into the urban environment,' he says. Like several other higher education institutions, de Montfort has set up a technology transfer and training centre to do just that. But the centre also brings benefits for the university, he says. 'We have good ideas that have withered or been kept within a research environment,' he says. 'The centre allows us to test whether they have commercial applications.' The need for more co-operation between universities and urban regeneration agencies is underlined by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, the co-ordinating body for university managers. It is lobbying agencies such as development corporations to make more use of higher education institutions. The committee's chairman, Professor Kenneth Edwards, vice-chancellor of Leicester University, says: 'All universities have grown out of their local communities. As they developed into the universities of today, with their national and international dimensions, they have retained this local focus.' It would probably be more accurate to say that some, at least, have only recently rediscovered their local roots. The new universities of the 1960s such as Sussex, Warwick and York were built on greenfield campuses outside provincial centres, far removed from the inner cities. At Warwick in 1970, there was a bruising student sit-in after students discovered links between the university and local businesses. The university's most famous don, the radical historian EP Thompson, resigned in disgust, penning a book called Warwick University Ltd. Today, 51 per cent of Warwick's income is earned from the private sector. And the archive of trade union history started by Prof Thompson is housed in a Pounds 4m library funded by oil company BP. The university is now one of Coventry's 10 largest employers, and no longer wants to keep its links with the local economy a secret.</p>

In an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today, Iranian  Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] said  that his country's foreign debts will reach 15 billion U.S.  dollars by the end of this year provided the government will not  make any repayment.    Earlier reports said that the country so far has delayed the  payment of some 8-9 billion dollars and an additional sum of 6  billion dollars will mature this year.    Vaezi put Iran's foreign debts at about 8.8 billion dollars,  saying that Germany is Iran's biggest creditor with some 2  billion dollars, followed by Japan, with 1.5 billion dollars,  and France, with 250 million dollars.    Iranian officials are discussing with foreign countries to  find a way out for the foreign debts, he said, believing that  the issue will be solved in the near future.    Iran failed to repay its foreign debts last year due to the  sharp drop in oil prices in the world market following the  depression of the world economy.    However, Governor of Iran's Central Bank Mohammad 'Adeli  said  earlier this month that the Central Bank and the government do  not owe a single penny to any country or company, but the  Iranian private sectors and commercial banks have foreign debts.    He said that his country has only to repay 8 billion dollars  and the delay of repayment is due to the non-cooperative  attitude of insurance agencies to cover medium and long-term  credits.    The Iranian Government decided in the budget of 1994 to  repay  some 1 billion dollars of foreign debts, but many Iranian  officials urged the government to allocate more incomes to repay  foreign debts.    Some experts believed that the Iranian Majlis (parliament)  will raise the figure for government to repay foreign debts as  the government will reduce its development expenditures because  of the low oil prices.    The government hoped in the new year's budget to get 12.5  billion dollars with the oil price calculated at 14 dollars per  barrel, but many officials especially the Majlis deputies  believed that the country's oil income will not exceed 10  billion dollars since the present oil price stands below 13  dollars.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Books: Facade of fragility - The enigmatic Audrey Hepburn AUDREY: HER REAL STORY Alexander Walker Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99, 319 pages Audrey Hepburn was one of the most entrancing screen heroines of the postwar generation. Yet she never appeared a career film star. She hid the word 'talent', seemingly, inside the word 'dilettante': which left anagrammatically another key Hepburn word, 'diet'. She was an airy, pencil-thin beauty who had suffered from bouts of bulimia and anorexia; and in her later years as a Unicef worker she looked scarcely less malnourished than the African children with whom she was photographed. Alexander Walker's biography does this semi-invisible sprite full justice. He subtitles the book 'Her Real Story': which means that the family skeletons are wheeled out early from the walk-in cupboard, brushing through the daughter's Givenchy dresses on the way. Father was a Nazi propagandist who spent the second world war in a British jail. Mother was a Mosley supporter who wrote for Oswald's fascist rag Blackshirt. There is a photograph of mum on the steps of the Nazi Party HQ in Munich and there are 'well-attested reports' that both parents attended Nazi rallies. This is piquant stuff for anyone who had suspected a different upbringing: that Audrey - to judge from the pedigree manner - had been brought up in a palace made of porcelain, where the tinkle of tea sets vied with the distant cry of peacocks. Yet a problem childhood - father, as well as being a political rotter, walked out on the family when Audrey was young - may account for the star-making oddities in her personality. There was that low, lovely, gulpy delivery, full of mysteriously-sourced nervous energy. And there was the feeling, in films as varied as War And Peace, The Nun's Story and Breakfast At Tiffany's, that the lithe and soaring charm just might be broken, given the right nemesis, on the wheel of brute ordinariness. Walker keeps his book moving even when banality does threaten to break into Audrey's life: which is not often. Chapter headings have the thump of a Saturday matinee for adults. 'The Girl With Death In Her Shoes' is the title for the section about Audrey's wartime exploits carrying anti-Nazi leaflets into occupied Europe. And JFK's death has a surreal tragic eclat - the actress broke down in her dressing-room - amid the fluffy frivolity of shooting on My Fair Lady. Like any good heroine in the mystery drama of Life, Audrey also had a doppelganger. Her career and that of Leslie Caron, Walker notes, were bizarre reflections of each other. Each began as a ballet student; each went on to specialise in adorable gamine roles; each starred opposite Fred Astaire in consecutive 1950s musicals - Daddy Long Legs (Leslie) and Funny Face (Audrey); each had a major success, on stage or screen, as Gigi and later as Ondine. But Audrey was more than just a pretty - or funny - face. When Billy Wilder picked her for two early roles in Sabrina and Love In The Afternoon, it was because he saw the native intelligence: 'She looks as if she could spell 'schizophrenia'.' And Richard Avedon pounced on her, during his period as a Hollywood shutterbug, and immortalised those strange wide eastern features, like a pixie graduated from a Peking sixth form. Audrey finally did run into the buffer of brute ordinariness. She met and married Mel Ferrer. But Walker argues that she probably needed his prosaic, domineering guidance. For years he acted as her agent and minder: the only roles he seemed up to in his own dull but persevering career. In War And Peace Ferrer's Prince Andrei is the price we pay for Audrey's Natasha. And who can forget, once read, Michael Powell's comparison of Ferrer's stage performance in Ondine with that of France's Louis Jouvet. 'When Jouvet paused, the audience paused. When Mel paused, the whole play stopped dead.' In later years, thanks to spending more time with Mel and the family, Audrey's screen acting became occasional. But she delivered a brace of late delights in Two For The Road and Robin And Marian. And for a woman about to tread the famine lands of developing countries, she showed a bizarre persistence, right to the last, in claiming her own glamour rights. Those Givenchy dresses were a point of principle. She even asked for one to play the dowdy spinster in Summer And Smoke. (Result: the role went to Geraldine Page.) But then Hepburn knew her worth. She wanted the right dress in the same way that she wanted the right truck in her charity safaris: because they helped do the job. The job in Hollywood was to be a ministering angel to glamour-starved audiences in the recovery years after the war. The job in Africa was to be a ministering angel to more literally starved people in the recovery years that never end. And perhaps the actress' Unicef devotions were a last, late bid to make up for those guilt-bequeathing parents.</p>

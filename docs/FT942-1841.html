			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 126m at Manweb - Policy of concentrating on core businesses set to continue Manweb, the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier, re-affirmed its policy of concentrating on core businesses yesterday as it announced a 13.6 per cent rise in annual profits. The company proposes to pay a final dividend of 17.35p, taking the total to 24.35p, a 16 per cent increase. 'Our view is if we focus on the core we can best add value for shareholders,' said Mr John Roberts, chief executive. In the four years since privatisation, Manweb has been less keen than other recs to diversify into other businesses and is the only one which has not taken a stake in a combined cycle gas power plant. Mr Roberts saw no reason to change the policy of caution on diversification, even though Manweb had cash deposits of Pounds 58.2m at the year-end and is therefore seen by some analysts as being likely to be tempted into making acquisitions. In the year to March 31, Manweb increased profits from Pounds 111m to Pounds 126m pre-tax on turnover up from Pounds 920m to Pounds 930m. Earnings per share growth of 20.6 per cent to 83.6p was helped by a lower than expected tax charge of 21.4 per cent. The tax charge reflects higher capital spending, higher capital allowances, and resolution of long-standing issues with the Inland Revenue. The company expects a tax charge of about 23 per cent in future years. Although supply profits rose to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 6.9m), profits in the main distribution business fell 9.4 per cent to Pounds 91.9m as a result of increased insurance and depreciation charges and investment in customer services. Unusually for a power company, job numbers rose - from 4,346 to 4,428. Manweb said it had taken out more costs than most other companies since privatisation and had shed 23 per cent of jobs in the core businesses, but last year had concentrated on improving customer services. 'We expect to bring in further efficiencies in future years,' said Mr Roberts. Analysts expect a further round of job cuts after completion of the regulator's distribution review. Retail profits rose by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 600,000, in spite of a 4 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 28.3m, and contracting showed a Pounds 100,000 profit against a Pounds 1.1m loss in 1992-93. The company made Pounds 700,000 from wind farms and continued to make a profit from supplying gas to more than 1,000 sites. Expenditure on the distribution network and business infrastructure rose 20 per cent to Pounds 103m. Manweb is seeking shareholders' approval at the annual meeting to buy back 10 per cent of its shares. See Lex</p>

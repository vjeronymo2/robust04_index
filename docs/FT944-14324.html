			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Shorter hours 'led to jobs increase' Union campaigns during the late 1980s to cut working hours in the engineering sector led to higher employment, research for the government has shown. The findings will not please ministers, who have argued that reduced hours would lead to more, not fewer, redundancies. The research for the Department of Employment challenges the conclusion of earlier studies which found productivity rose to offset the adverse effects of shorter hours. It also contests the view that a reduction in hours is a disguised increase in wages via a rise in overtime. The report says: 'We found no evidence of reduced basic hours leading to corresponding increases in overtime.' But the most politically sensitive finding is that there is some support for the view that shorter hours provide more jobs by dividing the available work among more people. The report's findings are qualified but clear: 'Although our research method was not ideally suited to shedding light on this proposition, we found some evidence of greater employment in the short and medium term. 'Given that most of the firms we studied were anyway reducing staffing levels for other reasons, this employment effect means that the shorter working week led them to make fewer people redundant,' the report adds. It concludes that a shorter working week accompanied by appropriately lower wages can share work among more people. But if hourly wages are permanently increased by shorter hours the employment gains could be threatened, it says. The research by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the London School of Economics involved interviews with 20 factories which had agreed to a reduction in the basic week from 39 hours to 37 hours per week.

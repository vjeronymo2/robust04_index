			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel revises timetable for Redland bid THE TIMETABLE for Redland's hostile Pounds 630m bid for Steetley, a rival building materials group, has been put back to give the Office of Fair Trading further time to consider possible monopoly implications. Under Takeover Panel rules, Steetley should publish its final defence document by next Monday - 39 days after the bid was announced. The Panel has now ruled that the bid clock be halted. As a result 'day 39' will be deemed to be the second day after an announcement clarifying whether or not the offer will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Day 46 - the last opportunity for posting a revised offer - and day 60 - the date an offer must become unconditional - will similarly be extended.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are revising redesignated &sect;488.442(e) to include the phrase ``by residents covered by the respective programs on the date the civil money penalty begins to accrue.'' By including this phrase, we require that civil money penalties collected from dually participating facilities be apportioned to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, not according to the proportionate number of beds but proportionate to the number of residents in each program on the date the civil money penalty begins to accrue. For example, a facility has the capacity and is certified to provide care for 50 Medicare beneficiaries and 50 Medicaid recipients. On the date the penalty begins to accrue, 15 Medicare beneficiaries and 45 Medicaid recipients are residing in the facility and 40 beds of the 100 beds are empty. The amount of the civil money penalty is apportioned as follows: 25 percent (15/60) of the civil money penalty would be apportioned to the Medicare Trust Fund for Medicare beneficiaries and 75 percent (45/60) of the civil money penalty would be applied to the protection of the health and property of Medicaid residents of facilities that the State or HCFA finds deficient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters suggested alternative uses for the civil money penalties collected by HCFA or the State. Many suggested using the civil money penalty amount to address the situation which led to the deficiency so as to protect the health of the residents as OBRA requires. Other commenters suggested that civil money penalties collected be used to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fund the State incentive program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Offer financial improvement grants to needy facilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters suggested: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Placing the monies collected into a fund to be used by HCFA or the appropriate State agency, rather than placing them in the State's general revenue fund; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Depositing the monies with the State Treasurer into the Long Term Care Monitor/Receiver Fund; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Not using the monies to fund government administrative activities or those activities not related to resident care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept the above suggestions for the disposition of a civil money penalty imposed in accordance with sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(ii), 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) or 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. If the civil money penalty is used by the facility to correct the noncompliance which led to its imposition, it is, in effect, not a remedy. While the use of the civil money penalty to fund the State incentive program, to finance grants for needy facilities or to deposit into the Long Term Care Monitor/Receiver Fund would be beneficial uses, the Congress has directed the use of the civil money penalty amounts collected as specified in section 1128(A)(f) of the Act. Civil money penalties collected from Medicare facilities are returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and, as specified at section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act and redesignated &sect;488.442(e). Civil money penalties collected by the Medicaid State agency, in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, are applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds or property lost (redesignated &sect;488.442(f)). The law does not require that the money received through civil money penalties be spent on direct patient care. In fact, the Act suggests that those funds will be spent on administrative expenses, such as those incurred in moving patients to other facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters support the use of civil money penalties by the State for the protection of the health and property of the residents.

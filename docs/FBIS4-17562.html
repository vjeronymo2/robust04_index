			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian delegation which is to take part in the  final stage of the interstate talks, before the two countries'  presidents sign a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Latvia, this afternoon arrived in Riga from Moscow.    Russian delegation head Sergey Zotov told journalists that  the talks about the last adjustments to the treaty will be  taking place in Riga for no longer than two days.    [Begin Zotov recording in Russian with superimposed Latvian  translation] First I want to say that the agreements initialled  by us have been misunderstood in Latvia. I repeat, Russia  itself will take care of the social guarantees for the military  personnel discharged from its Army, and the payment of pensions  will also be our responsibility. We do not ask that the Russian  military be given special privileges. However, I will add that  the international obligations which your country has undertaken  to guarantee at the United Nations for the citizens of another  country must be observed.    Reports by the mass media on the interstate agreements  initialled between Latvia and Russia, as well as their  discussion by the Saeima, have been distorted. Russia will  withdraw the Army by 31 August. We are ready for the meeting of  the two countries' presidents and the signing of the treaty.  Russia is not interested in changing its stance, which has  already been in force for two years. [end recording]</p>

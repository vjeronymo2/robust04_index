			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / US grants limited visa to Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, has been granted a visa to enter the US, in a dramatic reversal of Washington policy. Up to now, the US has sought to mirror British policy regarding Mr Adams, who is excluded from entering the British mainland. In a statement, the White House said the action was taken because Mr Adams had made 'constructive comments' on renouncing violence. 'It is in the interests of peace that the US reach out to Mr Adams to press him to go forward,' it added. He will attend a conference in New York tomorrow on Northern Ireland organised by the North American Committee on Foreign Policy, an independent but influential think-tank with several former secretaries of state among its members. The leaders of all Ulster's main political parties have also been invited to attend. Downing Street said last night: 'Adams has said he wants to end violence and on that basis he is being admitted to New York to attend a conference. Sinn Fein will be judged on its deeds. It must renounce violence permanently and immediately.' The news was welcomed by Mr Joe Hendron, West Belfast MP for the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, but it provoked an angry response from unionist politicians. Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, who had been 'on standby' to attend the New York conference, said he would not be going as long as Mr Adams or any Sinn Fein 'proxies' were there. He was 'disappointed' by the US decision, 'as it would appear the US government is more interested in pressuring Her Majesty's government to concede to violence than in actually encouraging the peace process'. The US State Department had said last week the decision on granting a visa would depend on whether Mr Adams would 'publicly renounce violence and support the joint declaration' issued in December by London and Dublin. Speaking on Irish TV yesterday evening, before he received news of the visa approval, Mr Adams said he had had an interview with US embassy officials last week but denied that he was called on to make such prior commitments. Later, welcoming the visa decision, he said: 'My purpose in going to the US is to advance the cause of peace.' Mr Adams will apparently be allowed to enter the US for 48 hours, but will be restricted to travel within 25 miles of New York and will be barred from fund-raising activities. There has apparently been intense debate in Washington, with Irish-American politicians divided over the issue. Senator Edward Kennedy, whose sister, Mrs Jean Kennedy-Smith, is the US ambassador in Dublin, is thought to have been lobbying the State Department in favour of the visa approval. Last night he welcomed the decision. It also emerged at the weekend that Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has replied to Mr Adams following a request from him for clarification of the Downing Street joint declaration. The letter is thought to contain Mr Reynolds' views on the shape of likely progress after an end to the IRA's campaign of violence.</p>

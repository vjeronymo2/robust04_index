			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> LOTTO ODDS TO RISE AFTER TODAY'S GAME  </P> <P> Today is your last chance to beat the relatively good, 1-in-14-million odds of  winning a multimillion-dollar Lotto jackpot.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the odds go to 1 in 23 million. Sticking to plans announced May  22, the state-run lottery will shut down Lotto 6/49 after tonight's drawing for  an estimated $25-million jackpot and replace it with Lotto 6/53 on Thursday,  officials said. Players will not be able to buy a lotto ticket from 7:45 p.m.  tonight to 9 a.m. Thursday as the lottery changes over its computers. Gamblers  will still bet a dollar, or more, but will pick six numbers from 1 to 53  instead of from 1 to 49.  </P></p>

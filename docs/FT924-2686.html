			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Street discovery fetches Pounds 935,000: Saleroom THE HIGHLIGHT of a Bonhams sale of Old Masters yesterday was a painting bought in a street market 30 years ago for a few shillings. The still life of sea bream, oranges, garlic, a cloth and kitchen utensils, by Luis Melendez, sold for Pounds 935,000, a record for the 18th-century Spanish artist. The sale brought in Pounds 1.45m, a record for any sale at the Knightsbridge auction house. At Sotheby's yesterday an aquamanile (a bronze medieval container for washing the hands) in the shape of a knight on horseback sold for Pounds 660,000. The price was an auction record for an aquamanile. The aquamanile, made in north Germany in about 1200, was bought by a Continental collector. The top estimate was Pounds 80,000. The Bowleaze jewel, a rare 9th-century Anglo-Saxon jewel, probably the terminal of a manuscript pointer, also received considerable pre-sale interest and was bought by Mr Robin Symes, a London dealer, for Pounds 41,800. The jewel was found in 1990 on the beach at Bowleaze Cove in Dorset. It had apparently fallen from the cliff in a landslide. The European works of art auction totalled Pounds 1.48m in the morning session and was 12.8 per cent unsold. Mr Danny Katz, another London dealer, paid Pounds 93,500 for a Florentine bronze stallion made in the workshops of Antonio Susini in about 1600. At Bonhams on Wednesday, Ikemasa, a Japanese dealer, paid Pounds 682,000 for a blue and white early Ming brush washer. The dish re-emerged after being stolen in 1984 and was sold by Lloyd's of London.</p>

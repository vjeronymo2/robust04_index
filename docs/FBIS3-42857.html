			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rita Naseniece: "Security and its Security"] </F>   [Text] The scandal in the Vidzeme borough [of Riga]  was so loud that it obscured a law concerning law enforcement  activities which was adopted in complete quiet and which ignores  espionage rules (which will sooner or later be adopted), but  which also places on the agenda a question about the service's  secrets or the question of protecting secrets.    The affair with the energetic Mr. Rucs, who in moving  naivete, with the assistance of the municipal police, latched  onto the withdrawal of the Russian army, which could have become  the final toll for the Latvia's independence, but which in its  essence is only evident in the consequences of the poverty of  the state security system.    "We have a lot of spying,    and enough information, but analysis and systematization are  limping along, and therefore it is not clear what each security  service may and may not do," is the way one Saeima deputy  characterized the situation.    Right now Latvia has been taken over by a spy mania and not  without cause. A broad spectrum of security organizations have  been established, which actively participate in intelligence. We  can divide them into three large, "strongest" groups, of which  only one would include state institutions. First of all,  espionage is a criminal method for gathering information and  includes with it qualitative analytical and systematization  work. Secondly, growing and powerful businesses are particularly  concerned for their security, for any firm often feels  threatened by both organized crime and by the power of the  state. That has caused the establishment of their own private  security systems, whose job quality is sufficiently high. Many  KGB information gathering specialists have gone to firms engaged  in such activities. Professionals from the former KGB have their  own agency, their own information gathering channels, possibly  even connections with the former Soviet, now the Russian  intelligence service residence in Latvia, with their "end" in  Moscow. The outflow of professionals encourages an overload of  work, incomparably low salaries and uncertainty for the future.  Businesses can pay adequately for this work, which requires a  near-exhausting intellectual and physical regimen. At the same  time, large sums of money are being offered to those who are  potentially dangerous to state security agencies.  From various sources it is known that for leaving one's job  (that is, resigning one's current position) sums are being  offered equal to five times one's annual salary; and this is  only the beginning offer, which can be haggled over.    Business can afford (similar to the "informals") to give  tremendous technical assurances, which the lean state budget  purse is unable to provide for its security organizations.    Right now many prominent persons, who require the most  exhaustive information, obtain it from these unofficial sources.    The More Agencies, the More Security Is Needed    Responsible officials continue to receive operational  reports  from the seven security organizations, but it is not normally  possible to analyze these "seven volumes." The many agencies  that were established actually reflect the mutual distrust among  the various political currents which are more or less fancied by  one or another security institution. This mutual distrust has  created two intelligence organizations, the Security Agency and  the State Economic Sovereignty Department (VESAD), functioning  in parallel. The former has been incriminated as the "pocket  agency" of the President (or sometimes even of the "national  radicals"), but the latter is dogged by a reputation as a "den  of Chekhists," which is illustrated by the seemingly  professional picketers at the Interior Ministry entrances. While  VESAD, according to many, is professionally more powerful, the  Security Agency has always claimed to have a reputation for  political reliability. It is not known whether one or the other  conclusion is closer to reality, but this kind of parallelism  causes dangerous instability which can be exploited by powers  which are hostile to Latvia's independence.    The new espionage rules anticipate the establishment of four  security organizations, which will have espionage powers: the  Constitutional Defense bureau, the Interior Ministry's Security  Police, the Defense Ministry's Intelligence Service, and the  Home Guard Headquarter's Information Service. I will not dwell  particularly on the last two. The Home Guard's Information  Service's functions are specific and completely narrow: tactical  intelligence in time of operational activities and control over  their personnel selection and activities (former or current  connections with the Mafia, convictions and examination of other  facts). It must be said that in this sense Latvia is a  completely exotic land, for analogous intelligence agencies in  volunteer people's militias, which the Home Guard actually is,  are a completely unique occurence in the world. The Defense  Ministry's Intelligence Service is an institution of the Defense  Ministry which carries out military intelligence. This service,  too, has a unique sphere of work, in which, it seems, there  could be no overt competition, even if the paths of the security  organizations crossed.    Relations between the Constitutional Defense Bureau and the  Interior Ministry's Security Police hold the promise of  interesting developments. Both of these services are the only  ones of the four with investigative authority; thus they  distinguish themselves from the others (a unifying moment--all  four have operational work functions).    VESAD Professionals Are Offended    The State Economic Sovereignty Defense Department (VESAD),  which currently is subordinated to the Interior Ministry, is the  base on which the Security Police will be built, and this base  already has a certain basis, different from the Constitutional  Defense Bureau (SAB), which we will be forced to prop up in a  naked place. Establishment of the SAB (which is hoped to become  an agency subordinated to the National Security Council), is, of  course, a wholly painful fact to VESAD. That is connected to the  particular authority of SAB, because this agency will be the one  which is offered the authority to control all the others and to  implement intelligence activities internally. In addition, SAB  officials authorized by the bureau director will have special  rights to familiarize themselves fully with the internal  documents of the intelligence service (regardless of level of  classification), but the director himself will be permitted to  examine the identities of information sources of other services,  or, speaking simply, to learn the true name of an agent.    This sort of authority "sends a shiver down the spine" of  those who have attended the KGB school. To someone who has been  raised in a holy relationship toward protection of information,  the fact that someone will be able to rummage around in their  safe causes fear. Here everyone decides for themselves between a  liberal and totalitarian direction, stopping at their own  individual point between two poles.    Latvia has no historical analogy to follow in these events.  After the 1934 coup, when the power of the President was made  absolute, the Political Administration (or political police),  which was found in the Interior Ministry, was the only security  agency and which was reviewed and controlled only by the  President himself. In the Soviet era the KGB operated  successfully, which was a state within a state and with  outstanding information collection methods and unlimited  authority gave rise to professional arrogance and a sense of  power among those who worked there.    The Security Police may perceive the SAB (which does still  exist per Cabinet of Ministers decree no. 28) as a potentially  dangerous service, for it will be a service which they will not  be able to examine, thus it is logical that professionals will  not trust them, for among them there is no characteristic  viewpoint that selling out to Western intelligence agencies is  less reprehensible than a link with the KGB. Actually, this  antipathy could be labeled with the inspired phrase that  is your problem, if only talk were not of the more thorough  dissemination of information to "their own" people in the  government or Saeima.    SAB: The Great Unknown    The proposed rules governing intelligence submitted by the  Interior Ministry were coordinated by the Interior Ministry's  parliamentary secretary Linards Mucins. His view is that SAB  subordination makes for unreliability. SAB, the "umbrella  organization" for the intelligence community, will be  subordinated to the National Security Council (the President,  Prime Minister, National Security Commission leader, etc.), not  to the Cabinet of Ministers, which as the executive branch would  always be forced to function only within the constraints of law,  thereby not permitting the SAB "to break out" in terms of its  authority, in the sahdow of a rather unclear organization (there  is still no law on the National Security Council). "The time of  liberalization is over," says Mr. Mucins. "The time has come to  honor laws."    "It seems to me that the idea of preventing the SAB from  listing one way or the other has been successfully  accomplished," says Andrejs Pantalejevs, Saeima National  Security Commission chairman. "In the beginning there was an  attempt led by Vectirans to convert the Security Agency to the  Constitutional Protection Bureau. There were other tendencies.  We of course thought that that would degrade the essence of the  SAB. Right now, it seems, we have succeeded in maintaining the  concept of a new organization, in whose service there will not  be anyone from among the current security organization workers.  That is my viewpoint."    The painful question about the SAB shows only the tendency  toward distrust between the executive and legislative branches,  between the government and the Saeima. The chief ones, it seems,  are mutual fears of the opposing sides gaining overly great  authority and potential. President or Prime Minister?    If the SAB cadres will really come from the current Security  Agency, then in conditions of antagonism a [link/union] between  the SAB and the Security Police will be completely problematic.  That is why the aforementioned viewpoint about "fresh" cadres  may be a step toward resolution.    To repeat this viewpoint in greater detail (how realistic it  is can be decided by the experts): Professionalism should not be  turned into a fetish; unhurriedly, slowly, this service can be  established one person at a time, accentuting the analytical,  tidying functions, keeping the internal intelligence of other  services in the second plan.    Regardless, it will be interesting and meaningful to see who  is nominated to be the bureau's director and what will be his  political sympathies.    The SAB is the child of the era of distrust. It could just  as  well be called the child of the era of consolidation, some might  argue. Time will tell who will win; distrust or consolidation.    I completely acknowledge that this article will not satisfy  any of the sides that are working with development of  intelligence rules, but neutrality is like innocence: it can be  lost only once. Let that be my wish to the still unborn child:  the SAB.</p>

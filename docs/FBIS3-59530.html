			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuovo Pignone Talks Focus on Italian </F> Majority"]    [Text] Rome, 28 Dec (ANSA) -- Local representatives headed  by Florence Mayor Giorgio Morales came away from today's  Industry Ministry summit on the U.S. buy-out of Florentine  turbine-maker Nuovo Pignone with a pledge that the government  will ask the publicly-owned fuels group ENI [National  Hydrocarbons Agency] for greater assurances over a majority of  its former subsidiary's stock staying in Italian hands.    Morales told reporters after the meeting that the government  "agreed with us" that greater assurances should be offered  concerning the 10.75 percent of Nuovo Pignone stock that will be  sold on the stock market via a public purchase offer (ppa).    He said he expected these assurances to be forthcoming at a  further meeting at the premier's office on Thursday between the  government and trade unions.    In the partial privatisation deal agreed last week, General  Electric heads two other U.S. companies -- Ingersoll Rand and  Dresser -- taking over 49 percent of the Florence firm; ENI  maintains 20.25 percent, and a consortium of Italian banks are  parcelling out a further 20 percent, leaving 10.75 percent for  the ppa.    The continued presence of the Italian banks was the other  point on which Morales said local bodies and the firm still want  assurance -- despite Industry Minister Paolo Savona and Treasury  Minister Piero Barucci's optimism that "the banks may stay even  longer" than the four-year duration of the business plan GE has  lined up, since the plan is "so strong".    Morales said he spoke for Nuovo Pignone's management and  workers in asking for "written guarantees" that the banks' 20  percent will not leave the country at some future stage.    He also revealed that an article in the ENI-GE accord  envisages five percent of Nuovo Pignone stock being offered to  the company's employees, in the wake of the coming ppa.    As for the merits of the business plan itself, Morales  restricted himself to reporting that "the government and ENI  believe that this plan will ensure company growth, employment  and technological research".    Official sources at the premier's office later denied  Morales' assertion that government-union talks on Nuovo Pignone  will take place on Thursday at the premier's office.    The unions -- who seemed certain that the encounter had on  the other hand been set -- meanwhile echoed Morales in calling  for changes to the ENI-GE accord to ensure an Italian majority  emerges after the ppa, and to ward off "the possibility of  direct competitors like Dresser and Ingersoll beefing up their  share in four years' time, when the Italian banks may leave the  field."    The Tuscan regional commissioner for labour, Enno  Ghiandelli,  revealed this evening that Industry Minister Paolo Savona had  issued invitations for the Thursday meeting, which will again be  held at the industry ministry in Rome and not at the premier's  office.</p>

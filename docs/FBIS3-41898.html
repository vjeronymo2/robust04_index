Kostyantyn  Hryshchenko, head of the directorate of control over armaments  and disarmament of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  stressed this during a meeting with journalists on 18 January.  He emphasized that all components necessary for the safe  storage of nuclear weapons, hydrogen absorbers in particular,  are manufactured in Russia and until recently were not being  supplied to Ukraine. Hryshchenko noted that this led to the  storage of nuclear weapons becoming increasingly unstable. The  threat was gradually increasing and demanded a resolution. In  the opinion of the representative from the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, after Ukraine's experience with Chernobyl it would be  extremely irresponsible not to take this situation into account.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's defense minister, Robert Ray, has hit  out at the United Nations for failing to come up with a workable  plan for Rwanda. Senator Ray said a UN force in Rwanda could be  a total disaster unless it has a well defined mandate.    The defense minister was responding to the UN secretary  general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who said the failure of the  international community to confront genocide in Rwanda was a  scandal.    [Begin Ray recording] It could well be a criticism of us and  let me be equally critical of he and his colleagues, who had not  come up with a workable plan. No one is about to risk lives  where the lives are risked through poor planning, poor  logistics, and poor sense of mission. [end recording]    Sen. Ray said as a good world citizen, Australia would look  at contributing troops to a peacekeeping force in Rwanda.  However, Sen. Ray it is up to the UN to propose a mission based  on a feasible political solution, a clear mandate, and a clear  timetable.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI attacks Bank THE BANK of England was yesterday accused of 'wholly inadequate' regulation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and of withholding information about BCCI's frauds for 15 months before closing the bank. This was the conclusion of a four-year US Senate sub-committee investigation into BCCI by Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican, in a report published yesterday in Washington. The Kerry report said that although the Bank received evidence of BCCI fraud in the spring of 1990 it 'colluded in the suppression of the true facts concerning BCCI's financial status and its involvement in fraud'. Although the 780-page report does not offer any conclusive new evidence about the fraud, it states that alleged errors in judgment by the Bank 'collectively materially contributed to the losses incurred' by BCCI's depositors and creditors in the closure of the bank on July 5 1991. Mr Kerry yesterday attacked the Bank for having 'acquiesced' in allowing Abu Dhabi, the BCCI majority shareholder, to remove vital documents from Britain in 1990 as a quid pro quo for Abu Dhabi's agreement to restructure BCCI. The Bank yesterday would not comment, saying it had to maintain confidentiality until the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into BCCI's supervision. The Bingham report is expected this month. The Bank said it was not asked to supply documents or evidence to Senator Kerry. It believed that Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry would be more thorough as he had examined documents and interviewed Bank officials. The Kerry report claimed Abu Dhabi's involvement in BCCI was greater than acknowledged. Senator Kerry disclosed yesterday that Abu Dhabi is under investigation by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney who brought BCCI fraud charges last year. Abu Dhabi last night rejected the findings contained in the Kerry report. The report also criticised Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors. It claimed that as early as 1987, Price Waterhouse had 'ample reason' to recognise there could be no basis for certifying BCCI's books and records gave a true and fair view of BCCI's finances. Senator Kerry was especially swingeing over what he termed 'a direct conflict of interest' by Price Waterhouse partners who received loans from BCCI while auditing the bank's operation. Price Waterhouse rejected the Kerry report findings as full of 'unsubstantiated assertions', and expressed outrage that the committee had not responded to its offer to talk to it in London. More than 90 per cent of creditors to BCCI have voted for the joint liquidators' plan, in another move to its acceptance. The vote on the plan, involving payment to creditors of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 691m) to Dollars 1.7bn, was ordered by the Luxembourg court. The plan has been approved in the UK and Cayman Island courts. Report details, Page 9</p>

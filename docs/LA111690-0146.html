			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MAN ONE OF 11 INDICTED IN SMUGGLING RING  </P> <P> The federal government has indicted 11 people, including a Buena Park man, for  allegedly smuggling aliens falsely identified as agricultural workers into the  United States, New Hampshire's U.S. attorney said Thursday.  </P> <P> The indictment, returned in U.S. District Court, claims that the defendants  charged aliens fees ranging from $2,700 to more than $6,000 each to create  fictitious farm-worker histories for their applications for temporary resident  status. The scheme allegedly involved nearly 2,000 aliens from at least 60  countries who now live in the United States.  </P> <P> "The case illustrates how New Hampshire is inextricably linked to organizations  alleged to be operating nationwide," U.S. Atty. Jeffrey R. Howard said. "The  fact that the alien population in New Hampshire is small compared to that of  other states is one factor which helps to draw conspiracies here."  </P> <P> A trial in the case is scheduled to begin on Dec. 4.  </P> <P> Howard said the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 created the category  of "special agricultural worker." That allowed aliens who might otherwise be in  the United States illegally and who performed seasonal agricultural work for at  least 90 days within a 12-month period to apply for lawful temporary resident  alien status.  </P> <P> Aliens who applied through the program had to prove to the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service that they met the requirement by submitting forms signed  by employers.  </P> <P> The indictment charges that the primary farms allegedly used to promote the  scheme were South Dade Harvesting and Second Dade Harvesting in the Miami,  Fla., area.  </P> <P> Indicted in connection with the scheme were the operators of the farms, Willie  Jones, 46, of Goulds, Fla., and David Jones, 53, of Naranja, Fla.; Colon E.  Bustamante, 58, of Jersey City, N.J., a notary public who accompanied some of  the aliens to the Paterson, N.J., INS office to assist them in interviews; and  Victor A. Nassif, 52, of Goffstown, N.H., who is charged with helping the  aliens complete false applications for temporary resident status.  </P> <P> Also indicted were: Michel Melki, 29, of Buena Park, Calif.; Atef Eid, 42, of  New York, N.Y.; Awad Hamada, 29, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Abed El Kafar, 35, of  Astoria, N.Y.; Muhammad Masnu, 40, of Bronx, N.Y.; Adres Prada, 36, of Miami,  Fla.; and Wahid Zaman, age unknown, of Astoria, N.Y.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY WINS $2.4 MILLION IN SLAYING BY OFFICER  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Friday awarded $2.4 million to the family of  a Muslim college student and father of four who was slain by a California  Highway patrolman after a routine traffic stop.  </P> <P> The jury, which deliberated for six days, awarded no punitive damages because  it did not find malice on the part of Officer Bruce Moats, who shot motorist  Yusuf Bilal three times in the back.  </P> <P> "We can go on with our lives now," said Bilal's father, Jimmie Johnson, wiping  tears from his eyes.  </P> <P> As the verdicts were read, Bilal's brother, Robert Johnson, sat in Judge  Stephen Lachs' courtroom and wrote down the financial information on a yellow  legal pad. His dead brother's 4-year-old daughter sat on his lap.  </P> <P> Johnnie Cochran Jr. and Eric Ferrer, the family's attorneys, said Friday they  will ask the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to reopen a criminal  investigation into the slaying and will ask the U.S. Justice Department to  conduct an inquiry into whether Bilal's civil rights were violated.  </P> <P> Four years ago, the district attorney's office declined to file criminal  charges, saying there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Moats. The  investigation concluded that the officer believed he was in serious personal  danger when he fired at the motorist.  </P> <P> California Assistant Atty. Gen. Thomas Blake, who defended Moats, said that he  had not yet decided if the verdict will be appealed.  </P> <P> "We are thankful that the jury found no malice on the part of Officer Moats,"  Blake said.  </P> <P> Before going to trial, the family had turned down a $1.2-million cash  settlement from the state.  </P> <P> At the time of his death in 1986, the 38-year-old Bilal was an RTD bus driver  and Cal State Los Angeles graduate student who planned to open an Islamic  textbook printing business. He was on his way home after noon prayers at a  mosque when he ran a red light in South-Central Los Angeles and was pulled over  by Moats.  </P> <P> Moats, a 13-year CHP veteran who had never fired his handgun in the line of  duty before, testified that Bilal refused to give his address and would not get  out of the car.  </P> <P> The officer also said Bilal swung at him, took away his baton and threatened to  kill him as he got out of the car. Moats said he aimed at his chest, but the  motorist spun around, taking bullets in the back.  </P> <P> As Bilal lay dying, Moats stood nearby and was heard to say: "The stupid son of  a bitch. All for a traffic ticket."  </P> <P> During the trial, witnesses gave conflicting testimony. Some said Bilal's back  was to the officer, others said he was sideways. Only Moats testified that he  heard Bilal threaten to kill him.  </P> <P> Two police consultants asked by the plaintiffs to review the case testified  that the shooting was not justified. Another said that shooting was called for  because, once Moats lost the baton, his only recourse to protect himself was  his revolver.  </P> <P> Jury members later said that it took them more than four days just to decide  what a human life is worth.  </P> <P> Cochran had asked them to award Bilal's family $12 million.  </P> <P> During closing arguments, Cochran compared that figure to the recent  acquisition by the Getty Museum of Van Gogh's painting "Irises," for $54  million. "Would you quarrel with that amount (of money) for a human life . . .  when you consider the price of the painting?"  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Brazil's bankers lament victory over inflation: The introduction of the Real has meant an end to banks' big overnight profits on short-term lending Brazil's new currency, the Real, has sent inflation tumbling and public support soaring. But the country's bankers are not yet celebrating. For them, low inflation means lower profits, at least until the banks have been thoroughly restructured. Banks were the main beneficiaries of Brazil's years of high inflation. They profited from lending to the government at very high short-term interest rates. They gained from holding customers' money in cheque accounts because funds lost value daily. In June, just before the Real's introduction, daily inflation reached 2 per cent, a windfall for the banks. Many banks earned more than 30 per cent of their income from such inflation-related revenue. When inflation fell with the Real to less than 2 per cent a month, this income disappeared. The first serious signs of strain appeared last week when Banespa, the biggest state owned bank, faced a liquidity squeeze, and the central bank closed down a small private bank, Brasbanco. Most analysts agree that private-sector banks, except for a handful of very small ones, can quickly adjust to low inflation. Larger banks like Bradesco and Itau have strong balance sheets and should be able to find alternative income sources, especially from an increasing demand for consumer credit if economic growth continues. The transition will be more painful for the much less efficient 23 banks owned by the Brazilian government or individual Brazilian states. Banespa's costs per employee reached Dollars 26,240 (Pounds 16,600) in the first half of this year, compared to Dollars 8,820 for the similar-sized Itau. State-owned banks are also limited by law in dismissing workers, which prevents them from cutting costs as rapidly as their private sector counterparts. Then there is political pressure. State banks are subject to interference by politicians, and have been used to channel jobs and loans to supporters, especially before elections. As a result, small towns often have three or four bank branches owned by the central or state government. The central bank failed in an attempt earlier this year to close down loss-making branches after local politicians complained their campaigns would be undermined. 'Governments have regularly used their state banks to finance elections and other non-banking activities,' says Mr Erivelto Rodrigues of financial analysts Austin Asis. 'The problem is, the banks lend the money without getting paid back.' It is difficult to assess how much damage these policies have caused. Public accounting disclosure is poor and, until the introduction of the Real, high inflation made the comparison of accounting periods misleading. Analysts also suspect state banks conceal non-performing loans to their respective state governments by granting a new loan near the end of the bank's fiscal year so they can be paid interest on the old loan. Analysts estimate it could cost several billion dollars to restore the state banks' balance sheets. As an indication of the sums involved, last week the central bank provided RDollars 1.65bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in short-term assistance, in the form of swapping central government for state government securities, to the three large state banks thought to be most in need of reform. Banespa of Sao Paulo received RDollars 1.1bn, Banerj of Rio de Janeiro RDollars 340m, and Banrisul of Rio Grande do Sul state RDollars 210m. At least over the next three months, the central bank is likely to continue backing banks that face liquidity problems. Brazil holds presidential elections on October 3 and the government is keen to avoid any financial instability, especially if it undermines the Real. Even in the long term, the central bank is not expected to let larger banks encounter serious problems, which would highlight the entire state-owned sector's weakness. The banks are likely to be urged to cut costs and merge branches. Some smaller state-owned banks may be threatened with closure or told to merge. 'Sorting out the state banks will be a long and very careful process which won't be solved overnight and which cannot be done in an irresponsible way because of the risks,' says Mr Carlos Langoni, a former central bank president. According to private bankers, the hope for long-term reform lies with Brazil's new president, likely to be Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The bankers say the new president must make a number of moves, starting with measures to insulate banks from political interference. For example, a law which prevents private banks from lending to their main shareholders could be applied to state-owned banks to stop them funding their state's deficit. 'We need new regulations to restrict the banks' freedom. If they want to be called a bank they should act like one,' says one Sao Paulo banker. Other bankers argue that privatisation is the only way to guarantee independence for the state banks, and to improve their efficiency. But this would first require the states, some of which are already in deficit, to repay their debts. According to one model, a bank such as Banespa - which is owed about Dollars 7bn by the Sao Paulo state government - could be repaid with shares in the state-owned electricity and water companies. Mr Cardoso is thought to favour such schemes. But he will encounter stiff opposition from state governors and the banks themselves, which argue that in a country like Brazil, state banks also serve as development agencies and should not aim to emulate the private sector. Whether the banks are allowed to remain in the state sector will probably depend on their own performance. The central government cannot afford to lend financial support for long. Unless they quickly move to reduce their losses, the government may start paying more attention to private sector calls for the banks to be merged or privatised.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Brazilian banks  ------------------------------------------------------------------                 Number of       Costs per         Bad loan                 employees   employee (dollars)    ratio (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ STATE OWNED  Banespa          34,432         26,240             11.25  Banerj           12,000         13,775             23.65  Bemge            11,389         15,370              1.92 PRIVATE  Bradesco         62,580          8,500              2.76  Itau             39,362          8,820              2.89  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Austin ASIS, FT  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Payment transactions per employee (US = 100%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                              % Private banks               44 (47,200) Public banks                28 (30,600)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: McKinsey analysis  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

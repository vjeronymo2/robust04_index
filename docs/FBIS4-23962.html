			<p>BFN     [Text] The refugee camp at Benaco in Tanzania, is faced  with lack of order and security caused by notorious militias  like Gatete who have assumed the leadership of the camp. The  president of Medecins sans Frontieres, (Bernard Grandjean), said  that people have been killed and activities paralyzed in the  camp. Journalists and humanitarian workers have been chased out  of the camp by the militias. The militias also harass and stop  people who want to come back to Rwanda and instead argue with  them to stay in camps in Tanzania so that they can be trained  and armed to attack Rwandan Patriotic Front forces in Rwanda.  The Tanzanian authorities and the UNHCR should come to the  rescue of the people in this refugee camp and also be able to  control the activities of the militias who take the law into  their own hands.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Jammu, April 25--Pakistan's inter-services  intelligence (ISI) has launched a fresh operation to step up  militant violence in Kashmir and to scuttle any move of the  Centre to restore the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir,  official sources here said, reports PTI.    Under the operation "expense support," the ISI has begun  pumping into Jammu and Kashmir huge amounts of money, including  foreign currency to sustain militancy, besides motivating people  to re-activate propaganda on alleged atrocities by security  forces.    This money would als be used for "damage control" efforts in  the areas, where militant support has been waning in Kashmir due  to pressure of the security forces and wrong actions of  militants.    The sources said more than Rs 80 crores had reached pro-Pak  militant outfits in Kashmir between December last year and end  of January this year in the aftermath of Hazratbal crisis.    However, the security forces had seized some consignments of  cash and gold from the Jammu borders during past few months, the  sources said, adding the seizure including foreign currency was  approximately estimated to be around Rs 4 crores.    Most of these consignments have reached the state through  "couriers." In some cases money was sent in the name of relief  through some trusts like America-based "Kashmir-American  council" and the Gulf-based "Jamat-i-Sihadis." Funds were sent  through banks to frontline pro-Pak Hizbul Mujahideen which  stands for merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan, the  sources said.    The pro-independent outfit, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation  Front (JKLF), which started militant movement in Kashmir early,  was being deprived this financial support as Pakistan was  opposed to its moves for "independence of Kashmir."    The sources said one of the arrested Hizbul Mujahideen  militants, Ashfaq Ahmed Lone, had told his interrogators that he  had got Rs 16 lakhs from the ISI for his outfit early this year.    Another captured militant, Shahab-Uddin of the Hizbul  Mujahideen, had admitted that he had brought $10,000 for Master  Ahsan Dar, a former commander-in-chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen.    The money for Master Ahsan Dar was sent by Mohammad Yusuf, a  patron of Hizbul Mujahideen in Rawalpindi, the sources said.    The consignments under this operation also included  anti-India propaganda material for distribution among the local  population in Kashmir and other areas of Jammu region.    The ISI, the sources said, was forced to launch this  operation in the wake of increasing alienation of the people  from Pak-sponsored militants, who were indulging now in criminal  acts.    Pakistan has also been making efforts to scare away the  political leaders from initiating political process in Jammu and  Kashmir, the sources added.    The ISI has formed a "Jehad council," a strategic  cartel of all the pro-Pakistan militant groups, adds UNI.    Talking to a group of visiting newsmen, Brig Gen Staff  (operations) Arjun Ray said that headquarters of the council was  located in Muzafarrabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It  was acting as the spokesman of all the militant groups in the  valley to the Pakistan government.    Brig Ray said the council had been designated to look after  the raising and distribution of funds to the various militant  outfits on behalf of the ISI and would also project the militant  outfits' requirements of arms and ammunition.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There has been another Angolan Government air raid  today on the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] rebel stronghold at Huambo. The first claims that the  city had been attacked came from UNITA sources at the weekend  and they were confirmed by aid workers who have been forced to  suspend their flights into Huambo. The escalation follows hard  on the heels of reports of dozens of deaths in UNITA's shelling  of the besieged cities of Malange and Cuito over the last few  days. Karl Meyer of the London INDEPENDENT newspaper is in  Luanda. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked him what information he  had about today's raid on Huambo.    [Begin recording] [Meyer] Well, at about 1:30 this  afternoon,  some government jets came in and dropped some bombs on Huambo,  apparently around Bairro Academico, which is right in the center  of the city and near one of the main schools. It was very close  to the of the house of the Irish Aid Agency, Concern, very close  indeed, and there doesn't seem to be another raid this  afternoon. So, [words indistinct].    [Isaacs] Now, these aid agencies that are still in Huambo --  are they staying put or they are trying to leave now?    [Meyer] Well, right now, they are staying put, of course,  because there is no plane going in there, as long the bombing  raids continue. I think it will be very difficult to get some  planes in there. I think some of them are coming out anyway;  some of their workers are coming out anyway because they are  already scheduled to come out. So, if a plane does get in  there, they will be coming out. But, I think quite a few of  them plan to stay on. It is very difficult to keep coming in  and out of this city. So, I think some of them will stay on. I  believe the Red Cross plans to stay on, for example.    [Isaacs] Now, with the escalation of the fighting in Huambo  and other cities, like Cuito and Malange, it has been very  difficult for the relief flights, for the World Food Program, to  get in. Any more news about that?    [Meyer] No, as far as I know, they can't go in. I think in  Cuito, shelling was continuing today, although it was less than  it was before. In Malange, they are facing the same problem --  every time they try to take a plane in, UNITA mortar men put  some shells in the airport area. Uige, of course, is the other  city that has been blocked, that is in the north. But that is  more of a decision -- if the aid (?can't get) into Cuito and  Malange, then, the government is saying, well, you can't go to  Huambo and you can't go to Uige.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev believes that  settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict cannot be  carried out without introduction of the separating forces to the  conflict zone. However, the Azerbaijani leader stressed in an  interview with Interfax that this military contingent must have  the CSCE mandate. Aliyev admitted that Russian troops could  participate in the peacekeeping action, however, they must also  bear the CSCE sign.    Aliyev underlined that his position on the conflict remained  the same, seeking a peaceful political solution to the issue.  "The war must be halted since it has no perspectives both for  Azerbaijan and Armenia," Aliyev pointed out. He was certain  that settlement must be carried out on a fair basis, this is to  say on the basis of Azerbaijan's sovereignty, territorial  integrity, inviolability of the borders and taking into  consideration the generally recognized international standards.    Aliyev emphasized poor efficiency of the two-year efforts  put  by the Minsk group on settlement in Karabakh. However, he said  he was interested that the talks be held right within the scope  of the Minsk group (which includes Russia with its independent  peacekeeping initiatives).    Aliyev recognized Russia's special role. He suggested that  Russia was interested in the Caucasian region more than any  other state. The consultations which the Azerbaijani leadership  has conducted with Russia and the Minsk group prove the value of  parallel mediation by the CSCE, Russia and the CIS in settlement  of the conflict, Aliyev underlined.    Speaking on possible direct talks with the leaders of the  self- proclaimed Nagorno Karabakh Republic, Aliyev said, "In  what concerns this, I have many plans in my head. Something may  be carried out along."    Commenting on possible participation of the Azerbaijani  military contingent in the peacekeeping action in Abkhazia,  Aliyev stressed, "In principle, I stand against introduction of  troops of one country to the territory of another one. However,  taking into account the persistent requests made by Eduard  Shevardnadze and the Abkhazian party, we gave our consent. We  regard the issue with understanding. However, as far as I know,  only Russian troops will act there."</p>

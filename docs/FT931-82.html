			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Delta pilots' union seeks justification for lay-offs THE UNION representing pilots at Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, said yesterday it wanted to 'validate' the need to lay off 600 pilots as result of the airline's 'fleet simplification' plan. Delta announced the furloughs - its first temporary lay-offs of permanent staff for 36 years - on Monday. 'We think the numbers are on the high side,' said the Air Line Pilots' Association. But Alpa added that, if the lay-offs were shown to be justified on economic grounds, it would be willing to resume talks with management over a wage concession package. When the airline announced the planned furloughs, Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, stressed that they should be seen as part of a 'fleet simplification' plan. But the move was interpreted as a shot across the bows of the pilots' union. Pilots are the only unionised labour group at Delta and the one group which has so far failed to agree a package of wage cuts. The fleet simplification plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of some Airbus A310 aircraft, which the company took over from the now-defunct Pan Am in 1991, and of some Boeing 727s. Delta said these moves rendered 600 pilots surplus, including a number of former Pan Am pilots.</p>

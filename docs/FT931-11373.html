			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Calcutt calls for tougher press curbs SIR DAVID Calcutt QC warned MPs yesterday that the Press Complaints Commission had not worked and that statutory measures were needed to regulate newspapers. Sir David, who recently published a review of self-regulation by the press, told the Commons National Heritage committee that the commission was a body 'by the press, of the press and for the press'. Unless there is statutory regulation, he said, 'there will be an endless succession of last chances and an even weaker PCC'. But many of the committee members were sceptical about Sir David's main proposal that the commission be replaced by a statutory tribunal. Under his proposals, the tribunal would be chaired by a judge and be able to impose fines on newspapers for breaches of a statutory code of practice. Sir David said his main anxiety was that if the press had one more chance it would assume regulation was not being taken seriously. 'If you get that situation you are going to have a real problem.' Sir David defended his proposal to fine newspapers. This, he said, would only happen in extreme cases where a newspaper repeated an offence or was in contempt of the tribunal. Such a tribunal, he emphasised, would not stand in the way of proper investigative journalism. Sir David also said that proprietors should have 'a very big part to play' in press regulation. The commission was also criticised by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who chairs the National Heritage committee. Mr Kaufman said it had made a fool of itself over Mr Alastair Morton's book on the Princess of Wales. Although it had been controversial, it was legitimately published and had turned out to be a highly accurate piece of history, Mr Kaufman said. By contrast, he said the commission had taken little effective action over the so-called 'Camillagate' tapes of an alleged telephone conversation between the Prince of Wales and his friend, Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles, 'even though very serious issues are raised by that tape'.</p>

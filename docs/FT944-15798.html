			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Sport: Seve - the showman in suburbia Wentworth in autumn. Low October sun filtering through the lofty pines bordering the fairways. Cossetted greens playing like the billiard tables they resemble. At their expensive best, England's suburban golf courses are a tableau to match Scotland's wildest links. Odd that golf's most savage event has made its home in Surrey. Compared with the refined niceties of a four-day strokeplay tournament, matchplay is sudden-death, hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, Toyota's World Matchplay championship at Wentworth is the only event of its type on golf's international calendar. Twelve of the world's top players commence battle, two by two, on Thursday morning. By Sunday night only the winner survives. As they move around the celebrated Burma Road course, the competitors seem to be caught in a spotlight that reveals their innermost natures. Its brutal light can seem to blind the technicians, inspire the showmen, and none fits the latter description better than Spain's Seve Ballesteros. Irrespective of what came later, his first-day performance at Wentworth was a triumph of obstacles overcome. An enormous gallery followed his every move, their intense clapping of each holed putt echoing like the noise of a battalion of woodpeckers. A week earlier, Ballesteros could hardly move. He was bruised and scarred after falling from his mountain bike near his home in Pedrena. Then he had to get himself invited to Wentworth, hurdling the disinterest of the organiser, IMG, which had previously preferred the attractions of American rascal John Daly. A year ago Seve was a natural to snub. Since then he has been re-born, lies second on the European money list with a total of Pounds 454,848, and two weeks ago won the tough German Masters after a play-off against Ernie Els and his friend and compatriot, Jose Maria Olazabal. Naturally, he thought that five wins in 18 appearances at Wentworth earned him an entry ticket. Until Daly dropped out in favour of de-tox, IMG thought otherwise. Then, in the first round, Seve was drawn against David Frost. Last year at Wentworth the same pairing saw the rampant South African thrash a distraught Ballesteros 7 and 6. It was a savage end to a 1993 season spent bumping along the bottom. Last year, Seve left Surrey mentally and physically broken. This year he was a new man, surfing the adoration of the huge first-day Wentworth crowd to beat Frost by an even bigger margin than he himself suffered last year . 'Irrespective of who wins this tournament, that first day proved Seve Ballesteros is the greatest matchplay golfer in the world,' said Colin Montgomerie, thinking himself lucky to be in the other half of the draw. 'I played Dave Frost in the Dunhill Cup and he's one of the most solid and consisent performers on the circuit. To beat him 8 and 7 is nothing short of incredible.' Montgomerie's own demeanour in matchplay conditions is less comfortable. He scowls and growls at the crowd like the angry lion cub he resembles. Several times in his afternoon round against Yoshinori Mizumaki he let slip some truly leonine yawns. Matchplay is physically demanding, for two circuits of a 6,900-yard championship course are a fair day's hike, even without the demands of world-class competition. No other tournaments - except Ryder Cup, where nationalism tends to fuel the players to extraordinary heights - demand 36 holes a day. Analysis of the Wentworth scorecard revealed some interesting differences either side of noon on a typical day. In the morning rounds, the outward nine holes saw 23 birdies or eagles and only five bogeys from the four pairs. After lunch it was a different story - just 10 sub-par shots and eight bogeys. 'Fatigue shouldn't really come into it. We're fit enough to walk a bit more than 12,000 yards,' Mongomerie mused. 'But the pressure goes on for eight hours, not just four. It's demanding but still a fairer process than 18 holes. You can't fluke a win over two whole rounds. That's why Test matches are five days. Whoever is the better player will come through after 36 holes.' Nick Faldo, who went into Wentworth a slightly surprising bookies' favourite to win, despite an indifferent season, agreed that the 36-hold format was a more serious examination of talent and application. On the pro tour, all professional golfers dread the days when they drop a couple of shots in the first few holes, then - before they know it - are on the 10th tee and struggling to get back in the fray. What stops the matchplay formula being more widely used? Golf's promoters, it seems, fear the format's unpredictability. Stars can be turfed-out on the first day. And an early run of 4-and-3 victories can mean that play finishes early, leaving the holder of expensively-purchased television rights with nothing to broadcast. Until 1953, the US PGA was unique among the major titles in using a matchplay format. That year Ben Hogan declined to play, choosing the 18-holes-a-day Open instead (40 years ago the dates clashed) so as to give his legs a rest. Hogan appeared to start a trend. Some gladiatorial personalities, however, will always prefer mano a mano. 'One of the reasons I like matchplay so much is you don't have to keep a scorecard. That's the hardest thing in golf, to keep the score,' said Ballesteros.</p>

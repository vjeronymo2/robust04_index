			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE PROSPECTS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS  </P> <P> In response to Frye's column:  </P> <P> Poland, Panama, Nicaragua and other countries have to beg for foreign aid  crumbs while Israel without any debate or public discussion received another  $200 million in military aid, which increases the acknowledged military aid  package to $2 billion (March 9).  </P> <P> Aid to Israel must be linked to progress on peace, which Israeli intransigence  is impeding. Logically, if there is peace, then the need for weapons will  diminish -- a Middle East "peace dividend."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, let's not squander our "peace dividend" by financing a Middle East  missile race.  </P> <P> FRANK E.

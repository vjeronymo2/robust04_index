			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Temporary permits for workers THE Italian government is to introduce a system of seasonal work permits in an attempt to have more control over illegal immigrant labour. This is the first time an EC state has opted to experiment on a large scale with temporary work permits. The move follows months of study of illicit immigration in Italy and the demands for legally imported labour. The authorities concluded the bulk of some 1.2m non-EC workers now in the country entered initially for seasonal work. Under the decree the government will establish a six-month permit. On expiry holders will be obliged to leave the country. However, they will be able to register their wish to return and would be eligible to do so the following year. Having obtained two permits in consecutive years, the non-EC worker would be entitled to apply for a one-year work permit provided he or she is in possession of a valid job offer. Those with valid seasonal permits will be entitled to social security benefits, including maternity care.</p>

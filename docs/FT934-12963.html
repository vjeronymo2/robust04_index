			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Beware of the sting in the tail IN MY portfolio, I have two very successful single-premium investment bonds with different insurance firms. I rang one company asking about the procedure for cashing the bond. It replied that any gain would be free from basic-rate tax, although (a) this might affect entitlement to age allowance and (b) any charge for higher-rate tax would depend on the individual's circumstances. I then rang the Inland Revenue. It assured me there would be no tax, as capital gains tax was already taken care of in a single-premium bond. But the Revenue added that it would look on the money I received as income and reduce age allowance accordingly. I understand from previous articles that the Revenue admitted in the 1970s that it was unlawful to restrict age allowance by taking capital gains into account in matters like this. When we use the phrase 'capital gains' in our articles and Briefcase replies, we mean 'capital gains as calculated for the purposes of charging capital gains tax'; the phrase does not include (as you unfortunately thought) capital gains chargeable to income tax. It is not practicable for us to keep defining the words and phrases which we use commonly - that would make our replies too long and repetitive. You must bear in mind that every reply is tailor-made for the reader who asked the question; thus, what we say must not be taken as a statement of universal application. What you were told is correct except that the exemption from CGT has nothing to do with CGT being 'already taken care of in a single-premium bond.' Exemption from CGT (which is not actually an advantage, because it merely denies you the benefit of indexation losses) is given by section 210 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Over the years we have, in fact, given a number of warnings in our columns about the sting in the tail of single-premium life policies for people over 64 on modest incomes. (Here again, when we use the phrase 'people over 64' we mean people whose 64th birthday fell before the beginning of the tax year in question; but we cannot spell that out explicitly on every occasion.) The surrender or maturity of a single-premium life policy (a so-called investment bond) can trigger a 12 1/2 per cent age allowance clawback because section 547 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 says: '(1) Where under section 541 . . . a gain is to be treated as arising in connection with any policy . . . if, immediately before the happening of the chargeable event in question, the rights conferred by the policy . . . were vested in an individual as beneficial owner . . . the amount of the gain shall be deemed to form part of that individual's total income for the year in which the event happened . . .' (5)' . . . where by virtue of subsection 1 above, a sum is included in an individual's total income . . . he shall be treated as having paid income tax at the basic rate on that sum . . .' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli President Ezer Weizman by Turhan </F> Ipek in Ankara on 25 January -- recorded, in English with  superimposed Turkish translation]    [Text] [Ipek] Mr. President, could you first summarize  the problems in the Middle East peace process?    [Weizman] A negotiating process never continues in the same  way as it began. It is natural for certain problems to arise in  time. The problems that emerged in the aftermath of the  agreement signed with the Palestinians can be summarized under  the following three headings: The boundaries of Jericho which  will be granted autonomous status, control over entries and  exits from the area, and the disagreements within the PLO.    [Ipek] In your opinion, can Turkey play a role in the Middle  East peace process?    [Weizman] Yes, definitely. I would like to tell you that I  have been in office for eight months. During this period, I  received invitations from many countries, but I postponed almost  all of them. I am conducting my first official visit to Turkey,  because Turkey is an important and large country in the region.  It also has a large population; and moreover, it is Muslim. It  is a democratic and secular country. It has common borders with  Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in addition to the former Soviet  republics. There is no need to explain in length the importance  of Turkey, which is a part of the Balkans and has two important  straits. Turkey and Palestine [as heard] share a common  foundation because of these characteristics. Turkey, which is  an important power in the Middle East, can be influential in the  peace process. It can influence the PLO and Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad. Turkey can play an extremely important role for  peace, and it is doing so.    [Ipek] Various international issues were also discussed  during the talks. Within this framework, can you comment on the  tragic situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenian attacks  against Azerbaijan?    [Weizman] Various international issues were raised with Mr.  Demirel. We discussed the newly independent republics and the  developments in Russia. It is not clear what developments will  take place in Russia. These must be closely followed. I hope  the developments will pursue a democratic path. We did not  discuss Armenian attacks with the Turkish president. The  situation in former Yugoslavia, however, and the tragic  developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, were  discussed. The international community, the United Nations, and  NATO must do something to halt this course, which caused the  death of some 200,000 people. Mr. Demirel is concerned about  the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would not like to  speak on his behalf, but I think he believes that this stems  largely from the fact that the world remains a spectator to the  tragedy in Bosnia and the weakness of the United Nations.    [Ipek] Lastly, what in your opinion is the future of  Turkish-Israeli relations?    [Weizman] I am very pleased with the warmth we encountered  in Ankara. The talks were extremely constructive and were held  in full understanding. There is an important future for  bilateral economic cooperation. I believe that during the 24  hours I spent with Mr. Demirel, we created a brand new beginning  for the relations between the two countries. There is a  beautiful and bright sun in Ankara. I believe that the future  of bilateral relations is as bright as this sun.</p>

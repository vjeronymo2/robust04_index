A delegation from the unions left Haiti  last week. The members of the crisis committee of the Haitian  union organization met with Aristide on 19 March to seek a  solution to the critical situation in Haiti. A member of this  delegation labeled their first meeting with Aristide as very  promising. Representatives of six Haitian union organizations --  including the General Independent Organization, Federation of  Unionized Workers, Federation of Haitian Blue Collar Workers,  and the two branches of the Autonomous Organization of Haitian  Workers [CATH], including Mezyeux's CATH and Manuci Pierre's  CATH -- were present.    Jean-Claude Lebrun, secretary general of CTH, the Federation  of Haitian Workers, said that during this meeting discussions  turned on how to create the conditions necessary to the lifting  of the embargo. [passage omitted]    A second meeting between the union committee and President  Aristide is scheduled for 21 March. The delegation that is to  meet with President Aristide is now in Miami.</p>

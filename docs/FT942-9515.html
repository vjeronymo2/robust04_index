			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Blair urged to reach accord with top leftwing opponent Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the Labour leadership contest, was urged by supporters last night to strengthen his candidacy decisively by striking a deal with one of his leading rivals on the left of the party. The suggestion came as Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, faced calls from among Labour's so-called modernisers to resolve possible competing leadership claims quickly. A clutch of weekend opinion polls confirmed Mr Blair's advantage over other contenders to succeed Mr John Smith, who died last Thursday. But Mr John Prescott, the party's employment spokesman, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, kept open the option of standing as 'traditionalist' candidates. Amid intense behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings, the eventual outcome of the leadership election remained clouded by left-right differences, long-standing personal rivalries and rival ambitions of leading party figures. Despite agreement by all potential candidates not to campaign until after Mr Smith's funeral on Friday, shadow cabinet members said informal soundings over the next few days would be critical in shaping the contest. Bargaining has been complicated by the fact that many trade union leaders are reluctant to endorse any particular candidate publicly. The introduction of one-member-one-vote ballots will greatly reduce the influence of union executives. The suggestion that Mr Blair might reach an agreement with one of the traditionalist candidates came as his supporters admitted that the 41-year-old MP for Sedgefield needed to broaden the basis of his support. Mr Prescott and Mr Cook have made it clear they would find it much easier to work with Mr Blair as party leader than Mr Brown. But Mr Brown's friends were claiming powerful support for his candidacy within the shadow cabinet and among leading figures in the union movement. They said the bandwagon running in favour of Mr Blair underestimated Mr Brown's much stronger ties with grassroots Labour supporters. The pressure on the two leading modernisers to reach an amicable accord within the next week followed inconclusive discussions last week in which they staked out their respective claims. They have agreed to reassess their relative support later this week. Colleagues said there was no pact between the two but the hope was that one would step aside in favour of the other. Mr Bryan Gould, heavily defeated in the leadership contest two years ago by Mr Smith, predicted the outcome of the manoeuvring would be a contest between Mr Cook and Mr Blair which would be won by the shadow home secretary.

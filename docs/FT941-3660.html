			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Automagic jumps to Pounds 163,000 Automagic Holdings, the shoe retailer and key cutter, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 76,000 to Pounds 163,000 in the 28 weeks to January 8, on a reduced turnover of Pounds 6.01m, against Pounds 6.38m. The company attributed the improvement to greater efficiency at controlling overheads. It had also reorganised field operations management in readiness for expansion. The directors were confident that 'the out-turn for the year as a whole will prove to be another positive milestone'. A programme of further resiting and opening of new branches was well under way, some of which would be completed by the year end. Further disposals were planned, several of which were well advanced. Interim earnings per share were up by 1p to 1.9p. There was again no interim dividend.</p>

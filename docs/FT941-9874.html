			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fishermen's protests for Brittany ports French fishermen are planning demonstrations in Brittany ports today in support of a two-week strike which has disrupted fish imports and drawn protests from trading partners, writes John Ridding in Paris. The demonstrations follow a vote on Thursday to continue strike action, despite concessions from the government which include aid packages worth FFr450m (Pounds 51.5m) and the imposition of minimum price controls by the European Commission. The striking fishermen are demanding an emergency meeting with Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and further measures to protect themselves against what they describe as unfair competition from cheap imports. Government measures to placate the fishermen, however, have already run into opposition from trading partners. The US has sent a written complaint about the blocking of imports, following a decision by Paris to implement rigid testing procedures. The US embassy in Paris said US fish imports had been blocked at Charles De Gaulle airport and tonnes of fish had started to rot. Norway said the situation facing its fish exporters had largely returned to normal, following a decision to include members of the European Free Trade Area on the list of countries excluded from certification procedures at customs posts. But the Norwegian embassy said the situation was still confused and lorry drivers were wary of bringing cargo into the country.</p>

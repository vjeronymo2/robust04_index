			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kalina Stancheva on the 28 April </F> session of the Council of Ministers in Sofia -- live]    [Text] The Council of Ministers has received two notes  from the U.S. Embassy dated 11 April, requesting permission for  six U.S. Air Force F-16 combat aircraft to transit Bulgarian  airspace today, and for a further four fighters to do the same  tomorrow. The planes will fly to the (?Incirlik) air base, and  will not carry ammunition on board. They will be used to patrol  the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.    The Bulgarian Army General Staff finds no reasons to object  to the requests, but as a result of a vote by the individual  ministers, the government unanimously decided to refer the  request to the National Assembly.    The National Assembly is also expected to make a decision on  another problem submitted by the cabinet. Three hours ago  Valentin Karabashev, deputy prime minister and trade minister,  submitted his resignation from both his posts. He asked for  space to be made on the agenda for him to present his statement.  The statement mentions serious differences within the  government that have developed since mid-1993 regarding the  amendments to the Privatization Act, the military-industrial  complex, the energy industry, and the privatization of hotels.  The statement also refers to the lack of confidence and the  administrational chaos created by the combining of the deputy  prime ministers' functions since the fall of 1993. Among the  motives pointed out, the statement mentions the prime minister's  attempts to circumvent government decisions and to promote his  own personal ideas about privatization, and the major attacks in  his statement yesterday, which Karabashev regards as unfounded.  He considers the assessment of the work of the Trade Ministry  as based on intrigues and denunciations.    The Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] backs Valentin  Karabashev's decision and, as the members of its leadership  stated, if the decision is made for the ASP to withdraw from the  cabinet, they will recommend that Minister Bikov resign as well.</p>

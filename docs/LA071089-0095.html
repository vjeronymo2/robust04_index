			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> STEALTH BOMBER MOVES UNDER ITS OWN POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME  </P> <P> The B-2 stealth bomber moved under its own power for the first time today,  emerging from its super-secret research hangar and rolling out onto a desert  runway.  </P> <P> The sleek, bat-like bomber, the most advanced in the Pentagon's arsenal and  capable of penetrating enemy radar defenses without being detected, taxied onto  the runway shortly after sunrise and began a series of engine tests at various  power settings. As the tests began, the engines changed in pitch from an eerie  whistle to a low roar. The aircraft then moved from a station near its secure  hangar at about 10 m.p.h. for about two miles down the runway at Air Force  Plant 42.  </P> <P> For about two hours the sinister-looking bomber was put through its engine  tests, then moved to the far end of the runway adjacent to Sierra Highway,  where it was visible to passing traffic.  </P> <P> After the low-speed taxi tests, the plane will make high-speed taxi tests and  then make its maiden flight sometime within the next two weeks.  </P></p>

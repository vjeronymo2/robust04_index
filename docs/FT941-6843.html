			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / In the public eye: The head of the UK prison service When Mr Derek Lewis, former chief executive of the leisure group Granada, was appointed director-general of the prison service in England and Wales at the start of 1993, he described the job as a 'proverbial bed of nails'. After a career as a high-flying business executive, he was the surprise choice to run more than 130 prisons, taking a significant pay cut to do so. Lacking any previous experience of prisons, he was regarded with suspicion in a service sceptical about the ability of outsiders to cope with its uniquely difficult task. Now, a year later, Mr Lewis admits there have been days when he wondered whether he had made the right decision. But overall he has no regrets over taking a job that he says has become 'totally absorbing'. The biggest difference he has found in his new role is the intensity of the public scrutiny to which he is exposed. It is, he says, greater than anything he had experienced in the private sector. It is hard for anyone from the private sector to prepare for the level of exposure encountered in public life, he adds. 'Intellectually, one can understand it, but you don't really know what it is like until you experience it. 'In the public sector, we work in a goldfish bowl. I am answerable 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on issues ranging from penal policy to the treatment of individual prisoners.' Mr Lewis did not have to wait long for his first experience of public accountability. Just three months after taking up the post, a row erupted over the privatisation of the escort service which ferries inmates between prison and court. Group 4, the private security group, lost seven of its charges during the first two weeks of the contract for escorting prisoners in East Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire. The resulting furore drove home the message that everything the prison service did was fair game for public comment. But Mr Lewis feels that his private-sector experience made it easier for him to fend off calls for private contracts to be abandoned. 'I don't think there has been a single launch of anything that has not had significant teething problems,' he says. 'Having been involved in many start-ups, I was able to take a slightly more relaxed view and be more open about the things that had gone wrong.' Those skills were again put to the test last August following damaging criticism of Wolds remand prison, the UK's first privately-managed prison. A report by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, welcomed some aspects of the Wolds regime but criticised the absence of constructive activity for prisoners on remand. 'It was a balanced report,' says Mr Lewis. 'But it was the critical comments that attracted the headlines.' That was followed by a hardy perennial in the prison service - the threat of industrial action by the Prison Officers' Association. The traditionally militant union, an effective opponent of change in the past, refused to co-operate with privatised prison escorts. Last autumn, the Home Office won an injunction against the union, successfully arguing that prison officers had the status of constables and so could not take industrial action. The removal of the right of officers to strike is being confirmed by legislation currently passing through parliament, a move which has done little to improve relations with the POA at national level. Mr Lewis prefers to see the flare-up with the POA as a watershed that will lead to better industrial relations in the prison service. He sets great store by the sort of communication between staff and managers that is at the heart of modern human resource management techniques. 'We now have the opportunity to put our industrial relations on to the sort of footing that exists in most other organisations in the public and private sector,' he says. Throughout these storms, the prison service has had to cope with a steeply rising number of inmates, raising once again the spectre of prison overcrowding. The climate of public opinion has also moved in favour of harsher prison regimes, with Mr Michael Howard, home secretary since last May, keen to demonstrate his toughness on criminals. These two factors have made it harder to complete the improvement of conditions recommended in the Woolf report after the Strangeways prison riot in 1990. Yet Mr Lewis believes that he has been able to make significant improvements in the service, ranging from the quality of catering to the amount of time prisoners spend on work and training. He derives the greatest satisfaction, however, from his programme of management reform in the service. In line with private-sector orthodoxy, much more responsibility is being devolved from headquarters to local managers - the governors who run the prisons. This has revolutionised governors' attitudes, claims Mr Lewis. 'The dependency culture is disappearing: governors no longer say they can't do what they want to because they don't have the resources. Now they tell me what they're going to do and how they're going to do it.' He acknowledges that the introduction of private-sector competition has helped generate this new enthusiasm. Three prisons have so far been contracted out to private management, with more to come. But governors and staff are taking a positive approach to competition, he adds. 'There is a much more confident note which says 'we can give the private sector a good run for its money'. That is what competition from the private sector was meant to do.'</p>

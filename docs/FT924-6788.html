			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: French builders in merger battle A RARE shareholder battle broke out in the French building industry yesterday when Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the water distribution to civil engineering group, blocked a merger between two of the country's leading construction companies. Generale des Eaux, owner of a 34 per cent blocking minority in the construction group Fougerolle, refused to vote in favour of Fougerolle completing an agreed Dollars 830m takeover of one of its main competitors, Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises (SAE). If the bid had succeeded, it would have resulted in a company with an annual turnover of FFr40bn (Dollars 7.42bn). This is of the same order as Generale des Eaux's main construction subsidiary, SGE. The sector leader, Bouygues, had sales of FFr64.3bn last year. Generale des Eaux said the merger would make it harder for shareholders to track the two groups' development and their separate profits records and that it saw no advantages from the merger to compensate for this problem. Fougerolle said that the merger could not now go ahead and that it was regrettable that the industrial advantages of the scheme were so misunderstood. This shareholder battle is the latest episode in a power struggle between Mr Guy Dejouany, chairman of Generale des Eaux, who is one of the most influential operators in the Paris business establishment, and Mr Jean-Francois Roverato, the self-made son of an Italian cabinet maker who has worked his way up through the ranks in Fougerolle and became chairman in 1987. Mr Dejouany wanted to take over Fougerolle three years ago and merge it with SGE. However, Mr Roverato refused and instead staged a management buy-out. This left Generale des Eaux as the second largest minority shareholder after Paribas, the financial and industrial holding group which owns 47 per cent of Fougerolle. The blocking move is also a setback for Paribas, which had strongly supported the Fougerolle-SAE merger plan. It represents another misadventure for Paribas's industrial portfolio following the recent discovery of a FFr600m loss due to off-balance sheet financial dealings in its Ciments Francais subsid-iary.</p>

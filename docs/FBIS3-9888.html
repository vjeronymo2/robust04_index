The  legislators, opposed to President Aristide, are reportedly ready  to vote for the formation of a new government. It would be,  according to Sen. Sansaricq, an ad hoc government, the duties of  which are provided for in Article 111 of the 1987 Constitution.    On the question of Article 149, Bernard Sansaricq noted the  refusal by the president-in-exile to immediately nominate a new  prime minister in compliance with Article 148. According to the  president of one of the two offices of the Senate, it is urgent  to form the ad hoc government to solve the political deadlock.    Bernard Sansaricq, who asserts that he met with the Army  General Staff, revealed that some officers of that institution  regard the Governors Island accord and the New York pact null  and void. He indicated, however, that General Cedras did not  openly express himself on the matter.    On the subject of the commander in chief, invited to the  parliament at the beginning of the week, Bernard Sansaricq still  expresses indignance at the general's refusal to answer the  senators' questions. Sansaricq considers it a lack of respect  for the Senate of the Republic. Mr. Sansaricq also explained  that he did not formally ask for the resignation of Gen. Cedras,  but would be ready to do so if it were a Senate decision.</p>

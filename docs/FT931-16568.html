			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Revenue rule move forces Pep changes SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the fund management group, is being forced by a change in an Inland Revenue rule to write to between 800 and 1,000 unit holders, telling them they must restructure their personal equity plans by April 6 or face full taxation thereafter. The move, throwing into question up to Pounds 2m of investors' money, stems from a rule- drafting error made by the Revenue in July and its subsequent, unprecedented, decision to rewrite the Pep rules retrospectively. The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any funds held in bond or gilt-based sums ineligible for Pep investment. Currently Pep holders can invest up to Pounds 1,500 in such so-called 'non-qualifying' funds. Most of the investors affected hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep portfolio, launched in September last year, which exploited the loophole.</p>

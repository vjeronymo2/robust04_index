			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Syntex falls heavily as drug patent runs out Profits at Syntex, the US drugs company being bought by Roche of Switzerland, slid in the latest fiscal quarter, as sales in the US of its leading product, Naprosyn, slumped to just Dollars 36m, from Dollars 200m a year ago. Operating income was Dollars 23.6m, compared with Dollars 158.8m (before a Dollars 140m restructuring charge) a year before. Net income of Dollars 22.4m, or 10 cents a share, compared with a post-restructuring Dollars 40.8m, 18 cents, in 1993. The period, to 30 April, was the first full quarter since the US patent on Naprosyn expired last December. To maintain its market share, the company sold its own low-margin generic version of the drug and the compound to other manufacturers. In addition to the Dollars 36m in the US, sales of Naprosyn, the generic product and the compound reached Dollars 58m elsewhere in the world, compared with Dollars 62m a year before. The falling sales of the high-margin branded product led to a decline in Syntex's gross margin to 71.5 per cent, from 77.3 per cent the year before. Total sales for the period dropped be nearly a third to Dollars 402m, from Dollars 584m. Sales of its other leading product, Toradol, fell to Dollars 81m, a decline of 15 per cent from the previous year's Dollars 95m. Analysts had been predicting a gradual increase in sales of Toradol compared with last year.</p>

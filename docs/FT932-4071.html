			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Fragile ceasefire between Croats and Moslems A FRAGILE ceasefire between Moslem and Croat forces went into effect yesterday as the two former allies prepared to battle for another town in central Bosnia, Reuter reports from Travnik. Furious fighting until yesterday noon prompted United Nations peacekeepers to appeal to them to spare civilians trapped by their war for territory. Vitez, a town where British UN Protection Force troops are garrisoned 25km southeast of Travnik, was 'apparently under siege' and extremely tense with continued small arms fire and sporadic artillery fire, Ms Shannon Boyd, the spokeswoman for the UN forces in Zagreb, said. UN sources said sporadic mortar and sniper fire rang out around Vitez hours after the truce, agreed by Croat and Moslem officers in Kiseljak on Wednesday, went into effect. Croats blocked all routes into the area with checkpoints and debris and the main road between Vitez and the northern Moslem stronghold of Zenica was also blocked. It is in this area that UN forces are seeking guarantees on behalf of civilians who have to run a gauntlet of Croat and Moslem roadblocks to reach safety. Moslems were reported to be attacking villages in the area of Novi Travnik, and to the east around Busovaca. The Croat Defence Force (HVO) accused Moslems of provoking a fresh outbreak of fighting in Mostar and said a Franciscan monastery was set ablaze and 15 Croat soldiers were wounded. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in Zagreb minutes before Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, cutting short an official visit to China, landed to take charge of the Bosnia crisis. Later the supreme commanders of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces signed a sweeping agreement to end fierce fighting across central and southwest Bosnia and set up power-sharing bodies. Meanwhile Sarajevo radio reported continuing fighting between mainly Moslem Bosnian forces and Serb troops around the Moslem refugee haven of Gorazde yesterday.</p>

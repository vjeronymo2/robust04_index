			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["The Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "What </F> Cultural Normalization!"]    [Text] Cultural normalization with Israel seems to be all  the rage now -- for both local and Arab intellectuals. It was a  real issue at the recent elections of the Jordanian Writers  Association and continues to engage the attention of a good many  Arab intellectuals. For most of them, it seems that to hold our  ground culturally makes up for the setbacks we have suffered on  the battle front over the past four decades.    In fact, with an impending normalization in the military,  economic, commercial, tourist, and water spheres, I cannot see  how it will be possible to resist cultural normalization.    How will it be possible to buck the trend for cultural  normalization when economic normalization will bring Israel  right to the core of our lives and channels will open wide  between our mortal, permanent enemy and ourselves?    Are we to bar access to the Israeli newspapers, counsel our  viewers and listeners against tuning in to Israeli television  and radio networks, and ostracize whoever reads a poem composed  by an Israeli author or a literary work translated from Hebrew?    I, for one, am prepared to observe a decision to combat  cultural normalization. But will local and Arab intellectuals  show me and other like-minded persons the way to put this  decision into practice?    I will admit that in this age of satellite communications,  the world is now virtually a global village and culture is a  universal and global concern. However, I take issue with some  intellectuals who are falling all over themselves to become  familiar with Israeli literary works and figures.    How are we to combat cultural normalization when Israeli  television gate-crashes our homes, when our radios are  continually tuned in to Israeli stations, and practically every  Jordanian and Arab daily runs a full page translated from one  Israeli paper or another?    Would it promote the cause of the fight against cultural  normalization, if we were to march through the streets tomorrow  and demand that Arab Education Ministries keep the same  curricula and not tell our children that Israel now belongs in  the camp of our friends?    This may be one way to further this cause. However, assuming  that Israel will continue to be viewed as an enemy in our school  curricula, we must realize that an Arab child encountering  Israelis and handling Israeli toys and candies is bound to be  confused and perplexed.    Normalization is normalization; we can't be selective. It is  pointless and meaningless to combat cultural normalization when  we press ahead with normalization in military, economic and  other areas, and when our intellectuals seem keen to read  whatever is being turned out by Israel's mass media.</p>

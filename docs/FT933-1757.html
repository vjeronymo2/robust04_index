			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Korea-Europe Fund net assets ahead Korea-Europe Fund raised net asset value by 14.3 per cent to Dollars 5.51 per share at the end of June, 1993, against Dollars 4.82 a year earlier. This compared to a 33.7 per cent increase in US dollar terms in the KSE Composite Stock Price Index. The trust said the underperformance was largely because of the overweighting in smaller companies which had been responsible for a significant outperformance over the same period last year. Net available revenue for the year was Pounds 923,000 (Pounds 602,000). Earnings per share came to 3.22 cents (2.1 cents) and the dividend has been stepped up from 0.6 cents to 1.5 cents.</p>

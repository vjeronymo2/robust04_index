			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Brundtland threatens 'antis' with election Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, said last night she might dissolve parliament and call new elections if anti-European Union parties tried to block ratification of EU membership, despite a Yes vote in next Monday's referendum. 'I have always been against implementing the power of dissolution. But now I'm more open to the fact there can be good reason to do so,' she told a pro-EU rally in the west coast city of Kristiansand. The Centre party and the Socialist Left party, leading the No campaign in the referendum, have threatened to block ratification if Norwegians vote in favour of joining the Union by a small margin. The two parties have never defined what they consider a small margin to be. However, for Mrs Brundtland to dissolve parliament would require a change in Norway's constitution. Two years ago, a proposal for such a change was put before parliament and could be addressed during this term. The amendment would require two-thirds of the parliament to push it through and political analysts said that it would be possible to get the support needed for the change. EU membership ratification requires a three-quarters majority in the parliament. Between them, the two parties could muster the support they need to block EU membership ratification by gathering support from other anti-EU parties such as the Christian Peoples' party. Just 49 votes would be needed to block ratification, and between them the Centre party and Socialists have 45 seats in parliament while the Christian Peoples' party has 13. But Mrs Brundtland stressed that the issue of dissolving parliament and calling new elections has not been formally discussed within the government nor in her Labour party. On Tuesday, she said she did not believe the Euro-sceptics would risk going against the will of the electorate by blocking ratification. Although the No camp has long held a lead in the polls, a survey published yesterday showed for the first time a 50/50 split between the Yes and No camps. Officials close to the prime minister said if there is a Yes majority supporting membership it would likely be no more than 52 per cent. Mrs Brundtland has repeatedly said she would not resign if Norway rejects EU membership for the second time since 1972.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Index-linked In these days of diminishing inflationary expectations, one would hardly expect index-linked gilts to be worth a second glance. Perversely, neglect since the election has increased their charm. Only if inflation averages well under 2 per cent during the next 10 years do conventional gilts offer a higher return to investors paying 40 per cent tax. Small wonder the Bank of England included Pounds 200m of index-linked in yesterday's offering.</p>

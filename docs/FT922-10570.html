			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Attack on Kohl intensifies feud within coalition: Germany's future deputy chancellor calls for stronger leadership CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl, faced with spreading strikes across Germany, yesterday came under attack from his future deputy chancellor who called for stronger leadership and drastic budget cuts. The call, from Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister who has just been nominated for the deputy's post, fuelled the bitter feuding between the parties that make up Germany's ruling coalition. The recriminations followed Monday's dramatic decision by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher to resign as foreign minister and deputy chancellor - and disagreements within the government over who should succeed him. At the same time, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), bitterly criticised Mr Mollemann and his Free Democratic party (FDP) for upsetting the coalition, and called on Mr Kohl to carry out a drastic government reshuffle. For their part the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), taking advantage of the obvious confusion in government ranks, called for new elections two years ahead of time. The FDP yesterday attempted to close ranks after a revolt by its members of parliament, who rejected the leadership's nomination of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer as new foreign minister, and substituted Mr Klaus Kinkel, the present justice minister. At the same time, the party is insisting on Mr Mollemann as its candidate for deputy chancellor, although he is unpopular with the coalition partners. That is the job which the CSU believes should now go to Mr Theo Waigel, its leader and the current finance minister. Mr Mollemann has chosen just this moment to launch an offensive on the government's spending plans, delivering a 16-page paper to Mr Waigel calling for drastic budget cuts, according to today's issue of the independent Suddeutsche Zeitung. Mr Mollemann also called for urgent action to privatise significant state holdings such as Lufthansa, the German airline, Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, and the post office savings bank, in order to raise more cash. The report says he is calling for a common line from the chancellor, the finance minister and his own economics ministry, proposing cuts - including a reduction in social spending, an area which Mr Kohl has specifically ruled out for savings. Mr Mollemann also called for 'strong political leadership' in Bonn, the newspaper said, clearly implying weakness in the chancellor. The timing of his initiative has fuelled speculation that the FDP may be seeking a confrontation with its coalition partners, given the sliding popularity of the government in the opinion polls, and the ever-more unpopular costs of paying for unification with eastern Germany. In his paper, Mr Mollemann argues that the budget faces increased charges totalling billions of D-Marks from compensation costs related to unification  -DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in 1993, DM15bn in 1994 and DM25bn in 1995. Mr Kohl is simultaneously facing grumblings of discontent from the CSU, whose leader, Mr Waigel, does not appear to have been seriously consulted over the Genscher succession. Last night the party and parliamentary leaders of the three coalition partners were meeting in an attempt to agree on their outstanding differences, including the question of budget strategy in the coming months. Mr Peter Struck, the SPD parliamentary group manager, said there was a simple answer to the coalition's crisis: new elections.

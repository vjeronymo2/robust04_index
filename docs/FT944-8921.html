			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Champalimaud regains control of Portuguese bank Mr Antonio Champalimaud yesterday regained control of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor (BPSM), paying Es37.28bn (Dollars 289.9m) for 80 per cent of Portugal's sixth-largest bank 19 years after it was seized from his family in a wave of Communist-led nationalisations, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. The Champalimaud group bid Es1,528 a share for the 24.4m shares on offer in a privatisation operation on the Lisbon stock exchange. This was Es228 more than the only rival bid, from a consortium led by Banco Finantia, a Portuguese investment bank, and 45.5 per cent higher than the reserve price of Es1,050. Mr Champalimaud, 76, said to be the wealthiest man in Portugal, acquired BPSM through Mundial Confianca, the insurance company that he also bought back after its nationalisation in 1975. He fled Portugal after the 1974 revolution and rebuilt his business group in Brazil before returning to begin repurchasing his expropriated assets. In January, the government rejected as too low an offer from Banco Comercial Portugues of almost Es14bn for 80 per cent of BPSM, in addition to guarantees of further investment. BCP said it might have increased its bid if it had been allowed to make a more detailed examination of the bank's liabilities. The remaining 20 per cent of BPSM is to be sold later to employees and small investors.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Profits at trust banks fall sharply JAPAN'S seven trust banks suffered sharp falls in earnings for the year to March, due to thinner profit margins and falls in commission revenue after the plunge in the stock and real estate markets. Combined non-consolidated pre-tax profits fell 33.8 per cent to Y248.1bn (Dollars 1.9bn), while combined net business profits, or profits from core banking business declined 12.6 per cent to Y217.5bn. Sumitomo and Mitsubishi saw double digit increases in net business profits thanks to firm earnings at their international divisions. Profit margins fell sharply due to the time-lag between the fall in money market rates and the review of dividends on their loan trusts, which account for half the trust banks' business. Trust fees shrank 12.8 per cent to a combined Y510.7bn. Service income fell 38.2 per cent to Y155bn, due to the sluggish real estate market. Profits on securities transactions, including appraisal losses, fell 5.6 per cent to Y24bn. Fund transactions improved 20 times to Y85.8bn, thanks to widening market interest rate spreads. Profits from international business increased by 37.7 per cent to Y326.6bn, buoyed by lower interest rates overseas. The trust banks also saw sharp declines in commission revenue from investment trust management. The sharp falls in share prices and last year's increasing number of companies to cancel their stock fund trusts. Mitsubishi had Y2,000bn in outstanding fund trusts, down from Y2,400bn, while the balance fell from Y1,900bn to Y1,400bn at Sumitomo. Mitsui reported a sharp drop in its fund trust balance at Y670bn from Y1,470bn. The poor results have forced Yasuda and Toyo to cut dividends for fiscal 1991 by Y0.75 per share. For the current year to March 1993, the trust banks expect profits growth to remain flat due to continued sluggishness in the stock and real estate markets.  ------------------------------------------------------ JAPANESE TRUST BANK PROFITS  ------------------------------------------------------                   Core bank    Pre-tax      After-tax  ------------------------------------------------------ Sumitomo         72.7  +21.1  53.4  -37.1  30.4  -41.4 Mitsubishi       62.3  +11.8  56.5  -29.5  29.0  -39.2 Mitsui           32.9  -31.1  45.9  -36.1  25.6  -30.4 Yasuda           20.3  -50.8  42.4  -25.2  21.5  -37.1 Toyo             19.8  -41.4  31.6  -33.0  15.5  -32.0 Chuo              6.9  -51.5  13.4  -43.1   7.4  -32.4 Nippon            2.4         -4.6  -54.0   2.3  -49.1 Total           217.5 -12.62  48.1  -33.8 132.0  -36.9  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

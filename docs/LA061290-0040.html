			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTENDER FOR MALIBU SEAT LEAVES HOSPITAL  </P> <P> A contender for a contested seat on Malibu's future City Council who suffered a  mild stroke last Friday was reported to be in good condition Monday after being  released from Santa Monica Hospital.  </P> <P> John J. Merrick, 71, a retired Municipal Court judge, was resting comfortably  at home after his release from the hospital, his wife, Marge, said.  </P> <P> Merrick was said to be trailing slow-growth activist Missy Zeitsoff by a single  vote Monday, with an unknown number of absentee and write-in ballots from last  week's incorporation election yet to be counted.  </P> <P> In addition to approving cityhood by a wide margin, Malibu voters chose a  five-member council. But the race between Zeitsoff and Merrick for the fifth  seat on the council continued to be so close that a spokesman for the Los  Angeles County registrar's office said it may be Thursday before the winner is  known.  </P></p>

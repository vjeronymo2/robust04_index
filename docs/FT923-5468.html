			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Daniel Ludwig, the invisible billionaire: Obituary MR Daniel Ludwig, the reclusive shipowner and property developer who died of heart failure at his Manhattan apartment last Thursday, was, in many respects, an archetypal US billionaire. Although Mr Ludwig was regularly described in later life as one of the world's richest men and had interests ranging from hotels in the Caribbean to coal mines in Australia, his origins were fairly modest. He was born in 1897, in the small port town of South Haven, on Lake Michigan, to a family closely linked to the shipping business. Daniel Ludwig quit high school after eighth grade, and quickly followed this example. He persuaded his father to lend him Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 2,510) which was spent converting an old steamer into a barge. This became the first of a fleet of vessels which Ludwig used to ply wood and molasses up the shipping channels. In 1921, he acquired his first ocean-going vessel, and by 1930 had moved into shipping oil. In 1936 the foundations of his business empire were laid when he hit on a financing arrangement, whereby oil companies would charter tankers for future oil deliveries while he used the charters as collateral to borrow money to build the tankers. By the end of the second world war he owned the nation's fifth largest tanker fleet. He leased a shipyard in Japan, and started to roll out supertankers. By the 1960s Ludwig's business empire was becoming more diversified. At one stage, he bought up 4m acres of Brazilian rain forest and planted gmelina - a fast-growing tree, native to India - for pulp and lumber. He also added hotels, coal operations, and various financial interests - including investments in four thrifts now managed by the Resolution Trust Company. He sold his Princess Hotel group to Mr Tiny Rowland between 1979 and 1981 for about Dollars 200m. His personal life was equally complex. He divorced his first wife in 1937 after nine years of marriage, but refused to acknowledge her daughter as his own. He married again later that year, but the second marriage produced no children. Mr Ludwig refused to be photographed for 20 years, relenting in 1985. He always said he did not care what the world thought of him, though some suggest that he found it more convenient to conduct business away from prying eyes. Despite this reclusiveness, Ludwig could not escape a reputation for being tight-fisted - he was reknowned for taking commercial flights and walking to work - and crusty. He gave up talking to journalists in the 1960s, and a biography published in 1986 was appropriately titled The Invisible Billionaire. Observer, Page 12</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (7): Business goes beyond mutual funds - Investment management ALTHOUGH more than 300 mutual funds are domiciled in Bermuda, there is more to the island's investment management business than just mutual funds. A small but growing number of specialised financial firms are running investment portfolios from Bermuda, not only for individual and institutional clients, but also for themselves. A wide range of firms on the island now offer investment management services to a wide range of clients. Prominent local companies such as Lines Overseas Management and PRP Performa Limited manage money for the island's insurance community and First Bermuda Securities, Bermuda Asset Management and Kast Investment Management, offer investment management services to local as well as international customers. Then there are the bigger names with operations in Bermuda. These include Fidelity, the US fund company, Kidder Peabody, the US securities firm, Monroe Trout, the Chicago-based commodities trading house and Schroders, the UK trust group. Finally, a host of individual investment specialists and one-man firms also manage portfolios from the island. Although no one has yet tried to calculate the size of this burgeoning industry, the evidence suggests that it is expanding fast. Investment managers are coming to Bermuda for several reasons, including the island's accommodating regulatory environment, its first class telecommunications links and its convenient geographical location. More important, they are taking advantage of a trend that is noticeable in other financial centres - the movement of investment management business and expertise away from the traditional locations, as computer and communications technology allows specialists actively to manage portfolios from almost anywhere in the world where there is an electric wall socket and a telephone plug. Although the focus of most investment management on Bermuda is directed overseas to the prosperous business of running offshore portfolios for international clients, some firms are aggressively pursuing business right on their own doorstep, namely the island's fast-expanding insurance industry, with its Dollars 52bn worth of assets. Until recently, Bermuda firms have not been seeking business from the insurers, primarily because they assumed that the big international insurance companies preferred to have their portfolios run from centres such as New York and London, either by their own managers or by huge securities firms. Although this assumption still holds in general, a few local firms are beginning to win business from the insurers. They include Lines Overseas Management (which hopes to have Dollars 120m under its control, some of it from small island-based insurers, by the end of the year), and PRP Performa, whose head, Hugh Barit, has been managing money for captive insurance companies for more than a decade. Another firm hoping to catch the insurers' attention is Orbis, a former Hong Kong money manager which now commands Dollars 490m in three Bermuda-based equity funds. Alan Gilbertson, a director of the firm, says: 'A lot of the insurance companies here are very young, and are building up to a point where they can become more adventurous with their investments. Some of them are beginning to dip their toes into the water of equity investment.' Orbis runs three of the many mutual funds registered in Bermuda. Growth in these funds - the bulk of them sold to international trusts, or high-net worth offshore investors in Europe and the East Asia - has been impressive. Two years ago there were 200 funds domiciled on the island. Today there are more than 300. The growth of Bermuda's mutual fund business, however, continues to be hampered by its virtual exclusion from the huge US market, because of regulatory restrictions. Ken Morgan of the Bank of Butterfield says the banks and other fund managers are unlikely to pursue opportunities in the United States until the authorities there loosen the regulations. 'At some point we might look at it, if we are able to find a way through the regulatory system up there. If there was a straightforward and simple way we'd do it,' Mr Morgan says. As for the UK market - a seemingly natural target for Bermuda fund managers  -only a few local firms have obtained the recognition from UK regulators as a special 'designated territory' that is required to market their funds in the UK. Malcolm Williams, general manager of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, says he is surprised that no more than a handful of Bermuda firms have sought UK-designated status. And he is not sure why so little interest has been shown so far. 'I suspect it's because most of our collective investment schemes are closed-ended, and in the UK they're open-ended and aimed at the UK public,' he says. The biggest presence in the island's mutual fund business remains Fidelity International, whose president (and Bermuda finance minister) David Saul describes as a 'cousin company' to the huge US fund group. Fidelity International now manages Dollars 10bn, but none of the management is done on Bermuda, where the 32 staff act purely as an administrative team for the company's many non-US operations.</p>

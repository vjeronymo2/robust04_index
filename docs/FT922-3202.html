			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Robusta COFFEE prices closed weaker in London, while arabicas were down at midday in New York. The market will probably test life-of-contract lows, one New York trader said - 'There is no reason right now for prices to go up'. Technically, the market is in a downtrend and there is no fresh supportive fundamental news until the ICO meeting in London on June 22. London September COCOA hit a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 531 a tonne, but recovered some of the loss by the close. Dealers said the prospect of further sales by the Ivory Coast - on holiday yesterday - continued to weigh on sentiment. ZINC prices rallied form earlier 2 1/2 -month lows by the close on the LME. Continued technical tightness kept the premium for cash metal over three-month at Dollars 172 a tonne. PLATINUM'S brief rally met resistance at Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market. Earlier speculative US commission house buying on Nymex triggered buy stops after weak US retail sales data helped to revive speculation of a US interest rate cut. The white metal was fixed at Dollars 370 in the afternoon, up just over Dollars 2 from the morning fix, before it slipped back in the face of initial upward resistance, London dealers said.

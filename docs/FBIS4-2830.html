			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The first Sino-British  adult education seminar was held yesterday in Jinan, capital of  east China's Shandong Province.    The seminar was co-sponsored by the Jinan-based Shandong  Teacher's University (STU) and Nottingham College of Great  Britain.    More than 80 educators from Britain, the United States,  Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea and China attended the  seminar and presented some 60 papers, covering the management of  adult education, relations between adult education and economic  development, modes of adult education, education for rural  population, lifetime education and experience in adult education.    The seminar will last for five days.    STU started an adult education program in 1956 and has  trained about 20,000 adult students over the past 38 years. It  has set up a college for adult education, which has an  enrollment of more than 7,000 students.    In 1987 the university signed a cooperation agreement with  Nottingham College in Sino-British adult education.    It is a cooperative and friendly conference, said Professor  J. E. Thomas, vice-president of Nottingham College. He  expressed the hope that every grown-up in the world will have  the chance and freedom to read.</p>

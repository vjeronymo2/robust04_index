			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright appoints float team CARPETRIGHT of London, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, has appointed advisers and non-executive directors ahead of its flotation, planned for the summer. Details of the float are yet to be finalised but the group is expected to be valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m. Carpetright made a pre-tax profit in the year to April 1992 of Pounds 2.8m, up from Pounds 351,000 the year before. Its interim profits jumped from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.4m, and analysts are expecting profits for the current year to top Pounds 7m. Sir Phil, who headed the Harris Queensway carpet and furniture group until it was taken over for Pounds 450m in 1988, said that there would be 115 Carpetright stores and another 22 would open in the next year. He said the chain could expand from cash flow. MFI Furniture Group holds 22 per cent of the ordinary shares. It has yet to decide whether to sell them at the time of the float. There are also Pounds 9m worth of preference shares in issue which could be redeemed from the proceeds of the float. The non-executives appointed yesterday are Sir Harry Djanogly, a non-executive director of Coats Viyella and Singer and Friedlander, and Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman of Alexandra Workwear and Domino Printing Sciences. Sir Harry chaired Nottingham Manufacturing, the textile group which was bought by Coats, and Mr Dennis was deputy chairman of BAT Industries. Sponsors to the float are County NatWest and the brokers are SG Warburg Securities. See Observer</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: PowerPC alliance to be strengthened International Business Machines, Apple Computer and Motorola will on Monday announce plans to develop a common specification for personal computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor chips that the three companies have jointly developed. The agreement builds on the PowerPC alliance formed by the companies three years ago which was established to challenge the PC industry standards for hardware and software based on Intel microprocessors and Microsoft software. The success of the alliance has been limited by incompatibilities between Apple's Power Macintosh computers and the PowerPC computers built by Motorola and IBM. On Monday, the companies will announce that they have agreed to eliminate these incompatibilities. But it will be two years before computers based on the new standard are available. Talks among the three companies have been underway for several months, fuelling rumours that either IBM or Motorola might acquire, or take an equity stake in Apple. IBM had also been reported to be close to reaching an agreement to license Apple's Macintosh software. But in the event, the new agreement between Apple , IBM and Motorola applies only to the hardware specification for PCs. An important goal of the new pact is to encourage third party software companies to develop applications for PowerPC computers. The lack of software for PowerPC was cited by IBM when it postponed introduction of its planned Power Personal range of PCs last month. The new design will run a variety of operating systems including Apple's Mac OS, IBM's OS/2 and others. If developers could write software that runs on several operating systems on one machine, with only slight modifications, they might be more inclined to write software for the PowerPC computers , analysts said.</p>

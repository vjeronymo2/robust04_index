			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Brussels warns on foreign curbs The European Commission has threatened European Court action against the UK if it does not scrap rules which allow the government to set a limit on foreign shareholdings in certain companies. The move seems likely to add to the tension between London and Brussels. It follows a long-running wrangle between the commission and the UK over the limits on foreign shareholdings set for British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce following their privatisation in 1987. It emerged yesterday that the EC had opened infringement proceedings against the UK over the rules, which are designed to protect companies deemed to have a strategic or security role. The commission says limits on shareholdings can sometimes be justified on national security grounds, but it feels the current UK legal structure is too flexible. 'This isn't just aerospace - it could be applied to a whole lot of sectors,' explained one commission official. 'What we are unhappy with is the fact that the minister is able to prohibit investments on the grounds of national interests.' British ministers also argue that scrapping the limit would allow EC companies to take over UK companies without extending the same rights to British shareholders. They say complex regulations in some EU countries, such as Germany, effectively prevent takeovers. But the Department of Trade and Industry said it would consider the request from British companies affected by the limits to raise the cap on foreign ownership from 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent. The commission says the UK law infringes single market legislation, including laws on establishment and the freedom of circulation of capital, since it makes distinctions between British and other EU shareholders. The commission yesterday acknowledged that Britain was unlikely to be the only country in the EU which infringed community law, and said it had raised concerns over French and Portuguese curbs. The commission's formal letter of protest to the UK government was sent at the end of December, and commission officials say they have not received a response. Under EU infringement proceedings, the commission would usually respond to a formal reply by issuing a 'reasoned opinion' on the case. Where cases cannot be resolved by diplomatic pressure, the commission may then proceed to take the government to the European Court.</p>

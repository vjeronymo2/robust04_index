			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW 'RECKLESS';  </P> <P> CRUEL YULE;  </P> <P> IF ALICE FELL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE, RACHEL IS A CAT BEING DRAGGED THROUGH A  KNOTHOLE.  </P> <P> Craig Lucas' black comedy "Reckless" has found the right director. Pope  Freeman's intense multilayered production at Santa Barbara City College's  Studio Theater is reminiscent of Antonin Artaud's "theater of cruelty." And it  corroborates Jerzy Grotowski's theory that the content of theater should be  "myths of the blood" rather than fictions bearing on social life and behavior.  </P> <P> The plot has Rachel, a sort of 20th-Century Alice in Wonderland, catapulted  through a series of events that ostensibly have to do with social life and  behavior -- but which may be fantasy, dream, memory or all three. Catapulted is  not a strong enough image; if Alice fell down the rabbit hole, Rachel is a cat  being dragged through a knothole.  </P> <P> It starts on Christmas Eve. Rachel is a normal, if slightly hysterical, wife in  her own home, happily stuffing Christmas stockings for her children, chatting  to her husband who suddenly informs her that he has taken out a contract on her  life.  </P> <P> Cut to a roadside telephone booth in the snow. Rachel, in robe and slippers,  gets a ride with a stranger, Lloyd, who takes her home to live with him and his  deaf paraplegic girlfriend (who isn't really deaf and who may be his mother).  Rachel changes her name, gets a job and life goes on.  </P> <P> On the next Christmas Eve, Rachel's husband arrives at the door with a bottle  of champagne. Within minutes, he and the paraplegic girlfriend (who is clad in  reindeer horns and a fake red nose) die a horrible death by poisoning.  </P> <P> Cut to Rachel and Lloyd (comatose and wearing a Santa Claus suit), who are back  in the car running away to a new life, where they will change their names  again. Lloyd will refuse to take off the Santa Claus suit or stop drinking  champagne until the next Christmas, when he dies too.  </P> <P> Rachel is on the road again, and we follow her through several more bizarre  Christmases, interspersed with scenes in which she tries to explain to various  obtuse psychiatrists what has happened.  </P> <P> The funny thing is that it could all be true. Freeman has directed the actors  to play it straight, as if it were true. This somehow creates a chilling effect  that activates a seldom used section of our funny bone: We find ourselves  laughing hysterically when Lloyd finally keels over in his Santa Claus suit;  then we feel embarrassed when we realize that we are laughing at his death. But  before we can buffer that, we are whisked off to the next incredible event.  Nothing comes to rest in itself. Every event calls forth a new horror clothed  in everyday dress.  </P> <P> The issues become life, death, sanity, recurrence, betrayal, recognition,  salvation . . . the list is unfinished but it leads further away from mere  social life and behavior.  </P> <P> The mise-en-scene deserves a paragraph -- the stage is a claustrophobic jumble  of all the scenery and props needed for 20 scenes. Thus as two characters sit  on the double bed, they are inches from the red automobile they will drive in  the next scene. Two hanging video screens record some of the action. The effect  is disturbing, disorienting, dreamlike and wholly effective. Douglas Tal  Sanders is scenic and lighting designer.  </P> <P> There are some good performances by Tom Rearden, Peter Alexander Flanders,  Rachel Marie Bargiel, Even Caston and Aaron Levin.  </P> <P> Lucas is an interesting playwright. His "Prelude to a Kiss" is on Broadway and  was nominated for a Tony Award last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> "Reckless" at the Studio Theater, Santa Barbara City College West Campus, 721  Cliff Drive. Plays at 8 p.m. today, Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $7, $5  students and seniors. Call 965-5935.  </P></p>

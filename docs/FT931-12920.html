			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Brazil's drug companies face anti-trust action THE Brazilian government is to use anti-trust laws against pharmaceutical companies in an effort to force down prices. Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, yesterday began legal processes against 40 pharmaceutical companies accused of 'abusive price increases' on 150 products. Mr Haddad claims that between March 1990 and November 1992 medicine prices increased by 613 per cent above inflation.

However, analysts fear that the attempt to control pharmaceutical prices might spread into other sectors as the government tries to contain inflation, now running at 28 per cent a month. President Itamar Franco began the so-called 'Medicine wars' in November by complaining that recent price rises, including for his own ulcer cream, had been excessive. Mr Franco said yesterday: 'These companies are more troublesome than children and when children are badly behaved we put them in play-pens.'</p>

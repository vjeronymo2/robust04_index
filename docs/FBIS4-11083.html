			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rafael Caldera said yesterday that  summoning a constituent assembly is not the solution to the  country's problems. He also urged the Congress to include the  impeachment referendum in the constitutional amendments to  create a "truly participative" democracy.    The president noted Colombia's positive experience in this  area, adding that it is possible to reform the system "without  breaking the constitutional thread."    Speaking during the presentation of the book Venezuela,  Crisis and Constitutional Reform at the Avila Hotel, he  said he was among those who think the congressional debate on  the reform should begin where the past legislature left off. In  any case, a bicameral commission should be named to promptly  update the study and to include new proposals. Caldera indicated  four kinds of referenda must be included in the reforms: a  referendum to impeach, a referendum to consult, a referendum to  approve, and a referendum to confirm. As an example, he said a  matter as important as the delimitation of marine and underwater  areas with Colombia must be submitted to a popular consultation,  "because a mere ratification by Congress would not be  sufficient."    Regarding federalism, Caldera explained he views it as the  adequate strengthening of administrative decentralization that  avoids "the destructive abuses" of centralism but does not  restore the vices of the old system of cronyism.    "I have been asked, not without malice, if now as president  I  continue supporting the possibility of revoking the mandate of  the head of state and any top official, and I have said I would  feel bad if it were not approved," he warned. The president said  he is confident that the congressional debates will have a  favorable outcome and that the stumbling blocks to a favorable  outcome will be removed.</p>

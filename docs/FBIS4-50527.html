			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China on Wednesday denied  as "groundless" reports that a law suit had been filed against  Wei Jingsheng, saying the country's most famous dissident was  under surveillance. "Wei Jingsheng is now under surveillance,"  foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly press  briefing. "He remains under surveillance, but to allege that a  law suit has been filed against him is totally groundless," said  Wu.    Although the English translation of Wu's remarks suggested  that no suit would be brought in the future, the spokesman  subsequently made clear he was talking only about "now" and  declined to elaborate.    The public security ministry issued a denial Wednesday of a  western press report that it had announced a formal decision to  try Wei and had handed the case over to the courts. The foreign  ministry also denied Wednesday separate reports that China was  preparing to file treason charges against the 44-year-old  dissident, who was released from prison in September just six  months short of a 15-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary"  crimes.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> VENTURA MAN BEATEN AT TELEPHONE BOOTH  </P> <P> A Ventura teen-ager using a telephone in a Camarillo shopping center Monday  night was assaulted by a group of young men who said he did not belong in town.  </P> <P> Anthony Medeiros, 18, was at a telephone booth at the Crossroads Shopping  Center in the 4000 block of Las Posas Road when a car containing about seven  young men approached him, said Sgt. Paul Oechsle of the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Some of the men asked Medeiros where he was from. When he answered that he was  from Ventura, they said, "You're in the wrong town," Oechsle said.  </P> <P> The young men got out of the car and beat Medeiros, Oechsle said. Medeiros  suffered cuts on his face and a two-inch cut on his wrist, Oechsle said.  Medeiros, who said he thought he saw a green-handled knife, was treated at  Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Oechsle said the attackers might be the same young men, believed to belong to a  gang, who approached Derick Williams, 19, of Oxnard as he walked in Dos Caminos  Park Sunday night. When Williams refused to fight, one member of the group  pulled out a knife and slashed Williams' wrist. He was treated at Pleasant  Valley Hospital, Oechsle said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

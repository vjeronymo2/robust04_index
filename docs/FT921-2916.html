			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Iran attacks Turkey over arms seizure IRAN has bitterly attacked Turkey after a state security court in Istanbul confiscated a ship carrying a cargo of arms on its way to an Iranian port. The 2,700 tonne Cypriot-registered Cape Maleas was stopped in the Bosphorus last October soon after it had left a Bulgarian port carrying anti-aircraft guns, rocket launchers and ammunition. The Turkish court said the vessel was 'shipping arms and ammunition in an organised manner' and was thus in contravention of an international treaty which requires all arms shipments through the Black Sea and Aegean to be notified to the Turkish authorities. Iran gave no such notification, claiming the Bosphorus counted as international waters. Iran had hoped that after the ship was seized its release would be assured both by diplomatic efforts and through the good relations enjoyed by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mr Turgut Ozal, his Turkish counterpart, who is associated with an Islamic constituency in Turkish politics. However, the state security court yesterday handed the freighter over to the Turkish armed forces. Although the 24-man crew was freed late last year, the court sentenced its captain to five years in prison. Iranian officials do not accept that a Turkish court can be politically independent and say they believe Mr Suleiman Demirel, the prime minister, and ultimately the US, are behind the decision. Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi, the Iranian prosecutor general, on Sunday cancelled a meeting with the Turkish ambassador and called the confiscation 'obscene and illegal'.</p>

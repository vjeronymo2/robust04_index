			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T RULE OUT IRAN ROLE, EXPERTS WARN  </P> <P> Although terrorists operating out of the Middle East most commonly use more  powerful explosives, the possibility that the pipe bomb attack on Sharon Rogers  was ordered by Iran cannot be dismissed, terrorism experts said Friday.  </P> <P> "I would expect the Iranians to come better equipped, but it's not unheard of  for terrorists to use pipe bombs," said John Ruggie, an international relations  professor at UC San Diego. "One example is the attack on U.S. servicemen in  Germany."  </P> <P> Ruggie said there has also been a trend among international terrorists to shift  away from dynamite or plastic explosives to avoid leaving clues that could lead  to their detection.  </P> <P> "The Iranians could be using something other than what they've used in the past  to make us think it wasn't them," said Ruggie, who has worked as a consultant  on terrorism and low-intensity conflict for the federal government and the  United Nations.  </P> <P> G. Allen Greb, associate director of UC San Diego's Institute on Global  Conflict and Cooperation, agreed. "It might be a group trying to cover its  tracks by using a cruder device than they would have preferred," he said.  </P> <P> Bruce Hoffman, a specialist on Middle East terrorism for the Rand Corp. in  Santa Monica, said he has interviewed terrorists trained in Lebanon who say  they are specifically ordered to use low-intensity explosives like pipe bombs  when hitting targets abroad.  </P> <P> "For one thing, these kinds of materials are easily obtained near the victim,  rather than having to be smuggled in," he said. And, he noted, the Iranians  have a history of trying to avoid detection for assassinations, as was the case  in 1980, when a black Muslim was hired to murder then-Shah Mohammed Reza  Pahlavi's former press attache in Washington.  </P> <P> Pipe bombs are also the weapon of choice for domestic radical groups that might  have sympathy with Iran, Hoffman said.  </P> <P> In the past, groups like Puerto Rican separatists, the Weather Underground,  anti-Castro Cubans, Armenian nationalists, Croatian liberationists and white  supremacists have used pipe bombs, he said.  </P> <P> "Remember that while a pipe bomb isn't terribly powerful, as bombs go, it can  be very sophisticated, placed near a gas tank for a secondary explosion and  using a timing device," Hoffman said.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, for example, a pipe bomb with a timer destroyed an  Encinitas restaurant in 1982. Pipe bombs with timers have been found in  automobiles. Just a few weeks ago, a pipe bomb was discovered strapped to a car  in El Cajon, set to explode when the driver used his right turn signal.  </P> <P> Easy and cheap to assemble, pipe bombs are the most common kind of illicit  explosive used in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says  pipe bomb devices constituted up to 60% of the 900-plus bombings in the United  States last year.  </P> <P> Pipe bombs were used in attempts in 1987 to destroy several San Diego County  abortion clinics. The bombs were to be detonated by candles acting as crude  timing devices.  </P> <P> Organized crime hit men are thought by authorities to favor heavier firepower  like dynamite in order to inflict greater property damage and take fewer  chances of the victim surviving. The fatal bombing of Arizona newsman Don  Bolles in 1976, done in retaliation for his probes of organized crime, was  accomplished by dynamite.  </P> <P> "Kids use pipe bombs, amateurs use pipe bombs, guys with grudges use pipe  bombs," said Sgt. Conrad Grayson of the San Diego Sheriff's Department arson  and explosives unit. "Professionals use dynamite or, if they can get it,  plastic explosives."  </P> <P> Plastic explosive is the most deadly but also the most difficult to obtain. It  is illegal for civilian use and must be stolen from the military or bought on  the black market.  </P> <P> "We've had young servicemen willing to sell some for dope," Grayson said.  </P> <P> A pipe bomb is simply a small length of pipe -- plastic or metal -- with either  black powder or smokeless powder, both commercially available, inside. The pipe  is capped on both ends, with a fuse or timer on one end.  </P> <P> Once detonated, the powder burns slowly before exploding. The explosion sends  hot shrapnel in all directions at three times the speed of a .38-caliber  bullet. A vacuum is created, and windows blow outward; people are knocked to  the ground.  </P> <P> Pipe bombs have been placed near jars of gasoline to create a secondary  explosion, Grayson said. Without that secondary explosion, however, pipe bombs  are not particularly destructive as bombs go, he said.  </P> <P> "I've talked to people who've just had their hands blown off by a pipe bomb but  are still talking," Grayson said. "If dynamite or plastic explosive goes off  near you, you just vaporize; the skin is ripped from your bones."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE FBI PROBE, MOORE APPEARS TO BE UNBEATABLE  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Gwen Moore remains the odds-on favorite to win reelection in her  Westside district, even though she has been a target of a political corruption  investigation by the FBI for at least the last 18 months.  </P> <P> Both Republicans and fellow Democrats said the Los Angeles lawmaker appears  unbeatable for a seventh term in November's election.  </P> <P> "She is unequivocally strong in her district," said Rod Wright, a Democratic  campaign consultant and activist. "I don't think anything would change unless  she was indicted and convicted of a felony." Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff  (R-Yucaipa), who oversees elections for the Assembly GOP Caucus, said there is  a shortage of "high-caliber" Republican candidates to run against Moore, partly  because of the huge registration edge Democrats hold in her 49th Assembly  District.  </P> <P> Even Eric Givens, a Republican who has plans to run against Moore for the third  time, acknowledges he faces an uphill fight. "It's one of the longest shots of  the season," he said.  </P> <P> Moore, 46, is one of five state elected officials who are targets of the  federal investigation. She carried two bills for a bogus shrimp company set up  by the FBI as part of an elaborate sting operation.  </P> <P> The probe became public in August, 1988, when Moore's Capitol office was raided  by federal agents. The dummy company had contributed money to her campaign  committee.  </P> <P> Moore has not been charged with any crime and has maintained her innocence.  When she testified last month as a defense witness at the political corruption  trial of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), she was told by U.S. Atty. David  Levi that she remains under active investigation.  </P> <P> The federal probe, which resulted in Montoya's indictment, has thrust the  low-profile lawmaker into the spotlight more than at any time in her career.  </P> <P> Politicians cite several reasons for her political strength.  </P> <P> They say that with a 4-1 Democratic registration bulge, Moore would have to be  charged with a crime before a serious, well-financed challenger would emerge to  oppose her.  </P> <P> Another factor in Moore's favor, they say, is that she is a well-liked lawmaker  whose career had not previously been touched by scandal. Moreover, she is  generally given high marks for being responsive to her constituents, from the  Crenshaw District to Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> As a result of that view on both sides of the political aisle, "people give her  the benefit of the doubt" about the federal investigation, said Rick Taylor, a  Democratic political consultant.  </P> <P> "I just don't think that she's a dishonest person at all," said Los Angeles  City Councilman Nate Holden, a one-time Democratic state senator. "That's my  feeling. If anything went wrong, it's not because she knew it."  </P> <P> After testifying at Montoya's trial, Moore told reporters: "I've done nothing  wrong. I've tried to cooperate with every legitimate investigation. I have  nothing to hide." Montoya faces 10 counts of extortion, racketeering and  money-laundering.  </P> <P> In addition to Montoya and Moore, two other lawmakers -- Republican Assemblymen  Frank Hill of Whittier and Pat Nolan of Glendale -- are also targets of the  investigation. Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Cypress), now a member of the  State Board of Equalization, is also a target of the federal probe.  </P> <P> The investigation shadowed Moore's reelection efforts in 1988, but she  overwhelmingly defeated Givens, a contractor.  </P> <P> During the election, Givens charged that Moore had been too busy representing  "phony businesses" to pay serious attention to the district, and he called for  her to step down.  </P> <P> But Moore captured 76.7% of the vote in the district that includes Leimert  Park, Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Culver City, Ladera Heights, Cheviot Hills,  Playa del Rey, Marina del Rey and parts of Westchester and Palms.  </P> <P> Moore is not the first California lawmaker to campaign with the cloud of a  federal investigation hanging over her head. In 1986, Assemblyman Mike Roos  (D-Los Angeles) won reelection, even though his ties to fireworks magnate W.  Patrick Moriarty were being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. In  1987, federal prosecutors decided not to try Roos in connection with a  profitable investment arranged by Moriarty.  </P> <P> Likewise, the current investigation does not appear to have had a significant  impact on Assemblyman Hill's political clout. Hill is given a good chance of  winning a special state Senate election scheduled for Tuesday. "I think he has  the respect of everyone up here," said Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), the Senate  minority leader. "For those of us who felt free to endorse him, we are  embracing the idea that he's innocent until proven guilty."  </P> <P> Moore's supporters take a similar stance about the assemblywoman.  </P> <P> Kerman Maddox, a former assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, asserted  that if anyone runs against Moore and "uses the sting, it's an exercise in  futility. It will mean nothing, simply because she has a good reputation. . . .  People seem to think she got caught up in this because of bad staff work."  </P> <P> At Montoya's trial, Moore testified that she agreed to carry the legislation  because officials from the dummy company said it would create 35 to 40 jobs,  most of them for minorities and "low-entry level people."  </P> <P> Moore also testified that in 1986 she returned one $5,000 contribution from  federal undercover agents because it appeared to be a bribe. But she told  reporters she kept $2,000 given her in 1986 because the undercover operatives  attended one of her fund-raisers. "They bought tickets, they came to my  fund-raiser. They ate my food and so I kept the money," Moore said.  </P> <P> Tyrone Netters, then a Moore aide, helped steer two Moore bills to benefit the  dummy company through the Legislature. The day after the Legislature gave final  approval in 1988 to one of the bills, Netters, an unsuccessful candidate for a  local utility board, reported receiving a $2,000 contribution to his campaign  from the dummy company.  </P> <P> William Julian, a spokesman for the assemblywoman, said Moore does not want to  elaborate at this time on her views about the case.  </P> <P> But Moore has voiced optimism about her reelection effort, saying that her  constituents have been supportive of her during the investigation. "I am  definitely running," Moore said.  </P> <P> Moore has lived in the area around her district since she was 2 years old. A  former member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees, she was  first elected to the Assembly in 1978. The contest drew several other black  candidates and divided loyalties in the black community. Moore had support from  the Democratic political organization of Los Angeles Reps. Howard L. Berman  (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Moore is regarded as a low-profile liberal who is loyal to Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) but is not part of his inner circle. A year ago,  in a move seen as a vote of confidence, Brown named Moore as the Democratic  whip to help shepherd legislation for Assembly Democrats.  </P> <P> As chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, Moore wields  clout in overseeing telephone and other utility rates. One of her best-known  measures was a 1984 law to ensure that home telephone service remained  affordable for the poor.  </P> <P> Speaker Brown this week called Moore "one of the best, if not the best" chairs  of an Assembly committee. Brown said that until he named her to head the  committee in 1983, he "never knew she had the talent. . . . This woman is  awesome" in terms of knowing about utilities and negotiating compromises on  legislation.  </P> <P> But others question the way her office has performed, especially in the way  bills for the dummy shrimp company were handled.  </P> <P> Citing the role of Moore's aide, Netters, in the legislation, another  Democratic colleague, who asked not to be identified, said: "I still feel she  was duped by staff. . . . By God, it just looks to me that she was a victim. .  . . "  </P> <P> Robert Jacobson, who left Moore's staff last year, acknowledged that the  legislation on behalf of the dummy shrimp company "simply wasn't just that big  a deal" for Moore's office.  </P> <P> "I don't think I have poor staff," Moore said. "We run as tight a ship as  anyone. What happened could happen to anyone in the Legislature. It is not a  reflection of poor staff."  </P> <P> Jacobson said that partly because of the FBI investigation, Moore streamlined  her office operation. "For one thing," he said, "we became much better  organized in the office, kept better track of documentation . . . to avoid  falling in this trap again."  </P> <P> A Democratic legislative staffer, who asked not to be identified, said that in  the past Moore had a reputation for introducing legislation "without paying a  whole lot of attention to the bills," especially these not dealing with the  regulation of utilities. Now, he said, "she's probably more prudent about bills  she carries."  </P> <P> Even before Moore testified at Montoya's trial, Assemblywoman Sally Tanner  (D-Baldwin Park) said "it's been pretty hard" for Moore to constantly read  "negative things" about herself.  </P> <P> Tanner, Moore's seatmate on the Assembly floor, acknowledged that the  investigation has been "agonizing for her. It's been a very traumatic thing for  her." But Tanner maintained that it has not impacted Moore's performance. "She  hasn't let it affect her at all," she said.  </P> <P> Until the federal investigation was disclosed, Moore was mentioned in  Sacramento as possible successor to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) if he  decided to run for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors or some other  office. Other lawmakers say it is unclear whether the investigation will pose a  roadblock if Moore ever seeks higher office.  </P> <P> So far, the investigation has not changed the way Republican strategists view  the odds on Moore's winning reelection.  </P> <P> "The district is very solidly Democratic," said Republican Assemblyman  Woodruff. "I think it would be hard to convince the voters of that area that  she hasn't been voting . . . the party line."  </P> <P> Woodruff maintained that voters in the 49th District almost always vote  Democratic. "If Ronald Reagan or George Bush or George Deukmejian cannot carry  Gwen Moore's district," Woodruff said, it would be difficult for an unknown GOP  candidate to beat Moore.  </P> <P> Without commenting on the FBI investigation of Moore, Assemblyman Tom  McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) complained that an Assembly member "could be  convicted of an ax murder three days before the election and still win 55% of  the vote."  </P> <P> Despite her popularity, some elected officials question whether Moore has done  enough for their cities.  </P> <P> "We don't see a lot that she does particularly for Culver City," said Culver  City Mayor Jozelle Smith, who said she is still upset that in April, 1988,  Moore mounted a last-minute mail and telephone campaign on behalf of three  council candidates. "I was angry about the interference . . . in our  elections," Smith said.  </P> <P> But Ronni Cooper, president of the Ladera Heights Civic Assn., said Moore is  extremely responsive to her group's needs. She cited Moore's help about a year  ago in blocking construction of a Southern California Rapid Transit District  bus yard in her community.  </P> <P> "I don't think her credibility has been hurt in our community" by the FBI  investigation, Cooper said. "Every time we have needed her help . . . she has  been there for us."  </P></p>

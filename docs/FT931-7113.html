			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Christopher in push to restart Mideast talks MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday he was ready to invite Arab and Israeli delegations to resume stalled Middle East peace talks in April, adding that his tour of the region made him 'confident enough' that all parties were willing to return to the negotiations. Mr Christopher's statement, made in Geneva after his departure yesterday from Jerusalem, came as senior Palestinian leaders said a US proposal to break the deadlock over 396 Palestinian deportees held the 'elements to a solution' to the issue which has blocked the resumption of talks. There is no indication yet whether the American proposals are acceptable to the Israeli government which prior to Mr Christopher's visit had appeared to rule out any further concessions on the deportees. The revival of full bilateral peace talks by April would be deemed a successful conclusion to a tour which Mr Christopher and his aides billed in advance as principally a chance for the new secretary of state to meet the main players and listen to the issues. But in spite of continued US insistence that Mr Christopher carried no fresh proposals to break the deadlock which has encased the talks since Israel's deportation in mid-December of alleged activists belonging to the Hamas Islamic movement, American diplomats have been quietly packaging a possible compromise. Palestine Liberation Organisation officials in Tunis said yesterday that the US had proposed that Israel should accelerate the repatriation of the deportees and issue assurances that it would not resort to further expulsions in future. Israel has previously stood by an earlier offer, made in consultation with the US, to repatriate 101 deportees immediately, and the rest within a year. Palestinian delegates rejected the offer, calling for Israel to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 799, which demands the return of all 396 immediately. While the Palestinian delegation to the talks has not yet committed themselves to returning to the table, they issued a statement from Jerusalem yesterday saying that discussions on the US proposal were continuing and that they hoped to 'solve outstanding issues in the near future.' Senior Palestinian officials in Cairo said talks on the proposal would continue quietly through 'diplomatic channels' and that no formal acceptance of a compromise offer on the deportees was likely before Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, travels to Washington to meet President Clinton next month.</p>

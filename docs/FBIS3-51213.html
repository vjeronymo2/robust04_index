			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Period, Same Paragraph" newscast] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Technical University Rector Jose Mauricio  Lausel released the result of the fifth university poll carried  out in December.    One of the main questions was: What political leader do you  prefer? Here were the results: Armando Calderon Sol, 40.2  percent; Ruben Zamora, 22.2 percent; and Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena,  14.1 percent. According to this poll, Dr. Chavez Mena suffered a  drop.    We spoke directly and exclusively with Dr. Fidel Chavez  Mena,  presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]  this morning. Chavez Mena raised doubts about the Technical  University poll's credibility because the students filled out  the questionnaires themselves, which, in his opinion, could  cloud the poll results.    Dr. Chavez Mena says PDC-sponsored polls show both he and  his  party in second place. He called for public opinion to not be  manipulated with polls like the university's.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] DPR [House of Representatives] criticizes the  government's decision to let foreign investors enter the local  mass media business as it violates the existing press law (UU  No. 21/1984), hampering national unity and the Pancasila state  ideology.    The government issued the Regulation Number 20/1994 on  Tuesday allowing foreign investors to have more than 50 percent  shares in various businesses, including local mass media. On  the other hand, foreign investors and executives are allowed to  enter the local mass media.    Chairperson of the Commission I [in charge of foreign  affairs, defense, security, and information] Aisyah Amini of the  United Development Party (PPP) urged government to review its  decision and reminded that mass media is still strategic in the  national development.    She said that the foreign investment on mass media will  hamper national unity and against the press law. National press  in the developing countries has strategic role like informing  public opinion and channelling people's aspiration. She  suspected that foreign investors will not merely cope with  commercial matters but also with political [ones], and this will  influence the national ideology. "It ruins national press  idealism," she added.    MP Zamhari of the Golkar [Functional Group] group said that  government should reconsider the decision and reminded that this  regulation is against the press law. He said that press law  should not be "defeated" by such government's regulation and any  policy must be based on constitutional ground. Any deviation  from this should be handled in the frame of constitution, he  said.    "Don't let ambition to attract foreign investment hamper our  national unity," he stressed.    Any expansion of investment must not endanger our ideology,  politics, and sociocultural systems, the MP added seriously.    Aminullah Ibrahim of the Armed Forces Group expressed his  concern over the regulation. He said there is no reason to  implement the policy and he reminded that foreign investments in  mass media will surrender our sensitive communication and  information system to the foreigners. "They can suppress us to  accept their ideas, and this is dangerous," he said.    "Don't let foreign powers intervening our strategic  sectors,"  Aminullah added.    MP Sabam Sirait of the Indonesian Democratic Party Group in  the House told reporters here on Friday that government's  decision is premature and it crushes Law Number 21/1984 on the  national press. In the other word, Sabam added further, the  Regulation Number 20/1994 is invalid.</p>

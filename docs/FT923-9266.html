			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Questions on Belling pension fund money TWO directors at Belling, the cooker manufacturer which went into receivership in May, have come under scrutiny for their actions in relation to the company's pension fund. The Law Debenture Trust, which was appointed by Belling's receivers to act as independent trustees to the pension fund, is considering legal action over investments made by the scheme and a Pounds 2.1m shortfall in the fund. In December last year, just five months before the company went into receivership, the pension fund paid Pounds 5.5m to buy Compound Sections, a Belling subsidiary. The pension fund was controlled by two Belling directors at the time. The Law Debenture Trust is questioning whether this was an appropriate investment. The trust has also taken advice on action to recover Pounds 2.1m borrowed from the fund. The trust is considering suits against several possible defendants, including Mr CJ Deacon, a solicitor in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stafford-shire. It is understood he undertook to hold the Pounds 2.1m pending a Dollars 50m loan to Belling. The loan was arranged last summer through Global Prospect Funding, a client of Mr Deacon. Belling agreed to pay a year's interest, equivalent to Pounds 2.1m, before receiving the capital. Belling borrowed the money from the fund. In April an Isle of Man registered company, Finchley Investments, provided security for the interest payment when the loan was not forthcoming. The security was a CDollars 1.75m stake in the Vancouver natural resources company, Western &amp; Pacific. The shares are now estimated to be worth a fraction of that. Mr Deacon said he was unaware the trust was considering action. He said the money would be repaid 'literally any time'. He denied he signed a receipt on receiving the Pounds 2.1m, promising to hold the money until Global paid the cash. According to an agreement in April, he said, repayment was not yet due.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Talks to resume soon over HK airport TALKS ARE to resume between Britain and China soon - possibly next week - in a final attempt to break the deadlock over Hong Kong's plans to construct a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport, which would be opened soon after the colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. There is no sign of any new initiative from either side, but both countries favour a resumption. If the talks fail it is likely Hong Kong businessmen will quickly submit a private sector-led plan as a catalyst to save the project, possibly by creating a consortium that could include the Hong Kong and Chinese governments. This might enable the two governments to move away from entrenched positions. Several of the colony's top business names - including Mr Li Ka-shing and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - are holding private talks. But no plan will be proposed unless there is deadlock at a diplomatic level. Mr Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, held discussions in Peking 10 days ago with senior officials about plans he has been promoting for five years. This infuriated the Hong Kong government, which has secured pledges from Mr Wu and other local businessmen that they will not make further moves for the time being.</p>

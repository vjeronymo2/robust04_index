			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Stead to take over at NCR MR JERRE Stead, a fast-rising star at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, is to take over as chairman and chief executive of NCR, AT&amp;T's computer subsidiary, from Mr Gilbert Williamson, who is unexpectedly retiring. Mr Williamson, who has been with NCR for 30 years, became chairman after AT&amp;T acquired NCR in a hostile Dollars 7.4bn 1991 takeover. He oversaw the successful integration into NCR of AT&amp;T's much weaker computer business. He will only be 56 next month, but both NCR and AT&amp;T claimed yesterday that the retirement from May 1 to pursue 'personal interests' was his initiative and had not involved pressure from Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman. Mr Allen expressed 'deep gratitude' for Mr Williamson's handling of the integration. However, some analysts speculated that Mr Williamson might not have moved sufficiently quickly for AT&amp;T's liking to raise NCR's computer industry profile in the 18 months since the merger. Mr Stead, 50, joined AT&amp;T in September 1991 from Square D, an electrical components company acquired by France's Groupe Schneider. He was put in charge of AT&amp;T's loss-making business communications systems operation, which makes office telephone equipment, and put it into the black. Mr Stead will be succeeded at business communications systems by 39-year-old Ms Patricia Russo, currently vice- president national sales and services for the unit. The acquisition of NCR was a gamble by Mr Allen that the rapid convergence of the computer and telecommunications industries would benefit companies with strong positions in both sectors. So far, the merger has gone more smoothly than many on Wall Street had predicted, but NCR has yet to prove that it is capable of sustained market-share growth.</p>

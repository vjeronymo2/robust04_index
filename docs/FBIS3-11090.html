"But first  the 32-year-old economic embargo against our country must be  lifted. It has cost us $40 billion in damage, goes against  international law, and has been condemned throughout the world.  With such an embargo, how could it be possible for us to talk  about compensation for U.S. possessions (which were nationalized  after the 1959 revolution, ed.)?"    Washington recently lifted the economic embargo against  Vietnam without imposing political preconditions. Deputy  Minister Allende does not have much hope that this will also  happen to Cuba in the near future.    "It is a good, rational thing that the embargo against  Vietnam was lifted," she says. "But Cuba is a special case for  U.S. Governments. Their policy toward us goes beyond pure  rationality. Cuba is something like an obsession. Of course,  one can also interpret the maintenance of the embargo against  Cuba as a warning to the rest of Latin America," a warning that  a high price is paid for any reduction in U.S. influence on the  continent.    "The Americans," Allende sighs, "make demands on us about  human rights and democracy. But they are just excuses. They do  not want Cuba to follow an independent course." These demands  are largely linked to domestic U.S. politics, she says. There  are more than 1 million Cubans living in the United States, and  they are U.S. citizens and voters who are hostile to the Castro  government. Wealthy exiles finance the election campaigns of  U.S. politicians like Torricelli, who ensured that the Cuban  embargo was further tightened at the end of 1992.    "Not all of them are hysterics who want to further  strengthen  the embargo," according to Allende. "Others do not want that at  all. In April, we will talk with those exiles who accept that  Cuba makes its decisions itself." The distinction between  "fanatics" and other Cubans in the United States is a new  element in Havana's attitude. Until recently all exiles were  regarded as "gusanos" (worms) and defectors who had betrayed  their country.    The deputy prime minister speaks passionately in support of  the democratization carried out by Cuba within the one-party  system. "What is democracy?" she asks. "Does it only exist in  one form, such as the one applied in the United States? For me,  it still means government by the people. In Cuba the  people participate in the government. Where else are planned  economic measures subjected to popular consultation in the  workplace?" Allende refers to the planned government cutbacks,  the introduction of a progressive income tax, and other  far-reaching changes, which after an initial debate in  parliament, are being discussed in the factories under the  leadership of the trade unions.    The minister defends last year's general elections. "It was  the people who chose the candidates for the election lists," she  says. "Directly and by secret voting." She agrees with  parliamentary Chairman Ricardo Alarcon. He said proudly that  "the political map of the world would look very different if  everywhere, like in Cuba, the people selected the candidates,  rather than the political machines greased by the financial  powers."    Havana feels that Washington, with regard to Cuba, limits  the  concept of "human rights" to individual and political rights,  while discounting economic and social rights. "There are human  rights in Cuba, which are not even discussed in other parts of  the world," Allende says, referring to free education and health  care and the absence of hunger and poverty. "In addition,  Washington violates human rights itself," she says. "U.S.  companies are not allowed to trade with us and U.S. tourists are  not allowed to go to Cuba."    Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a columnist for the Trabajadores trade  union newspaper and member of the Communist Party's Central  Committee, also calls the U.S arguments for the embargo excuses.  "The original justifications given for the embargo were that  Cuba was a danger to U.S. security, that it encouraged  subversion in Latin America, that it was the ally of the Soviet  Union, that it intervened in Angola. With the passing of time  they could no longer use these arguments. Now human rights and  democracy have once again come to the forefront in their  arguments."    Nicanor Leon says: "But when Washington had to explain to  the  United Nations why it supported the embargo, it dropped all  these arguments and maintained only the demand for compensation  for nationalized U.S. interests in Cuba." Only the United  States is still making problems about the nationalization; in  other countries the problem has been cleared up, according to  him. And the real reason for the embargo? "The United States  has not forgiven Cuba for shaking off its neocolonial status in  1959 in a traditional sphere of U.S. influence."    Leon points out that to a large degree Cuba "is a theme of  domestic politics in the United States. Nearly 1 million Cubans  live in Florida, the state with the fourth biggest electorate in  the United States. The U.S.'s Cuba policy is decided in Miami.  Up to now it was Jorge Mas Canosa who decided this policy."    Mas Canosa, a businessman originally from Cuba, is  president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a  right-wing, extreme anti-Castro organization. He was the  architect of the tightening of the U.S.'s embargo on Cuba during  the 1992 presidential election campaign. "That is the core of  the problem," says Leon. "The U.S. policy toward Cuba is  hostage to Cubans in Miami." Leon does not say "the" Cubans in  Miami: he, too, makes a distinction between Cuban exiles who  want to talk to Castro and the "fanatics" around Mas Canosa.    How are things in Cuba now? "The lifting of the embargo  would make it easier to solve our internal problems," says Leon,  "simply because it would be cheaper to import a range of  products."  <H5>  Investments </H5>   Deputy Minister Allende identifies two priorities: "We must  seek new markets, and we must encourage foreign investments, for  without these investments we cannot get production up to an  adequate level." Cuba has rolled out the red carpet for foreign  investors. They can have full ownership of companies and  repatriate profits.    Recently Cuba has been inundated with businessmen eagerly  looking for opportunities. Many made investments, but others  wonder how they can repatriate profits if they cannot convert  their money into foreign currency. Cuba is considering making  the peso convertible, but is still hesitating because that would  entail a large devaluation.    "For us,two principles cannot be negotiated," says  Allende,"and those are our independence and sovereignty; and the  benefits of the revolution, a social security system like that  on which Europe prides itself. And the fundamental sectors of  the economy will not be considered for privatization."</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: HOT CEREALS CAN HURRY MORNINGS  </P> <P> Because many hot cereals -- especially the instant varieties -- cook quickly on  top of the stove, you may wonder if there is any reason to microwave them.  </P> <P> The answer is yes. For starters, there's little danger of a cereal lumping or  scorching in a microwave oven. Second, you needn't stir it nonstop or resort to  the double boiler to keep it smooth and creamy.  </P> <P> Best of all, you save messy pot-scrubbing because cereals can be microwaved  right in their serving bowls. It's such a snap that the children may want to  fix their own breakfasts before they dash off to school.  </P> <P> Oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat, cream of rice, even the Southerner's choice,  grits, are cooked much the same way in the microwave. The only variable is the  ratio of cereal to liquid. For best results, however, follow these guidelines:  </P> <P>  -- To prevent boil-overs, always use a bowl or casserole twice the volume of  the ingredients that are placed in it. For each individual serving, use a deep  1-pint bowl.  </P> <P>  -- To speed cooking, use hot tap water instead of cold.  </P> <P>  -- Cover the cereal, if you like. A cover keeps the cereal uniformly creamy  (no surface drying) but also increases the risk of boil-overs.  </P> <P>  -- If, at the end of the suggested cooking time, a cereal tests -- and tastes  -- done but seems soupy, microwave in 15-second increments (for one serving)  and in one-minute increments (for four-servings) until the mixture thickens  properly. If, on the other hand, the cereal cooks dry before it's done, add a  little hot water and microwave as directed for thickening the mixture.  </P> <P>  -- Always use potholders. Cereal bowls and casseroles get blistering hot in a  microwave oven.  </P> <P>  -- Always let cooked cereals cool slightly before tasting lest you scald your  tongue.  </P> <P> BASIC MICROWAVED CEREAL  </P> <P> 1/3 cup old-fashioned oats or 3 tablespoons grits or 2 tablespoons farina,  cream of wheat or cream of rice  </P> <P> 2/3 cup hot water  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon salt, optional  </P> <P> Combine cereal, water and salt in microwave-safe 1-pint bowl. Microwave  (covered, if desired) on HIGH (100% power), stirring at half time, until all  liquid is absorbed and cereal thickens. Allow 1 3/4 to 2 minutes for farina,  cream of wheat or rice, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes for grits and 3 1/2 to 4 minutes for  oats.  </P> <P> Stir cereal again. Cool 30 seconds on heat-resistant surface. Makes 1 serving.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P> <P> Variations:  </P> <P> For 2 servings: Microwave single portions in 2 (1-pint) bowls, arranged  side-by-side on microwave oven floor, 5 1/2 to 6 minutes.  </P> <P> For 4 servings: Microwave single portions in 4 (1-pint) bowls, placing 1-inch  apart and staggering 2 on oven shelf, 9 to 10 minutes.  </P> <P>  SOME QUICK WAYS TO IMPROVE COOKED CEREALS  </P> <P>  Add any of following to each portion of cooked cereal (any kind), then cool  briefly as recipe directs:  </P> <P>  -- 1 to 2 teaspoons light brown or maple sugar plus sprinkling of ground  cinnamon, nutmeg, mace or allspice.  </P> <P>  -- 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons seedless raisins, diced dates, prunes, dried figs,  apples, peaches or apricots.  </P> <P>  -- 1 tablespoon honey and/or wheat germ.  </P> <P>  OR, JUST BEFORE SERVING  </P> <P>  Top oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat or cream of rice with jam, jelly or  preserves, any sliced or diced fresh fruit or whole ripe berries. Dollop of  sour cream adds finishing touch.  </P> <P>  FOR GRITS ONLY  </P> <P>  Cook grits in chicken or beef broth instead of water, then serve in place of  potatoes.  </P></p>

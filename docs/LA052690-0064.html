			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MELLOW ECLECTICISM FROM GUITARIST HIRAM BULLOCK  </P> <P> Hiram Bullock was feeling mellow. He made that clear from the start of his  opening set Thursday night at Santa Monica's At My Place.  </P> <P> A veteran of the David Sanborn and Gil Evans orchestras, as well as the David  Letterman show house band, the guitarist moved easily across most of the  current musical categories -- from funk and rock to jazz and soul. The result  was eclecticism of the first order, some of it tongue in cheek, some of it  deadly serious, and virtually all of it mellow.  </P> <P> Among the humorous highlights were Bullock's laid-back vocalizing on "A Little  Bit" and "Groovy, Groovy" (with a rhythmic drive that was true to its name),  and bassist Steve Logan's raucous romp through "Funky Chicken." But a ballad,  "Angelina," was less appealing; its smooth-limned melodic line didn't seem to  fit into Bullock's still modest interpretive vocal range.  </P> <P> He was much better when he got down to some serious guitar playing on the final  few numbers -- notably an unidentified fusion piece and two extended  improvisations on "Dear Prudence" and "Ode to Billie Joe." Bullock's tendency  to play to the crowd did not obscure his energetic technique, colorful melodies  and rich assortment of passing harmonies.  </P> <P> Keyboardist Scott Brown and drummer Steve Wolf spent most of their time  supporting the musical interactivity between Bullock and Logan. But given some  open space toward the close of the set, they responded like world-class  sprinters at the crack of the starter's gun.  </P> <P> Brown's solo was a virtual nonstop, right-hand tour de force, snapping out his  lines at a breathtakingly rapid pace. Wolf, who had appeared somewhat chaotic  earlier in the evening, brought everything together with a collection of  percussive sounds -- both live and sampled -- fascinating enough to offset the  curse of the set-ending drum solo.  </P> <P> "Mellow" is what Bullock started with, and "mellow" is what seasoned most of  his performance. But "mellow" wouldn't have worked without the high-voltage  intensity that is an intrinsic part of all his music. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

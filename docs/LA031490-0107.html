			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Brazil Closes Banks for Rest of Week: Brazil's Central Bank, the equivalent of  the U.S. Federal Reserve, closed the nation's banks for the remainder of the  week in anticipation of a series of emergency economic measures to be announced  by President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello. Central Bank spokesman Pedro  Kleinberg said the three-day bank holiday was ordered at the request of Zelia  Cardoso de Mello, the nation's new economic minister, who is to take office  with the new president on Thursday. The move took many locals and economists by  surprise because only a day earlier Cardoso de Mello had said, "A bank holiday  is absolutely not necessary."  </P></p>

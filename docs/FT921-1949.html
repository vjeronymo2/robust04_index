			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Markets: Invest in haste repent at leisure - The Election and You / Serious Money THERE WAS some really good news this week for those who live off their savings. Labour has abandoned its plans to introduce a 9 per cent investment income surcharge. Admittedly, the surcharge would have applied only to incomes over Pounds 3,000 and those over pensionable age would have been exempt. But it would have been an unfair tax. As readers know only too well, in most cases such income is not 'unearned' at all, but the fruits of many years of hard work. A decision to save is merely a decision to postpone consumption to a later date. Interest income is, in large part, compensation for the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of the money saved. Take a saver earning, say, 10 per cent in the building society. Income tax already takes 25 or 40 per cent of that return. If inflation stays at around 4 per cent this year, the 'real' return for savers will be just 3.5 per cent for basic rate taxpayers and 2 per cent for those on the higher rate. Labour's surcharge would have reduced that real return by a quarter and a half respectively. The people who would have been most hurt by this tax were those who had retired early and were living off a combination of occupational pension and savings income. In the absence of the surcharge, savers can afford to view a Labour government with equanimity. Indeed, those who are above state retirement age will enjoy a modest benefit, in the form of Pounds 5 and Pounds 8 per week increases for single and married pensioners. Only those whose savings income is over Pounds 40,000 (more for married couples and those over 65) will be hit by the new 50 per cent tax band. That will be a minority of savers. For those FT readers who fall into the category, there are a number of tax shelters (Tessas, national savings, etc) which may ease the burden. Of course, many would argue that a Labour government will mean higher inflation, the enemy of savers. But given Labour's commitment to sterling's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, inflation might not be the same problem as it used to be. Some economists are predicting higher interest rates under a Labour government, because the foreign exchange markets will test John Smith's determination to defend the pound. That would be good news for savers. Those who are trying to build up their savings will be rather less cheerful this week, at least if their salary is above Pounds 405 per week. A Labour government would impose an extra 9 per cent bill for national insurance on such people, and those with taxable incomes over Pounds 36,375 will also be hit by the new 50 per cent band. These changes will mean quite dramatic falls in post-tax salaries for some high earners. A married man on Pounds 100,000 would see his post-tax income fall by over 20 per cent compared with 1991-92 (or around Pounds 13,000 a year); a single man on Pounds 50,000 would see a fall in his net income of almost 8 per cent. Is this tax burden excessive? It is worth remembering that during the years 1979-88 - the time of the Thatcher 'economic miracle' - the top rate of tax was 60 per cent. (By-the-by, since the tax burden was lifted by Nigel Lawson, and 'incentives for entrepreneurs' created, economic performance seems to have gone downhill. That may, of course, be coincidence.) We asked Price Waterhouse to compare the tax burden under a Labour government in 1992-93, with that in the year 1987-88. before the Lawson tax-cutting Budget. The differences are less than you might suppose. Tax and national insurance will take 49 per cent of the income of a married man on Pounds 100,000 under Labour; in 1987-88, someone on Pounds 68,200 (the inflation-adjusted equivalent) would have paid 46 per cent. For someone on Pounds 40,000, the equivalent figures are 34 per cent and 31.5 per cent. People on Pounds 25,000 will actually face a lower tax burden under Labour (27.5 per cent of their income), then those on an inflation-adjusted income of Pounds 17,000 did in 1987-88 (29 per cent). So a Labour government would essentially move us back to a slightly more redistributive version of the pre-1988 tax system. That may not sound so bad in theory. In practice, however, the difficulties will arise from the fact that the changes are being imposed all at once. This could have really horrific effects on individuals, particularly those with large mortgages, as David Barchard reports on page IV. Even those who have been prudent will have a lot less money to put aside for saving and they may be forced to run down previous investments to maintain their standard of living. There may be knock-on effects as people retreat from long-term savings commitments, and suffer the penalties. So those who will be hit by Labour's taxes need to plan very carefully. How much of your take-home pay do you save at the moment? Will you be able to continue to save if your take-home pay falls by 10 per cent under Labour? If not, then beware of taking on further savings commitments in a pre-election rush. The greatest losers in the savings industry are those who stop long-term policies early on.</p>

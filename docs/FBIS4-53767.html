			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 20 (ANTARA) -- The Dutch Embassy stated  here on Friday that its exporters had shipped containers of  waste to Indonesia, some of them hazardous. It said its  exporters had shipped 48 out of the 70 waste checked containers  through the port in Rotterdam. Six of the 48 containers were  found containing dangerous and toxic wastes while the others  solid plastic wastes probably from households and industries.  It denied that its exporters had shipped 14 containers to  Indonesia through several ports in the Netherlands.    Based on an existing Dutch act some of the wastes manifested  no signs of danger and therefore checks had only been made upon  samples taken from the outer part of the containers. It also  said the wastes had been solidified into bales so that their  recycling process would depend much on importers' technical  expertise.    An expert team from the Netherlands had been in Indonesia  from May 2 to 19 to meet the importers and check plastic  recycling methods in the country. This team would report the  results of their examination to the Dutch Ministry of  Environment for legal scrutiny to avoid any posible recurrance  in the future.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Taxing property by value Sir, I wonder why the government decided to apply bands of taxation according to value of property. The added burden placed upon those living in the south-east is self evident and any system related to values will, by definition, involve the expense of valuation. A far more equitable refinement of the system would have been to create banding by property type, eg terraced house with two bedrooms, moving up to terraced house with three bedrooms; semi-detached house with three bedrooms and so on. The implication seems to be that those in the south-east pay more for their homes because they can afford to, whereas in reality I wonder whether expendable income, having been saddled with the high cost of a house in the south east, is any higher than that of the north. I am no expert in these matters but I very much doubt whether southerners have the expendable income of those in the north.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 9  June.    Private mining increased 41 percent in 1993, the highest  growth in the past 50 years. This increase was prompted mainly  by the expansion project implemented by the Inti Raymi Company,  which invested $150 million to improve gold production. The  Mining Association reported that gold registered a record  production of 6.56 metric tons in 1993. Silver production  increased 38 percent, and lead 14 percent. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO  in Spanish 28 May 94 National Section p 1)    Central Bank statistics show that gold exports generated 21  percent of the total value of mining exports in 1993, when they  amounted to $76.3 million. They represented only 2 percent of  mining exports in 1985, 11 percent in 1989, and 21 percent in  1993. Exports went from $21.9 million in 1992 to $76.3 million  in 1993. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 28 May 94 National  Section p 2)    The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that  exports  amounted to $216 million in the first quarter of 1994, an  increase of 33.7 percent; imports totalled $253 million, a drop  of 1.6 percent. Mining increased 18 percent, hydrocarbons 10.5  percent, and nontraditional exports 72 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON  in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p B2)    Integration Under Secretary Victor Rico on 30 May reported  that Bolivian exports to Chile dropped "dramatically" from $30  million to $12 million in the past three years. The commercial  deficit, which totals $100 million, is caused by the  restrictions imposed by Chile on some Bolivian products; by the  export of certain products to other markets; and by the poor  diversification of products offered by Bolivian exporters in the  past few years. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p  A8)    The Chamber of Exporters reported that Santa Cruz's exports  totalled 73,103 metric tons at a value of $29.305 million in the  first quarter of 1994, almost double the figure registered in  the same period in 1993. This shows that the volume of exports  increased by 75 percent, and its value by 98 percent. Peru is  Santa Cruz' main market with $12.4 million, Argentina with $5.1  million, and Colombia with $4.9 million. (La Paz PRESENCIA in  Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 4)    On 31 May the INE reported that economic activity increased  4.3 percent in the year's first four months as compared with the  same period in 1993. Hydrocarbons increased 11 percent; oil and  gas production 19.8 percent and 10.7 percent respectively;  mining 9.6 percent; manufacturing production 4.4 percent;  services 7.4 percent; and energy 8.7 percent. (La Paz PRESENCIA  in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 1)    The National Chamber of Industries reported that industry  continues to decline. A survey on industrial performance  results in the fourth quarter of 1993 showed that sales dropped  6.0 percent; financing 3.7 percent; and production 0.4 percent.  Industry, however, accounted for 16 percent of GDP despite the  unfavorable results. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 20)    The INE reported that the inflation rate was 0.6 percent in  May, 2.41 percent in the first five months of the year, and 8.14  percent over the past 12 months. Food and beverage prices  increased 0.32 percent; clothing and shoes 0.38 percent; home  appliances 1.2 percent; health 1.33 percent; transport and  communications 0.23 percent; education 0.1 percent;  entertainment and culture 2.28 percent; and goods and services  0.68 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p B5)    The World Bank approved $15 million in credit to be designed  for the state-owned companies capitalization program. This loan  is in addition to the $50 million in credit agreed by the bank  during Capitalization Minister Alfonso Revollo's visit to the  United States.

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Charities face financial crisis Britain's charities are facing a growing financial crisis because spending is fast outstripping the growth in their income, detailed analysis to be published this week shows. Among the 2,000 biggest charities the median growth in income was 7 per cent last year, while median growth in expenditure was 10 per cent. The figures appear in the Henderson Top 2000, produced by Hemmington Scott, the financial information publisher, which examines the accounts of the biggest 2,071 charities measured by either income, assets or expenditure. The data show that the larger charities are growing at the expense of their smaller counterparts. Income grew 20 per cent for the upper quartile of charities but fell 5 per cent for the lower quartile. Concern about this trend is echoed in an article published in the guide by Mr Perri 6, a lecturer at the University of Bath, who calls for an examination of the charity sector by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. Thirty-one of the charities examined - mostly operating in the arts - have accounts which have been qualified by their auditors on grounds that the organisation may not be able to survive. More than 17 per cent of the charities do not have a full audit of their accounts, because they are not obliged to do so unless they are also incorporated. Across all 2,000 charities considered, income grew by nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 8.053bn on average in the past year for which accounts are available, while expenditure grew 9 per cent to Pounds 7.668bn. Net assets rose 5 per cent in the same period to Pounds 24.895bn. Public grants and fees provided 29 per cent of total income on average, with a further 25 per cent from fees and charges, 20 per cent from other voluntary income, 15 per cent from interest, dividends and rent, and 7 per cent from legacies. The biggest charity by income was the British Council at Pounds 414m, followed by the Church Commissioners at Pounds 257m and the Arts Council at Pounds 223m. As grant providers these three organisations also spent the largest sums last year. The largest charity by assets or funds was the Wellcome Trust at Pounds 5.631bn, followed by the Church Commissioners at Pounds 2.214bn, the Weston Foundation at Pounds 951m and the Leverhulme Trust at Pounds 501m. Corporate donations to charities came from 1,550 of the UK's 2,200 quoted companies. The total in cash and non-cash contributed was Pounds 228m, up 2 per cent from the previous year. The largest donor was British Petroleum, followed by Grand Metropolitan, British Telecommunications and National Westminster Bank. The biggest proportion of charities' expenditure was operating costs at 70 per cent, followed by grants and awards at 28 per cent and publicity and fundraising at 3 per cent. Comparisons are difficult because of the widely differing nature of charities - some of which provide grants and others which provide services directly. The Henderson Top 2000 Charities, Hemmington Scott Publishing, 26-31 Whiskin Street, London EC1R 0BP. Pounds 89.50, Pounds 45 for charities.</p>

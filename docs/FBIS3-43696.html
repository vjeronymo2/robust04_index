The minister  of finance, Dr. Kalu Idika Kalu, said during the 1994 budget  breakdown in Abuja that the arrears included $25.72 million due  for payment to the European International Bank. Under a Paris  Club reschedulement arrangement, the country recorded $1.55  billion in debt payment arrears in the medium term. He said  short-term public sector arrears amounted to $105.12 million  while short-term private sector arrears totalled $1.119 billion.  Dr. Kalu said the arrears of external debt payments under the  Paris bilateral arrangement stood at $16.439 million. Arrears  of external debt payments to non-Paris bilateral creditors,  including the former USSR and South Korea, amounted to $533.655  million. Other nonpreviously consolidated debts which matured  between 1 April 1992 and December 1993 totalled $838 million.

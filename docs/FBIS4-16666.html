			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "The Secret of the President's </F> Safe. `Tanks Advance by Two to Three Men'"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has  learned from reliable sources, a new military reform plan is  already lying in the president's safe. In this context,  military experts suppose that in the very near future the  question of separating the Defense Ministry from the General  Staff will be raised again. There are also indications that the  plan provides for the creation of a powerful ideological body  like the old Main Personnel Directorate [Glavpur]. Former  presidential military adviser Gen. Volkogonov and Gen.  Vladimirov, the Yeltsin team's main analyst on military affairs,  are cited among the document's authors.    The new plan has been attributed such a high security  classification (a stamp saying, "Burn before reading" [as  published] that even some members of the Security Council do not  know about it yet. Still, signs are that many do not know how  current reforms are proceeding in the army either.    Even people in the Defense Ministry itself do not know.  Generals from the Defense Ministry, who only a month ago were  talking about a "phased" reform plan, are now reminiscent of  hedgehogs wandering in the fog [reference to a popular animated  cartoon]. Now the Defense Ministry discusses the disbandment of  the Baltic Fleet, ruling to preserve it. Now they effectively  abolish the Air Defense Force, having the public believe that  the troops will remain. It is also reported that the main  commands will be abolished, for instance the Main Ground Force  Command. In brief, as has always been the case with military  strategists, "tanks advance by two to three men."    Gen. Vladimirov, whom we asked to comment on the rumor about  the new reform plan, confirmed that "conceptually, no one  understands which reform the Defense Ministry is now pursuing."  He is convinced that the ministry should be separated from the  General Staff. In Russia, frequent changes of government and  therefore defense ministers are simply inevitable. According to  Aleksandr Vladimirov, the army must be safeguarded from this  leapfrog approach, and the General Staff given the right to  issue orders directly to the troops.</p>

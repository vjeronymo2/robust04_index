			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / What Future For Coal?: Miners shop around for jobs - The hunt for work in the wake of the coal crisis FORMER miners Mr Peter Leonard and Mr Allen Hughes are waiting to hear about applications for three jobs - working on London Underground's proposed Jubilee Line extension, tunnelling through two mountains in Iran for a new road and opencast mining in Malaysia. The men, aged 35 and 49, were employed together as face worker and chargehand at Sutton Manor Colliery in Lancashire which closed last year. Since then they have not been idle - most recently they have worked for private contractors on the South Yorkshire coalfields. However, they have twice lost their jobs - after working knee-deep in water, doing what they described as 'the hardest and dirtiest work in our lives'. It was 'first in, last out' as contractors reined back on employees. Last week they travelled 18 miles from their Liverpool homes to inspect the vacancies advertised in a job shop run by British Coal Enterprises (BCE), a subsidiary of British Coal. Set-up in the wake of the 1984-85 miners' strike, BCE tries to find jobs for ex-mineworkers and support small businesses in mining communities. These most often are not run by former miners. BCE can claim some tangible success in settling ex-miners in new jobs. This has been won by the provision of training on the Job and Career Change Scheme, along with counselling services, job shops and career services. These services are available for up to six months after a worker has been made redundant. BCE used to prefer applicants to have a job offer for which the training was required - something focused on by critics, which has been recently lifted. BCE says that between March 1988 and October last year it operated 123 individual job clubs and career centres on 80 coalfield sites with 29,043 former employees registering for help, a majority of those made redundant in the period. It also spent about Pounds 16m in the period. Of those, 22,128 became active job hunters - with 1,343 becoming self-employed, 4,602 joining BCE training courses and 11,824 finding new jobs either by themselves or with the assistance of the shops. Jobs on offer in one BCE shop last week included vacancies for a security guard, a warehouse operator, a cashier, a fitter and a senior engineer. BCE has no detailed figures about the types of job taken by ex-miners who use its services. Critics - including the Coalfield Communities Campaign, which represents coalfield local authorities - claim many former miners find it difficult to find stable well-paid jobs and that the level of training received by former miners is low. Many ex-miners do not ask their former employer for assistance. Mr John Waddington, a counsellor at BCE's Leith job club in Lancashire, where the last pit is scheduled to be closed next year, says many men go straight into another job without the need for re-training. 'Mineworkers are very adaptable,' he says. Their skills are many, he adds - including those of mechanics, electricians and welders. He also points to the qualities associated with working underground - such as teamwork and loyalty to the group. Mr Waddington says BCE does not try to force individuals into changing radically their job aspirations. 'The vast majority of people want to stay in and around their communities and they just want another job,' he says. 'Money is of secondary importance and they are not likely to earn as much as when they were down the pit.' Former miners, he says, are not afraid of retraining, but few are interested in long-term retraining for very different types of jobs. 'We try to persuade people to retrain but very few want to,' he says. The poor economic state of many mining areas is the dominant factor in many men's search for a new working life. Mr Leonard, soon after he was made redundant, went on a short BCE-funded retraining course to become a mechanical digger operator. 'We used similar equipment in the tunnels and I thought I might get work on the motorways,' he says. He was promised a job before he went on the course but it fell through later. 'I could not get any other jobs driving a digger because they all wanted experience,' he says. 'What is the point of re-training if there is not a job at the end of it all?' Whether the government's new initiative to help up to 30,000 miners in the 31 pits threatened with closure by British Coal will make any greater impact on improving the job prospects and aspirations of men like Mr Leonard remains to be seen. Some Pounds 75m has been provided by the government over the next two years to assist miners and their communities in areas worst affected by the job losses. The initiative, which will seek to offer a variety of employment services, is being led by Training and Enterprise Councils in association with other agencies including the Employment Service - which runs government job centres - and BCE. There is optimism among the agencies that a well co-ordinated effort could make some impacts on these communities. It remains to be seen whether all the parties can work effectively together and whether, with the comparatively small budget, any achievement will be significantly greater than that secured by BCE.</p>

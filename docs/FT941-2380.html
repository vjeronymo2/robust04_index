			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilt market faces a new week in a fragile state after another volatile trading day on Friday. For some time now, the market has been unable to focus on what, by and large, have been favourable UK economic fundamentals, because gilts have been caught up in weakness of the international bond markets. Last week's statistics were on balance positive, with a lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement and weak producer prices figures offsetting the upturn in average earnings. The announcement of a March 30 gilt auction, the first floating-rate note issue for some time, was generally seen as positive, since it may tap a new appetite for gilts among banks and building societies. The main economic figure this week will be the inflation numbers for February, published on Wednesday. The market consensus is that the headline rate will drop from January's 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent while the underlying rate (excluding mortgage payments) will fall from 2.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent. A weak RPI number may allow the authorities to make a further 0.25 per cent cut in base rates. However, they could easily decide to wait until after the next meeting between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor, on March 30, before making their move.</p>

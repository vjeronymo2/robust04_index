			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs fizz Leading pharmaceuticals groups Glaxo and Wellcome were the star performers in London following encouraging reports from a conference on Aids. Wellcome opened weaker as Glaxo decided to backtrack from licensing its Aids product 3TC to the company and continue to develop it in-house. However, some brokers argued that the benefits coming out of the conference outweighed the disadvantages. Lehman Brothers said sales of both products would be boosted and every additional Dollars 100m of Retrovir sales would add 2p a share to Wellcome's earnings. It will be some time before trials on the Retrovir/3TC cocktail are translated into increased profits. But the news gave a lift to sentiment and, with the help of a firmer dollar, Glaxo advanced 13 1/2 to 626p while Wellcome improved 12 to 675p. VSEL gained 30 at 1518p following widespread weekend press comment on the possibility of an early reply in the bid battle for the submarine maker from electronics giant GEC. British Aerospace eased 4 to 442p, which shaded the value of its all-share offer for VSEL to under 1459p. According to analysts yesterday, GEC could shortly step up its 1400p a share cash bid to 1550p. GEC dipped 1 1/2 to 286p. The situation provoked very little turnover: BAe was the most active of the protagonists yesterday with just 2.4m shares dealt. Rolls-Royce firmed 2 to 185p as the market embraced the strategic strength of the company's Dollars 525m agreed purchase of Allison Engine, of the US. The deal gives R-R a significant stake in US aero-engine manufacture and, with Allison clawing back to a modest operating profit in the 1994 third quarter, London analysts warmed to its timing. What Sir Ralph Robins, R-R's chairman, had to say about a possible share placing or rights issue next spring took some of the gloss off the occasion. But both NatWest Securities and Credit Lyonnais Laing see the deal as earnings enhancing, and expect R-R's preferred financing route to take shape through a one-for-six rights at 165p a share. Shell Transport traded up 4 to 711p as the market responded to a company presentation at the City's Chiswell Street Brewery. Ms Irene Himona of SGST said the company gave a positive and reassuring performance and focused on hefty cost cutting. Regional electricity group East Midland attracted attention as traders started dealing in the company's new shares after the well signposted share consolidation took effect. The stock closed at 777p. There was good buying in three of the smaller water companies which report interim figures this week. Yorkshire rose 10 to 549p, Welsh 5 to 668p and South West 2 to 503p. Dealers are looking to see if the three will follow Northumbrian (723p xd), which reported a 16 per cent dividend increase. One market watcher said: 'The three are likely to announce favourable payments. They are aware that the government's golden share expires at the end of this year and they may be vulnerable to takeovers.' Mobile communications group Vodafone remained weak ahead of today's interims, easing 1 1/2 to 206p in turnover of 4.3m for a decline over the past five trading days of almost 6 per cent. Whispers about possible customer fraud provisions also hit the shares. The half-time results are expected to be held in check by heavy overseas start-up costs, which for the full year could get close to Pounds 60m, according to Hoare Govett. The broker sees interim profits of Pounds 180m. High street banks suffered from profit-taking, with Barclays sliding 13 to 590p, Lloyds 9 to 586p and National Westminster 8 1/2 to 523p. Abbey National declined 7 1/2 to 412p ahead of a quarterly trading update today. British Land retreated 12 to 383p after a surprise announcement that the company is to buy the 51.5 per cent of Quantum Property Fund it does not control, from financier Mr George Soros. Dealers were particularly concerned by the sharp increase in the company's gearing following the deal, given the current rates of interest. Well received figures from publisher Emap saw the shares improve 5 to 405p. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

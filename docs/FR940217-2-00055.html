			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Background and Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Emergency Medical Services for Children statute (Section 1910  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the PHS Act, as amended) establishes a program of two-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants to States, through a State-designated agency, or to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredited medical school within the State, for projects for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion and improvement of emergency medical services for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children who need treatment for trauma or critical illness. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this grant program, the term ``State'' includes the 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Samoa, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The term ``school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of medicine'' is defined as having the same meaning as set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 799(1)(A) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 295p(1)(A)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Accredited'' in this context has the same meaning as set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 799(1)(E) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 295p(1)(E)). It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intent of this grant program to stimulate further development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or expansion of ongoing efforts in the States to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems of life-threatening pediatric trauma and critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness. The Department does not intend to award grants which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would duplicate grants previously funded under the Emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medical Services Systems Act of 1972 or which would be used simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increase the availability of emergency medical services funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allotted to the State under the Preventive Health Services Block  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Funding Categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There will be four categories of competition for funding this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year: State planning grants, State systems grants, targeted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants, and resource capacity grants. States may apply for only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the first two categories, but are not restricted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for the last two categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Category (1): State Planning Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Planning grants are intended for States that have never received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an EMSC grant and that are not at a stage of readiness to initiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a full-scale implementation project. States (or medical schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within those States) that have not received prior EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation grants are the only applicants eligible for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. Planning grants are designed to enable a State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess needs and develop a strategy to begin to address those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs. Funds may be used to hire staff to assist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of EMSC needs of the State; obtain technical assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from national, State, regional or local resources; help formulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State plan for the integration of EMSC services into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing State EMS plan; and plan a more comprehensive grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal based upon a needs assessment performed during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning grant project period. A comprehensive approach,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing physical, psychological, and social aspects of EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along the continuum of care, should be reflected. An ongoing working relationship with Federal EMSC program staff and resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center staff, beginning with the initiation of a planning grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, is strongly encouraged. Budget requests in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category should not exceed $50,000, The project period is for one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year only, with no renewal. Applications in this category are due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier than other categories. The application deadline is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Category (2): State Systems Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category of grants has two subcategories: implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants and system enhancement grants. Proposals for State systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants may be framed within the context of the changing conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of health care delivery anticipated under health care reform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subcategory (A): implementation grants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Implementation grants will improve the capacity of a State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emergency Medical Services program to address the particular needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of children. Implementation grants are used to assist States in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrating research-based knowledge and state-of-the-art systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development approaches into the existing State EMS/trauma systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the experience and products of previous EMSC grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grants of up to $250,000 per award for each twelve month budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period are anticipated. Project periods are up to two years. Up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to five grants will be awarded. For this competition, we intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fund applications from States (and medical schools within those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States) that have not as yet received support, or that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received only partial support under this program as part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional alliance. This means that approved applications from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States (and medical schools within those States) with no or very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited prior EMSC program support will be funded before approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications from outside this group. Applications will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted for both planning grants and implementation grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously from the same State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

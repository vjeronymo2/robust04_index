Shaymiyev expressed the opinion that if Kazan and Moscow  sign  a treaty before the additional elections to the Russian  parliament scheduled for March 13, then Tatarstan's people will  actively participate in the voting.    Elections did not take place on Tatarstan's territory on  December 12 because less than 30 percent of electors came to the  electoral districts.    "The factor of an agreement will play its decisive role in  this issue and will finally determine whether the republics'  representatives are elected to the Federation Council and State  Duma," announced Shaymiyev. To this effect he expressed  conviction that the treaty would be signed before March 13 and  Tatarstan "will be represented in the new parliament."    According to Shaymiyev, relations between Kazan and Moscow  should be grounded on the Basic Laws of the Russian Federation  and Tatarstan and should be "agreement-constitutional ones."    Commenting on the Russian president's speech at the  Federation Council's session, Shaymiyev said that "he met with  great satisfaction the thesis stating that a strong Russia  should consist of strong regions." "One should not fear to  transfer authorities to the regions because as of today none of  the regions tries to violate Russia's integrity," said Shaymiyev.</p>

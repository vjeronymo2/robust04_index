			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Italy After sitting out the recent turmoil, Italy's politicians are assessing the impact of wider margins for the economy, writes Haig Simonian. The lira has floated since last September's devaluation and suspension from the ERM. That has given exporters a competitive advantage; the lira is now more than 22 per cent below its pre-devaluation level against the D-Mark. The new ERM bands could cost Italy some competitiveness against countries with weaker currencies, such as France. Exports have been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economy overshadowed by domestic recession. Unemployment reached 13.6 per cent in the first quarter, up from 11.3 per cent a year earlier, and redundancies are accelerating, notably among small-and-medium sized businesses. Last month, the Bank of Italy cut the discount rate to 9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976, but industrialists are pressing for further cuts. The lower lira has had a negative side. Inflation, which fell to 4 per cent earlier this year, is expected to reach 4.4 per cent in July. The domestic recession has depressed price rises, but it was only a matter of time before the weaker lira started to feed into prices, given Italy's dependence on imported raw materials. In the longer term, the impact will be attenuated by last month's deal between unions and employers on wage reform. But the virtual collapse of the ERM will undermine one of the most powerful arguments used to justify tough policies to bring down the budget deficit. Ministers regularly referred to the 'external discipline' of economic and monetary union to justify higher taxes and lower benefits.</p>

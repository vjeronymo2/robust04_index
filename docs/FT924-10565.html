			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: More bread from Tomkins Any UK share price these days would shudder at the prospect of a Pounds 670m one-for-two rights issue and plans to garnish a food-free guns to bicycles conglomerate with bread and Bisto. The near 20 per cent fall in Tomkins' market capitalisation yesterday, however, reflects a deeper concern - that by entering the bidding for Ranks Hovis McDougall Mr Greg Hutchings is biting off more than he can chew. Admittedly the sceptics have been wrong-footed before. Tomkins appears to have done its homework and has proved itself capable of digesting similar mouthfuls relative to its size. Nor is it as sinister as many suppose that other food companies are conspicuous by their absence from the bidding. Most of the obvious candidates for RHM are either discredited, pursuing strategies which specifically exclude milling and baking, or merely interested in picking over the company's corpse. That said, Tomkins is being forced to pay a full price, at least 15p to 20p more than Lord Hanson would probably have put on the table if his former protege had not intervened. In the absence of any information on cost savings or tax benefits, Tomkins' shareholders have to take on trust the assurance that there will be no earnings dilution. They also have to hope that Tomkins' undoubted skill in dealing with US retailers translates to UK supermarkets, and that it can find the necessary marketing flair to make the British eat more bread. It all sounded suspiciously easy yesterday. Hanson, of course, is torn between letting a second successive deal slip through his fingers and the risk of overpaying. While they sit tight for the next move RHM shareholders at last have a reason to be grateful to their board. The seemingly kamikaze-style defence - which at least underpinned its shares - does not seem so daft now after all.</p>

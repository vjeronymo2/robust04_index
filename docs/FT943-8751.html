			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Hamas members seized after Israeli warnings: Swoop exposes acute dilemma faced by Arafat Palestinian security forces yesterday rounded up some 35 members of the extremist Hamas Islamic movement after Israel threatened to halt peace talks until the Palestine Liberation Organisation curbed guerrilla attacks against Jewish settlers and soldiers. The move, which could ignite violent conflict among Palestinians, has exposed the acute dilemma faced by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. If he does not take stiff measures against Hamas, the peace process momentum will quickly decline; if he does crack down on Hamas, seen by many Palestinians as freedom fighters against continued Israeli occupation of Arab land, he risks unpopularity and the threat of civil war. Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin welcomed the arrests, calling it a 'good sign' after a spate of attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israelis in the Gaza Strip. In Damascus, Hamas condemned the crackdown, accusing Mr Arafat of 'playing the role of the enemy's army', and said it would continue the armed struggle against Israel. Earlier, Mr Rabin had visited the Jewish settlement block in the Strip and toured the road in Gaza where Hamas guerrillas killed an Israeli and wounded six others in ambushes on Sunday. 'It is inconceivable we will continue the process without seeing on the part of the Palestinian Authority a serious effort to deal with those terrorist elements,' Mr Rabin said. The Israeli military said there had been 39 attacks by Palestinian militants since they redeployed their forces three months ago, and not a single gunman had been arrested by Palestinian police. Mr Rabin said he had frozen talks on releasing more Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. Officials said Israel could halt negotiations on reaching agreement on transferring power from Israeli to Palestinian hands over West Bank education, health, taxation, welfare and tourism. Israel could also delay opening a safe corridor between Gaza and Jericho, and setting up Palestinian terminals at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossings.</p>

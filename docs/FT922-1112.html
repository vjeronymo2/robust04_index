			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Major pressed on supervision report THE NEED to prevent legal proceedings over the Maxwell affair being put at risk by publication of a report into the supervision of Maxwell companies was emphasised by Mr John Major yesterday as he came under renewed pressure to make the full findings public soon. The Securities and Investments Board has received the report by Imro, the investment management regulatory organisation, details of which have been leaked over the past few days. Challenged in the Commons by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, the prime minister said he understood SIB intended to publish Imro's findings, but that 'the House will understand it will be essential to ensure that publication does not in any way jeopardise either civil or criminal proceedings in the Maxwell affair, including those currently underway against Kevin and Ian Maxwell'. Mr Kinnock argued that government involvement made publication a 'pressing necessity'. He highlighted the decision by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988 to grant an investment licence to London and Bishopsgate Investments after the Bank of England had blocked an attempt by Robert Maxwell to take over a merchant bank. 'Is it not clear in these circumstances both the government and the system it established have got a clear and serious charge of negligence to answer?' he said. MPs believe the role of the DTI in granting the original licence in 1988 is critical to the extent of the responsibility government will have to take for the plight of the Maxwell pensioners.</p>

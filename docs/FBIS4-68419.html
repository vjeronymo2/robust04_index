			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by National-Democratic Chairman Giorgi Chanturia </F> under rubric "Point of View: The Way I See It. Discussion: How  Can We Help Georgia?": "Argumentum ad Rem"]    [Text] This item derives from part two of  National-Democratic Party Chairman Giorgi Chanturia's final  speech at the National-Democratic Party's open conference in  Tbilisi on 19 February 1994.    In brief, then, we can formulate what we have to do  this way: begin to build statehood, convert to the market  economy, establish law and order, create an army, restore  Georgia's territorial integrity, stabilize the economy, convert  to a national currency by strengthening the coupon, and  establish a strong government. (This latter ranks first in  importance, because without a strong government any restoration  of statehood is out of the question). It is very difficult to  accomplish these tasks, especially given our objective problems,  but we declare in all seriousness that it is possible, and if we  want to exist we have to accomplish these tasks.    As to the ways by which all the problems must be solved and  how Georgian statehood is to be built are things we have our own  view of, and it is already known to many, but we still deem it  necessary to set forth a few of our ideas again, schematically  at least:    A) THE ECONOMY.    CATASTROPHIC describes the situation in the  national economy. Incorrect economic policies have brought it  about that not only normalization of society's socioeconomic  situation but also our statehood is in doubt.    The government has clearly failed to realize that the  country's political safety and independence depend vitally on  its economic security, whose foundation has to be an independent  national economic system. Yet the creation of such a system has  hardly even been started--in fact, what we see is the reverse.  For a Georgia left without a system of economic security, state  independence can only be symbolic.    Incorrect economic policies have also had an adverse effect  in the country's social infrastructure. One might say that what  is at work in Georgia today is not the "economic growth"  principle but rather the "one-sided distribution" principle that  is widespread in some developing countries. In order to realize  the "economic growth" principle, the following stimulating  factors are needed: the institution of private property, free  enterprise, and competition. At a time when these factors are  absent, when ownership by the "Reds" (which is called state  ownership) holds a monopoly position, no real new national  wealth is being created, and what there is is distributed in  favor of a tiny segment of society in close contact with state  structures and official or unofficial militarized groups. As a  result, a very tiny segment of society is growing rich rapidly,  while the standard of living of the majority is declining  catastrophically, which creates a fine context for social  upheaval.    The situation is further aggravated by uncontrolled  inflation  resulting from the government's mistaken monetary-credit policy.  Inflation, of course, has its most devastating impact on the  low-income and socially least protected segments of society. If  the present economic system remains unchanged, great cataclysms  can be expected, which, given the absence of flexible  socioeconomic levers, can only be averted by the use of physical  force, and this would make any democratic civil society in  Georgia a mere fantasy.    Georgia's economic strategy should be oriented toward the  creation of an independent national economic system, which  requires the formation of a unified Georgian market, unified  economic space, and an autonomous monetary-credit system.    At this point we must address the provocatively introduced  theme of Georgia's entry into the so-called "ruble space." Quite  aside from the fact that the advocates of the Russian "ruble"  never bother to adduce arguments or any competent, scientific  reasoning to persuade their opponents and the people but rather  attempt to accomplish their aim through demagoguery and naked  populism, the point lies elsewhere: there is no such thing as a  "ruble" zone, there is only the ruble of the Russian Federation,  used by the subjects of that Federation. All the countries and  semi-countries which introduce the Russian "ruble" officially  become de facto members of the Russian Federation.    The fact that the Russian ruble is unofficially in  circulation here means nothing; we have dollars in circulation  also, yet the state, if it wishes, can easily make the coupon  the sole medium of payment (this can also be done by means of  administrative organs) and solve the problem.    They are also ignoring the fact that the coupon and the  ruble  are qualitatively the same currency, the only difference being  the rate of decline in value (this difference itself will soon  disappear in connection with the virtual halt of reforms in  Russia).    From the economic standpoint, then, there can be no  justification for introducing the Russian ruble, and it will not  improve the people's situation in the slightest. It will be  solely a political move designed to destroy Georgian statehood  totally and turn Georgia into a de facto part of the Russian  Federation. (Similarly, some people think that instead of  100,000 coupons in pay they will receive 100,000 rubles; in  reality, however, they will get an amount in rubles  corresponding to the exchange rate of 100,000 coupons, and our  people's financial resources will remain the same as today--at  best.)    Again, all this talk about "restoring old ties" is nonsense,  because it is impossible to restore "old ties" without  resurrecting socialism, and restoring socialism is  inconceivable. We can talk about establishing ties with our old  partners, so to speak, in Russia and the CIS countries, but  these will be qualitatively new ties and will not give those who  wish for the restoration of the "old ties" the effect they are  hoping for.    Nobody is against such ties, but, we repeat, unless we  establish our own economic system and implement the correct  economic policy, these ties will yield no benefits.    The goal of an economic policy must be solid economic  growth,  a stable monetary system, solutions to problems of employment,  and a balance in foreign economic relations. This will require:  the advent of a reform government (no reforms can be carried out  by persons who spent decades building a socialist economy and  are still today talking about "old" ties, which is to say, a  parasitical economy)--the kind of government which will carry  out comprehensive reforms, in all spheres of life and, in  particular, the economy, following the recommendations of the  International Monetary Fund and other authoritative  international organizations, with no populism and no toying with  the public;    --it will require the transformation and rationalization of  present management structures;    --a legal foundation for economic reforms;    --genuine property ownership reform in all sectors of the  economy;    --implementation of a rigorous monetary-credit policy in  order to stop inflation, form capital and halt the capital  drain, and ensure a stable monetary system;    --implementation of a state policy fostering private  enterprise and small businesses;    --liberalization of foreign economic ties--rationally--and  measures to make Georgia a country having an open economic  system.    Georgia used to be dominated by the myth that we could  prosper by Borzhomi water and tea alone, which proved  destructive. Now a second myth is coming into being, namely that  we are doomed and that if Russia doesn't save us we will perish;  this is no less dangerous to us. We have to realize that with a  team of reformers and by converting to the market economy  without populism, by making wise use of our resources, through  purely economic contacts--including with the countries of CIS  (but without any political subtext--and, most important, through  honesty and labor we can bring the country out of its economic  crisis and create the conditions necessary for a normal life.    B) LAW AND ORDER.    FIRST OF ALL, the structures of authority need to  be cleansed of clans, representatives of bandit gangs, and dope  addicts.    Certain types of narcotic substances ought to be legalized  in  order to strike a blow against the narcobusiness that is  beginning to take shape.    Even though we are in principle against the death penalty,  we  believe it is acceptable, temporarily--for a span of two to  three years--to make use of the supreme penalty against dope  peddlers and distributors, terrorists, and kidnappers.    Of course, the appropriate changes will have to be made in  the Criminal Code.    The Internal Affairs Ministry will have to change radically,  stop being a politicized institution protecting the authorities  and turn into a structure protecting citizens and their rights.    All parties, including those who support the authorities,  must be disarmed. All unofficial military formations must be  abolished. Any weapons held by security workers and persons who  need protection must be registered in the Internal Affairs  Ministry.    The war against crime must be more than just a campaign; it  needs to be purposeful, and it ought to start "from the top"  rather than "from the bottom," the way it is today.    There are other specific questions which also need specific  approaches and solutions.    C) FOREIGN POLICY.    THE STATE must resume its pro-Western course, but  it must be genuine rather than merely declarative. At the same  time, we have to take account of Russia's geopolitical interests  and be willing to compromise--though not at the expense of our  own sovereignty and state interests--to establish normal  relations with Russia (it also needs to be pointed out that not  everything depends on us, and the most important thing, still,  is just who is going to be in charge "up there." Yeltsin, who  has already embarked on the path of derzhavizm and has even, in  effect, buried economic reforms, will certainly share  Gorbachev's fate if he carries out such a course, because it is  not going to satisfy either the democrats or the extreme  nationalists. We have to have an interest in seeing Gaydar and  other true democrats come to power in Russia, but today's  authorities there--specifically, Chernomyrdin's government--are  objectively laying the groundwork for a quite different regime,  and Zhirinovskiy will be at its head).    Georgia must cooperate actively with the UN, the  Eurocouncil,  and other international organizations. We need to have  especially close ties with NATO's military-political bloc, and  we must certainly join the Cooperation for Peace initiative.    Georgia has to work actively in the North Caucasus, but, at  this stage, on the level of people's diplomacy.    Finally, any correct and fruitful foreign policy necessarily  requires a top-to-bottom reorganization of the Foreign Affairs  Ministry and substantial cadre changes (which should include our  diplomats as well, with rare exceptions).    We need to work out a serious foreign policy conception,  define our priorities, and work purposefully on the basis of  that conception.    D) CERTAIN DIRECTIONS OF DOMESTIC POLICY.    THE MAIN THING is relations with the national  movement, reports of whose demise are greatly exaggerated. Quite  the contrary: if everything goes on as it has, the national  movement will gain new forces, find ways to make use of social  activism, draw the old, not-all-that mistaken, appropriate  conclusions from the past, and take shape as a very solid and  meaningful entity.    In the interests of statehood, it is essential that men of  the national movement--in general, "new men"--come into power.  It is a little embarrassing when the people who speak of the  destructive force of the national movement are those who for  years destroyed the country themselves, sold off the lands, and  squandered state property, especially considering that the one  year of Gamsakhurdia's rule which people have been harping about  was not a year of national-movement government. In fact,  Gamsakhurdia started his "deep statehood" activity by fighting  the national movement's supreme organ--the National Congress (we  could also mention Beso Gugushvili's ideas and decisions of  convergence and other anti-national notions). The national  movement has never been in power, and even if it did fervently  desire to destroy anything it couldn't do so. There may be many  who do not like the national movement, but at least its  representatives have never given away credit. You may look at  the national movement in various ways, but it wasn't the  national movement which brought in one-dollar wheat at one  dollar and thirty cents--it was the person who is the Vice  Premier today. It isn't the national movement that has been  eating up the humanitarian aid, and it did not lose Abkhazia.  And, of course, admitting a few representatives of the national  movement to power just to prettify the facade does not mean that  the national movement has come to power.    The national movement has made mistakes--quite a few. But  let  him who has never done any wrong to his own people, and is  infallible, throw the first stone. Hence, we have to stop laying  blame, and entrust the nation's fate to those who are capable of  building the state and, in particular, those who wish to.    Today, the authorities are on the brink of anarchy, while  anarchy is ready to take power. According to Lichtenberg, order  is the prerequisite of any good thing, but is anything leading  us to order? Is it going to be necessary to give up on democracy  and establish a dictatorship? No, it is not, because it is  possible to achieve order through democratic structures as well.  Almost every democratic country has gone through a "democratic  Caesarism" phase--that is, a period in which the rulers, in  order to create strong democratic structures, have resorted to  certain restrictions and other temporary measures. But in such a  case, as in the case of carrying out reforms, the rulers have to  enjoy the people's trust, and they must not abuse that trust.  "Democratic Caesarism" implies strong presidential rule, though  with a strong parliament and, as we have stated, with a large  store of trust.    We must never forget for a moment that the problems of  Abkhazia and Samachablo are still unresolved, and until they are  there can be no question of order and stability. The people are  aware of our party's views on these matters, so we will just add  one thing: we need a differentiated approach to both problems,  because while it is possible to make effective use of peaceful  measures in regard to Samachablo and preserve our territorial  integrity through reasonable compromise, in the case of  Abkhazia, unfortunately, we will have to first shift the  emphasis to partisan warfare and then, after an army has been  formed, resolve the conflict through large-scale military  operations.    The business of building an army and military industry has  to  be turned over to civilians and politicians, while professional  military men must be in charge of military operations and other  specific spheres (as in all normal countries).    E) HOW SHALL WE BEGIN?    DESPITE objective factors, the government and all  its component parts cannot dodge responsibility for the  country's ruin and destruction. In order to escape  responsibility, one ought to have to resign from one's position  or, perhaps, even quit politics. If this does not happen  voluntarily, we have stated repeatedly that it will happen by  force, either through social upheaval or by mass actions,  because the people have no other remedy, and there has been no  light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while.    Georgia truly cannot stand such cataclysms, and this is why  it is all the more urgent that our leadership be changed by  peaceful means.    First of all, a new election law must be passed and  extraordinary parliamentary elections scheduled (a Constitution  can be adopted simultaneously with the elections, and no one  will give us the time to put off elections until Abkhazia is  regained). The elections must be organized on the basis of party  rosters, and with a 5-percent barrier for the parties (a  10-percent barrier for blocs). This way, we will have two or  three really solid parties in Parliament. Then the winning  party, or a coalition of parties, can put together a government,  and, finally, a "new generation"--that is, persons of a  non-socialist mentality--will come to power.    Election day must be announced quickly, but meanwhile  (today,  one might say) the Cabinet of Ministers ought to step down (and  not on grounds of the budget). Instead of the old party hack or  former factory director, the government should be headed by a  politician who has the support of both the majority and the  minority in Parliament.    Because the country's very existence is at stake, we must  all  rally our forces and share responsibility. A national-salvation  government will have to be made up of representatives of both  the majority and the minority in order to achieve a  consolidation of political forces, ensure that reformers and  honest persons are in charge and that in addition to personal  and party responsibility there is an increase in collective  responsibility of the sort that we are so sorely in need of.  Such a government will have just one drawback: because of the  diversity of its make-up it will not be a team; on the other  hand, however, it can unite the country, ensure the  inviolability of the country's sovereignty until elections are  held and carry out reforms.    The national-salvation government is our common  responsibility in the land we call Georgia, the land we all must  save and build regardless of our party affiliation, creed, or  social status. We have a choice then--to join together, to face  together the numerous problems threatening to engulf our people,  or to keep on tearing at one another and giving Georgia away  piece by piece to the forces "which have been, are, and will for  a while continue to be" the test of our faith and our strength.</p>

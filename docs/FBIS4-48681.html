			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marie-France Cros report: "Jean Birara: `The Belgians and </F> French Could Have Stopped the Killing'"]    [Text] His smile is infrequent but dazzling and reassuring  like a sudden burst of sun in a stormy sky. His constant frown  gives his face a severity which is only softened by the sad  kindness of his gaze and gray hair. Jean Birara, now former  governor of the National Bank of Rwanda and a man who is  respected in his country, is not inclined to optimism. Those  who have been listening to him for four years know that,  unfortunately, he was right.    Although a member of no political party, he was consulted by  all. He is a northerner and has family ties with people in  power, especially in the Army, and he also has the respect of  the southern opposition because he was one of the oldest  opponents of the Habyarimana regime.  <H5>  The Presidential Guard Against the Army </H5>   It is this man who thinks that "Belgium and France could  have  halted the massacres in the first few hours if they had so  wished. Do not forget that the Presidential Guard was trained by  the Belgians." It is this Guard which, together with the  Interahamwe militia of President Habyarimana's former single  party, is responsible for most of the massacres. In Jean  Birara's view, the two bodies are virtually the same. "The  Interahamwes are the Presidential Guard leading the young. It  forms the basis of this militia of around 50,000 members, mainly  reservists."    According to him, "after the assassination of the president,  the Guard fought for two days against the rest of the Army which  wanted to maintain the Arusha agreements. They were reconciled  on Friday evening when they knew that the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] was attacking."    Mr. Birara fears the continuation of the massacres. "This  can  go on as long as there are young people with weapons throughout  the country. In a commune in Gisenyi, which has 140,000  inhabitants, the mayor told me there were 50,000 guns."  <H5>  Europe Knew </H5>   Mr. Birara thinks the Europeans should intervene. He does  not believe in an African intervention: There is no  satisfactory precedent in this sphere. Mr. Birara said that the  European chancelleries knew that the massacres were being  planned. He warned the Belgian political world "at a very high  level" where people preferred to believe that "Habyarimana was a  saintly man" and do nothing. "In 1991, when I was in danger, an  application to renew my visa was turned down and I was forced to  leave."    According to Mr. Birara, Belgian diplomacy in Rwanda changed  when, following action by the nuncio -- who, he said was the  only ambassador along with Belgian Johan Swinnen who had sounded  the alarm about what was being planned -- the Rwandan church  stopped supporting the regime.  <H5>  The Massacre Was Planned </H5>   What was being planned? The massacre. "The list of people  to be eliminated numbered 60 names at the end of 1992, 500 in  April 1993. At noon on 20 February 1994, Army Chief of Staff  General Nsabimana, my relative, showed me a list of 1,500 names  just for Kigali. He did not support that plan, drawn up with  President Habyarimana's consent. He told me he had succeeded  three times in preventing it but that, on the fourth, he could  no longer do so and urged me to leave. On 4 April, another  officer told me that serious things were being planned and that  he did not know whether he would still be alive in a week's time.    On 6 April, the attack took place and General Nsabimana was  in the plane with the head of state. The latter's removal had  been decided by his own officers in October 1992. But secrets  are difficult to keep because everybody has relatives in all the  groups."</p>

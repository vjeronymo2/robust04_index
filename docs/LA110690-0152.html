			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> $334,000 STATE GRANT FOR LEISURE CENTER  </P> <P> The city has received a $334,000 grant from the state to help build a  $2.44-million recreation facility that would double the size of the existing  Cultural Arts and Recreation Center, city officials said.  </P> <P> Recreation Director Mary Gonye said the expansion would enable the city to  provide as many as six programs, such as karate, ballroom dancing and ballet  classes, all at the same time.  </P> <P> The present building has only one main room, limiting the number of groups that  can use it at a given time.  </P> <P> The proposed 14,450-square-foot facility, to be completed by August, 1992, will  replace the existing center at the corner of Cedar Street and Katella Avenue,  City Manager Terry Matz said.  </P> <P> The facility is now in the design stage and will be constructed at the same  time as the the new civic center at 7800 Katella. Matz said no decision has yet  been made on whether the two projects will be combined into a single building.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) helped the city obtain the grant,  which is funded by a state surtax on cigarettes and tobacco and earmarked for  parks and recreation projects.  </P> <P> "I sense that there's excitement. This has been a demonstrated community need  for the last several years," Matz said.  </P></p>

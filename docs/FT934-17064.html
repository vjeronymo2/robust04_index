			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Planning for a better life in retirement - How to get tax advantages from annuities ALL TOO often, people approaching retirement overlook the importance of tax planning as a way to boost the pension they will receive from their annuity. Annuities provide a regular income, either for life (through the use of a pension or life annuity) or for a specified period (temporary annuity) in exchange for a lump sum payment to an insurance company. There are considerable tax advantages to be gained for those who have retired with a compulsory purchase annuity - one bought with the proceeds of a pension fund which will, generally, pay out a percentage of the total fund as tax-free cash. Those wishing to maximise their income on retirement will usually find it more profitable to draw their tax-free cash and put it in a life annuity. Since the Inland Revenue applies different tax laws to the two annuity groups, people who have retired can make use of these to supplement their income, which is particularly important while annuity rates are at their present low. All income from compulsory purchase annuities is taxed in full as earned income, which could mean a 40 per cent charge if the annuitant's income is high enough. By contrast, life annuity payments are split into interest, which is taxed, and return of capital, which is not. It follows that the net income from a life annuity will be considerably higher than from a compulsory purchase annuity. For those annuitants who are married and paying tax at 40 per cent, the financial anomalies between the two types of annuity offer another means of maximising value. Retired people can pass their tax-free cash to their spouse (providing the spouse is in the lower tax bracket) who can, in turn, use it to buy a life annuity. The transfer of tax-free cash is exempt from income tax, as is the gift made to the spouse. Where the spouse is the sole buyer of the annuity, the interest element is taxed in line with the income tax rate of the spouse as long as he/she is alive, even though the annuity provides joint-life benefits. Where the spouse dies first, the tax rate reverts to that of the survivor. The interest portion of the annuity would be taxed at their tax rate, or even less, only if the spouse had not used up his/her allowances. So, in addition to the savings on the tax-free capital portion, another 15 per cent tax could be saved on the rest. If a couple wished to purchase only a single life annuity, and the main annuity purchaser is the husband, this arrangement would work best when they are of similar age. If he is much older, the standard reduction in annuity rates for a female compared with a male of the same age (because of a woman's greater life expectancy) would be exacerbated because of her relative youth. So, in these circumstances, the husband could be better off keeping his tax-free cash. This could change with the development of unisex rates. Conversely, a married couple with the wife as the main annuity purchaser on a single life basis would probably stand to gain if the wife transferred her tax-free cash to the husband, allowing him to buy a life annuity. If he was roughly the same age, or older, he would definitely get far better annuity rates and would also enjoy the tax advantages, especially if his wife was in the 40 per cent bracket and he was not. It is clear that the scope for tax planning opportunities can transform even further the value achieved from the best annuity available, even when retirees have been shopping around on the 'open market.' When the investor cashes in his pension contract, he can take the accumulated fund value and buy his annuity from any life company he wishes. He does not have to buy it from the life company with which he originally took out the personal pension. Take a 60-year-old man with a company pension fund of Pounds 100,000. He could get a net annual income of Pounds 4,883.40 by using the whole fund to buy an annuity with Equitable Life (at present, one of the top-paying life offices for these specific benefits). This assumes payment to be monthly in advance without a guarantee period and with a spouse's benefit of 100 per cent for a spouse aged 50. It also assumes that the annuitant is in the 40 per cent tax band and is using his allowances elsewhere. But, by withdrawing the maximum tax-free cash (in this case, Pounds 25,000), and buying a life annuity with the same company, the net income would increase by Pounds 211.37 every year to Pounds 5,094.77. If he had also used the open market option for a life annuity as well as for the compulsory purchase annuity, he would have enhanced his income even further: by purchasing the life annuity with MGM Assurance, his net annual income would have increased to Pounds 5,110.25 using a 75/25 per cent split between the compulsory and life annuity portion of the fund. The total net after-tax income would be increased by Pounds 226.85 a year. The present life expectancy of a female aged 50 is 29 years, so the extra income gained over this period would be Pounds 6,578.65. This again shows clearly that the top company for one annuity is not necessarily the top for another, and underlines the need for independent advice on the best rates available.

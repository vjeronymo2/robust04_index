			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Portals shares jump 99p on bid approach Shares in Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, jumped yesterday after the group revealed it had received an approach, 'which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company'. The shares closed 99p higher at 765p, having traded as high as 795p earlier in the day. The shares has risen earlier in the week amid market rumours of a possible bid. Yesterday Portals declined to elaborate on its announcement which, nevertheless, triggered speculation about the identity of the potential bidder and the value of the shares in any bid battle. Analysts suggested the group, which also includes environmental protection and control products operations, could have a break-up value of about 800p per share. However, they also suggested that a bidder might have to pay 950p to Pounds 10 to win board backing for an agreed takeover. Among companies suggested by analysts as possible bidders were domestic competitors like Arjo Wiggins Appleton and customers such as De La Rue, the banknote printer, seeking to integrate their operations. Both Arjo Wiggins and De La Rue declined to comment on the speculation although Mr Les Cullen, De La Rue's finance director, acknowledged that Portals was a company 'we know very well'. However, some analysts pointed out that an acquisition by a printer could also have serious disadvantages - not least because it would almost certainly result in the loss of Portals' contracts with rivals.</p>

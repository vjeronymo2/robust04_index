			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Treasury expects pause in recovery Britain's economic recovery could pause in the spring when tax increases announced in last week's Budget take effect, Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, said yesterday. However, he told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that the Budget, which will add Pounds 1.68bn to Pounds 6.73bn of tax rises already planned for 1994-95, was not intended to be deflationary. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, decided to tighten fiscal policy to ensure that the recovery continued, Mr Budd said. While there was uncertainty over consumers' reaction to tax increases next April, the Budget could have a positive effect on confidence. In addition, the 'very considerable' fall in interest rates since September 1992 was having a powerful effect on demand. Mr Budd pointed out that consumer demand continued to grow after the announcement of tax increases in Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget. Nevertheless, he agreed with Mr Giles Radice, a Labour committee member, that the tax increases announced in this year's two Budgets would have a cumulative impact of Pounds 15bn to Pounds 17bn in 1996-97. In forecasting growth of 2.5 per cent next year, rising to 3 per cent a year by 1996-97, the Treasury expected investment and exports would play a bigger role in supporting activity in later years, Mr Budd said. MPs were told by Mr Paul Gray of the Treasury's monetary group that in spite of the tax increases, the net funding requirement for the budget deficit would be in the 'high 30s' of billions of pounds in 1994-95. They also heard Mr Christopher Kelly, head of the Treasury's general expenditure policy division, express only cautious optimism that the reduced contingency reserve of Pounds 3.5bn in the spending plans for 1994-95 would be adequate. The flow of orders to the west Midlands engineering industry has slowed in the past three months, Paul Cheeseright writes. The latest survey of business trends, conducted by the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands, shows that the proportion of companies experiencing an increase in domestic orders fell to 37 per cent in November from 46 per cent in May.</p>

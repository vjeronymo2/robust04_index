			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO TO BAR ALCOHOL AT CENTER;  </P> <P> ISSUE PITS SENIOR CITIZENS AGAINST PARENTS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN  </P> <P> "I will never have on my conscience the death of a child or anyone else due to  drinking and driving," said Mayor William S. Craycraft before casting his vote  to keep alcohol out of the Oso Viejo Community and Senior Center and all other  city-owned facilities. "It's important we be consistent in our policy across  the board."  </P> <P> But Councilman Norman P. Murray, who cast the dissenting vote, said, "I'm  personally convinced that grandma and grandpa are not the problem in this  community."  </P> <P> The issue of allowing consumption of alcoholic drinks at the Community and  Senior Center has pitted angry parents whose children go to school near the  center against seniors who want alcoholic drinks available at their club  activities.  </P> <P> "Alcohol has its place and our city parks are not that place," said John  Landgard, a father of four students who attend nearby Fred Newhart Elementary  School, told council members.  </P> <P> Parent Eileen Fallman added: "We think the city and senior citizens need to set  an example for our young people by saying, 'Yes, we can have social activities  without alcohol.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approval Sought  </P> <P> Seniors had sought council approval to allow alcohol to be served at the center  by nonprofit groups able to provide proof of insurance and a refundable deposit  of $250. The new policy, however, would not have allowed the sale of alcohol.  And consumption of such beverages would be restricted to the senior wing of the  community center, said city Parks and Recreation Director Wayne Lowery.  </P> <P> For Holly Kunkle, a mother of two and a spokeswoman for the parents' group, the  issue is not one of age but of alcohol consumption near a park and the Newhart  School.  </P> <P> "We feel that the site is unworkable for the recommendation," she explained.  "(The center) is surrounded by playgrounds and playing fields. My family uses  the park and my children attend the school."  </P> <P> Ed Kearns, a senior who frequents the community center, said he believes  opponents of the proposal are discriminating against seniors.  </P> <P> "I think (opponents) are more concerned that seniors (who would drive after  consuming alcohol) would be jeopardizing their kids than they are with alcohol  in a park," explained Kearns, who also is commander of the Region 58 chapter of  the Veterans of Foreign Wars. "That is a fallacy on their part."  </P> <P> "(The seniors) are upper-middle-class people with children and grandchildren  and they know the responsibilities of driving," he said. "They're not going to  drink a gallon of wine and go out driving."  </P></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: An alternative 'tv' man - Theatre EDDIE IZZARD, the stand-up comic playing at the Ambassadors, calls himself a tv man, by which he means transvestite not television. He has a mop of blond hair with an engaging fringe that could be female. He wears a black tunic with a plunging neckline and gold buttons, black tights and highish heels. The earings are discrete and the nail varnish more pink than red. The transvestite jokes run very well for about quarter of an hour. When he thought about coming out of the closet, he says that some people suggested a better term would be coming out of the lounge. He also claims to be dyslexic and not quite sure what transvestism means: transistorism perhaps? As quickly becomes clear, he is a very good comedian who has to dress somehow. References to television take over from the other form of tv very early on. The Daleks and Dr Who are never far away from his act. Izzard has a number of fascinations. In no particular order, they include religion, dinosaurs, small insects and, above all, language and ordinary human behaviour. Oddly engough for a satirist, politics is scarcely mentioned: John Major not at all. He can probably beat a Jehovah's Witness on a Sunday morning game, set and match. For the Witnesses, as he correctly points out, have no new thought input, whereas he can talk for two days at a stretch and is bursting with irrelevant information: hence their retreat from his doorstep. He wonders why Jesus wore flip-flops, what God thinks when people consistently mumble the Lord's Prayer and why they have to ask forgiveness for trespassing - 'not the most heinous of sins'. Reverting to dyslexia, he suggests that invisible letters would be just as logical. He has a brief go at the Queen and her annus horribilis. Where did she get that from? She knocked it out as if we all say it all the time. There is other fun with Latin tags. In his brief history of evolution, he stresses the role of homo 45 degreesus. Izzard is at his best on London transport and the current wave of disruptions. He thinks there is a conspiracy to place nutty people on buses, but that civilised people have a way of dealing with them: they simply stare straight ahead. Izzard stares, as he does all his acting, very convincingly. Like most stand-up comics in a theatre, he goes on too long - a good 2 1/2 hours. He proably knows it. There is a splendid moment at the end when he threatens to come back for a third act. His technique is to pretend to be disorderly while more or less maintaining the threads. I did not laugh out loud quite as much as some of the audience, but the chuckle level is high. The Ambassadors is just the right small theatre for this kind of show.</p>

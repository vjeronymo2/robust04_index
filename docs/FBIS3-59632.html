The object of this fantasy: The 14-hectare  sludge hole between Bitterfeld and Wolfen, where an evil mixture  of sulfite lye, lignin, cellulose, sulfates, bleaching waters,  hydrogen sulfides and carbon disulfides, salts, alcohols,  phenols and solvents is swimming. For years, toxic waste from  the Wolfen film factory created the pool of muck, which--because  of its shimmering surface--after the unification became world  famous as Silver Lake.    Now, a company in the region wants to perform a miracle and  free the residents of nearby Wolfen-Wachtendorf from the stench  of this sewer. The Sangerhaeuser Maschinenfabrik (SAMAG), which,  together with its subsidiaries, takes part in the cleanup of the  former film factory, promises to return the water to ecological  balance with its Aqua-life unit.    To begin with, a large-scale test has been under way since  June. Independent environmental laboratories are taking samples  every day and checking on the progress. The decision is to be  made at the beginning of October. Then, if this succeeds beyond  all doubt, a large assault can be made with additional equipment  even this year. This is aimed first at the surface of the  Silbersee. "The thin layer of water over two million cubic  meters of sludge must first resume its function as a  hydrological stopper," SAMAG's laboratory chief Axel Koenig  explains the principle. This plug will first be enriched with  atmospheric oxygen. Then the developing harmful gases will  already be oxidized and mineralized below the surface, Koenig  anticipates. At the same time bacterial cultures are to initiate  biological breakdown processes. The cleanup people's vision:  Complete food chains from microorganisms to fish are to be  recreated in the oxygen-rich water. Later on, the "disarmed"  sludge could be dredged up almost without odor and burned.    The cleanup is not without risk. To be sure, in the  jelly-like mass of the pit there are only small quantities of  heavy metals, says Koenig, and the ground water is protected by  a barrier of lignin. The real difficulty threatens on top: "A  major danger is that with large additions of air into the not  quite 30-centimeter-thin layer of the surface water, the entire  brew will begin to churn," the laboratory chief fears.    Within the space of three months microbiologists, flow  technicians, designers, engineers and workers designed and built  a "special ship" which is to overcome the problems: At the end,  they gave the discharge from the mobile water purification unit  the form of a snout. It avoids swirling up the shallow water.    The technical principle is a Venturi system that sucks up  polluted water. In the aerator part it is squeezed through a  "throat" and mixed with air, which intensifies the oxygen  absorption of the water. Subsequently, the water passes through  a 15-meter-long flow channel with columns of biological growth  surfaces. When the light, oxygen-rich mixture flows through, on  the one hand it promotes the growth of microorganisms. On the  other, it tears off the overhanging part of the growth and  carries it off with the water. That is how new life is supposed  to originate.    Naturally, SAMAG administrator Eckart Harrmann is more  fascinated by the economic than the technical aspects. "If we  get the final contract for cleaning up the Silbersee, with  another six to 12 units it will become a million-mark deal," he  calculates. The image of "having cleaned up to some extent" the  notorious sewer would be a priceless reference "in the eyes of  the world."    Even now, Harrmann convincingly praises the Aqua-life  purification system from Sangerhausen. It can be used in creeks,  rivers, and standing waters as well as in conventional treatment  plants. All it needs is a power supply. Harrmann adds: "The cost  of hiring our services until the end of a cleanup mission is  low." The company thus accommodates the strained financial  situation in many companies and municipalities.</p>

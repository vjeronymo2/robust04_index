In an appeal titled "Let us defend Korea, the bastion of the  world revolution," it said socialist Korea guided by dear  Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding leader of the Korean  revolution and the world revolution, represents an ideal human  society.    Charging that the United States and the South Korean  authorities are working round the clock in nuclear war  preparations against a peaceful reunification of Korea, the  appeal said that though the United States is now trying to  stifle Korea, it would try to conquer another country tomorrow.    It stressed that to defend Korea means to safeguard world  peace and security, crop the U.S. feathers, defend the bastion  of the world revolution and build an independent world and bring  a bright future earlier.    It called on all the countries of the world to cooperate  with  each other in close unity.</p>

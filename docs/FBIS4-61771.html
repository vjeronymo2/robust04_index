			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Kislov: "Soviet Power in Mordovia </F> Advances Against Russian President's Positions"]    [Text] Republic of Mordovia -- IZVESTIYA has already  reported the decision by the Mordovian Supreme Soviet Presidium  to restore soviet power in city and rayons. President Yeltsin  has directed that the republic's legal acts be verified for  conformity to the Russian Constitution. The ink was not yet dry  on the directive when Mordovian parliamentarians dealt yet  another blow to the prestige of the head of state by deciding to  abolish the post of his representative in the republic.    Having put a stranglehold on the Council of Ministers, whose  chairman, Valeriy Shvetsov, was hospitalized following a heart  attack, the deputies set about the president's representative,  Prof. Valentin Konakov. An authoritative man in the republic,  he occupies a firmly reformist stance and is erecting  substantial obstacles to the implementation of the idea of full  power for the soviets. At a closed sitting of the Supreme  Soviet Presidium the deputies decided to propose that President  Yeltsin abolish the institution of his representative in the  republic.    Probably not hopeful that the head of state would look  kindly  on their demarche, they decided to take a shortcut and try to  remove V. Konakov.    A report, framed in black, appeared in the prosoviet paper  MORDOVIYA about a recent meeting between Nikolay Biryukov,  chairman of the Mordovian Supreme Soviet, and Boris Yeltsin. It  talks of the warm reception accorded to the Mordovian speaker by  the president. During the conversation Biryukov apparently  asked the president what kind of state system he had in mind for  Mordovia -- parliamentary or presidential? To which Yeltsin  allegedly replied that it was a matter for the republic itself.  The speaker then raised the question of the removal of V.  Konakov from his post, describing him as a man who had fallen  out with the representative and executive authorities in  Mordovia. The president apparently reacted by saying: "We can  do without representatives like that."    Knowing the predilection of the speaker and his newspaper  for  wishful thinking, people in the republic doubt whether the  report is authentic. But it is bound to cause serious concern.  If the president does "abandon" Konakov the proccess of  restoring the old order in Mordovia will be complete.</p>

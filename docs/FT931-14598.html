			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / France raises tobacco tax TOBACCO taxes in France rise by 15 per cent today as part of the government's anti-smoking drive, but the move has prompted a fresh round of price cutting among cigarette companies. RJ Reynolds, the US tobacco group, is to cut the retail price of its Winston brand in France by nearly 16 per cent to FFr10 (Pounds 1.21) for a packet of 20, matching the price for blond Gauloises made by Seita, the state-owned tobacco group. While cigarette companies are free to set their own prices the move risks undermining government attempts to curb smoking, following lax application of a recent law to ban smoking in public buildings. A second tobacco tax rise, of 15 per cent, is due on May 24. Other brands, including Seita-owned ones, are to absorb some of the increases in their profit margins. Blonde Gauloises, for example, will go up by only 9 per cent, although higher-tar dark Gauloises will rise by 17 per cent. Philip Morris, another US tobacco group, has said it will increase its prices by an average 9.5 per cent. RJ Reynolds said it was attempting to close the price gap between its premium brands and cheaper French competition rather than trying to spark a price war.</p>

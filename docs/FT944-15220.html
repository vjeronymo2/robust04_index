			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gaic shares up 9% as market sees Ferfin bid Shares in Gaic, the Italian finance company, rose by nearly 9 per cent yesterday, following comments on Monday by the chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the financial holding company which controls a large stake in Gaic. Mr Guido Rossi was reported to have said that Ferfin was 'examining the problem' of Gaic, which in turn owns about 30 per cent of Fondiaria, the quoted Italian insurer. Gaic has been at the centre of speculation for months, and the markets yesterday interpreted Mr Rossi's comment as a hint that Ferfin was set to mount abid for the 20 per cent of Gaic freely traded.</p>

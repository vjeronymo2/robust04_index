			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 2 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Regarding negotiations in the automobiles and auto  parts sector in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, the  Japanese Government will propose to visiting U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor the creation of a third-party organ  to gauge the degree of foreign companies' participation in the  Japanese market based on the objective criteria to be set.  Japan believes that because an assessment in relation to the  objective criteria at the governmental level is expected to give  rise to confrontation, it is necessary to set up a neutral  arbitration body. However, negotiations on these criteria to  guide the third-party organ are also expected to experience  rough sailing because the United States wants to include virtual  numerical targets in the objective criteria.    The proposed third-party organ will assess the openness of  the market based on the objective criteria to be set by both  countries. Membership in this body will be decided later. There  are suggestions that scholars and private companies be asked to  belong to this organ.    As for the specific objective criteria, Japan proposes to  include the following: the actual volume of Japanese imports of  finished cars and auto parts, the number of sales outlets  dealing in imported cars, and the number of right-hand-drive  cars and bantam cars tailored to the needs of the Japanese  market. The third-party organ is supposed to assess performance  every six months based on these criteria.    Thus far in the framework talks negotiations, the United  States has been persuading the Japanese automobile industry to  set up a joint committee which will promote cooperation between  private companies in both countries. It therefore does not  consider the third-party organ merely a body for assessing the  objective criteria but also expects it to act as an intermediary  between companies.    According to a government source, the U.S. Government shows  great interest in creating a third-party organ. It "has also  expressed the desire to set up assessment bodies for areas other  than automobiles." However, the United States wants to include  the future percentage of increases in sales of U.S. products in  the objective criteria and to ask the third-party organ to  assess performance in terms of the extent to which targets have  been met. Japan rejects this, deeming that "this will, in fact,  amount to numerical targets." There is still a wide gap between  the two countries' views on the role of the third-party organ.</p>

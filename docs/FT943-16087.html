			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Lean eagle fights a fat turkey: Quentin Peel asks whether Deutsche Telekom will prove attractive to investors when it is privatised Own goal for Germany,' the banner headline over a full-page advertisement in the mass circulation Bild Zeitung trumpeted, as the World Cup football matches were getting under way last month. It showed a dismal-looking German eagle, feathers flying, watching helplessly as a football flashed by. But it had nothing to do with football. The advertisement was a desperate appeal by the German state post and telecommunications services to their employees not to go on strike. That would amount to an own goal, they said. Instead, they urged them to back a pay deal which would allow the reform of the entire sector to go ahead, leading to the eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly, Postdienst, the postal service, and Postbank, the postal savings bank. In the early hours of last Saturday morning, the employers and the trade union reached agreement. It was greeted with almost universal relief. The accord preserves for the 670,000 workers in the industry a comprehensive package of social benefits, cheap housing, health insurance and the like, as well as strict rules preventing redundancies, for up to three years. The employers said the deal went to the limits of what was 'entrepreneurially responsible'. Despite their failure to renegotiate the industry's fringe benefits, their fear of delaying the privatisation process proved too great to resist. On Friday, the last parliamentary step in the process - approval in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament - is expected to be a formality. On January 1 1995, Deutsche Telekom will become an Aktiengesellschaft (AG) - a joint stock company - and from some time in early 1996 the privatisation process proper will be launched with a first share issue. That will raise, it is hoped, between DM15bn (Pounds 6bn) and DM20bn. Yet many observers fear that the pay deal will prove to have been another own goal for the telecommunications giant itself. It will be coming to the market encumbered with massive debt and a host of burdens from its public-sector past, which could make it decidedly unattractive for private investors. 'There are a lot of questions still to be answered,' says Mr Evan Miller, telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers. 'They will have to address them very specifically when they publish their prospectus.' Not that Deutsche Telekom is shy with facts and figures. When the management board faced press and analysts at the annual press conference last week, simultaneously broadcast from Bonn to London and Singapore, the audience was inundated with statistics. Turnover has been growing by leaps and bounds, thanks not least to an explosion of new users in east Germany, Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief executive, declared. It was up 9.3 per cent last year to DM59bn, and in eastern Germany up from DM3.5bn to DM4.5bn. Its investment programme in the east has transformed the former communist state from a telecommunications backwater, where only one in 10 had a telephone, and a single rainstorm could knock out tens of thousands of lines, to a country enjoying more modern technology than the west. The cumulative cost of modernisation will have been DM60bn by 1997, by when 7.2m connections will be installed, as well as 360,000 fax connections, 50,000 packet-switched data links, 5m TV cable connections, a complete digitalised switching system, optical fibre networks, and mobile communications networks covering the entire territory. Ironically it is the sheer scale of that investment which has many observers worried. Telekom has had three huge projects running simultaneously: the eastern investment, the construction of a television cable network, now covering 14m households - the densest in Europe - and the establishment of mobile telephone networks. 'They are a company positioning themselves to be a global player, and to get into all the key parts of the business,' according to one Frankfurt industry expert. A considerable strength is Telekom's control not only of the terrestrial telephone infrastructure in Germany, but also of the dense cable network, opening up options for multimedia transmission. Its recent deals with France Telecom, and the purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Sprint, the US telecommunications company, fits with the strategy of internationalisation. So does a push into eastern Europe, led by the purchase of a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian telephone company, a stake in Ukrainian Telecommunications, and an expected stake in the Czech telephone system under negotiation. On the downside come the burdens of the past. The biggest is the debt burden, now standing at DM107bn, or almost 70 per cent of the balance sheet, and rapidly inflated by the heavy investments of recent years. Another concern is the unresolved pension question for Telekom's employees. More than 120,000 of the 230,000 employees will retain their status of civil servant. They cannot be fired, and will receive 75 per cent of their final salary in guaranteed pension. The other employees have obtained deals with many of the same advantages. Mr Peter Paterna, chairman of the German Bundestag's post and telecommunications committee and a leading critic of the privatisation process, estimates the unfinanced burden of pensions and insurance payments for employees at about DM35bn. All three arms of the postal service combined, including the Postbank, face commitments of about DM100bn. As public authorities, they were never required to accumulate the necessary pension funds to pay for the future: they were to be financed from operating income. 'The pensions issue is unresolved,' Mr Miller says. 'It cannot be swept under the rug. It is a big black hole.' Yet he believes the absolute debt level is more worrying. 'The interest burden is very real,' he says. What reassured many investment analysts who attended Telekom's presentation last week was the prediction that the current investment programme is peaking, and by 1996, cash flow will exceed capital expenditure, thus gradually bringing the debt burden down. Nevertheless, they still believe that Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, may have to take over a portion of the debt burden to make Telekom shares more attractive in 1996. There has also been an explosion of potential competitors from the private sector, getting ready to compete with the monopoly once the EU enforces competition in voice telephone services from 1998. The first was Mannesmann, already operating a mobile phone network, which has joined forces with RWE, the electricity utility, and Deutsche Bank to offer corporate networks. Few expect them to stop there once the market is open. As the telecommunications market place starts to look crowded, for Telekom 'the real question is to assess the level to which they are becoming customer-facing, which means recognising the fact that they are a service company,' says Mr Tim Hurst, telecoms analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'The customer should be the measure of all things,' says Mr Horst Gellert, the board director responsible for customer relations. The prospect of privatisation is certainly having a galvanising effect, but there is still a good way to go. 'They are working their way up the learning curve,' says Mr Miller. 'Meetings with analysts still remain long and painfully detailed.' In spite of a massive public relations exercise, with young ladies in lilac and grey suits popping up at public events all over Germany and abroad, Deutsche Telekom still has a fair way to go to persuade a sceptical investing public that it will be a lean and profitable competitor in the harsh telecoms market round the turn of the century.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Telekom: own goal?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Customer connections      1989     1992     1993     92-93     89-93 ('000s)                                              growth   growth  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East                     1,800    3,100    4,150      34%      130% West                    28,850   32,300   32,900       2%       14% Total                   30,650   35,400   37,050       5%       21% ISDN channels               15      620    1,120      81%    7,400% Cable connections        6,250   11,820   13,500      14%      116% Mobile phones              185      850    1,280      51%      590%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Deutsche Telekom  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

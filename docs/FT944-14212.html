			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Frankfurt - Other Markets The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but James Capel argues that stubbornly high inflation and rising capacity utilisation argue against further rate cuts. On the corporate front, the utilities will be in focus, with RWE holding its annual balance sheet press conference and Veba meeting analysts. UBS does not expect major financial surprises but says there is likely to be substantial information presented on the telecommunications activities and both companies should continue their strong performances on the back of these details.

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 200 RALLY AGAINST JAIL EXPANSION PLAN  </P> <P> About 200 demonstrators from four communities near downtown Los Angeles  converged on the Men's Central Jail on Monday evening to protest a proposed  expansion at the facility.  </P> <P> "The county hasn't taken an objective look at the appropriateness of expansion  at this location, because it was assumed there would be little opposition from  the surrounding immigrant communities," City Councilman Michael Woo said.  </P> <P> Residents and merchants from Chinatown, Olvera Street, Lincoln Heights, and  Little Tokyo displayed signs and shouted slogans as they marched from their  neighborhoods to the jail on Bauchet Street, where the county has proposed  adding 2,408 beds, bringing the capacity to 9,000 inmates.  </P> <P> Woo, fellow Councilman Richard Alatorre and state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los  Angeles) joined the protesters during the march and at a rally in the jail's  parking lot, where they demanded that county supervisors scrap the preliminary  environmental impact on the expansion and schedule new public hearings.  </P></p>

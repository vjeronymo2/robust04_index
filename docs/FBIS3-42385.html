Kovalenok under the rubric "Military Reform and  Higher Educational Institutions": "Preserve and Augment  Pedagogical-Science Potential"]    [Text] A practical-science conference with the  participation of representatives of a number of directorates of  the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the higher  educational institutions of all branches of the armed forces of  the Russian Federation was held in October of 1992 at the Air  Forces Engineering Academy imeni Professor N.Ye. Zhukovskiy.  Dissatisfaction with the current situation in the system of  higher military education was distinctly heard in the papers and  presentations. The contribution of higher educational science to  resolving defense tasks in particular is being hindered by the  sharp reduction in appropriations for its development and the  lack of a streamlined mechanism for mutual relations between  state budgetary and economically accountable structures, as well  as the principles of financial and economic activity in the army  and navy under conditions of cutbacks in the size of the armed  forces and the transition to a market economy. The chief of the  Air Forces Engineering Academy, Candidate of Military Sciences  and Professor Colonel-General of Aviation V. Kovalenok, shares  his thoughts on this problem.    The results of the conference confirmed yet again that the  military academies and leading higher educational institutions  of the branches of the Armed Forces today should be considered  centers supporting the unity of the educational and scientific  processes in the training of specialists for the 21st century.  Meanwhile, the rapid outflow of young and promising staffers and  experienced instructors to commercial structures is taking  place, and the aspiration of the trained cadres to serve only  until they reach pension age is progressing, owing to their  limited independence in creating and reforming the scientific-  educational subunits, training and certifying pedagogical cadres  and awarding them military ranks, as well as the lack of a  flexible mechanism of material incentives for the labor of  military scholars.    The leadership of the Air Forces is taking certain steps in  order to eliminate these causes. For example, specialists at a  number of scientific-research institutions, in conjunction with  representatives of our academy, are currently formulating a  conceptual model for a unified system of training for  engineering and scientific-pedagogical cadres for the Air  Forces. A leading place in that is relegated to the development  of new educational programs and progressive training  technologies.    The academy, from the standpoint of the new requirements, is  also engaged in the training of aviation engineers in seventeen  fields and nine specialties, as well as doctors and candidates  of sciences in doctoral studies, campus or off-campus graduate  study and through dissertations. A rise in the qualifications of  attendees in academic courses of study has been organized. Such  intensive training of military cadres in many fields poses  strict demands for the level of pedagogical mastery and  scientific maturity of the professor and instructor personnel. I  can assert with full confidence that the scientific-pedagogical  potential of the academy (there are 96 doctors and more than 500  candidates of sciences today) by and large meets the behest of  the times. And that is no accident, since we devote constant  attention to augmenting it. The capacity of campus graduate  studies alone is 235 places today. Some 199 doctors and 2,512  candidates of sciences have been trained since the time the  academy was created. More than 400 people are working on their  dissertations today, including 36 at the doctoral level. The  subject matter of scientific works is aimed first and foremost  at raising the combat readiness and quality of aviation  engineering support for the combat operations of the Air Forces  with a regard for trends in the development of the means of  armed struggle, flight safety, reliability and combat  survivability, reducing the detectability of aircraft and  creating more effective weaponry, piloting, navigational and  sighting systems and means of aerial reconnaissance and  electronic warfare, including those founded on new principles  and phenomena of physics.    I would like to emphasize that improving the systems for  training pedagogues and scholars at our academy is not an end in  itself. The work in this area, after all, is oriented toward the  end result--the high professionalism of the graduates and the  pursuit of basic scientific research. The amount of that, by the  way, has increased by one-and-a-half times compared to 1989.    The solution of the problem of preserving and supplementing  the scientific potential of the academy, at the same time,  entails certain difficulties--as it does, by the way, at other  higher educational institutions as well. This pertains first and  foremost to the realization of the Statute on the Completion of  Active Military Service, especially by highly skilled scholars.  Statistics show that a pedagogue reaches the pinnacle of  academic maturity at 45--50 years of age. And that is just the  age when he is subject to discharge into the reserves. I cite as  an example the fact that 25 (!) doctors of sciences who had  served out the stipulated term left the walls of the academy in  1987 and 1988 alone. We must urgently seek out reserves and make  up for the losses. We have been left standing this time. If the  cutbacks in the army continue to proceed by treating everyone  alike in the future as well, however, there soon will not be a  single doctor of sciences left at the higher educational  institutions. I think there is no need to say where that could  lead.    A maximum age for military service of 60 years for doctors  of  sciences and 55 for candidates must be established in this  regard, in the opinion of participants in the conference, once  and for all getting rid of the willful approach to the procedure  for discharging them, allowing the academic councils of the  higher educational institutions to determine independently the  term of service of each leading scholar individually and  shifting the positions of the professor and instructor personnel  from the category of military to civilian and vice versa.    Much could be resolved at the local level using internal  resources. A program to replenish and further increase the  scientific potential of the academy, which envisages the  training of 5--10 doctors and 80--100 candidates of sciences  every year, has been developed here and is now being realized.  We are getting support for this undertaking from the leadership  of the Air Forces. The commander-in-chief, with his sights set  on the long term, has approved the range of dissertation topics  through 1995, and approved a plan to equip the academy with  models of new-generation aviation hardware and armaments and the  unique equipment without which the process of training  engineering personnel is inconceivable.    Experience testifies that the replenishment of the  scientific- pedagogical potential of the higher educational  institutions takes place principally through the training of  graduate students within their own walls. Taking this  circumstance into account, and so as not to scatter manpower and  resources, it would be worth concentrating this work, in my  opinion, only at the military academies and leading higher  educational institutions of the branches of the armed forces  that have well- developed experimental bases and scientific  schools as compared to other educational establishments of the  Ministry of Defense, as well as expanding the rights of chiefs  at the higher educational institutions to select worthy  candidates in the ranks to be admitted to graduate study and to  determine the times for the start of their study.    The necessity of a comprehensive approach to strengthening  the intellectual potential of the Air Forces furthermore  suggests the expediency of instituting the standard positions of  professor, docent and apprentice instructor at the higher  educational institutions for servicemen, and academic  secretaries of the specialized and academic councils at the  academies.    I think it would not be revealing any great secret if I were  to mention the fact that the supervisory personnel of all the  higher educational institutions without exception of the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will have to  search for additional sources of material and technical support  for the teaching process, under the conditions of sharp cutbacks  in appropriations for the development of science, and in  particular military science. Matters are still proceeding,  frankly speaking, with some difficulty owing to a lack of  experience. The necessity is thus arising of creating an  economically accountable scientific-research center at every  higher educational institution, the chief direction of the  activity of which would be to choose the sale of the "scientific  and technical products" of the higher educational institution  and to obtain additional--I emphasize, extrabudgetary--funds for  the further development of the educational and scientific bases,  the resolution of problems of social protections for the  personnel etc. Such a center should undoubtedly function within  the context of stipulated legislation, under the monitoring of  the command, the financial bodies of the educational institution  and representatives of the scientific community.    There is another problem of no small importance that was  vividly revealed during the years of "restructuring" in the  former USSR, and has remained topical for the armed forces of  Russia today as well. I have in mind the drop in prestige of the  military education of the youth. I am profoundly convinced that  the necessity of certifying a number of the higher educational  institutions of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation, and first and foremost the military academies, has  become acute within the process of reforming higher schooling. I  feel that such a step would make it possible for them to become  competitive not only within the state, but at the international  level as well, and would ensure an appreciable influx to them of  both Russians and foreign servicemen.    The proposals that I have expressed must naturally be  considered through the prism of the educational process of each  higher educational institution separately. I hope that they will  find reflection in the policy of military reform, and will help  us to preserve and augment the scientific-pedagogical potential  of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

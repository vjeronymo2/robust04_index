			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Labour defends decision Labour is to avoid making manifesto commitments in order to foil Tory hopes of exploiting public-spending pledges. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, yesterday defended his party's decision not to make promises it could not keep. He admitted the decision against making spending pledges was a 'tough strategy' and one which left the party open to some 'difficult questions'. But he insisted: 'We are not in the position now to start writing the manifesto. We are a party that is a government-in-waiting now, and we have got to act like that, and we have got to put things honestly before people.' His comments on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme came after Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, last week faced calls for a 'return to clear socialist commitments' after his order to avoid spending pledges. Thirty-four Labour MPs, mainly from the left of the party, tabled a Commons motion challenging Mr Smith's decision to steer clear of commitments which the party might not be able to honour in government.</p>

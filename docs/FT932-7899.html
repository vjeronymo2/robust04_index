			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Smith applauds 'full and active' union role in party MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, said yesterday he was 'proud' of the unions' links with his party and hoped they would continue to play a 'full and active' role in it. He believed this autumn's party conference would approve the 'twin-track strategy' of one member, one vote for the selection of parliamentary candidates and the creation of a 'much larger participating membership'. Mr Smith said at the launch of the political-fund ballot of the AEEU engineering union that he was convinced that the links between party and unions remained as valid and as strong as ever. 'The debate is about modernising our relationship, not ending it,' he said. 'I want to encourage the involvement of as many trade union members as possible in all the party's activities.' The 900,000-strong AEEU is the first big union to hold its political-fund ballot. Under the 1984 Trade Union Act all unions with political funds separate from their general financial funds must win the approval of their members for the political funds by secret ballot at least once every 10 years. Over the next 12 months all 31 unions with such funds will ballot their members on their continuation. In 1985-1986, when the first such ballots took place, 20 unions acquired political funds for the first time. Not all unions with political funds are affiliated to the Labour party. Unaffiliated unions include the Nalgo local government union and the Civil and Public Services Association. Any union that wishes to finance lobbies of parliament or campaigns against government policy is required by law to do so from a legally recognised political fund. There are now 51 out of the total of 301 unions - covering just under 6m members - which have political funds totalling Pounds 18m. Only 29 of the 51 are affiliated to Labour, but they provided just over Pounds 4m of the party's Pounds 6m income in 1991. AEEU leaders stressed yesterday that they had decided to hold an early political-fund ballot to ensure that the government met 75 per cent of the Pounds 200,000 cost to the union. Two months ago the Department of Employment decided to phase out state funding of such ballots by April 1996.</p>

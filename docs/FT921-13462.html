			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Press picks over Maxwell's lair MR Robert Maxwell would have absolutely loathed the invasion of his private sanctum. But hordes of journalists were taken on conducted tours of his London apartment yesterday in preparation for an auction of its contents next month. Everything must go, from duvet covers to pots and pans which were once used to produce delicacies for Mr Maxwell 24 hours a day. Tangible remains of the Maxwell lifestyle will be sold on February 14, by Sotheby's, the auction house, on behalf of Price Waterhouse, administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation. The sale is expected to raise about Pounds 400,000. It will include items such as a 16ft Regency three-pillar dining table which is estimated to be worth between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 35,000. Journalists inspected every room leading off the octagonal hall of the apartment designed and decorated by Mr Jon Bannenberg, who also designed the Lady Ghislaine, the yacht on which Mr Maxwell was last seen alive. A television cameraman lined up a close shot of the open door of Mr Maxwell's drinks fridge to reveal Russian vodka, Czechoslovakian pilsner beer and champagne of 1983 vintage. In the drawing room, photographers used a well-thumbed copy of Joe Haines' authorised biography of Maxwell as a convenient prop. There were three lines of obvious approval in the margin of the book against a quote from Prof MMR Williams. 'One thing Maxwell does not do is interfere in editorial decisions; in that respect, he is the ideal person to act as a publisher of scientific journals,' the quote said. In the kitchen, lists of telephone numbers pinned to the walls excited reporters. They were the mobile numbers of all the Maxwell family and of the suppliers of basic foods such as caviar to the Maxwell household. Security men were quickly dispatched to take the numbers down. They are now of no more than historic interest. All the mobile phones have long since been disconnected. There was every sign that the apartment, on the ninth floor of Maxwell House in New Fetter Lane, had been completely untouched since its master went on his last cruise. In his bedroom, dominated by a large television set and hi-fi equipment at the foot of his double bed, there are half-empty boxes of tissues. A well-used loofah lies in a white circular jacuzzi of ample proportions. Off the bathroom is Mr Maxwell's personal sauna complete with television set. As well as conventional equipment such as a fax machine, his study has its own shredder - Gelia Top Secret - in perfect working order. The impromptu tour was conducted by Mr Leslie Weller, who described himself as 'Sotheby's furniture man'. He praised the Regency table in the hall, estimated to be worth about Pounds 10,000, and the Baltic-Russian coza-oil burning chandelier in the dining room which may be worth between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 20,000. In the drawing room, with more than a touch of understatement, Mr Weller said: 'Here you have got slightly flamboyant taste in settees.' The only thing apparently missing was Mr Maxwell's chess set, perhaps a personal rather than an MCC possession. Berlitz stake dispute, Page 20</p>

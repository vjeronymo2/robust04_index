			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Forestry reforms under attack The government's plans for introducing market reforms into the way Britain's forests are run will come under criticism today by two environmental groups, Deborah Hargreaves writes. The Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds fear that imposing a more business-like structure on Forest Enterprise, the commercial arm of the Forestry Commission, could be a way of preparing it for privatisation. In August the government announced Forest Enterprise would become an executive agency under its 'next steps' programme aimed at increasing efficiency. This followed widespread opposition to plans to sell the 1.1m hectares of state-owned woodlands. The environmental groups are concerned that the new agency will be forced to operate too much like a private-sector company at the expense of public benefits. But the public will not be impressed if the agency proposal turns out simply to be a way of privatising by the back door.' A Step Forward For Our Forests.

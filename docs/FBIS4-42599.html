			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gallup Institute and Bjorn Moller: "Social </F> Democrats Poised for Advance"]    [Excerpts] The Social Democratic Party (SDP) is poised to  make significant gains in the election for the European  Parliament, according to a new Gallup poll. But at the same time  the Liberals are holding steady.    Every three weeks in advance of the European Parliament  election the Gallup Institute has conducted a survey on popular  support for the parties and lists currently in the running.    The poll shows that 59 percent of the voters have now  decided  to vote for a particular party or list, and this is a clear rise  in relation to the corresponding poll conducted 10 days earlier  in which 51 percent had decided on a party. Not surprising, the  share who are still in doubt has at the same time fallen from 35  to 29 percent of voters.    The poll shows that the SDP is now looking at a significant  gain, both in relation to preceding poll and to the European  Parliament election in 1989. In that year the SDP got 23.3  percent of the votes, and this is also where the party stood in  the poll of 15 May.    In the current survey, the party has an 8-percent gain -- to  a strong 31 percent of voters. Accordingly, the SDP has gained  the support among many who only recently have made their party  selection. It is interesting that the SDP is just as strong  among both yes and no voters who had decided on a party in the  European Union [EU] referendum of 18 May 1993. Among yes voters,  the party gets 31 percent, while among no voters it gets 30  percent.    The election's big winner, however, still appears to be the  Liberals. In the preceding Gallup poll, that party had 28  percent of votes among those who had decided on a party, and an  equally large share supports the party in the current poll.    But it can accordingly be said that Liberal voters decided  early on this party, and for many people this was surely because  of the Liberals' clear stance on the EU.    Specifically, the party has very strong support among those  who voted yes in the 1993 EU referendum. Some 39 percent of the  yes voters from 1993 who had chosen a party then will vote for  the Liberals this time, while only 9 percent of the referendum  no voters intend to cast their ballot for the party this time.  [passage omitted]    The statistical margin of error in these polls is between 1  and 3 percent, so that it is smallest for the parties with less  support and largest for parties with more support. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  SDP Storming Ahead for EU Election </H5>   Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) has fresh  ammunition when he shows up to wrestle Liberals' Chairman Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen [for a debate] on TV 2.    The prime minister can brag about an especially strong poll  gain for his party just three weeks before the election to the  European Parliament. [passage omitted]    "This is fantastically neat," says Frank Jensen, the party  political spokesman. He is not in doubt that the gain is  especially due to the prime minister's performance in the TV  duel with Ellemann-Jensen last week. At the same time, he also  thinks that the SDP campaign has begun to have an effect.    "The TV debate showed that the prime minister can deliver  the  goods despite Uffe's effective debating style. At the same time,  it is clear that it is no longer just a matter of yes or no for  the EU," says Jensen.    The poll moreover underlines that the Liberal Party is the  main opponent of the SDP. The Liberals held steady at 28  percent, compared with 16.6 percent in the 1989 election.  Generally all others declined.    Of the 1,597 interviewed, 59 percent had decided on a party.  This is 8 percent more than 10 days ago.    The poll was conducted 13-23 May 1994, during which a  representative sample of 1,597 eligible Danish voters were  contacted by phone.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |"How will you vote in the election for the European Parliament on 9 June?"

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: January date set for Gatt accords Top trade negotiators yesterday agreed to make January 1 1995 the target date for implementation of the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords, committing the leading trading nations to ratifying the accords this year. The date will be formally endorsed by ministers next month when they meet in Marrakesh to sign the Gatt Uruguay Round agreements on April 12-15. Continued wrangling over a US demand for labour rights to go on the agenda for future trade talks prevented approval of a draft ministerial declaration. The row is also blocking agreement on setting up a preparatory committee to manage the transition between the Uruguay signing and establishment of a new World Trade Organisation next year. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt said yesterday he stood ready to call a meeting of senior trade officials next week to try to resolve the worker rights issue. The matter did not pose a threat to the signing of the agreements, but Mr Sutherland said it would be 'very unfortunate' not to have consensus on the ministerial declaration.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> CROATIA COMMUNISTS CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS AS YUGOSLAV SPLITS WIDEN  </P> <P> Political divisions in Yugoslavia widened Monday when the Communist Party in  Croatia called for free multi-party elections next month and the leadership in  Slovenia accused Serbia of aiming to break up the nation.  </P> <P> Communists have been slow in realizing the "historic exhaustion of the  single-party system," said Stanko Stojicevic, head of the Croatian Communist  Party's ruling presidium.  </P> <P> "There can be no democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the  right of association and competition of political (movements) and programs,"  Stojicevic said.  </P> <P> He was speaking in Zagreb at the start of a Croatian party congress where the  policy-making Central Committee adopted a proposal that elections should be  held in January instead of March for the republic's Parliament and should be  wholly free.  </P> <P> The proposal, which must be endorsed by the congress, put Croatia, Yugoslavia's  second largest republic, squarely on the side of Slovenia, whose Communist  Party has pledged to hold free elections next May for the Slovenian Parliament.  </P> <P> It widened the breach between those two regions and Serbia, the largest of  Yugoslavia's six republics, whose Communist leadership has explicitly ruled out  a multi-party system and this month broke all economic relations with Slovenia.  </P> <P> Responding to that move, Slovenian President Janez Stanovnik told his  republic's Parliament: "The ultimate goal of these attacks is not just Slovenia  and its leadership. They were just the first phase of a long-term strategy  whose final phase is the liquidation of Yugoslavia."  </P> <P> Slovenia, which borders Austria and Italy, fears that Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic wants to abolish the power-sharing arrangements between  Yugoslavia's different nationalities and impose Serbian dominance over the  nation.  </P> <P> Croatia's move, which was accompanied by a call to abolish the constitutionally  guaranteed leading political role of the Communist Party, mirrored the plunge  into democracy that every Eastern European country except Romania has taken  this year.  </P> <P> Unlike the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia has been  nonaligned since 1948. But like the others, the Yugoslav Communists had until  this year claimed the exclusive right to rule and refused to allow free  elections.  </P> <P> "The present situation in the Communist Party can be changed only in conditions  of political competition," Stojicevic said. "This is indispensable for the  party's transformation into a modern political organization."  </P></p>

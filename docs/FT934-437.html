			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: The End is Nigh - JDF Jones enjoys an apocalyptic argument COSMOS, CHAOS, AND THE WORLD TO COME by Norman Cohn Yale Pounds 20, 271 pages At this time of year some of us feel the need for a wider perspective beyond the all-invading tinsel and goodwill - for instance, something about nativity myths and miraculous hero-births in other societies, where they are also attended by animals and exotic princes and heavenly portents. Nothing is more welcome than a cool draught of wise and intelligent scholarship after so much sweet sherry. Cosmos, Chaos, and the World to Come is not exactly about nativities, but it will do nicely. Prof Norman Cohn is a British academic, now of ripe years, who wrote a famous book called The Pursuit of the Millennium, which described the Middle Ages phenomenon of a host of apocalyptic - millennial - European movements, which believed that 'there will shortly be a marvellous consummation, when good will be finally victorious over evil . . . the elect will thereafter live . . . without conflict, on a transformed and purified earth'. (The quotation comes from this new book.) That trail-breaking volume started with the early Church and ended with the Anabaptists: the expectation of an imminent transformation of the world gave birth, of course, to political and secular as well as to religious offspring. What he now gives us is a similarly fascinating and lucidly explained investigation asking where this extraordinary idea first came from: and so he goes back into the mythology, as well as the history and theology and literature, of pre-Christian societies. Neither the Egyptians nor the Mesopotamians, for example, had any concept that the world might be made perfect, nor had the Indo-Aryans: the common element in their philosophies was that 'Cosmos' (ie 'order') had been immutably established by the gods; that it was frequently threatened by 'Chaos' (ie destructive forces, enemies, evil), but in the combat between Cosmos and Chaos a young hero - warrior, storm-god - was charged by the gods to repulse Chaos and so win kingship. Prof Cohn guides us carefully, and never tediously, through this particular interpretation of Ancient (in fact, quite late) Near East mythology. His thesis is that, in a major turning point in human consciousness, this combat-myth was re-interpreted and transformed so as to prefigure a prodigious final battle in which the forces of Chaos would be defeated once and for all so that, in the later words of the Book of Revelation, there would be 'a new heaven and a new earth'. Cohn argues that it was Zoroastrianism that broke out of the Cosmos/Chaos equation and turned the combat myth into an apocalyptic faith. Zoroaster, who probably settled in eastern Iran some time between 1500 and 1200 BC, was a priest without honour in his own country who became the first millennarian prophet, preaching a faith that aimed 'to remove every form of disorder from the world, wholly and for ever; to bring about a state in which Cosmos will no longer be threatened by Chaos . . . In place of repeated but incomplete victories we are promised a final and total one'. The influence of Zoroastrianism on the Jewish exiles in the Babylonian Captivity - Cohn maintains - was seminal, as was the Jews' own development of monotheism. The very extremity of the Jews' defeat and humiliation at that time paradoxically served to confirm their acceptance that Yahweh was chastising his own Chosen People; the worse the disasters, the better they could be seen as proof of Yahweh's righteous power, because he was evidently punishing his People for not giving him their exclusive devotion (the theme might serve for a Woody Allen film). Cohn concludes that 'the similarities between Zoroastrianism and the notions one finds in the Jewish apocalpyses are too remarkable to be explained by coincidence'. There followed from this development such notions as the Resurrection, Judgment, Damnation, the person of the Messiah, and the imminent 'coming of the Kingdom'. The way was clear for the popular fantasies of millennarianism, both religious and secular, which have littered the history of the past 2,000 years and which are by no means dead today. There is still a character in Oxford Street proclaiming that 'The End Is Nigh'.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Nadir seeks to recover assets: Move to regain businesses will create problems for Polly Peck administrators MR ASIL NADIR, the former chairman of Polly Peck International who jumped bail last Tuesday to return to his native northern Cyprus, says he plans to fly to Turkey to reclaim the remnants of his business empire. Mr Nadir told reporters over the weekend he would go to the Turkish mainland 'sooner than you think'. This would create new difficulties for Polly Peck administrators attempting to recover assets. Mr Nadir appears to be planning court action to regain control of his various Turkish business interests. Such a move could also place strains on Britain's diplomatic relationship with Turkey, as the UK government continues to apply pressure for Mr Nadir's return from northern Cyprus. Administrators of Polly Peck at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand confirmed that Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus had delayed two disposals of group companies worth Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) after Turkish and Cypriot buyers pulled out because of uncertainty surrounding his intentions. Mr Michael Jordan, a joint administrator, flew to Istanbul on Thursday in an attempt to steer through the sale of Polly Peck's shareholding in Meyna, a fruit company based in Turkey and northern Cyprus, and the sale of the Cypriot pharmaceutical company ICP. A spokesman for Coopers said: 'At best we can say that since Mr Nadir's flight the sales are on hold.' In a telephone interview with Sir David Frost on BBC television yesterday, Mr Nadir repeated his criticisms of his treatment in the UK and reiterated a promise to compensate shareholders in Polly Peck for their losses. He said he was hoping to offer 'a very pleasant surprise' to Polly Peck shareholders but refused to elaborate. If Mr Nadir travels to mainland Turkey he could risk being extradited. Britain has said it will seek his extradition, but Home Office officials played down the chances of a successful application to the Turkish authorities. Under the UK's treaty with Turkey, neither country is obliged to extradite its own nationals. A spokesman said it was possible the Turks might not treat Mr Nadir as immune because he has dual Turkish and Cypriot nationality, but 'that is a question for them'. The precise size of Mr Nadir's Turkish and Cypriot business empire is unclear. Mr Mentesh Aziz, Mr Nadir's personal lawyer, has estimated Mr Nadir's personal wealth at Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m. Mr Aziz said yesterday that according to records in northern Cyprus, Mr Nadir is still a director of the local PPI companies. These include Sunzest, the fruit business, Unipac, the packaging plant, and three hotels - the Palm Beach, the Jasmine Court and the Crystal Cove, although these are thought to be leased from the northern Cyprus government. The administrators estimate the total book value of the northern Cyprus assets, including parts of Meyna and ICP, at about Dollars 40m. In Turkey, Mr Nadir may try to regain Gunaydin, the Istanbul newspaper. Creditors await report, Page 7 Observer, Page 15</p>

(IDO) will open 159 new relay  stations for telephone service on the formula of Motorola Inc.  of the United States within a year and a half starting in April.    -- IDO will transfer 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz radio  frequency on the formula of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT) to the Motorola formula for allocation of 6.5 megahertz to  both formulas.    -- The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular  meetings to assess implementation of the agreement.    -- The radio frequency change will be made with IDO  transferring 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz frequency  allocated to it for the NTT formula to the Motorola formula.    The agreement was reached as a result of a meeting held  Saturday night between Posts and Telecommunications Minister  Takenori Kanzaki and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale,  ministry officials said.    Both governments agreed to hold consultations to assess  implementation of the agreement every three months or on request  by either government, the officials said.    On the basis of a 1989 Japan-U.S. trade accord meant to  boost imports of U.S. cellular phones, IDO began service under  the Motorola formula, in addition to the NTT formula, but the  Motorola-formula service has not spread much.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor accused Japan last  month of breaching the accord and set March 17 as the deadline  for an announcement of sanctions over trade disputes with Japan.    In negotiations with Motorola, IDO proposed in late January  to open 124 new stations for the Motorola-formula service by  March 1997.    Motorola demanded that IDO open 159 new stations for the  Motorola-formula service by February 1995 and allocate 3  megahertz of IDO's 8-megahertz frequency for the NTT-formula  service to the Motorola formula.    IDO made concessions to Motorola's demands to reach the  basic agreement.</p>

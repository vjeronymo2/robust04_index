			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: First Henderson trust since TR merger HENDERSON Touche Remnant is launching its first investment trust since the merger of the two fund management groups late last year. The new trust, which will invest in Japanese smaller companies, is aiming to raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m via a placing and offer for subscription of shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Henderson TR believes that low interest rates and increased government spending will help the Japanese economy to grow appreciably in 1994 and 1995. Low rates will also push investors away from cash and into the stock markets where, although p/e ratios are very high, Henderson TR thinks stocks look attractive on a price-to-cash flow basis. The annual management charge will be 1 per cent of assets, and issue expenses will be capped at 4 per cent. The trust will have an initial life of 10 years. Closing day for applications will be October 14 and dealings are expected to start on October 22.</p>

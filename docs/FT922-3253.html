			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Smith New Court doubles on strong equity turnover BUOYANT TURNOVER in the UK equity market allowed Smith New Court, one of London's leading marketmakers, to more than double profits last year. Pre-tax profits for the year to April 24 amounted to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 7.6m). Earnings per share advanced sharply to 23.4p (4.1p) basic and 16.6p (8.8p) fully diluted. A proposed final dividend of 3.5p brings the total for the year to 4.5p (3.5p). Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said the distribution reflected the policy of paying 'a gently rising dividend' against the background of a cyclical equity market. After dividend payments of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 5.1m), the group transferred Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.7m) to reserves. Total reserves now stand at Pounds 11m. The return on equity was about 20 per cent last year, against an average of 10 per cent for Stock Exchange member firms. Analysts estimated that Smith takes about 20 per cent of UK equity marketmaking and 9 per cent of agency broking business. In 1991, return on equity was only 8 per cent, depressed by the low level of equity market turnover around the time of the Gulf war. In 1990 the group returned 13 per cent on equity. An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.9m was taken to cover the cost of closing the equity broking business in Australia which had operated for five years. The group has no immediate plans to open new offices or close existing operations. Mr Marks said: 'A significant European presence is clearly needed in the longer term and the client base will drive us towards this. Although I do not rule out an acquisition in this area, we are more likely to grow organically.' The results excluded Pounds 10.7m paid by Citibank in March following a US court ruling in favour of Smith over its purchase of shares in Ferranti International Signal in 1989. Citibank has appealed against the award. Mr Marks said Smith intended to 'vigorously defend the appeal', although the process could take over a year. If a favourable ruling on the appeal is achieved, the Pounds 10.7m plus interest will be taken into the profit and loss account.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Last minute dip leaves Footsie down on the day - Market Report The UK equity market did no more than crawl over the finishing line of the year 1994 after one of the quietest trading sessions on record. With only seconds to go before the line was drawn under the FT-SE 100 for the year, a handful of marketmakers tipped the balance in the index by lowering their quotations for British Gas, Glaxo and Allied Domecq. The upshot was that the index, up 0.4 with a minute to go before the veil was brought down on the year, ended the last session a net 0.1 lower at 3,065.5, a last ditch triumph for the bears who have trampled over all attempts to drive the UK equity market higher over the year. Over the year, the FT-SE 100 index has fallen 363.3, or 10.6 per cent, against a 284.8, or 7.5 per cent decline in the second line stocks, as represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 index. Dealers said the better tone in the market reflected a much calmer performance by international bonds after a worryingly turbulent session on Thursday. 'The market game really stopped on Thursday afternoon when bonds, bunds and gilts ran back ahead of, and following, news of the increases in French bank base rates,' said one senior dealer. 'But the feeling around the markets today(Friday) is that the sell-off was overdone,' he added. The performance of gilts yesterday tended to underscore that argument, with the 10-year gilt easing a shade at the outset and then moving up eight ticks before settling unchanged on balance. And there was none of the expected last-minute action in the market's best and worst performers of the year that many marketmakers had been expecting. 'Not an OTC expiry in sight,' said one. The FT-SE 100 had begun the day under light selling pressure, with marketmakers wary of the previous day's sharp sell off in bonds and equities. The index kicked off with a 1.3 decline at 3,064.3 and slipped to a session low of 3,062.9, down 2.7, before responding to the gradual improvement in the gilt-edged market. With gilts quickly moving to post gains of eight ticks shortly after the opening, the 100 index similarly moved into plus-territory, and climbed to a session high of 3,073.1, up 7.5, just before midday. Thereafter interest in the market, which was always minimal, faded away, and the skeleton staffs manning the City's trading desks did little more than head off any attempts to trade by brokers. A firm opening by Wall Street, which came in up around 12 points following an encouraging Chicago Purchasing Managers' index,was largely ignored by the UK market, where the 100 index maintained its quietly firm tone before slipping off at the very end of the session. The utilities areas of the market remained very much in focus with traders speculating on the possibilities of early takeover activity in the water stocks, where the Government's golden shares disappear at midnight tonight, and in the regional electricity stocks which have long been seen as takeover targets. Only one of the water stocks, Wessex, managed to attract turnover in excess of 1m shares. None of the Recs or generators could attract that level of business. Turnover in London totalled a miserly 240.2m shares, among the lowest figures this year. Non-FT-SE stocks accounted for 68 per cent of the overall number. Strategists, although looking for the UK market to record healthy gains over the coming year, are not expecting any fireworks when the market re-opens on Tuesday. 'The interest rate situation in Europe and the UK will overhang the markets for some time, but the positive earnings and dividend outlook and the prospects of substantial takeover activity will produce big gains over the year,' was the view of one old market hand.</p>

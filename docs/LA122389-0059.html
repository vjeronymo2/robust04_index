			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATION PLANS DUSTED OFF BY DECEMBER DROUGHT  </P> <P> A decidedly dry December has evaporated hopes that October rains might have  ended California's drought, and state water officials are starting to urge  renewal of conservation programs and limited rationing in some areas.  </P> <P> Hardest hit is the area from Monterey to Santa Barbara, where one reservoir has  run dry, others have shrunk to as little as 12% of capacity and the ground  water table has fallen "drastically" -- as much as 15 feet -- as wells are  asked to work overtime.  </P> <P> Mandatory cuts of 20% in water use have been made law in Monterey and Santa  Barbara counties, with cuts of 40% only two or three months away. Elsewhere in  the state, water agencies are dusting off conservation plans that were shelved  after unseasonable storms of only a few months ago.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the eve of the traditionally busy Christmas-New Year holiday,  Sierra resorts have scaled back skiing and other snow activities. One southern  Sierra facility may have a hard time opening its downhill runs at all, while  Tahoe-area resorts will do so only by spreading a film of machine-produced snow  over a thin base.  </P> <P> Statewide, the drought information center in Sacramento reports that runoff has  been a disappointing 65% of normal since September and reservoirs are well  below half full. Central Valley farmers have been warned not to count on their  usual irrigation supplies as that water is shifted to cities.  </P> <P> "We are facing the driest December we've ever seen," said Larry Foy, vice  president of the California-American Water Co. on the Monterey Peninsula. "We  have not had a December entirely without rain -- ever -- and we have had no  rain at all so far."  </P> <P> The peninsula, including Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel, usually enjoys  four inches of rain in December, about one-fifth of its annual total.  Late-season rains in March and early rains in October were only enough to stem  the fall in reservoir levels, not enough to raise them or ease restrictions,  Foy said.  </P> <P> The situation is worse in Santa Barbara, where the Gibraltar Reservoir near  Montecito has been exhausted and Lake Cachuma is at its lowest point ever, 30%  of capacity. Local officials there have been worried enough to consider -- and,  for now, reject -- a costly plan to import water from Canada in tanker ships.  </P> <P> Bill Helms of the state Department of Water Resources said a number of other  regions of the state, including the San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Basin, are  also "critically dry" and must get rain this year to avoid serious and -- in  the case of overdrafted aquifers where pesticides and fertilizers are being  concentrated -- perhaps permanent problems.  </P> <P> "The problem is that it started well, but it hasn't kept pace with what it  should have," Helms said of the current rainy season, which had a promisingly  drizzly debut in September but then slid into a dismal series of sunny days.  </P> <P> Clear skies not only meant no rain, they meant dry winter winds are free to eat  voraciously at the Sierra snowpack and thus threaten runoff in the spring.  Helms said the statewide snowpack dipped from above average in October to only  35% of normal at the beginning of December.  </P> <P> It has been shrinking daily since, as resort operators know. Badger Pass in  Yosemite National Park, for example, indefinitely delayed the traditional Dec.  10 opening of its downhill runs for lack of snow and has limited cross-country  skiing to 20 kilometers of trails. The park has trimmed back the number of  snowshoe excursions, although ice skating is said to be exceptional.  </P> <P> Despite all of this, Helms said it's "too early to panic." Just ahead lie the  typically soggy months of January and February, and he noted that "a lot can  happen in a short time." In 1986, for example, the state received half of its  normal annual precipitation in just 10 stormy days. Also, the construction of  several major dams and reservoirs makes it unlikely that the state will suffer  as much as it did during the 1976-77 drought.  </P> <P> Dan Bowman, a forecaster for the private WeatherData Inc. in Wichita, Kan.,  said there is some promise of rain early in January if a storm system forming  in the mid-Pacific gains enough strength to muscle through the stubborn  high-pressure ridge that has diverted other storms north to Oregon, Washington  and western Canada.  </P> <P> "It (rain) does look more likely early in January than in any time in the past  month," he said. Because the system would not arrive for 10 to 12 days, it is  difficult to predict accurately how much rain, if any, it will bring or how far  south rains might fall.  </P> <P> "It doesn't have a real high probability of happening," he said, "but it is  better than flipping a coin."  </P> <P> The high-altitude high-pressure ridge blocking winter storms from the state  also generated the prolonged period of Santa Ana winds that whipped Southern  California this fall, Bowman said. But, he added, the winds themselves were not  responsible for the lack of rainfall.  </P> <P> If it is too early to panic, Helms said it is not too early to be concerned --  and vigilant about conserving. Surface supplies, at 44% of capacity, must be  used sparingly because no one knows when rain will return to normal, he said.  </P> <P> Helms said Lake Oroville -- the main source of Northern California water for  homes and businesses in metropolitan Southern California -- is 1 million  acre-feet below what he said is its preferred level. One acre-foot contains  325,800 gallons, a year's supply for a suburban family of four.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara relies on Lake Cachuma for most of its water needs. That lake was  designed to tolerate a seven-year drought, the longest-known when the reservoir  was created. But James Stubchaer, a consultant for the Santa Barbara County  Water Purveyors Assn., said the county has not had an adequate wet year in six  years.  </P> <P> "We have enough -- barely -- to maybe tolerate one more year (of drought),"  Stubchaer said. "The problem is we don't know if (the drought) will last six  years or seven -- or eight or more."  </P> <P> Because of this, cuts may have to slice deeper than the relatively painless  adjustments already accomplished -- the attachment of low-flow shower heads and  retirement of yard sprinklers, water managers said.  </P> <P> "Lots of people have already let their lawns go and are now just trying to save  their plants, often with rinse water from dishwashers or washing machines or  even showers," said Foy of the Monterey water company.  </P> <P> He said the storied Pebble Beach golf links have managed to keep their greens  green, but the roughs have "gone brown" and only limited parts of the fairways  are regularly watered.  </P> <P> "If it doesn't rain here by the end of February, we may see mandatory cuts of  40%," Stubchaer added. "If it doesn't rain by the end of May -- who knows -- it  may be more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A DRY SEASON  </P> <P>  Santa Barbara rainfall in inches per month:  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> MONTH  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> AVG.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> January  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.35  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> February  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.72  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.53  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> March  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.49  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.90  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> April  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.34  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.07  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.05  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.01  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> August  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.03  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> September  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.23  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.08  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> October  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.55  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> November  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.13  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.66  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> December  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.68  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.70  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.85  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

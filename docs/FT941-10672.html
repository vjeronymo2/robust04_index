			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Transgas plans stake in Algerian pipeline Transgas, the company responsible for an Es450bn (Dollars 2.6bn) project to pipe natural gas into Portugal, plans to take an Es16bn stake in Europe-Maghreb Pipeline, the US-dominated construction consortium building a gas line between Algeria and Spain. Portugal, the only European Union country without a natural gas supply system, plans to lift 2.5bn cubic metres of natural gas a year from 1996 through a link with the pipeline that will run from Hassi R'Mel in Algeria through Morocco to Seville in Spain. Transgas, wholly owned by Portuguese public sector companies, is holding talks with at least 12 foreign enterprises interested in acquiring a stake in the company, a Lisbon government official said yesterday. He said the government planned to reduce the state-controlled holding in Transgas to a maximum of 30 per cent and would permit foreign ownership of up to 49 per cent of the company. The potential foreign partners in Transgas include Sonatrach, the Algerian state energy company, that will supply natural gas to Morocco, Spain and Portugal through the pipeline. Construction work is due to begin this year. Gaz de France is also negotiating a possible participation in Transgas. The French company led an international consortium that planned to introduce natural gas into Portugal through importing liquefied natural gas from Algeria by ship. But talks with the Portuguese government collapsed in March 1993 after a failure to agree on prices and risk-sharing. Mr Luis Felipe Pereira, Portugal's secretary of state for energy, said the pipeline option would provide gas at a lower price. It was also more secure because Portugal would be able to import gas from other suppliers through the Spanish network if supplies from Algeria were cut off.</p>

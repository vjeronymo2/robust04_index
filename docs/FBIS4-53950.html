			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications is inviting thousands of Japanese companies  to an interindustry meeting to look into possibilities  surrounding the multimedia business, a ministry official said  Monday [23 May].    The get-together, scheduled for June 16 at a Tokyo hotel,  aims to promote exchanges among companies in different  industries on the multimedia business, the official said.    "The most important characteristic of multimedia is border  crossing. Barriers between industries and those between  broadcasting and telecommunications, or those between areas will  be lowered or disappear," he said.    "Because of this, we need to right now promote exchanges  among different industries," the official added.    The move comes amid a race that is heating up among  government ministries to take the lead in administering and  supervising multimedia. The ministries traditionally compete  with each other for administrative authority.    The businesses invited include banks and wholesalers, which  fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry and the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry respectively.    Multimedia, which came into the spotlight this year,  combines  telecommunications with broadcasting, allowing users to receive  and send information whenever they want.    According to an estimate by the posts ministry, the  multimedia market is projected to grow to 123 trillion yen by  the year 2010.    But with the definition of multimedia still vague and too  many related services involved in the concept, the ministry is  receiving inquiries from many companies wondering what to do.</p>

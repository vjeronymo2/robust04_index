			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., by </F> NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN staffer; place and date not given; first  paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] The shifting of production bases overseas is  progressing rapidly due to the appreciation of the yen, and the  industrial circles in Japan face "the problem of hollowing out"  of technology and employment. In the midst of this, the Keizai  Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] put forth a  proposal that Japan should rethink the industrial centering on  exports and should aim at the establishment of Japan on the  basis of the creation of technology--a country that can  contribute to the growth of the world through the creation of  new technology. A NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN staffer asked Canon  Chairman Ryuzaburo Kaku, who is also vice secretary general of  Keizai Doyukai, about the technological policy issues and the  management of enterprises in the future.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem behind the  proposal?    [Kaku] In the economy and various social aspects, Japan has  already attained the goal set up in the Meiji era -- "Catch up  and pass the advanced European countries and the United States."  The export industry, which has been Japan's strong point, will  increasingly find it difficult to maintain itself not only  because of industrialization in Asian countries where labor  costs are low, but also because of trade friction. In order for  Japan to become a country acceptable to the international  community in the future, it must contribute to it through  science and technology. However, a glance at Japan's technology  shows that it has nothing worth mentioning except for the  technology of mass production. It should discontinue free  riding in the use of basic technology of countries in Europe and  the United States, and must immediately establish a system  whereby it can develop new technology on its own initiative.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you ever felt the necessity of  requesting the government to rethink its technological policy  through your experience in managing Canon Inc.?    [Kaku] Yes, I have felt that necessity through the supply of  our office machines to the U.S. Hewlett Packard Co. and Apple  Computer, Inc. through OEM [original equipment manufacturing].  Because of the strong yen during the past year or two, the cost  of procurement has become lower if those companies manufacture  products by themselves within the United States or import them  from Asian or Southeast Asian countries than if they resort to  supply through OEM. I have strongly felt that unless Japan  seriously undertakes the development of creative technology, it  will have no products that can be supplied through OEM.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The proposal claims that the amount  of  reesearch and development investment, which is currently 0.5  percent of the gross national product, should be increased to 2  percent at the lowest in the next few years. Is Japan's  investment in research and development smaller than those of the  United States and advanced countries in Europe?    [Kaku] The U.S. Government's investment in research and  development accounts for 1.1 percent of the gross national  product and 1.0 percent each in France and Germany respectively.  The Japanese Government has strived for the promotion of  domestic industries through protection and various regulations,  but it has been negligent of its technological policy. It is  true that in the case of the United States and France, national  defense research expenditure forms a larger proportion of the  government expenditure, but compared with Japan, the difference  is great nevertheless.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The total research expenditure of  Japan, including the research expenditure of private  enterprises, accounts for 3 percent of gross national product,  which is higher than 2.6 percent for the United States and 2.7  percent for Germany. It seems that Japan's private enterprises  are active in research and development.    [Kaku] Japan is prominent in private research  expenditure, but private enterprises do not conduct creative  research. They are just following the technology for  manufacturing epoch-making products developed by rival makers  inside and outside Japan and are striving for research and  development to fight successfully through the war against their  competitors. Since each company makes an investment in the same  technological field in a group, the efficiency of research  investment is poor from a macro point of view, incurring a  decline of profit rates.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem of public  administration?    [Kaku] Since sectarian ministries and agencies just imitate  each other in the distribution of research budgets, concentrated  investment in priority sectors becomes almost impossible.  Although the cabinet has the Council for Science and Technology  which examines comprehensive technological policies, the council  has no authority over research budgets. It is necessary for the  council to have research budgets, to increase its members from  the business community, and to become the central organization  of technological policies.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The export ratio of Canon Inc. is  very high, amounting to 79 percent. However, Canon has also a  pressing need to overhaul itself, does it not?    [Kaku] Canon has been conducting its business with "creation  of technology" in mind for more than 10 years. It has not been  dependent solely upon the technology of other companies, but has  been pursuing new technology. Typical examples in recent years  are laser beam printers and strong current liquid crystals with  memory function. As a result, it has strengthened its  international competitiveness and has increased its export ratio.    Due to the increased appreciation of the yen these days, it  has become increasingly important for Canon to shift its base of  operation overseas as much as possible and to manufacture high  value-added products at home through creative technology. Canon  has not only to protect itself from being imitated by other  companies, but also prevent itself from being caught up in  excessive competition. For this purpose, each company should  supplement each other with technology each is good at and should  strive for "symbiosis" free from excessive competition.</p>

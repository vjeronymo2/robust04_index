			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas is in  favor of the Bosnian city of Mostar, which is entrusted to the  Spanish blue helmets, being included by the United Nations in  the first group of safe areas to receive the same kind of  treatment as that applied to Sarajevo.    In statements made after meeting the Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzaq Rabin, Garcia Vargas admitted that UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali seemed to have given priority to the cities of  Tuzla and Srebrenica. However, according to the Spanish defense  minister, the momentum could also take in Mostar.    As for the presence of the Spanish blue helmets in Bosnia,  Garcia Vargas pointed out that their presence depends on what  happens in the conflict as a whole. The minister added that in  this situation Spain would not act on its own, and it would  fulfill its obligations -- i.e. in the short-term it would  continue its work as part of the UN forces in Bosnia.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Where trade winds blow: Latin America's steps toward integration Now the North American Free Trade Agreement is as good as ratified, the dream of a hemispheric free-trade zone looks a step nearer to reality. But is it? The vision of a western hemisphere free-trade area was first raised by former President George Bush in 1990 - and strongly supported by most Latin American governments. It appeared to herald a less confrontational foreign policy relationship between the US and Latin America than was traditional. In trade terms, it was viewed as an insurance policy in case the world evolved into trading blocs. In the three years that the US, Canada and Mexico have been negotiating the first step towards that vision - Nafta - the rest of Latin America has not stood still. The region has evolved into a patchwork of free-trade zones and customs unions, overlaid with various bilateral free-trade deals. Two developments made this possible. First, Latin governments embraced market economics and rejected 50 years of protectionism. Second, the unseating of military governments permitted elected successors to settle border and other rivalries with their neighbours. So, as the industrialised world has had cold feet over free trade, Latin America has embraced it, unilaterally cutting tariffs to the outside world and its neighbours. Whereas in 1985 the average tariff level in Latin America was 56 per cent, in 1992 it was 16 per cent. Trade in the region - traditionally low because of high tariffs, import barriers and poor communications - has rocketed. The value of trade among Latin American countries jumped 28 per cent in 1992, reaching a record Dollars 19.4bn, following a 24 per cent rise in 1991. This is already evidence of de facto economic integration. What is less clear is how the formal process of economic integration in the hemisphere will be advanced. For the US, the idea that in a world of trade blocs it can depend solely on the western hemisphere as its main area of economic influence is far-fetched, as Mr Clinton's talks this week with Asian leaders in Seattle suggest. The US economy is five times larger than all of Latin America's combined GDP of Dollars 1,250bn. Some observers also now believe that the idea of the US as the centre of a hemispheric integration effort has been weakened by the process of passing Nafta. 'The Nafta vote has advanced Latin American integration, but not hemispheric integration,' said Mr Wolf Grabendorf, head of the Institute for European-Latin American Relations in Madrid. The political capital spent by the Clinton administration in securing its passage through the House of Representatives could make it unwilling to pursue further free-trade deals in Latin America for some years. Questions have also been raised about the benefits of free-trade agreements with the US to most Latin American countries. A 1992 study by two World Bank economists found the only Latin American countries to make significant trade gains from agreements with the US would be Mexico and Brazil. For the other countries, the main benefits would flow from increased investment and insurance from unilateral trade measures taken by the US. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, said yesterday he had been assured two weeks ago by Mr Clinton in New York that Chile would be the next on the US free-trade agenda, but there was no rush to reach a deal. US officials have also cited Argentina and Venezuela in that order as those most likely to follow Chile. Even though he has kept Chile out of the main South American free trade areas, Mr Foxley said Latin countries should seek greater economic co-ordination to deepen integration within Latin America. Poorly co-ordinated economic policies in regional groupings have led to friction, for instance, between Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is pursuing an anti-inflation strategy which has brought annual inflation down to single digits, but which has led to an exchange rate appreciation in real terms. Brazil's projected inflation rate this year is about 2,000 per cent and the government has been keeping the exchange rate competitive to encourage exports. The result has been a widening trade gap in Brazil's favour: Brazil now exports to its southern neighbour twice what it imports. The Andean Pact - grouping Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia - in September 1992 set up the developing world's first customs union. But not before Peru 'temporarily' pulled out, citing in part the competitive advantages that cheap energy offered to industries, particularly in Venezuela. The Central American Common Market has been hindered by Costa Rica's objections to moving closer to its neighbours. Despite such obstacles, Latin America is unlikely to give up on integration. 'We have to follow a two-track process: fighting for a multilateral trade system but building our bargaining power in case the industrialised countries abandon their commitment to Gatt,' said Mr Foxley.</p>

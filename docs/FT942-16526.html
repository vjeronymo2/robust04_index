			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Rich German harvest may be garnered again - A look at the prospects for the Dax As recent German banks' results have shown, there was hay a-plenty to be made last year on the back of rising securities markets. Dresdner, for example, yesterday reported a 122 per cent increase to DM650m in earnings from own-account trading (now booked as 'financial transactions"). This followed a 76 per cent rise to DM2bn, reported last week by the mighty Deutsche Bank. And there is no reason to doubt that Commerzbank will also roll out comparably hearty numbers when it reports next Friday. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, Dresdner chairman, made clear yesterday that his bottom line was unlikely to benefit to such a dramatic extent in the current year, although there was still plenty of life in the markets and German stock exchange indices were expected to rise further. Frankfurt's leading Dax index has been shifting erratically sideways since its peak at the turn of the year, carrying with it all the investors' expectations which drove it up so forcefully during 1993. Underlying this movement are uncertainties generated outside Germany, largely balanced by mounting confidence that domestic companies are through the worst. Following their restructuring investors are now waiting for the benefits to start showing up. Just as Dresdner and other banks hope they will be able to rein in provisions against bad debts this year, industrial companies appear increasingly confident that the need for restructuring provisions will be greatly reduced. That is one reason for expecting markedly better corporate earnings this year. The rest is uncertain. While external demand for German products and services is strengthening the domestic economy is still flat overall. But there are bright spots still attracting investor attention. Current overall conditions are clear from the federal statistics office's national stock market index, which rose just 1.4 per cent last month, ending almost precisely between the high and low points of the year so far. But within that figure some of the industrial sectors hardest hit by recession and restructuring costs have put on a good show. The all-embracing 'transport' index rose more than 16 per cent in the month to the end of March, with road vehicles up 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the chemicals sector went up almost 6 per cent, basic building materials increased 9 per cent, and plastics and rubber gained 4.4 per cent. Within the automotive sector, where most manufacturers have taken ample advantage of improvements in US demand, BMW remains a strong favourite. It outperformed its compatriot competitors throughout the slump, and pleased with its bold recent purchase of Rover from British Aerospace. Suppliers of many raw materials and basic production goods are reporting rising orders both from home and foreign customers. Companies supplying basic building materials are continuing to benefit from a domestic housing boom, notably in the west, and improved orders. While German orders figures can be unreliable, there is little doubt that they do represent the first 'green shoots' of industrial recovery. More evidence of 'bottom-up' growth emerged this week in reports that the steel industry increased production 10 per cent in the first quarter. General investment interest has also been helped by a certain amount of 'window-dressing' by increasingly active investor and public relations managers, notably those employed by the growing list of companies preparing to tap the capital markets. Only yesterday Dresdner Bank formally joined the queue, unveiling a plan to pull in some DM1.2bn through a private placement of American Depositary Rights in the US. BMW is looking for DM800m and Porsche DM200m, while Daimler-Benz is expected to provide some details of an issue to garner up to DM3bn at its annual press conference on Tuesday. The banks also have a special medium-term interest in strong equity markets in that they are once again showing interest in off-loading at least some of their stakes in industrial concerns. Deutsche made a tentative start last year when its reduced its 28 per cent in Daimler to 25 per cent. Deutsche and Dresdner were among the worst to suffer when the financial community was caught cold last year in the near-collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group. This led to their having to mount - and largely fund - an embarrassing DM3.4bn rescue operation. According to most estimates, German banks hold about 10 per cent of all outstanding shares in German companies. Mr Sarrazin said yesterday that, counting only companies in which it held 10 per cent or more of the equity, Dresdner had some DM12.5bn tied up in industrial shareholdings. Deutsche, on the same basis, has around double that figure. As the Metallgesellschaft farrago and last year's thumping earnings made by own-account trading suggest, the banks might well feel better advised to put the money to use in funding financial transactions - which is what some might believe the banking business is all about.</p>

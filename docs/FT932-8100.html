			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi It is an odd state of affairs when tax considerations provide one of the principal justifications for a rights issue. Yet oddity is something of a speciality for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the group's accumulated tax losses represent one of its few financial strengths. The Pounds 73m rights issue allows it to exploit them neatly to enhance earnings. Half the proceeds will be used to reduce debt resulting in a smaller interest charge and lower tax rate. About Pounds 19m will be spent buying out minority interests in mainland European agencies. This, too, helps tax efficiency. Saatchi will spend the rest improving service levels, upgrading its information technology and expanding its international coverage. Expertise in the Chinese market is all the rage, it seems. So far, so useful. Sadly, though, Saatchi still has a poor trading story to tell. Theoretically, advertising should be an early beneficiary of recovery but there is not much sign of it yet. An additional worry is that the Marlboro mayhem seems to have caused brand managers to reassess promotional strategies, creating something of a hiatus in advertising spend. Saatchi's wafer-thin margins provide little leeway should events again turn nasty. Future profits will be drained by Pounds 25m of earn-out payments. That provides all the more reason to seek value elsewhere. Gold Greenlees Trott and WPP seem better poised.</p>

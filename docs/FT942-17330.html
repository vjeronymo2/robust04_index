			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Northrop wins battle for Grumman Northrop yesterday emerged the victor in the battle for control of US defence company Grumman, after rival bidder Martin Marietta declined to raise its own bid for the company. Northrop increased its offer for the company to Dollars 62 a share, even though, at Dollars 60 a share, it had already made the higher bid ahead of a Friday afternoon deadline for offers set by the Grumman board. Martin Marietta, which a month ago sparked the battle by announcing an agreed Dollars 55 takeover of Grumman, said it was not in its shareholders' interests to increase its own offer. The Northrop bid, which values Grumman at nearly Dollars 2.2bn, marks one of the largest acquisitions yet in the US defence sector, where mergers are being driven by falling defence spending. Analysts said that they expected other takeovers to follow, with the most likely acquisition candidates being defence divisions of larger corporations looking to leave the business. Northrops' share price dropped more than 5 per cent yesterday morning on news of its increased offer, against a background of a weak stock market. By lunchtime in New York, Northrop shares had fallen Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 . Mr Kent Kresa, the chairman of Northrop, insisted that his company was paying 'a fair price for Grumman, one that will enable us to enhance profitability in the long term, beginning next year'. The deal would not affect Northrop's earnings this year, and would begin to increase its earnings per share in 1995, he said. On completion of the tender offer, which has been extended to April 15, the company will be renamed Northrop Grumman. Martin Marietta said it had received a Dollars 50m termination fee from Grumman, which had been agreed at the time of their original merger accord, and that is was also seeking Dollars 8.8m to cover its costs in the bid battle. Yesterday, Martin Marietta reiterated its intention to make acquisitions when opportunities arose. Mr Norman Augustine, the company's chairman, has been one of the most vociferous advocates of mergers in the defence sector, and has already engineered the takeovers of the aerospace division of General Electric and the space division of General Dynamics in recent months. Northrop said in a statement that it and Grumman would have had combined 1993 sales of more than Dollars 8bn, more than 40,000 employees and a business backlog in excess of Dollars 13bn. Mr Kent Kresa, Northrop chairman, said: 'This merger will enable Northrop to pursue its primary business objectives of being a key member of the nation's defence industrial team well into the 21st century.'</p>

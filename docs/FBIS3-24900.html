			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 2 SAPA -- Neither the perpetrators  of violence nor those who left the National Party [NP] in the  lurch at negotiations, nor those threatening boycotts would  prevent the party from completing its historic mission, State  President F W de Klerk said on Wednesday [2 February]. "Nobody  is going to prevent us from completing our historic mission or  from running the full course -- not those who perpetrate  violence, not those who left us in the lurch at the negotiation  table when we needed them, not those who now want to boycott and  threaten," he said.    Addressing the 2,000 delegates to the party's federal  congress at a public meeting at the World Trade Centre in  Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said there was no turning back. "We  will keep negotiating, before the election and after the  election. We are prepared to make reasonable adjustments but  will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed.    "Any attempt to create anarchy will be resisted with all our  might."    He said the ANC [African National Congress] would cast the  country back into the dark ages. "It is a party secretly  controlled by communists, militants and extremists. They are  quiet now, but they will shout loudly if the ANC wins control.    "Mr Mandela jokes that the next president might not come  from  the ANC, but it will be no joke if it is (SA Communist Party  chairman) Mr Joe Slovo or Mrs Winnie Mandela."    The ANC had spelt out its plans but would not keep its  promises, he said. "It cannot. It does not know how to and it  has never done so.    "Mr Mandela and his party are searching for a new species of  flora to finance its promises -- its called the money tree and  banknotes grow on it to pay for the ANC's promises," said Mr de  Klerk.    "I wish the ANC luck in their search, but I don't think  they'll find anything because the money tree and the ANC  Manifesto are both fantasies.    "Only fools believe in money trees and I do not believe the  South African people are fools."    He promised the NP would stand by its supporters in the  townships throughout the election campaign. The NP's opponents  should know there were no no-go areas for Mr de Klerk or the NP.  The party's voice would be heard.    The party's message was simply that it could be trusted,  said  Mr de Klerk. "In the face of the ANC's arrogant belief that it  is going to win, I want to tell Mr Mandela that this is an  election, not a coronation. The people have not yet spoken. The  power is theirs, not yours."    Other parties wanting to put the ANC in its place should  stop  wasting energy by fighting the NP as well.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Threat of legal action as BSI fails to fly kitemark The British Standards Institution appears to have been caught in that embarrassing situation: do as we say, not as we do. The BSI, which co-ordinates the writing of standards for UK industry, is being threatened with legal action for failing to employ subcontractors with the BS 5750 kitemark for the painting of its new London headquarters. Under BS 5750, a standard devised by the BSI itself, companies are certified if their management systems meet certain quality and efficiency standards. S. Lucas, one of two spray and painting contractors in the London area with the kitemark, claims neither of them was invited to tender for the contract, worth more than Pounds 100,000. It went to an unaccredited company. The controversy is small beer compared to that raging between BSI and its members over BSI ambitions to increase its powers and the fees of its directors. BSI lost its chief executive earlier this year and faces a government review of its activities. But the refurbishment of an undistinguished former IBM office block in Chiswick, west London, could land BSI in the courts. Under its royal charter, the BSI has a duty to 'prepare and promote the general adoption of British standards'. S. Lucas is threatening to seek judicial review of BSI's 'outrageous' behaviour unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming. BSI said yesterday that 75 per cent of the subcontractors engaged in the refurbishment were BS 5750 accredited. Mr Ram Mylvaganam, BSI marketing director, said: 'since only 1 per cent of UK companies have BS 5750 we can be accused of being too favourable to accredited companies, not the opposite'. John Laing, main contractor for the renovation, said it had 'endeavoured' to use BSI-accredited companies, and 'believed that BSI was aware' that it was not doing so for the painting. Laing is itself BSI-accredited, but said it knew of only one London-based company with the kitemark at the time of tender. It was not invited to tender. The BSI standard has been adopted by 20,000 UK companies, but few painters and decorators appear to be among them. Mr Danny Lucas, a director of S. Lucas, said BSI's action would 'discourage many unregistered firms from seeking BS 5750' and called on the institution to 'act decisively to restore credibility'. Industry estimates suggest fewer than 20 per cent of private clients ask contractors or consultants to be quality accredited.</p>

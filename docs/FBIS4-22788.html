			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Boris Valentinovich Kiselev, general </F> designer of Russian Legal Informatization, by DELOVOY MIR  correspondent Eduard Suvorov: "Success Is Ensured by Openness"]    [Text] An international conference on "Legal and  Information Problems in Creating a Unified Economic Space for  the CIS" will be held on 26 and 27 April 1994 at the Russian  Federation President's State Legal Administration. The very fact  that it is being held is important for the business and  practical scientific contacts of jurists, scientists,  economists, and representatives of the organs of state authority  and administration and the public. The need for a dialogue on  various important problems in creating laws and regulating  collaboration in the field of legal information and  informatization is obvious. The success of this dialogue gives  all of us a chance at a better future.    Boris Valentinovich Kiselev, the general designer of  Russian Legal Informatization, is our guest at the editorial  staff today. Our correspondent Eduard Suvorov has a conversation  with him.    [Kiselev] The conference is charged with resolving the  problem of legal informatization. The need for this is dictated  by the qualitative renewal of society and the formation and  development of a market economy. Under these conditions, the  formation of a unified legal and information space is being  advanced to the forefront: for it, and only it, will be able to  provide for the dissemination of legal information to all  structures of society.    [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, doesn't it seem to you that  it  is somewhat late for the creative process of building up legal  informatization?    [Kiselev] You are right, unfortunately. But this is not a  spontaneous reaction to the situation that has taken shape, but  objective-oriented and purposeful work that has been carefully  reasoned. It should give us confidence in the quality of our  knowledge, so that we may have a real opportunity to influence  the course of social processes and work for a rapprochement of  views and lasting harmony in society.    [Suvorov] In the concept of Russia's legal informatization  confirmed by the Russian Federation President's edict of 18 June  1993, it states that the state policy of the Russian Federation  in shaping and utilizing legal information resources and meeting  the country's requirements for social and economic development  with these resources is implemented by taking into account the  interests of the subjects of the Russian Federation, the trends  of international cooperation in legal information science, and  the real opportunities for the informatization industry under  the conditions of a market economy. Can this be transferred to  the CIS?    [Kiselev] There is increasing realization that reintegration  of the unified economic space is essential. And this gives me  the right to speak about taking into account the interests of  CIS states in shaping and utilizing legal information resources.  Especially as there is a critical shortage of even elementary  legal information services today. This has a very harmful effect  on the public sense of justice and law and order. And not only  in Russia, but throughout the CIS as well.    [Suvorov] A natural question: how do we solve this problem?    [Kiselev] I think that the legal informatization of society,  based on a twofold task--informatization of the legal field, on  one hand, and provision for legislative regulation of legal  relationships in the field of informatization, on the other  hand--will contribute to this to a substantial degree.  Legal informatization should be considered the process of  creating the best possible conditions to fully meet the legal  information requirements of state and public structures,  enterprises, organizations, institutions, and citizens based on  the efficient organization and use of information resources.    The task is extraordinarily complex. After all, to provide  for the legal informatization of the Russian Federation alone we  will have to build a national legal information system which  covers all regions, organs of authority and administration, and  law enforcement organs.    [Suvorov] But who will be involved in bringing all this  about?    [Kiselev] The functions of head organization have been  entrusted to the "Sistema" Scientific and Technical Center of  Legal Information of the Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information. This agency possesses powerful  scientific and technical potential, combined with developed  telecommunications facilities, and it can provide for the  construction of a national system of legal information based on  the highest achievements of science and technology and the  integration of existing service lines and communications which  accompany the different legal information systems.    [Suvorov] There is no universal legal information system in  Russia yet. Collections and card files of official documents,  automated systems, and legal data banks are functioning in the  higher organs of state authority and administration of the  Russian Federation and the republics within Russia, and in  ministries and departments. But they are not linked with each  other at all and serve only their own departments.    [Kiselev] You are right. Nevertheless, systems which make it  possible to store and process individual sections of legal  information have already appeared in the programming products  market. It is another matter that most of them are the product  of enthusiasm by local groups of developers, and they all do not  have official status. Moreover, although the laws and formal  government documents being adopted are published in the  periodical press and in special collections and bulletins, far  from all of them are entered into the data bases of the legal  packages being sold. Let us point out that normative documents  are modified and supplemented periodically in connection with  current legislation that is developed, so it is essential that  they are always up to date. It is even more complicated to work  with departmental documents, the documents of republics in the  Russian Federation, and the documents of local organs of state  authority and administration. Most of the latter are not even  published.    But the information which may be accessed through existing  information systems is often contradictory and very limited in  its variety, quantitative indicators, and forms of presentation.  A developed program of specific measures is needed at the  federal level of administration; practical realization of the  program in combination with the efforts of the republic and  regional systems of executive authority will make it possible to  accomplish the most important state task of providing legal  information support for subjects of the Russian Federation. Such  a program is under development.    [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, it seems to me that these  problems are typical not only in the Russian Federation, but in  all the CIS member states. Can the forthcoming international  conference help in resolving them somehow?    [Kiselev] Yes, of course. It has been called upon to work  out  proposals, and I think it will be able to do so, to reinforce  practical cooperation by CIS member states in the field of legal  informatization and the creation of a unified economic space.  Especially as the development of an effective legal and  contracting basis for overall development and expansion of  economic relationships among the CIS member states, based on  realization of the Agreement on Establishment of an Economic  Union, is one of the principal directions and the gaze and  thoughts of politicians and jurists are fixed on it. We need to  find qualitatively new forms of cooperation in the field of  politics, economics, law, the social sphere, and defense in the  interests of the historic relationships among the peoples of the  CIS states.    In addition, it is very important to work out a mechanism  for  interaction of the states' legislation in effect in conformity  with the recommendations being adopted by the Interparliamentary  Assembly, for coordination of efforts and close interaction by  the parliaments of CIS member states in legislative support for  economic reforms, and for a coordinated policy in the  international arena. This can by helped by the international  conference as well.    [Suvorov] Let us return to the subject of building Russia's  legal information system, especially as it will probably be  serving as a guidepost for the CIS countries.    [Kiselev] I have already said that a key role in realizing  Russia's legal informatization is being played by the "Sistema"  Scientific and Technical Center. As the central hub for the  legal information system, it creates, shapes, and maintains the  currency of the data bank of legal information, it coordinates  the development and introduction of information and  telecommunications technologies within the framework of building  a system of legal information, and it conducts work related to  legal information support for users of the legal information  system. The tasks of the "Sistema" NTTs [Scientific and  Technical Center] include keeping copies of the standard data  banks of legal information up to date, duplicating them for use  in regional legal information hubs, and providing for the  practical and methodical activity of the developers. We should  be concerned with keeping records on and classifying the laws of  the Russian Federation, the decrees of the Federal Duma  (parliament) of the Russian Federation, the edicts and  directives of the Russian Federation President, and decisions by  the Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian  Federation, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation,  the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Higher  Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation, as well as the  legal documents of CIS member states, foreign laws, and other  essential information which is used to provide legal information  support.    In addition, our functions include expert analysis and  sampling of hardware and software solutions, taking into account  the requirements of world standards, the preparation of  practical recommendations on introduction of the latest  information technologies, and the application of standardized  model solutions and hardware and software. I will say further  that the acquisition of legal information directly "from the  pen" of legislators, which guarantees its complete reliability  and currency, is fundamentally important for the "Sistema" NTTs.    [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, the effectiveness with which  the legal information system functions depends to a substantial  degree on the completeness and reliability of information and  the regularity with which it is received not only from central,  but regional sources.    [Kiselev] Exactly! For this reason, it is advisable to  resolve this problem from two sides at the same time: from the  center and from pivotal regional informatization zones, which  are the base centers for regions' legal information and  communications systems for the transit movement of data for  regional systems. Such regional hubs will be entrusted with the  main volume of work in providing legal information for a wide  range of customers.    [Suvorov] Has an analysis been made of the information  surveys and what kind of results have they provided?    [Kiselev] Yes, an analysis has been made, making it possible  to single out the following types of output flows: inquiries  about legislative and normative documents, thematic sets of  legislative and normative documents, texts of legislative and  nmormative documents, inquiries about cases under consideration,  inquiries about citizens' appeals to law enforcement organs,  statistical inquiries, inquiries about case proceedings, and so  forth. But this analysis enables us to state that each  department is provided with information based on its own  understanding of what information systems are and what automated  data processing systems are, and so forth.    Meanwhile, the formation of state information resources in  the legal field presupposes orientation toward the creation of a  common information space, and consequently, the basis for  building up and improving unified information technology in the  legal field should be the principle of integrated, coordinated  development of all the elements in the system. This will make it  possible to effectively resolve the problem of information  interaction among state structures, which in turn will provide  for increased efficiency and correctness of the decisions made  to regulate the various areas of public life.    In conclusion, I want to say that we must not be slow to  bring order to public relations in the field of legal  information and informatization, and that there is a critical  need to prepare draft laws making it possible to legally define  the affirmation and protection of the right of information  ownership, protection of the information itself, and the  affirmation of guarantees of the right to information and the  protection of citizens' rights.    In other words, an open and clear state policy is needed in  the field of legal informatization.</p>

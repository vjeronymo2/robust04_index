			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Maiden dividend at Delian Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust, which came to the market in November last year via a placing which raised Pounds 48.5m, yesterday reported a net asset value per share of 95p at March 31. Net revenue for the period amounted to Pounds 387,000, giving earnings of 0.76p per share; an interim dividend of 0.5p is declared. Lord Stewartby, chairman, said that by the end of December about 50 per cent of the proceeds from the placing had been invested, and as markets began to fall in February and March this year the programme was accelerated and was completed by the end of March. Income during the period therefore included a high level of deposit interest  -Pounds 425,000.</p>

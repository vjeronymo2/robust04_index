			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>   [Text] There is tension between Israel and the United  States as a result of the United States' having supported Egypt  yesterday in its demand that the handling of nuclear waste be  put on the agenda of the multinational talks on environment  issues being held in The Hague.    As a result of diplomatic contacts between Washington and  Jerusalem and following a telephone conversation between Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, the secretary agreed to modify the Egyptian demand  and support a multinational discussion of issues relating only  to regional legislation on handling nuclear waste.    Christopher accepted Israel's position that Egypt's charges  that Israel is mishandling nuclear waste should be broached by  the two countries on a bilateral level and not at the  multinational talks.    The Egyptian demand is part of the very energetic campaign  regarding Israel's nuclear ability which Egypt is waging at the  multinational talks on armament issues as well. Two days ago,  before The Hague talks started, the Egyptians warned they would  boycott the talks if their demand to discuss nuclear waste is  not accepted. They changed their mind only after the United  States intervened.    Last night, Israeli sources expressed concern over the U.S.  support -- partial though it may be -- for the Egyptian stand.    The sources said that ever since the new U.S. Administration  came into power, there has been a constant threat of conflict  between it and Israel in view of Washington's determined policy  on nuclear nonproliferation. Because of the close U.S.-Israeli  contacts, the issue has not come up yet.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / France welcomes sign of recovery INDICATIONS of a sharp recovery in the French economy in the first quarter of this year have been warmly welcomed by Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, who has predicted that this year's growth rate may well exceed the 2 per cent previously forecast by the government, writes Ian Davidson in Paris. French GDP grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to official figures, and by 2.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis, twice as fast over this period as the rest of the industrialised world. Exports provided the main motor of the recovery, expanding by 4.3 per cent in the first quarter or by 9.7 per cent against last year's opening period. Household consumption has been more hesitant, with an increase of 0.7 per cent during the quarter. The black spot remains corporate investment, which dropped for the sixth quarter in a row, this time by 0.6 per cent.</p>

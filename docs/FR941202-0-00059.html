This amendment will permit Customs to issue Notices of Redelivery to importers of textiles and textile products within 30 days after the end of the conditional release period if investigation or information reveals that the merchandise was claimed to originate in a country where little or no manufacturing processes occurred in order to avoid quota or visa admissibility requirements. An importer who fails to redeliver the merchandise to Customs custody would be liable for liquidated damages under the terms of the Basic Importation and Entry Bond. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 3, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jeremy Baskin, Penalties Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, 202&hyph;482&hyph;6950. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On March 30, 1994, Customs published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 14808) which proposed to amend Part 141 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 141) to provide for a conditional release period of 180 days on all textiles and textile products that are subject to the provisions of section 204, Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). The notice referred to the significant enforcement problem regarding textiles and textile products that are imported into the United States in violation of quota restrictions or without the appropriate visa from the country of origin. The notice stated that this problem involves merchandise that is the product of a country to which stringent quotas or visa requirements apply and that is transshipped through a second country having less rigorous quota and visa standards, often in order to facilitate the making of a false claim, upon importation into the United States, that the merchandise is a product of the country through which it was transshipped and therefore subject to the more lenient quota and visa entry standards applicable to products of that country. The notice pointed out two principal obstacles to effective enforcement efforts in such cases: (1) While the penalty provisions of section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), are in principle available for assessment against any party who has committed fraud, gross negligence or negligence in connection with the entry of such transshipped merchandise, it is not always possible to establish the requisite culpability; and (2) the other alternative, namely the issuance of a Notice of Redelivery followed by the issuance of a claim for liquidated damages for a failure to redeliver, is often not available because in many cases the violation is discovered only after the close of the time period provided in the regulations for issuance of a Notice of Redelivery (for textiles and textile products and other merchandise for which a conditional release period is not specified in the regulations, issuance must be within 30 days of the release of the merchandise from Customs custody). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to address these problems, Customs proposed to amend &sect;141.113 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.113) by adding a new paragraph (b) to provide for a specific conditional release period of 180 days from the date of release for all textiles and textile products subject to section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956. Thus, under the terms of &sect;113.62(d) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 113.62(d)), Customs would then have up to 30 days from the end of the conditional release period to issue a Notice of Redelivery whenever it is determined that a textile or textile product is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States. Failure to redeliver merchandise within the time period specified in the Notice of Redelivery (generally 30 days from the date of the Notice) would result in the assessment of a claim for liquidated damages under the Basic Importation and Entry Bond as provided in &sect;113.62(k) of the regulations. In addition, the notice set forth proposed conforming changes to &sect;141.113 as a consequence of the addition of the proposed new paragraph (b). The notice invited the public to submit written comments on the proposals, and the public comment period closed on May 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

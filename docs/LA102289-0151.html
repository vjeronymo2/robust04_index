			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEENS AND ALCOHOL  </P> <P> I protest your headlines and the survey questions about alcohol use in the Oct.  10 edition as alarmist and as planting a distorted view of teen-agers in the  minds of the general public. A "frequent" user was one who reported drinking or  smoking on at least 20 days in the last six months. That means that on one of  nine days the youngster had a cup of beer or had three cups of beer at one  party one time in a month. Do you really believe that realistically defines a  "frequent" drinker? I vehemently disagree.  </P> <P> Teen-agers are maligned by this kind of writing and reporting. What about a  similar survey of your employees or the Task Force, stepping up your limits  even slightly. Would your employees or the committee itself not appear to be  depraved? Give the kids a break. Use headlines responsibly.  </P> <P> JUNE V. AMES  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

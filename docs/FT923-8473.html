			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Business Law: A green 'caveat vendor' The United States has gone mad on Superfund, the environmental clean-up operation. The idea of cleansing a vast country of potential hazardous waste deposits is excellent but enormously expensive. It has also had some curious results. The language of the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Cercla) is intended to make those who cause pollution liable for the cost of clean-up and perhaps also for damages for injury to the public. No one could quarrel with an act aimed at 'making the polluter pay' and it is the policy of the UK Government to do this. Accepting that those who control the land are primarily liable, Cercla recognised that lenders who took security over land which was later found to be polluted might be saddled with unfair liability. The Act therefore contained the 'secured lender exemption'. This excludes from liability the person who ' . . . without participating in the management of a . . . facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest'. The difficulty has been in defining what constitutes 'participating in the management'. American courts ruled that slight acts, little more than any prudent lender might take to protect his security, might be sufficient. The matter progressed further to the disadvantage of the lender when the Superfund law was addressed for the first time by a Federal Appeals Court in the case of US v Fleet Factors. The Appeal Court for the Eleventh Circuit found that a secured lender who took no part in management decisions previously thought to be safe might still be found liable if the court could infer that the secured lender could have affected hazardous waste decisions even if it did not do so. Lenders who had been careful to avoid participation because of fear of incurring clean-up liability found that, however careful they had been, they might still be liable. This might be when their security documentation gave them a right to exercise some measure of control. Most security documentation does exactly that. The Fleet Factors decision threw the American banking system into disarray. Preconceived and carefully thought out procedures were thrown into doubt. The San Francisco law firm Brubeck Phleger &amp; Harrison described the impact on the financial community as amounting to 'near hysteria'. An article in New Law Journal aptly but dolefully recited: 'The Superfund is underfunded and the Environmental Protection Agency will seek recovery from any potential deep pocket. Banks, insurance companies, pensions funds, finance companies and other major lenders are viewed by EPA as potential targets of opportunity. The public policy announced by Cercla overrides the bankruptcy code and the debtor or debtor in possession cannot avoid his responsibilities by abandoning property subject to a clean-up obligation pursuant to the abandonment procedure of the bankruptcy code. The donation of a closed plant to charity may not fare any better.' Some recent decisions in the US have failed to follow the Fleet Factors case, maintaining that at least actual control is necessary and not only an 'ability to influence'. But the legal position remains doubtful. So great has been the concern that there has been activity in Congress regarding lender protection from Cercla liability. Several bills have been introduced intended to limit that liability and to exclude property acquired through foreclosure, or that held in a fiduciary capacity or managed pursuant to an extension of credit. All but one of the bills, however, is dead. Concern remains in spite of an EPA final rule (56 Fed. Reg. 28798) which seeks to limit the lender's liability to cases in which he has 'actual participation in the management or operational affairs of the debtor'. There is still a difficulty in drawing the line between the actions of a prudent lender and those of a genuine manager of the concern in question. In any event, the rule is not binding on private American litigators who sue banks as opposed to the EPA itself. The EPA cannot overrule the Court of Appeals and confusion is worse confounded. In the UK, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 imposes liability on those who control waste but, in general, liability is not absolute and those who take reasonable precautions and exercise reasonable care escape liability. The Draft EC Directive, however, provides (Clause 2(1)(b)) that 'the person who had actual control of the waste when the incident giving rise to the damage . . . ,if he is not able within a reasonable time to identify the producer . . . ', shall be liable. Liability is absolute and dependent on fault. In many cases it will be impossible to identify the producer of the waste, for example, a tip where waste has been deposited by the public over many years. The EC directive in its present form is likely to become part of English law and could spell disaster. The increased danger for lenders would mean that, as in the US, expensive environmental audits would be required of customers who borrowed money and offered land as security; there would be a need to provide other security, which might be impossible, and additional loan documentation. Less money would be available for borrowers more expensively. The costs of lending would escalate and customers would have to foot the extra bill. Something could still be done by exerting pressure both on the UK Department of the Environment and on the officials in Brussels. It is only a Draft Directive and changes could be made, but time for effective lobbying is short. If no changes are made, the situation in the UK is likely to be as bad as it was in the US at the worst moments of the Superfund crisis. From a practical point of view it is quite bad enough already. Recently an administrative receiver discovered that land valued at Pounds 1m in the books of a company was badly contaminated with industrial waste. It had to be sold for Pounds 1 only.

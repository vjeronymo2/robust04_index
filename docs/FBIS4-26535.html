			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the  Jinjia Coal Mine began recently. It belongs to the Panjiang  Administration of Mines.    The mine is designed to produce 1.8 million tons of coal a  year. It is expected to go into production within five years.  The cost of creating the mine will reach 500 million yuan (57  million U.S. dollars).    Fan Jinsheng, an official of the Department of Coal  Production of Guizhou provincial government, said that Jinjia  Mine, at the junction of the two provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan  and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will help provide  power and industrial raw materials to a large number of backbone  enterprises in south-west China.    It will thus play an important role in the economic  development of Guizhou Province and even of the whole south-west  China area.    He said that Guizhou is rich in coal resources. The verified  reserves of coal deposits amount to 50 billion tons, making the  province top among the nine provinces and autonomous regions  south of the Chang Jiang river.    The province now produces 45 million tons of coal a year and  provides a dozen provinces and autonomous regions with coal and  electricity.</p>

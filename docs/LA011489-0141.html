			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: FRIENDS OF WRITER A DEDICATED BUNCH  </P> <P> When bookseller Ed Thomas received a phone call from best-selling author Dean  Koontz of Orange last fall inviting him and his wife, Pat, out for dinner that  night, Thomas should have been tipped off that something was up.  </P> <P> The Thomases, who own Book Carnival in Orange, had become good friends with  Koontz over the years and they frequently go out to dinner with him and his  wife, Gerda. But Koontz, the prolific thriller writer dubbed "the Master of  Menace," is not one to do things on the spur of the moment.  </P> <P> At dinner, Koontz presented the Thomases with an advance galley proof of his  latest suspense thriller, "Midnight," which he had autographed. After Pat  Thomas read the inscription, Koontz told her to look above the inscription, at  the dedication:  </P> <P> "To Ed and Pat Thomas of the Book Carnival who are such nice people that  sometimes I suspect they're not really human but aliens from another, better  world."  </P> <P> "I was shocked and elated," said Ed Thomas. "There's something about seeing  your name in a book. Within a few minutes you start realizing your name is  going to be in every copy of the book that's published. It boggles your mind,  and especially with the way Dean is selling, I figure there's going to be a lot  of copies of the book sold."  </P> <P> Indeed, it looks as though Koontz may have another best-seller on his hands.  </P> <P> Book Carnival, which is hosting an autograph party for Koontz from 1 to 4 p.m.  today, received a large shipment of books to sell at the signing. And in less  than 2 weeks, the small mystery and science-fiction speciality bookstore at 870  N. Tustin Ave. had already sold 102 copies of "Midnight."  </P> <P> If past Koontz book signings at Book Carnival are any indication, his fans can  count on a long wait in line today.  </P> <P> Koontz, in fact, holds the shop record. When he did a signing at the store last  fall for his new children's book, "Oddkins," he began autographing books at 1  in the afternoon and, because the line was so long, he didn't finish until  7:15. In fact, he returned the next day and signed for another 6 hours. In all,  Thomas sold 500 copies of "Oddkins."  </P> <P> Lest Koontz's fans be bored in line this time around, a magician had been hired  to keep the crowd entertained.  </P> <P> As for the dedication to the Thomases, Koontz said he normally dedicates his  books to friends. With a laugh, he said this is the first time that he has  dedicated a book to friends who also happen to be booksellers.  </P> <P> "My wife," he noted, "has received more dedications than anyone, not because  she's my wife, but because she is my best friend."  </P> <P> Book Signing: Anaheim author Valerie King will sign copies of her new Regency  romance, "A Daring Wager," from 1 to 3 p.m. today at Sunshine Books, 8898  Valley View St., Buena Park.  </P> <P> Read Aloud: Jim Trelease, author of "The Read-Aloud Handbook," will discuss  "reading aloud: motivating children to make books into friends, not enemies" at  7:30 p.m. Monday in the main auditorium at the First Christian Church of  Huntington Beach, 1207 Main St.  </P> <P> The lecture, in which Trelease will also discuss the influences of excessive  television viewing, is being sponsored by the Huntington Beach Public Library  and the Friends of the Children's Library. Tickets are $2 per person and should  be purchased in advance from the library. Information: (714) 848-7813.  </P> <P> Author Festival: More than 40 authors and illustrators of children's  literature, who will be speaking at schools in the Huntington Beach and Ocean  View School districts during the day, will gather at the Huntington Beach  Central Library from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Thursday to meet their fans and sign  autographs.  </P> <P> Among those scheduled to appear are John Archambault ("Knots on a Counting  Rope"), John Reynolds Gardiner ("Stone Fox"), Patsy Garrett ("A Walk with Mr.  Peeps") and Adrienne Jones ("The Hawks of Chelney").  </P></p>

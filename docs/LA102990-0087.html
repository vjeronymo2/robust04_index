			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: HOW ABOUT MINNESOTA ANTEATERS?  </P> <P> You can't always get what you want, so for the next basketball season, Orange  County's NBA expansion seekers will have to content themselves with the Bill  Musselman Compromise, which specifically states:  </P> <P> 1. Orange County will be granted an NBA franchise.  </P> <P> 2. It will play its home games in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Starting at one forward will be Tod Murphy, formerly of UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Coming off the bench at another forward will be Johnny Rogers, formerly of UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> Checking in at backup point guard will be Scott Brooks, also formerly of UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> And, filling out the roster as designated three-point pistol -- final cut  willing -- will be Leon Wood, formerly of Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Ladies and gentlemen, your 1990-91 Minnesota Timberwolves.  </P> <P> Or, as Brooks calls them, "The Orange County All-Stars."  </P> <P> A quick background check of Musselman, the Timberwolves' head coach, indicates  no just cause for regional prejudice. He did not graduate from UC Irvine. He  does not owe Bill Mulligan money.  </P> <P> But if they ever peeled off a rebound or knocked down a bank shot in some  Orange County gymnasium, Musselman had them coming to his summer rookie camp.  </P> <P> Wayne Engelstad (UC Irvine, 1984-88) showed up. So did Richard Morton (Cal  State Fullerton, 1984-88). Ronnie Grandison (UC Irvine, 1983-84) impressed  Musselman enough to get invited to the Wolves' September training camp, where  he was cut two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "And now there are rumors of a trade for Bob Thornton (UC Irvine, 1982-84, and  Philadelphia 76ers, present)," says Bill Robertson, the Wolves' director of  public relations. "People keep asking me, 'Where is this UC Irvine?' They're  starting to call us 'the UC Timberwolves.' "  </P> <P> Robertson, by the way, is a graduate of Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Of course.  </P> <P> Musselman has succeeded in updating Horace Greeley. "Go North, West man," is  the new rallying cry for the Have Jump Shot, Will Travel crowd -- and has been  ever since Minnesota rejoined the NBA and named Musselman to head the talent  search.  </P> <P> An expansion team in Minnesota meant more work for those on the play-for-pay  periphery and Musselman as coach meant good news for anyone who played for or  against him in the Continental Basketball Assn. As veterans of Musselman's old  Albany Patroons, Murphy and Brooks had easy ins. Once aboard, Murphy and Brooks  told Musselman about Rogers.  </P> <P> And Wood?  </P> <P> He'll play anywhere anyone will have him. Last season, that took Wood from one  coast (the CBA's Santa Barbara Islanders) to the other (the NBA's New Jersey  Nets). Now, he's attempting to find the middle ground.  </P> <P> In Minnesota, Wood is a long shot, which is both his blessing and his curse.  The Wolves need a three-point shooter and Wood fits the bill, but he hasn't  played much in the exhibition season and has just three more days to persuade  Musselman to keep him and not Tim Legler or Doug West or Anthony Bowie.  </P> <P> The Anteaters III appear in better standing.  </P> <P> Murphy played in all 82 games of the Wolves' inaugural season -- starting most  -- and averaged 8.3 points and 6.9 rebounds. His job is all hard hat -- guard  the other guy's best big man, trade some elbows, count those bruises -- and  he's expected to keep it until he requires traction.  </P> <P> Brooks, beginning his third NBA season, came over in a June trade with  Philadelphia, in exchange for a No. 2 draft choice. He's a mini-Murphy -- he  doesn't mind diving on the floor and at 5-11, he's a lot closer to it -- which  Musselman has admired since their days together in Albany.  </P> <P> And, no, Brooks insists, it has nothing to do with looks and, no, he is not  Musselman's long lost son, an ongoing tease since his arrival in the Twin  Cities.  </P> <P> "It's an insult," Brooks says, feigning outrage. "I'm sooo much better looking  than he is. He's a feisty little guy and he's blond, like me, but I'm too tall  to be in his family. He's only 5-7."  </P> <P> Rogers, just off the plane from Spain, is closing in on the sixth and final  forward position. His competition is Gary Leonard, a Wolves holdover, but  Leonard lacks Rogers' outside shooting touch. Rogers averaged 23 points while  playing last season for Valencia in Spain's top division of professional  basketball.  </P> <P> "I expect to make the team," Rogers says, but adds, warily, "although with  Musselman, you never know. He could go out tomorrow and bring in three new  guys.  </P> <P> "I'm on the fringe, but right now, it looks like I'm going to make it. From  there, I'd like to get into the top eight or nine. Musselman plays eight men  deep and I've got to get into that top eight."  </P> <P> The simple fact that all three are this close, still teammates after all these  years, is, in Brooks' words, "pretty incredible. It's mind-boggling."  </P> <P> "Irvine is not a powerhouse. But here we are -- three Irvine guys on the same  professional basketball team. You could see that happening with Vegas or  Georgetown, one of the big schools, but UC Irvine?"  </P> <P> One question begets another.  </P> <P> How come this triumvirate couldn't manage more than a 17-13 record and a  second-round NIT ouster when it was assembled in front of Mulligan during the  1985-86 season?  </P> <P> "It's hard to say," Rogers admits. "We had a lot of talent. Besides us, there  was Wayne Engelstad, JoJo Buchanan, a top guard, and Mike Hess. It was a real  frustrating year. We beat Las Vegas twice, we beat UCLA, but we lost three  times to Fullerton and we lost to Oral Roberts at home. We were very  inconsistent."  </P> <P> Brooks has a theory.  </P> <P> "John and Tod were just not very good then," he deadpans. "I hate to admit it."  </P> <P> But seriously . . .  </P> <P> "John, Tod and myself were not half the players then that we are now," Brooks  says. "We have to be. You can't make the NBA any other way.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can bad-mouth Mulligan. We all could've played better. We  could've played better defense. We were fun to watch, we ran up and down the  court, but we could have done a much better job on defense."  </P> <P> Brooks thinks a moment.  </P> <P> "Then again," he continues, "we might not have been capable of playing better  defense."  </P> <P> Now, they stand to hold Anteater reunions all over the country, from Seattle to  San Antonio to Charlotte, 82 nights over the next six months.  </P> <P> They don't stop in Anaheim or Santa Ana, but there's always cable. At long  last, Orange County has an NBA team to call its own, even if it has to call  long-distance to do so.  </P></p>

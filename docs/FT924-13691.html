			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Gaming boosts Hilton results STRONG results from its gaming business helped Hilton Hotels, the US lodging company, post a 21 per cent increase in after-tax profits, at Dollars 22.8m. Earnings per share were 48 cents, compared with 39 cents a year earlier, while sales advanced by 17 per cent to Dollars 323m. In terms of operating profits, the gaming division showed a 34 per cent advance to Dollars 39.9m. Hilton said all four of its Nevada properties had higher profits, and the results were augmented by the recently-acquired Reno Hilton. The hotel side also benefited from the discount air fares available throughout the summer, which encouraged tourist travel. In general, Hilton said that it saw higher occupancy rates - percentage occupancy in its owned or managed hotels rose from 68 to 70 - but admitted that average room rates were slightly lower. The results from its Hilton Hawaiian Village property were also disappointing, with Japanese tourist travel depressed and Hurricane Iniki also hurting business. With conditions in New York City remaining 'difficult' and the company incurring start-up costs on the refurbished O'Hare Hilton in Chicago, the hotel division overall saw operating profits fall by 5 per cent to Dollars 18.9m. The third-quarter results bring after-tax profits to Dollars 163.5m for the first nine months, a 27 per cent improvement on the Dollars 129m seen in the same period of 1991. Sales are up by 8 per cent, at Dollars 894.1m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. A surrender charge is assessed on purchase payments withdrawn from the Contract within the first five Contract years and may be assessed on annuitizations within the first three Contract years. The surrender charge is 5% during the first Contract year and declines one percent per year thereafter. No surrender charge is imposed on total withdrawals in each Contract year of up to 10% of purchase payments (less amounts previously withdrawn that were subject to a surrender charge). Applicants expect that the surrender charge will not be sufficient to cover the expenses incurred in selling the Contracts. To the extent that the surrender charge is not sufficient, FILI will pay these expenses from its general assets which may include proceeds from the mortality and expense risk charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request exemptive relief on a prospective basis from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charges under the Contracts and any future contracts offered through the Variable Account or through similar separate accounts established and maintained by FILI, whether currently existing or created in the future. Applicants also request that such exemptive relief extend to any other National Association of Securities member broker-dealer controlling, controlled by or under common control with FILI, whether existing or created in the future, that may serve in the future as principal underwriter of the Contracts or of future contracts offered through the Variable Account or other FILI Accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality and expense risk charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to (1) contracts offered in the future by the Variable Account or other FILI Separate Accounts that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts described in the application, and (2) other FILI Broker-Dealers which may serve in the future as principal underwriter in respect of the Contracts or of future contracts offered by the Variable Account or other FILI Separate Accounts, is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for FILI to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing its use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair FILI's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If FILI were required to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in the application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants submit that FILI is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks and that the change in principal underwriter in no way affects the findings the SEC made in granting the 1988 Order. Applicants represent that the charge of .75% made under the Contracts for mortality and expense risks is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a proper insurance charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. FILI further represents that the charge of .75% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon FILI's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. FILI will maintain at its executive office, and make available to the SEC upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants represent that prior to making available any future contracts, they will make a determination that the mortality and expense risks under any such contract will be within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts. Applicants will also maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying such determination. Further, such mortaility and expense risk charge would not exceed 1.25% of the daily assets of the Variable Account or other FILI Separate Account.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

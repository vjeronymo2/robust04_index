			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Patten loses his Bath seat to Lib Dems MR CHRIS Patten, the Tory party chairman, was the most dramatic election casualty last night when he lost his Bath constituency to the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrat candidate took the seat after overturning Mr Patten's majority of 1,412. Mr Patten appeared exhausted as he made his acceptance speech - at least as much from commuting daily from London where he ran the Conservatives national campaign, as from the result. He had a reputation as a donnish Conservative, formerly of wettish political inclinations who looked uneasy with the job of acting as a political rottweiler against the Labour party. Mr Patten told his campaign team that, 'we will be back and the Conservative flag will fly over Bath again'.</p>

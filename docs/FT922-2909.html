			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (8): Summer buying spree forecast by brokers - Shipping FOR Greek shipowners, 1992 has so far resembled the proverbial curate's egg: it has been good in parts. Although freight markets plummeted, to the extent that by late spring the word crisis was starting to replace recession, Greek owners are 'incredibly liquid,' according to Piraeus bankers. They are thought to be waiting for the moment when they believe the market has bottomed out before starting to buy up ships at bargain prices. Lines of credit are already being made available, including substantial syndicated loan facilities, and vessels are being inspected. Brokers say movement is still slow, but that by late summer the rush will be on to acquire good second-hand tonnage. 'When a couple of the big names make a move, the others will follow,' says a Piraeus banker. At the same time, the weak market, together with increased operating costs and insurance premiums, which have shot up this year from 25 to 100 per cent, has an impact on every owner. Mr John Goumas, president of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS) said: 'To a certain extent we understand underwriters' demands for increased premiums, which originate from the problems facing the insurance market. . . they must show an understanding for the problems confronting shipping in a weak market. Whether based in Piraeus or abroad, a Greek shipowner picks his moment to buy or sell, either for trading or as an asset play, but this is not to say that international issues and government policies do not have a role to play. For the UGS, the most pressing issue is the plethora of new rules and regulations on safety and pollution prevention. The broader financial implications of the stringent US Oil Pollution Act 1990 have already prompted a number of Greek operators to stop trading altogether with the US, or in some cases to accept specific charters on a limited basis. At a recent meeting in London of Greek and Norwegian owners, concern was voiced over the proliferation of surveys, particularly condition surveys recently introduced by the Salvage Association. International owners do not question the argument that much more effort is needed to improve safety at sea and protect the marine environment. However, as the UGS puts it: 'What is required is not new rules and regulations but effective implementation and enforcement of existing ones.' At home, only limited progress has been made in furthering the ambitions of Piraeus-based owners and the Greek government to make Piraeus a leading international shipping and finance centre. The feeling is that incentives launched by Mr Aristotle Pavlides, the merchant marine minister, to bring Greek-owned vessels back to the home flag and for more offices to set up in Piraeus, may be straying off course. New shipping legislation introduced by the conservative government during its two years in power is criticised for being a piecemeal set of measures. Initially, tonnage taxes on vessels of 80,000 gross tons and over were slashed by as much as 75 per cent, while those in the 40,000-80,000 ton range enjoyed a 50 per cent tax cut. Later, manning requirements were reduced on both conventional and automated vessels. Both moves were intended to attract Greek-owned tonnage back to the national registry, with the underlying aim of also bringing more ship managers to Piraeus. Nonetheless, the Greek registry has shown encouraging growth. The latest figures show that in October 1991 the Greek-flag fleet numbered 2,058 vessels totalling 23.7m Gross Registered Tons, against 2,008 vessels totalling 21.5m GRT the previous year. Foreign exchange earnings from shipping have remained high in the past two years, reaching Dollars 1.8bn in 1991, a 0.6 per cent increase over the previous year. Piraeus port took precedence over the rest of the country under a plan by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE), the state telecoms monopoly, to upgrade switching systems and provide additional facilities. Digital exchanges were set up, providing a direct satellite link abroad and a telecommunications park was established. In addition to making several thousand new lines available to Piraeus-based businesses, the programme also aimed at improving telex and fax communications and offered electronic mailbox services, videotext and leased channels. But OTE's back-up system is still suffering growing pains. One shipping company waited for more than a month to transfer a few telephone lines 150 yards to its new offices in the same street. When the new digital switching system was suddenly knocked out, 48 hours passed before it was repaired, much to the annoyance of local ship management offices. Still, Greek shipowners are showing considerable interest in related shore-based investments, such as the loss-making state-controlled shipyards which are now up for sale. Under an EC ruling on ending subsidies to shipyards, they must be sold or closed during 1992. A London-based shipping group, Peraticos, bought a 73 per cent stake in Eleusis Shipyards from the state-owned Commercial Bank for Dollars 60m.</p>

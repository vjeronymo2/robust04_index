			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / BNP eyes European bank links: Privatisation candidate may use Dresdner alliance to expand retail activities in the EC BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the first candidate for privatisation by France's centre-right government, may extend its alliance with Dresdner, the German bank with which it has a cross-shareholding agreement, to include links with other European banks. Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of BNP, said yesterday before the launch of the bank's privatisation marketing campaign that BNP and Dresdner might consider forging commercial links with other European banks to expand their retail banking activities into other areas of the European Community. 'The agreement with Dresdner means that BNP's French clients can use the Dresdner network in Germany and their German clients can use our branches in France', Mr Pebereau said. 'Eventually we will need to offer a similar facility in other countries. It is possible that together we might link up with banks in Italy or the UK.' Mr Pebereau emphasised that future alliances would be devised on a purely commercial basis and, unlike the BNP/Dresdner deal, would not involve equity participation. 'These agreements will be co-operative commercial ventures,' he said. 'They will not involve an exchange of equity'. The agreement between BNP and Dresdner, one of a number of cross-border ventures recently concluded in European financial services, enables each bank to take up to 10 per cent of the other's equity. Shares will not be exchanged until after BNP's privatisation, which is scheduled for completion by December 20. It also awaits authorisation by the European Commission. Mr Pebereau said BNP and Dresdner had not yet begun negotiations with any prospective European partners. He added that the French and German banks would wait until after BNP's privatisation and EC authorisation before deciding how to orchestrate their future expansion in Europe. He described the Dresdner alliance as central to BNP's strategy in retail banking and in international banking for companies. Mr Pebereau said BNP planned to concentrate on internal growth to develop its international banking operations, but it might consider strategic acquisitions in specific sectors. He and the BNP board are beginning a series of marketing presentations this week in preparation for the bank's sale to the private sector. BNP is under considerable financial pressure because of the French recession. BNP recently reported a 61 per cent fall in interim net profits from FFr1.33bn in the first half of 1992 to FFr522m (Dollars 91.6m) in the same period of this year, when it made net banking income of FFr21.23bn. Mr Pebereau said that 1993 would be a difficult year and that 1994 would be 'difficult too' with 'the real recovery' coming in 1995.

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Chairman of Spring Ram urged to quit by shareholder MR BILL ROONEY, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the bathroom and kitchens group, has been asked to quit by the Prudential Corporation, the group's biggest institutional shareholder. Mr Rooney, a co-founder of Spring Ram, has cut short his holiday in Barbados to fight for his survival. He has told colleagues that he is prepared to give up either the role of chairman or chief executive, but not both positions. 'A showdown is inevitable at the beginning of next week,' said a friend of Mr Rooney. The Prudential's ultimatum is the culmination of its many months of campaigning for management changes at the group. Mr Rooney is confident of the support of the group's executives, although he is less certain of being backed by Mr Roy Barber, the group's only non-executive director. Mr Barber, a specialist in reviving financially troubled companies, was appointed in April following the first bout of pressure from the Prudential. The Prudential, which owns 11.8 per cent of Spring Ram's shares, is understood to be confident of achieving its aim. The second biggest institutional shareholder is Baillie Gifford, with 7 per cent. Mr Rooney and his children own 16 per cent. The Prudential has decided to act because there have been 'too many surprises at the group', according to a City financier with a close knowledge of the insurer, one of the UK's most powerful institutional investors. A fortnight ago, Spring Ram warned that profits in the first half of the current year would be 'substantially lower' than in the previous period, although five weeks earlier Mr Rooney told the annual meeting that he thought profits in the full year would be better than in 1992. That was the third shock for the group's shareholders in just eight months. Last autumn, the group discovered that profits at its Balterly Bathroom operation had been overstated as a result of false accounting. Then in March it disclosed that pre-tax profits in the year to January were Pounds 26m, a third less than City analysts had been expecting. Spring Ram's shares were one of the stock market's star performers for much of the 1980s. At their peak of 181p in May 1992 the company was valued at Pounds 651m. Yesterday the shares were worth just 48 1/2 p. Mr Rooney's contract with Spring Ram has no expiry date and his notice period is two years. He was paid Pounds 100,000 in 1992.</p>

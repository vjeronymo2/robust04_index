			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: ICI/Zeneca A year after the plan to demerge Zeneca from ICI was unveiled, the issues facing the businesses have barely changed. The outlook for agrochemicals now housed in Zeneca remains at best patchy as the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy takes its toll. Sales of Tenormin, the biggest drug in the pharmaceuticals business, are still falling following the expiry of its US patent. ICI's petrochemicals business is struggling against poor margins. Slow recovery in the US and deteriorating prospects in Europe continue to postpone a bounce in profits from paints, explosives and industrial materials. After yesterday's bounce in the shares, though, the combined worth of ICI and Zeneca has risen by 8 per cent over the year. The passage of time might take some of the credit: European agrochemicals may be through the worst by the end of this year, as should the decline of Tenormin. Sales figures for Zeneca's new drugs increasingly support the notion that decent sales growth in pharmaceuticals can be maintained despite cost-cutting measures from governments. There is also the small matter of sterling's devaluation, worth Pounds 50m to ICI in the first half. Since the economic cycle is unlikely to offer much immediate help - and exchange rates could take an adverse lurch - progress from here will rely on management action. The product swaps and cost cutting undertaken by ICI show the right mix of imagination and rigour. More of the same on both sides of the business is now required to justify the decision to split.</p>

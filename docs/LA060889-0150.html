			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Truckers Oppose Rate Change: California's $2-billion trucking industry is  opposed to a proposed change in intrastate hauling rates. State Public  Utilities Commission Administrative Law Judge Stan Ferraro proposed new  regulations that would allow truckers to lower rates without state approval.  However, truckers would need PUC clearance to raise rates more than 10% under  the proposal. Trucking industry spokesmen said rates would drop below cost  under the proposed regulation, which the PUC is expected to consider next  month.  </P></p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK investor will return to face charges MR Terry Ramsden, the former City investor known for his lavish lifestyle, yesterday waived extradition in a Los Angeles federal court and agreed to return to the UK to face fraud charges in connection with dealings in Japanese equity warrants through his investment company Glen International. His lawyer declined to say what prompted Mr Ramsden's decision, but said his waiver included an agreement with the Serious Fraud Office to recommend bail of 'a reasonable amount' based on a financial statement Mr Ramsden will submit on arrival in the UK. Charges he faces in the UK include fraudulent trading, obtaining property by deception, evading debts by deception and making false statements to investigators. Last month a federal judge denied bail to Mr Ramsden, who has been in custody since his arrest on September 8 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.</p>

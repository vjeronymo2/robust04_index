			<p>BFN     [Text] During a meeting with French President Francois  Mitterrand in Paris on Tuesday [12 April] evening, Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis expressed readiness for integration  into the European Union [EU] and a willingness to implement EU  requirements. However, Ulmanis stressed, Europe will have to  rely more on Latvia in the integration process.    It is important that both Denmark and France are ready to  discuss the issue of setting up a fund to support the closure of  the Skrunda radar base and for the repatriation of Russian  military pensioners to Russia, according to Martins Virsis,  parliamentary secretary of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.    Francois Mitterrand admitted during the talks that Latvias  is  a small nation but has a unique European culture. Europe is  interested in preserving countries like that, Mitterrand said.</p>

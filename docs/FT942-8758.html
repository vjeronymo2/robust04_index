			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Sell-off offers delivery from market pressure The Post Office is a business suffering because of modernity. It delivers pieces of paper and handles cash payments: services that have moved to the rear in the world of communications. Pensions can now be paid directly to bank accounts and bills paid by direct debit. Conversations can be held on the telephone, and documents sent via fax machines. The Post Office has benefited from the growing demand for communication but it has also come under increasing pressure to provide quicker, more flexible and wider services. Its share of the UK communications market is between just 14 per cent and 16 per cent in 1992-93. For these reasons the Post Office management insists that it needs greater commercial freedom to compete and, by implication, that it must be privatised. Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, said yesterday: 'It's the only show in town; we have got to get cracking with it.' At the heart of its concerns lies Royal Mail, the source of more than 75 per cent of its business and nearly all of its profits. The volume of mail handled by Royal Mail has never stopped growing but its make-up has changed significantly. The growth in standard mail posted by individual consumers and small businesses has ceased, with the business only just breaking even in recent years. The area of rapid growth and high profitability has been bulk commercial pre-sorted mail. This business now accounts for a third of Royal Mail's revenue and took its overall pre-tax profits to Pounds 252m last year. The rub, says the Post Office, is the ease with which its competitors have been moving into this lucrative market. Although the Post Office holds a protected monopoly on the delivery of items that cost less than Pounds 1 to deliver, it is not in a position to assert a monopoly on pre-sorting. With the planned privatisation of many European post offices, foreign competition is becoming more aggressive and customised mailing services for large companies and publishers a prime target. The Dutch post office, which has set up sales offices in the UK, is offering to take companies' bulk mailings in computerised form, and print, package and accelerate their delivery to companies' own address lists - or even supply address lists of target groups, take the text of a mailing and do the rest. This type of service has required link-ups with other private companies in areas such as printing, freighting and direct marketing. The Post Office is keen to set up similar joint ventures in order to compete. But this has been repeatedly refused by the government. Mr Heron says privatisation could enable the corporation to become 'the European post hub'. He hopes to attract the business of big companies from around the world that want to distribute bulk mail, deliveries of magazines and direct advertising to Europe. 'The opportunities for the UK Post Office are enormous,' he said. The corporation is also considering leasing some or all of the 16 trains it owns, the distribution of newspapers and the handling of private mail and parcels, with potential savings of tens of millions of pounds. Public-sector restrictions on private partnerships has also affected Parcelforce, which has suffered fierce competition in the parcel delivery market. Although its pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.1m in 1992-93 was down sharply from a Pounds 24m loss the previous year, the Post Office is keen to gain control of its investment budget. Meanwhile, the debate over Post Office Counters has focused on its own problems of declining business. The government recently announced measures to make it more attractive for pensioners to receive their pensions through the post offices, reversing last year's move towards encouraging the payment of pensions directly to pensioners' bank accounts. Pension payments account for 12 per cent of counter business. The Post Office only owns and runs 850 of the country's nearly 20,000 post offices. Some 18,300 are sub-post offices, run as private businesses under contract to the Post Office. However, payments to sub-post offices are heavily skewed towards the smallest businesses, generating subsidies to some 10,000 post offices of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year. It is this element of maintaining rural post offices, which rely on subsidy from urban post offices as well as from the national Post Office, which has prompted the greatest resistance to change. The Post Office argues that it is not their status that needs changing, but the restraints on the products they can trade. To maintain or increase their turnover sufficiently to ensure survival, the Post Office would like to introduce additional services, such as ticket sales and financial services. The Treasury opposes giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom while it is in the public sector, arguing that taxpayers' funds should not be exposed to the commercial risk inherent in diversification. Decisions on investment and joint ventures have also been made with an eye on the burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement, with the Post Office contributing Pounds 181m to Treasury coffers in 1993-94, and a planned Pounds 226m in 1994-95. The plan before the cabinet today amounts to privatisation of Royal Mail and Parcelforce, which would give the Post Office the greater commercial freedom it seeks, allowing it joint ventures and control over its investment programme. The alternative to change, argues the Post Office, would have been declining businesses, with large overheads, that would have had to charge higher prices.  -------------------------------------------           TOP TEN COUNTER PRODUCTS  -------------------------------------------                             Percent of Products                   total volume  ------------------------------------------- Stamp packets &amp; parcels         23 Pensions                        12 Girobank deposits                9 Child benefit                    6 Income support benefit           5 Green Giros                      5 Invalidity pension               4 Telephone savings stamps         4 Motor vehicle licensing        3.5 TV licence saving stamps       3.5  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Commandeered How exciting - an invitation for Observer to toast the festive season in the company of The International Security Command of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Some very hush-hush gathering of top military bods, no doubt. Sadly no. The ISCFCO, it transpires, is nothing more than a fusion of three FCO departments dealing with non-proliferation, security policy and the CSCE, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Commanding the command is the resolutely civilian assistant undersecretary David Logan. Well, if you can't stop Balkan conflagrations, you might as well have a party, eh chaps?</p>

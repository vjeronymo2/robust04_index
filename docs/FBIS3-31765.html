[Reporter] Aleksander Kwasniewski, the Constitutional  Commission chairman, said that yesterday's decision by the  president to withdraw both his representative and his  constitutional draft from the Constitutional Commission was in  breach of law. According to the law [of 1991 on the procedure  of preparing and adopting the constitution] it is the  representatives of the president, the government, and the  Constitutional Tribunal who should take part in the meetings of  the commission. They all have the right to file motions. This  is more of a duty than a right.    Aleksander Kwasniewski said that using the Constitution as  means to achieve an aim, irrespective of whether the objective  is to compete for the presidential post, or to improve the image  of the first man in the country, is wrong.    On the other hand, Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the Democratic  Union [UD] parliamentary floor group, said that he had noticed  that also the government coalition, the coalition parliamentary  majority, used the Constitution as a means to an end. Tadeusz  Mazowiecki said that the Constitutional Commission Chairman,  Aleksander Kwasniewski himself, had brought about the escalation  of the conflict by saying, for example on the radio yesterday,  that President Walesa could be facing a trial by the State  Tribunal. Tadeusz Mazowiecki pointed out that the rejection by  the Sejm on Friday [18 February] of the president's  constitutional draft had been done in a manner openly arrogant,  ostentatious, and contemptuous to President Walesa.    Deputy Jerzy Gwizdz from the Non-Party Bloc for Supporting  Reforms [BBWR] put forward a motion that the commission's  proceedings be discontinued. He was supported by Leszek  Moczulski from the Confederation for an Independent Poland  [KPN].</p>

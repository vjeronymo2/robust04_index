			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) Bombay brokers arrested Correction (Published 25th June 1992) appended to this article. INDIAN police arrested two leading Bombay brokers, Mr Bhupen Dalal and Mr A D Narottam, last night and brought criminal charges against Standard Chartered and two state-owned Indian merchant banks for alleged fraud. In a joint operation, police and internal revenue officials raided the offices and homes of Mr Dalal, his uncle, Mr J P Gandhi, Mr Narottam and several others. Signalling the second phase in India's worst securities market scandal, the first information report (charge sheet) says that the exposure of the three banks is Rs13.68bn (Pounds 263m), including Rs8.9bn which relates to Standard Chartered. The police have named in the second phase 19 persons, of whom nine are Standard Chartered officers, indicating far greater involvement of the UK-based bank than expected. Standard Chartered dismissed two of its securities dealers at its Bombay office last week after an internal inquiry. The charges against the 19 are criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and bribery. The first phase of the Rs30.8bn scandal related to Rs17.13bn transactions between State Bank of India and several Indian banks brokered by Mr Harshad Mehta, who is already in custody. The Bombay bourse has been closed since June 15. K K Sharma adds:  The contest for the post of president of India - normally a straightforward election for a ceremonial position - seems to have caused a bitter battle between the ruling Congress party and its opponents. The Congress party last week nominated Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma, the country's vice-president, for the election in July to replace Mr R. Venkataraman. In doing so, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, did not consult the opposition parties, abandoning his proclaimed stand of being a consensus seeker. The opposition retaliated by seeking a candidate to oppose Mr Sharma but their actions only exposed deep divisions. Correction (Published 25th June 1992) Owing to a transmission error, the Financial Times yesterday incorrectly reported that the Indian authorities had brought criminal charges against Standard Chartered Bank in India in connection with a securities market scandal. The report should have said that criminal charges had been brought against two former employees of Standard Chartered Bank.</p>

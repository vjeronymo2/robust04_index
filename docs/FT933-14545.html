			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Ministers 'prompted' British Coal move THE GOVERNMENT prompted British Coal to consider using its pension-fund surplus rather than public funds to help pay enhanced pensions to staff made redundant, counsel for the corporation admitted in the High Court yesterday. The admission was made on the first day of the court hearing to determine the legality of the corporation's proposed use of its half share of the fund's Pounds 1bn surplus. Mr Edward Nugee QC denied that the government had sought to influence British Coal to use the surplus rather than grants provided by the Department of Trade and Industry. It had made the initial suggestion of using the surplus, he said. However, the corporation had relied since then on its own legal advice, he added. The legal challenge has been mounted by the pension-fund trustees who argue that British Coal would be in breach of the fund's rules. They argue that British Coal should not be released from its obligations to fund the pensions of redundant workers. The surplus should be used instead to allow the corporation to take a further pension fund contributions holiday. The dispute arose earlier this year when the corporation withheld Pounds 104m - part of Pounds 400m owed to the fund for providing the early and enhanced pensions - with the intention of paying it instead from its share of the surplus. The hearing is expected to last until Friday.</p>

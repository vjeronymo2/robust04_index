			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: BBV appoints chief executive Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, yesterday appointed Mr Pedro Luis Uriarte chief executive and announced that Mr Javier Gurpide, the institution's deputy chairman, was relinquishing his management responsibilities. This is the second management shake-up this week by a big Spanish bank, The development at BBV followed Monday's announcement by Banco Santander that its chief executive Mr Rodrigo Echenique was stepping down. His role in the bank is to be be partially filled by Mr Matas Rodrguez Inciarte, promoted to second vice-president of the banking group, and by Ms Ana Patricia Botn, the daughter of Santander chairman Mr Emilio Botn, who was was appointed a general director of the bank and the chief executive of its brokerage arm. Although neither of the two rival banks has given reasons for the changes, both are understood to be broadly linked to the shake-out in Spanish banking last April when Santander outbid BBV to acquire the Banesto banking group and established a clear lead over BBV as Spain's premier financial institution. Mr Gurpide is viewed as carrying the blame for BBV's failure to acquire Banesto while Mr Echenique is seen as not having been sufficiently enthusiastic about Santander's successful bid. Mr Uriarte, 51, a general director of BBV since 1990, has been entrusted with the job of lifting morale and renewing the bank's aggressive edge.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Brevel Development </F> Continuing"]    [Text] The French-German economic interest group Eurodrone  is beginning tests on the subsystems for the Brevel  reconnaissance drone whose development of these two promoter  countries for the armed forces should be completed by the end of  1998.    Eurodrone, a joint subsidiary of Matra Defense (France) and  Systemtechnik Nord (Germany), received an order from the French  and German governments in the amount of Fr450 million for the  second increment involved in the development of the new  surveillance system using Brevel drones. Designed to meet the  operational requirements of the French and German armed forces,  Brevel has been in the works since October 1992 as part of a  program spread out over six years based on an overall  development contract of Fr1.4 billion (DM400 million).    According to Eurodrone, the development program's first year  made it possible to install all the facilities needed for  program implementation through continuous cooperation fostered  for many long years between the two countries in the armament  field; here, Matra Defense is also cooperating with Deutsche  Aerospace in building the new Apache cruise missile which, among  other things, is earmarked for the Tornado aircraft of the  German Air Force (cf., A&amp;C, No. 1451).    STN [Systemtechnik Nord] and Matra, for their part, already  finished "several technically very ambitious subassemblies" (but  not yet finalized) for the drone and they began testing these  first elements of the Brevel. This, however, is but the  beginning of the program which will thus basically run until  1998.    As we recall, Brevel is an observation system based on small  (pilotless) drones equipped with an infrared camera that permits  both day-time and night-time observation of the overflight zone  whose image can be transmitted in real time (via "data link") to  the image receiving and processing station. This station  furthermore controls small furtive drones that can fly for  several hours at a speed of 150 km/hr and reach an operational  altitude of about 2,000 m. Eurodrone also emphasized that "the  current political situation in Europe calls for equipment to be  used in crisis control, especially surveillance systems, in  order to supply the civilian and military authorities with the  kind of information that is indispensable for decision-making."  The French-German firm thinks that "Brevel is best suited for  accomplishing this mission by virtue of its discretion and its  resistance to any form of jamming and due to the fact that it is  remote-controlled."    The usefulness of drones, as a matter of fact, has been  constantly demonstrated these past years, both in combat and  during times of crisis or civil war. Following the  demonstrations made by the American drones during the Gulf War,  the usefulness of these "pilotless aircraft" has been confirmed  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, when the United Nations forces used the  small Fox drones made by the French company CAC Systeme (cf.,  A&amp;C, No. 1450).</p>

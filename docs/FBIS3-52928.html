INTP Chairman Muzaffer Arslan said Tuesday the system would  be established around Irbil within 15 days, followed probably by  Karkuk and Kifri.    He said that various arrangements had been made with certain  private TV channels in order to obtain some program packages.  "We have also arranged our dish to pick up the broadcasts of  the International Turkish Channel, Avrasya," Arslan said. He  added that various groups were "disturbed" by the "activities of  the Turkmans."    When asked who these were, Arslan said, "Our relations with  the Baghdad government have not been good. Nor are we on good  terms with its extension in northern Iraq. Moreover, some  Kurdish groups in northern Iraq are disturbed, because we keep  our distance from them."    Arslan noted that a radio station in Turkish, called Voice  of  the Turkmans, had become the most popular in the region.   <H5>    Training for Teachers </H5>   INTP has also established two schools in northern Iraq,  Karaoglan Primary School in Kifri and Dogus Primary School in  Irbil.    "But we are in deep need of teachers and we have held talks  with the Turkish Ministry of Education to provide schools," he  said. "We are also appealing to retired teachers here who would  like to help us."    Arslan said 30 to 40 teachers would come to Turkey this  summer for training.</p>

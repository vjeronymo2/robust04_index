However, in a significant change, the Clinton administration  has promised to seek a statutory change limiting the duration of  U.S. technology patents to 20 years from the time of application.    That provision would put the United States in harmony with  Japan and Europe. The Clinton administration unveiled this shift  late last month in negotiations under the U.S.-Japan trade  framework.    Japan and Europe have long pushed the United States to  replace its first-to-invent patent system with the widely used  first-to-file system.    The U.S. system awards the patent to the inventor who can  prove the earliest date of invention, even if it means removing  the patent from its original recipient. The first-to-file system  gives the patent to the inventor who files a patent application  first.    ``The first-to-invent system has served us well in the past,  and while the United States may move to first-to-file sometime  in the future, I am not convinced that enough small inventors  and entrepreneurs would benefit if we made a switch at this  time,'' Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said.    An official at Japan's Patent Office said, ``It is  regrettable that the United States still sticks to its unique  system. It takes a great deal to prove who invented first. It is  much easier and clearer to determine who filed the application  first.''    The U.S. refusal to change the principle would stall the  patent harmonization talks at the 141-member World Intellectual  Property Organization in Geneva, Japanese officials say.    As for the duration of patents, Japanese officials remain  skeptical of the U.S. pledge.    Said Hajime Aoyama, senior managing director at the Japan  Patent Association, ``The White House has pledged the change in  the calculation method, but it is still doubtful that the U.S.  Congress will approve the change.''    Under current U.S. law, a patent is effective for 17  years--not from the time of the application but from the time of  registration.    In 1992, the U.S. patent authority suddenly awarded a patent  to a U.S. inventor in Nevada who filed an application 38 years  ago for technology to inspect parts through electric monitoring.  Japanese automakers are liable to pay royalties for using the  technology for 17 years until the patent expires in the year  2004--55 years from the application.    Such patents are called ``submarine'' patents because they  cruise submerged and then suddenly surface to hit companies  using the technology with royalty charges.    A 20-year limit on the validity of patents from the time of  application would minimize ``submarine'' patents, Japanese  officials say.  <H5>  Disclosure pressed </H5>   On another point, Japanese officials are pressing for  quicker  U.S. disclosure on pending patents.    The United States now discloses no information on  applications until a patent is officially awarded, on the  premise of protecting the inventor's interests. This means,  however, other parties may not be able to find out whether a  patent is being sought for a certain technology.    In Japan and Europe, patent information is disclosed 18  months after the filing of an application.    The United States has put a great emphasis on protecting  intellectual-property rights. It excels in the development of  intellectual property. In the intellectual-property category,  which includes patent and copyright payments, the United States  has by far the biggest surplus in world trade--about $13 billion  in 1991.</p>

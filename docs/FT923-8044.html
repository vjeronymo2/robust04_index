			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swissair searches for flight plan to recovery - International airlines are struggling to secure their futures, but the Swiss carrier appears unable to establish a convincing strategy As of an aged movie queen, it might be said of Swissair these days that it has a great past. Investors, suppliers and even ordinary Swiss are questioning whether the distinguished airline has a future. Swissair recently reported a record first-half loss of SFr116m (Dollars 87.8m), a reflection mainly of the cut-throat competition that has broken out on the North Atlantic this summer, but also of more serious structural problems. The result was broadly in line with expectations, and Swissair bearer shares, which have lost more than half their value since 1989, scarcely moved from the SFr610 level. But the big disappointment among investment analysts was that there was still no sign the airline was coming to grips with the challenges of the future. At a time when even big airlines, such as British Airways and Air France, are making large-scale alliances to secure market share, Swissair seems unable to establish a convincing strategy. 'They have made a lot of little moves to keep up their quality, but nothing to improve their strategic position,' Mr Dominique Bertrand, an analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation, says. 'I would like to see them doing something that shows dynamism.' Swissair's dilemma is that its home country is too small to generate enough passengers to fill the non-stop flights that customers demand of an international airline. In addition, it is based in a country where wages are very high, and wages represent 40 per cent of its operating costs. In the past, it could overcome these disadvantages by offering a better service than rivals and charging higher prices for it. Today, service on other leading airlines at least equals that of Swissair, and critics say the Swiss airline, which may be something of a paradigm of its country, has been slow to respond to the tougher environment. Swissair officials find this criticism unfair. They claim they were among the first to see the necessity of strategic alliances, setting up one for long-haul business with Delta Airlines of the US and Singapore Airlines in late 1989 and another with Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines in May, 1990, the so-called European Quality Alliance. But Swissair looked to these alliances mainly for support in marketing and cost control. It was unwilling to commit to substantial financial pacts, so it could not force them to work. And they have not worked out as well as the group hoped. Singapore Airlines has preferred, for the most part, to continue to go its own way, and SAS and Swissair have been unable to agree on combined aircraft purchase orders. But the biggest setback was Delta's purchase last November of Pan American's European routes. This enabled the big US carrier, for which Swissair hoped to be a collector and distributor of European travellers, to compete head on with its partner at its Zurich base. If the two had had a stronger alliance, things might have turned out differently, analysts say. There was a mild resurgence of confidence in the group in April when Mr Hannes Goetz, an executive who is credited with transforming the foundries group, George Fischer, was appointed chairman. The shares rose from around SFr700 in early April to their peak for the year of SFr765 in late May. But by then the severity of the North Atlantic fare war was becoming apparent, and Swissair warned its earnings trend was 'unsatisfactory', sending the shares plunging again. The North Atlantic accounts for about a quarter of the airline's business, and its returns from there were being hit both by lower ticket prices and by the weakening of the dollar against the Swiss franc. The airline was already in the midst of a four-year programme to slash internal costs by SFr300m, but it suddenly accelerated the pace. It rationalised its freight haulage business, announced 400 redundancies in its 6,000-strong administration staff and ordered its two charter subsidiaries, Balair in Basle and CTA in Geneva, to combine as many of their activities as possible. Swissair executives remain defensive about their strategy. Mr Paul Muller, a director, admitted recently there were weaknesses in the kind of co-operation agreements the airline had established. But he saw no need to rush out and do a big deal just because British Airways did one. 'Co-operation gives you independence but doesn't bring security. Mergers can give security, but only the security that you will share the same fate. And decision making will be in the hands of others.' Mr Muller said Swissair still wanted to be independent and try to capitalise on its reputation for quality. 'Our future lies in management - among other things, management of airlines. We do not mean to gobble them up but to sell them management services.' Analysts remain unimpressed. 'I think things will get better in the next few months, but I do not think Swissair will make enough money to attract investors,' says Mr Urs Kunz, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Mr Kunz says the airline has to seek a large partner if it is to thrive, but neither the airline management nor the Swiss government bodies which hold 22 per cent of the shares, are ready to think about that seriously. 'When the situation gets worse, people will think more about it,' he predicts.</p>

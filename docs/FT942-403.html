			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Germany moves towards ban on UK beef imports The German government yesterday took the first legislative steps towards banning imports of British beef in a move which threatened a further deterioration in Anglo-German relations. Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, formally asked the Bundesrat, the German upper house, to approve a six-month ban of British beef to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. He was joined for the first time yesterday by Mr Jochen Borchert, the German agriculture minister, whose support is vital for approval of a ban. The German move follows the UK's veto last weekend of Germany's choice of Mr Jean-Luc Deheane, Belgium's prime minister, as the next president of the European Commission. Downing Street said Germany's actions would be raised during tomorrow's visit to London by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister. Mr John Major, the prime minister, would also raise the matter with Chancellor Helmut Kohl 'at some point'. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, urged the European Commission to make good its threat to take Germany to the European Court. In a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, she said: 'You have left Germany in no doubt about the legal consequences of a unilateral ban of this kind. I now expect you to take the necessary legal action immediately.' Mrs Shephard said she would be 'surprised' if the German action was retaliation for Britain's veto of Mr Dehaene. On BSE, she said the Germans were 'ignoring the community's scientific evidence and the community's legal system'. Officials in Bonn said press reports about BSE had so alarmed the German public that beef sales had fallen 30 per cent since March and that both farmers and retailers had been pressing for action. The Bundesrat will vote on July 8 whether to approve a six-month import ban. The fall in beef sales has also encouraged Mr Borchert to endorse the health minister's initiative. 'The half-hearted proceedings of the European Commission are incomprehensible,' he said. Mr Borchert had earlier been reluctant to associate himself with Mr Seehofer's campaign, fearing it would hamper the European beef trade and make him unpopular with his European counterparts. However, officials in Bonn said other agriculture ministers, notably the French minister, were coming round to the idea of stronger measures against BSE. One official said Britain could expect further trouble during the forthcoming German presidency of the EU.</p>

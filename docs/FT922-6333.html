			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Economic liberals not believers in market infallibility Sir, Joe Cryans is incorrect in his assertion that free marketeers believe that markets are infallible (Letters, May 16). Rather, most economic liberals consider that the aggregate of thousands, or millions, of free choices of those most closely involved in economic decisions - consumers, investors, businessmen etc - are rather less fallible than the edicts of politicians and bureaucrats imposed from above. Perhaps it would be helpful to remind Mr Cryans that during the 1970s the development of London's Docklands, which he proposes as an example of market failure, was largely in the hands of a committee of borough councils and the Greater London Council, during which period precisely nothing was done. Maybe, moreover, Mr Cryans should ponder the probability that most of the unfortunate victims of the formerly centrally planned eastern bloc countries would deem themselves more than fortunate if they enjoyed the housing, food and income of the Los Angeles 'underclass' whose recent rioting he blames on market economics.

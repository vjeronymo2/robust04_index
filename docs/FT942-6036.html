			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after early bond-induced setback - Market Report A further bout of substantial weakness in international bond markets led to yet another turbulent trading session in UK equities yesterday, with share prices fighting off waves of futures-induced weakness to finish marginally higher on balance. At the close of a difficult trading session, the FT-SE 100 Index was 4.1 firmer at 2,970.5. The final reading masked big swings in sentiment across international markets still beset by worries about inflation pressures and rising interest rates. The latest slide in bond prices followed in the wake of the cancellation of a June bund issue in Germany, hard on the heels of last week's cancelled bund auction. The news stunned European bond and equity markets, which were looking to open in good order after relatively steady performances during the closure of US and London markets on Monday and after the heavy losses in markets last week. Adding to the UK market's discomfort was a report published by National Westminster, the UK clearing bank, which forecast a rise in UK interest rates to 5.75 per cent by the end of this year and to 6.75 per cent by mid-1995. And sentiment was also affected by news that provisional MO money supply in the UK rose by more than 7 per cent last month. There were few signs of selling pressure when London marketmakers opened their books for trading. Share prices were marked higher, reflecting the relatively good per-formances from European bourses over the holiday period and the encouraging move by the Tokyo market to a 1994 high. The FT-SE 100 kicked off 10 points ahead at 2,976.4, seemingly in good heart. Within five minutes, however, share prices were on the slide, upset by rapidly falling bunds and gilts as the news of the cancelled German bund issue became known. Plunging bonds - the German long bund was up  5/32 for around five minutes before dropping like a stone - were the trigger for another large-scale sell-off in the Footsie future, which fell to a discount of some 30 points shortly after trading began. There was very little evidence of actual selling in the cash market, where marketmakers were obliged to chop their dealing prices as the future continued to give way. At its worst, in mid-morning, the FT-SE 100 was down 41.4 at 2,925.0. It then embarked on a sustained recovery, helped, dealers said, by a substantial trading programme across the range of leading stocks. It included heavy buy trades in stocks such as Cable and Wireless, Coats Viyella, GEC, Ladbroke, Rolls-Royce, Sears, Smith &amp; Nephew, Tesco and Thorn EMI. With Wall Street opening only modestly easier - it moved into positive territory shortly after London closed - the UK market stabilised and began to rally in the wake of hurried bear closing. Senior dealers remained extremely nervous about the market's ability to rally further. 'The German bund looks sickly and will take gilts with it; I am not convinced we'll be able to make worthwhile progress until the European elections are out of the way and bonds are much more stable,' was the view of the head of marketmaking at a leading UK investment bank. Others took the view that last week's 5 per cent retreat was far enough and discounted much of the potential bad news. Turnover was a low 505.2m shares. Customer business value on Friday, when the market came under severe pressure, was Pounds 1.08bn.</p>

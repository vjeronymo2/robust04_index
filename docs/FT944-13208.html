			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / ICI up 59% in third quarter Imperial Chemical Industries yesterday provided confirmation that the chemicals industry is on the upswing with third-quarter figures that showed operating profits more than doubling in some divisions. But it warned that while prices for many of its goods were rising, those 'nearer the consumer', such as paints, 'remain very competitive'. Its shares fell 12 1/2 p to 786 1/2 p. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said demand in most markets looked 'more promising than for some time. Activity in the US, UK and Australian markets remains generally firm. Recovery in continental Europe appears to be under way and even the Japanese economy seems to have bottomed. Robust growth in the rest of the Far East continues.' Third quarter pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional items, rose 82 per cent from Pounds 72m to Pounds 131m. Sales for the same period rose 8 per cent from Pounds 2.16bn to Pounds 2.35bn. Including exceptional items, such as the costs of closing the Canadian paints business, pre-tax profits were Pounds 143m, 59 per cent higher than a year earlier. Earnings per share for the quarter were 11.1p against 7.5p in 1993. ICI's polyurethane businesses were among the star performers in the third quarter. The materials division, of which it is a part, saw trading profits more than quadruple from Pounds 3m to Pounds 14m. Trading profits for the first nine months were Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 19m for the same period of 1993. Third-quarter sales rose from Pounds 386m to Pounds 440m. ICI's biggest division, industrial chemicals, which includes petrochemicals and fertilisers, also performed strongly thanks to some 'sharp and swift' price rises for its products. Third-quarter trading profit rose to Pounds 71m from Pounds 21m as sales edged up from Pounds 902m to Pounds 977m. Nine-month profits totalled Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 80m in 1993. The poorest performer was paints, where third-quarter trading profits climbed from Pounds 34m to Pounds 37m on sales barely changed at Pounds 451m. Paints is one of the ICI's few businesses which sells directly to consumers. ICI said such businesses 'faced higher raw material costs and a limited ability to raise selling prices.' ICI is to spend Pounds 100m on a new plant in the Netherlands to make methyl diphenyl diisocyanate, a component in polyurethane manufacture. Lex, Page 20</p>

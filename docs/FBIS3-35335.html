			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpts] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu's supporters  enjoy a majority in the new Likud Secretariat, which was elected  last Thursday [17 February]. Several central activists from the  David Levi camp did not manage to get voted into the  secretariat. Ya'aqov Berdugo, secretary general of the Union of  Local Authorities in Israel, is one of those who failed to get  elected. A series of municipal heads identified with the Levi  camp were also voted out. [passage omitted]    A somewhat surprising fact is that eight persons newly  elected to the secretariat are identified with Moshe Qatzav's  camp. Altogether 29 secretariat seats were available. The  other 32 slots were reserved for the Likud's Knesset members  [MK's]. MK Netanyahu is not a member of the secretariat because  one of its duties is to monitor and supervise his work.  [passage omitted]    Netanyahu's associates expressed satisfaction with the  results of the elections to the secretariat. They stated that  those who declared they intend to "give Netanyahu a hard time"  were not elected, while all of those elected who are not members  of the Netanyahu camp are "suitable" candidates.    Levi camp members, on the other hand, claim it is misleading  to depict the results as a defeat for the Levi camp. According  to Levi's associates, this confrontation was not conducted on a  partisan basis and the Levi camp did not promote any candidates.</p>

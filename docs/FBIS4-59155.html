			<p>BFN     [Text] Health Minister Dr. Umid Midhat Mubarak has blamed  the persistent sanctions for the progressive deterioration in  health conditions in Iraq, citing a dearth in medicines and  medical facilities.    The minister was speaking at a news conference in Geneva,  where he is attending a World Health Organization conference.  Mubarak said the rising incidence of diseases and deaths among  children in particular is supported by reports drawn up by  international organizations.    Iraq has satisfied the conditions laid down by UN Security  Council resolutions, and is now, therefore, eligible for imports  of food and medicines. Certain quarters, however, are blocking  these deliveries, said the minister.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A House Foreign Affairs Committee member yesterday  claimed that Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui's "private holiday"  to Thailand would only benefit a certain political party.  Kuthep Saikrachang, the deputy House committee spokesman, made  the comment to Parliament reporters but refused to identify the  party. He said that during the last general election campaign,  a rumour was spread nationwide that some countries could "buy"  Thailand through some political parties that have spent "huge"  sums of money to win elections.    Mr Kuthep who is also Phalang Tham MP for Si Sa Ket, said he  did not know if Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, deputy leader  of the PDP, was told in advance of the Taiwanese leader's trip.  He also denied that PDP members have vested Interests in Taiwan.    Other House committee members also questioned why some New  Aspiration Party MPs and executives were seen at the dinner  meeting hosted on Valentine's Day at the Pacific Island Resort  Hotel in Phuket.    The NAP's Labour and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun  Kaeothong led a Thai delegation consisting of MPs and job  placement agency owners to Taiwan last year to seek more work  positions on the island nation for Thai workers.    Mr Kuthep told the press that the House committee would next  Wednesday invite Deputy Premier Amnuai Wirawan, Sqn Ldr Prasong,  and Mr Phaithun to give testimony about their alleged  involvement with the Taiwanese delegation.    Mr Amnuai was present at the party at the Pacific Island  Resort Hotel in Phuket while Mr Phaithun has denied that he  attended the meeting. The House committee deputy spokesman said  the Taiwanese leader's trip has prompted China's House Foreign  Committee to postpone its trip to Thailand from February 23 to  March 1. The postponement was seen by the Thai House committee  as a protest by the Chinese delegation. Mr Kuthep insisted that  his House committee would again invite the Chinese delegation to  visit the kingdom.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN OUSTED FROM SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> For the second consecutive season, Cal Lutheran has been eliminated in two  games at the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics softball  championships.  </P> <P> The Regals committed five errors and suffered their first no-hit defeat in two  seasons in losing a first-round game to Kearney (Neb.) State, 3-0, Thursday.  Bloomfield (N.J.) College then ousted Cal Lutheran from the double-elimination  tournament with a 1-0 victory.  </P> <P> DeeAndra Pilkington (18-5), the first CLU player to be selected to the NAIA  All-American team, had her streak of 25 consecutive scoreless innings snapped  when she allowed an unearned run in the third inning of the first game. The  Lady Antelopes (30-14) added two more unearned runs in the seventh on three Cal  Lutheran errors.  </P> <P> "I can't say I didn't wish we played a little better," Cal Lutheran Coach Wendy  Beckemeyer said. "Five errors is very unlike us.  </P> <P> "You just never know when you walk into a tournament like this who is going to  walk out with it. We expected them to be tough, but I thought our team had the  potential to beat them on our best day."  </P> <P> Sophomore right-hander Susan Johnson (22-7) of Kearney State struck out nine  and walked one en route to a complete-game victory. She allowed only two Regal  baserunners -- Pilkington, who reached base on an error in the first, and  Danielle Piotrowski, who walked in the third.  </P> <P> "Their pitcher was very strong, but I can't say she was tougher than any of the  pitchers we faced on a Division II level," Beckemeyer said.  </P> <P> In the second game, Cal Lutheran (35-18) collected five singles and stranded  six. Sophomore right-hander Leslie Stevens (12-6) gave up five hits and struck  out five in suffering the loss.  </P> <P> Patti Murphy tripled to right-center field with two out in the third and scored  on Kelly Dockx's single to center for the Lady Deacons' only run.  </P> <P> Freshman right-hander Pam Koller (23-2) struck out one and walked two en route  to a complete-game victory.  </P> <P> Beckemeyer, whose resignation became official Thursday, said that she was  disappointed with the Regals' early exit from the tournament but pleased with  their success this season.  </P> <P> "You have to look back on the entire season and not just the way it ended,"  Beckemeyer said.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran advanced to the national tournament after winning its second  consecutive District 3 title last week.  </P> <P> The Regals were eliminated in two games in the national tournament last season,  losing to Minnesota-Duluth, 6-2, and West Florida, 5-1.  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cash injection for Alphameric Alphameric, a loss-making computer equipment company, has secured its survival by raising Pounds 4.3m through a placing and open offer. Directors warned recently that without the cash injection the group would be unlikely to be able to continue trading. Over 50 per cent of the shares offered were issued to existing shareholders with the balance going to new institutional and private shareholders. Alphameric, which specialises in custom keyboards, electronic point of sale and satellite data broadcast systems, said it had a healthy forward order book with contracts from Alcatel and Groupe Bull of France, ICL, IBM, Microvitec, Linwood and Reuters. In the first six months of the current year the company incurred a loss of Pounds 377,000.</p>

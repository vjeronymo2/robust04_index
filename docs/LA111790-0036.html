			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAL FOR STRAWBERRY SEEMS TO MAKE FANS OF BOTH SIDES HAPPY  </P> <P> Hats off to the Dodgers for finally doing the right thing and not letting a  great one (Tim Raines, Rickey Henderson, etc.) slip away. Darryl Strawberry  will be a great Dodger for many years, but if the Dodgers are really serious  about winning a championship, they'll have to dig a little deeper into their  pockets and sign or trade for a left-handed relief pitcher, such as Dave  Righetti or Ken Dayley.  </P> <P> FRANK PEARLSTEIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HAVE NO LEADS IN SLASHING OF ACTRESS  </P> <P> Police on Sunday said they had no clues to knife attacks on two pedestrians in  Manhattan, one of whom was actress Viveca Lindfors.  </P> <P> The Swedish-born Lindfors, 69, suffered a facial wound that took 28 stitches  but said she would not be intimidated by gangs. Dennis Beal, 36, of New York  was slashed just a few minutes earlier Saturday morning and within 3 blocks of  the spot in Greenwich Village where Lindfors was attacked. Beal suffered cuts  on his face that required 40 stitches.  </P> <P> Police said they believed that a few marauding youths were responsible for the  two slashings, but they drew a blank as to their identities.  </P></p>

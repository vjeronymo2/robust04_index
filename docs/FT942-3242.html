			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa firm on rise in bullion Domestic institutional buying drove Johannesburg higher ahead of today's expiry of futures contracts, while a firmer gold bullion price also lent support. There were late gains in gold shares after bullion seemed ready to break out of its current narrow trading range through the Dollars 385 an ounce level after midday, before slipping back by the close of trade. The overall index advanced 41 to 5,762, industrials 14 to 6,723 and golds 56 to 2,121. Among the most actively traded issues, De Beers added 75 cents at R118.25 and Anglos R2 at R247. In golds, Vaal Reefs strengthened R11 to R421 and Kloof R1.25 to R54.75. Oryx, the developing mine, jumped 30 cents to R5. Foschini, the retail clothing and jewellery group, moved forward R5.50 to R107.50 following satisfactory annual results.</p>

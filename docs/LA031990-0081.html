			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANS BASK IN SYMBOLS, WESTERN IDEALS AS MOMENTOUS DAY MARKS FREEDOM;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: THE COMMUNISTS TURN UP WITH SOME GRAFFITI TO CELEBRATE.  </P> <P> If there was any one symbol for East Germans as they voted in their first free  elections, it was the flag.  </P> <P> Freedom, hope, peace -- the simple banner seemed to somehow capture the complex  feelings that have overwhelmed these people since the Berlin Wall cracked last  Nov. 9.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the flag was everywhere. It brightened the sooty windows of  high-rises in Karl-Marx-Stadt. It waved in front of decrepit, cold-water flats  in East Berlin. It fluttered above flower boxes in quaint old villages that dot  the countryside. It snapped in the breeze from buildings along the Oder River,  just a glance across the Polish border.  </P> <P> Uwe Muellmann hung the biggest one he could find outside his house in  Oranienburg, not far from the notorious World War II death camp at  Sachsenhausen.  </P> <P> Like the feelings it symbolizes, the red, black and gold flag is new to the  East Germans.  </P> <P> It is the flag of West Germany.  </P> <P> Election Day in East Germany sparkled, and everyone, it seemed, donned their  Sunday best to stroll about in the radiant sunshine.  </P> <P> Long lines often turned out not to be in front of polling stations but ice  cream stands.  </P> <P> One of the biggest crowds in the capital of East Berlin was in front of the  Palast der Republik, off Alexanderplatz.  </P> <P> The former Communist regime's showcase building, where Parliament meets, was  transformed into a media metropolis, with every television and radio station in  both Germanys broadcasting live from slick, portable studios.  </P> <P> Foreign networks also set up shop, with Japanese, Spanish, English, Swedish and  dozens of other languages creating a polyglot din.  </P> <P> But the curious East Germans who flocked by the hundreds to the Palast der  Republik weren't hoping for a glimpse of some TV personality or to ham their  way into some crowd shot.  </P> <P> They came to stare at the parking lot.  </P> <P> It was packed with sound trucks and satellite dishes, a high-tech al fresco  museum for the fascinated gawkers who could come no closer than a police  barricade ringing the lot.  </P> <P> "It's hard to imagine that the whole world is watching us," said one man.  "We're just the tiny German Democratic Republic."  </P> <P> The Communists, whose iron-fisted rule promised harsh punishment to even  mischievous vandals, bought some graffiti to celebrate Election Day.  </P> <P> Six-hundred placards spray-painted in 65 colors were commissioned by the  renamed Party of Democratic Socialism to decorate the foreboding brown facade  of what used to be Central Committee headquarters in East Berlin.  </P> <P> Fire truck ladders were used to hoist the mural, which featured a confusing  series of abstract images and the party slogan, "We Are the New Ones."  Spray-painted portraits of party chairman Gregor Gysi and Prime Minister Hans  Modrow -- now newly elected Parliament deputies -- were also hung.  </P> <P> And while the party advocates slower, more cautious unification with West  Germany, some things just can't wait.  </P> <P> The artwork was commissioned from three young artists based in Dortmund, West  Germany.  </P> <P> "No East German artists could have gotten the materials or done the work as  quickly as they wanted it -- in three days," explained one of the artists,  Bernd Richert.  </P> <P> Richert, whose professional name is "Zodiak," declined to say how much the  Communists paid for the display, which will stay up until April 1.  </P> <P> Bernd Neuendorf, a 35-year-old electrician from Frankfurt-Oder, voted early in  the day and then took a walk.  </P> <P> "The election is a good thing because, in principle, it's a free vote, and in  principle, everyone votes what they believe and has a say in the future," he  said.  </P> <P> In the old days, East Germans "voted" by simply folding a pre-marked ballot and  dropping it in the box.  </P> <P> Anyone who asked for the privacy of a voting booth was assumed to be re-marking  the ballot to vote against the Communists. Their names were always taken, and  even suspicion of disloyalty often cost people jobs, promotions and privileges.  </P> <P> Neuendorf found it strange and wonderful to vote for the first time in his life  "without the comrades watching you."  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds overcome early profit-taking Gold shares shrugged off initial profit-taking in Johannesburg to climb again as bullion pushed towards Dollars 390 an ounce. Turnover had slowed from Tuesday's higher levels but sentiment remained positive amid expectations of further gold price strength in the medium term. But analysts warned that profits were likely to be taken on any short term dips in the bullion price after the recent hefty gains, which have seen the golds index rise by more than 200 points since the start of trade last Friday. Golds yesterday climbed 33 to 2,535 and the overall index added 45 at 6,054. Industrials put on 18 at 6,680, led again by Iscor, which finished 25 cents higher at a new peak of R4.85. De Beers was 75 cents firmer at R110.50.</p>

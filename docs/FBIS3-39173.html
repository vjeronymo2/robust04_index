			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Executive Committee of the Thessaloniki chapter  of the Union of Municipalities and Communes of Greece today  submitted a resolution to James Blanford, U.S. consul general in  Thessaloniki, protesting the U.S. decision to recognize Skopje.  Konstandinos Kosmopoulos, Thessaloniki mayor and committee  president, headed the committee. Correspondent Dhespina Khari  reports:    [Begin Khari recording] The resolution addressed to U.S.  President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Administration stresses that  this action is against the historical [word indistinct] of the  symbols and boundaries of Greece, since they are threatened if  this situation continues. Consequently, it also threatens to  ignite the greater Balkan region. Finally, the resolution  stresses that the current stance of the United States fatally  injures the traditional friendship between the Greek and  American people. It also creates an adverse climate for the  United States from the Greeks who expected understanding and  justice from our great ally. The resolution asks the United  States to exert pressure on Skopje to eliminate all those  aspects that obstruct the development of good relations with  this state, including the name, symbols, propaganda, and  expansionist designs.    In a statement, Kosmopoulos emphasized that this U.S. action  has shaken Greece, called on the government to take a position  on the issue, and noted that people and leadership should  finally unite to face the critical issues of the country.    The mayors of Macedonian towns plan to hold an extraordinary  meeting 19 February to decide on new initiatives in the  framework of the local administrations and submit proposals to  the Central Committee for dealing with the issue further. It  has not been ruled out that they will propose new dynamic  mobilization, similar to the rally of 14 February 1992 in  Thessaloniki and the one in Athens in 1993. [end recording]</p>

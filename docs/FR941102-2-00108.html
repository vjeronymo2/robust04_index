The complete application is available for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is registered as a closed-end management investment company that was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. On May 27, 1988, applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N&hyph;8A, pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On June 8, 1988, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;2 pursuant to both the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. On August 11, 1988, this registration statement became effective registering 700,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and applicant commenced the initial public offering of the stock as soon as practicable thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On March 29, 1991, the applicant's board of directors adopted a resolution recommending liquidation and dissolution of applicant. On or about April 26, 1991, a proxy statement describing the proposed Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution (``the Plan'') and relating to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 20, 1991, was mailed to all shareholders of record. Applicant's shareholders approved the Plan at the annual meeting of shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On May 21, 1991, applicant commenced the sale of its portfolio securities, and sold all of its securities by June 30, 1991. Applicant's common stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ National Market System as of the close of business on May 20, 1991, the date its shareholders approved the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. As of May 20, 1991, applicant's 700,100 shares of common stock outstanding were held by 405 record shareholders. As of May 17, 1991, applicant's common stock had a net asset value per share of $10.0365 ($7,026,553.65 in the aggregate). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On July 23, 1991, in accordance with the Plan, applicant's board of directors authorized, and applicant deposited with AmSouth Bank N.A., of Birmingham, Alabama (``the Liquidating Agent''), the amount of $6,825,975.00 for payment, at $9.75 per share, of the first liquidating distribution to all shareholders of record as of May 20, 1991. The Liquidating Agent paid this first liquidating distribution to applicant's shareholders upon receipt of their respective stock certificates or satisfactory lost share affidavits and indemnity agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On November 4, 1991, applicant's board of directors authorized a final liquidating distribution in the amount of $88,842.69, representing $.1269 per share, for payment to those shareholders entitled to receive the first distribution. On November 8, 1991, the Liquidating Agent made this final distribution. Six shareholders, owning a total of 440.4062 shares delivered their stock certificates and properly executed letters of transmittal after November 8, 1991 and received their distributions ($4,349.85 in the aggregate, $9.8769 per share) at various times after November 8, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors, the Fund created a liquidating trust to pay off its creditors. $67,340.55 was transferred to the trust shortly after its creation. All expenses of liquidation have been paid, however, and no funds remain in the liquidating trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicant's expenses for liquidating were approximately $24,549 in legal fees and costs, $11,608 in accounting fees and costs, $4,125 in printing fees and costs, and $4,000 in directors' fees, all of which expenses were allocated to applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicant paid $12,143.92 in brokerage commissions following approval of the Plan. Of that amount, $11,743.92 was paid to Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama. Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, Inc. is an ``affiliated person'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of applicant and of Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment Advisors, Inc., applicant's investment adviser. $400.00 in brokerage commissions was paid to Porter, White &amp; Yardley, Inc. which is not an ``affiliated person'' of applicant or Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment Advisors, Inc. Applicant represents that the commissions charged by Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment Advisors, Inc. and by Porter, White and Yardley, Inc. were competitive with the brokerage commissions and fees charged by other brokers for similar transactions and were consistent with section 17(e) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Warhol silkscreen sold for Dollars 2m: Saleroom A SILKSCREEN creation by Andy Warhol depicting 210 Coca-Cola bottles massed in seven lines sold for Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.17m) at Christie's in New York on Tuesday night. The buyer was Thomas Ammann, a Zurich dealer. The price was below Christie's optimistic estimate of up to Dollars 2.8m but the fact that the work sold for such a comparatively high sum will reassure the contemporary art market, which has suffered a two-year decline. The sale of 68 lots totalled Dollars 11.26m and was 18 per cent unsold. Christie's had turned away works it considered unsaleable and had insisted on low reserves on lots it did accept. That ensured that the great majority sold, often close to their low estimate. The painting 'Untitled' by Cy Twombly went for Dollars 660,000, also below estimate, but 'The Ocean' by Hans Hofmann was at the top of its forecast, making Dollars 550,000. Christie's also offered 25 works from the vast collection amassed by the late Frederik Roos. All but one sold and new auction records were set for two of the UK's leading contemporary sculptors, Tony Cragg and Barry Flanagan. Cragg's 'Three Cast Bottles', executed in 1988 and consisting of three vast bronze canisters, sold for Dollars 99,000. Flanagan's 'Acrobats', showing one of his famous hares balancing another, one of an edition of five, made Dollars 93,500 slightly below the Dollars 100,000-Dollars 150,000 estimate.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs help push Wharfedale to losses of Pounds 1.3m WHARFEDALE, the loud-speaker manufacturer, fell into losses in the six months to December 31. The Leeds-based company, which is being reorganised under a new chairman and chief executive, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.34m compared with a profit of Pounds 106,000 last time. The outcome was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 443,000 covering reorganisation and other costs. There was also an extraordinary charge of Pounds 366,000 relating to the write-off of its investment earlier this year in Finewood, a loudspeaker cabinet maker, and the closure of its Germany subsidiary. Turnover for the period fell to Pounds 4.75m from Pounds 6.72m as the company faced difficult markets in the UK, where it has 40 per cent of turnover, and Europe. Losses loss per share were 6p compared with earnings 0.2p and there is again no dividend. The last distribution to shareholders was in 1988. Mr Pieter Totte, who took over as chief executive in January, said that the reorgan isation programme was going according to plan, operatio nal performance had improved and that the company was on the way to recovery. Wharfedale was also preparing to make a sizeable ac-quisition in the hi-fi industry in the next three months, he added. The main priorities of the reorganisation were to concentrate on the core businesses, cut costs and reduce gearing. The company has already reduced the workforce by 30 per cent and cut Pounds 880,000 of costs. Wharfedale would not indicate what its borrowings were but said it hoped to reduce gearing by bring-ing debtors and stock levels down. Mr Totte indicated that the company was now ready to make acquisitions in order to attain the critical mass necessary to fund R&amp;D expenditure. Even excluding the large Japanese manufacturers, there are about 20 smaller players in the UK with turnover of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m. 'We want to take the fragmentation out of this market by assuming critical mass of about Pounds 40m in turnover,' he said.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gillette shake-up costs Dollars 164m Gillette, the US shaving and consumer products group, yesterday announced plans to reorganise its overseas operations in a move that will bring 2,000 job losses over the next two years and a one-time after-tax charge of Dollars 164m in the fourth quarter of 1993. It said sales, profits and earnings were expected to reach record levels in the fourth quarter before special charges, reflecting the introduction of new products and the inclusion for the first time of results from Parker Pen, which it bought last May. The company said that the job losses, which represent about 6 per cent of the workforce, would fall largely outside the US, but did not specify where. Gillette said that the cuts were likely to be balanced by growth elsewhere, so overall employment would remain roughly at the present level of 34,000 by the end of the year. Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the company needed to reorganise so that it could compete more effectively and expand in international markets.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Lobbyists' pressure proves positive in EC: British organisations beating their rivals to the policymakers BRITISH organisations are rapidly learning how to lobby Brussels. In the process, they are even beating French and German rivals in the race to the policymakers, according to Mr Jeremy Richardson, director of the European Public Policy Institute based at Warwick University. 'British groups, used to a tradition of close and informal relationships with civil servants, are rather adept at influencing policymaking in Brussels and indeed are regarded as good Europeans,' says Mr Richardson. His conclusions find support among those involved. 'The British operation nowadays tends to be quite sophisticated compared with the French and Germans,' says the Brussels office of Hill &amp; Knowlton, the US public relations company. Mrs Edith Cresson, before she became French prime minister, called on French companies to be more assertive in dealing with Brussels directly, rather than relying on l'etat, according to Mr Richardson. By contrast, the British Textiles Confederation is lobbying Brussels directly to prevent German carpet quality standards, based on springiness, taking precedence over their UK equivalent, based on comfort and durability. The chemicals sector, too, has taken the battle to Brussels. Mr Jonathan Peel, executive director of EC and government relations at the UK Chemicals Industries Association, says: 'We have become much more active in Brussels in the last two or three years because more of the weighty decisions are being made there.' Britain's parliamentary constituency system has bred lobbying into UK companies, says Mr Peel. 'There isn't the same sense of that in France or Germany'. The EC patchwork means that UK companies have found themselves on familiar ground when lobbying. There are 23 directorates-general, each divided into a number of policy units. The commission is headed by 17 commissioners, each of whom has an entourage to screen those seeking access to the commissioner.</p>

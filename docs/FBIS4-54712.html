			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- Today's talks between  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and his Indonesian  counterpart Ali Alatas focused on the further development of  relations between Bulgaria and Indonesia and on bilateral  economic cooperation in particular. Mr. Ali Alatas arrived here  on a two-day official visit today. The two sides are not  expected to sign bilateral documents during the visit.    There are no political problems between the two countries,  Mr. Alatas said upon his arrival, a statement later confirmed by  his Bulgarian counterpart. We have already established  cooperation on many problems at international forums and we have  similar stands on a number of issues, Mr. Alatas said. We will  focus on the possibilities for deepening economic cooperation  and will seek ways to a further improvement of our relations,  the Indonesian foreign minister said.    Later on Mr. Alatas described his meeting with the Bulgarian  minister as very useful. The meeting continued an hour longer  than scheduled. The two sides discussed bilateral relations and  possibilities for promoting cooperation between the two  countries and exchanged opinions on some regional problems.    The two sides shared the opinion that it is necessary to  broaden economic cooperation and trade between Bulgaria and  Indonesia, Mr. Alatas said after the meeting. The two ministers  agreed that the present trade is far below the potentials of the  two countries. It was agreed that the next session of the joint  Bulgarian-Indonesian Committee, which held its first session in  1990, should be held as soon as possible. The two countries  have already signed several basic agreements: a trade agreement  and an agreement on avoiding double taxation. "We agreed that  to these we should add an agreement on reciprocal investment  protection," which will be signed soon," Mr. Alatas said. After  the successful visit to Indonesia of a Bulgarian delegation  headed by Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev a similar  Indonesian delegation will visit Bulgaria, the Indonesian  foreign minister said.    Economic contacts are most important in our bilateral  relations, the Bulgarian foreign minister said in response to a  question on the results of the meeting. According to Foreign  Minister Daskalov both sides wish to establish more regular  contacts -- both as regards bilateral relations and at  international forums in areas of mutual interest. From the  economic point of view, Bulgaria is of interest to Indonesia not  so much as a market, which is quite far removed, but rather as  an opportunity for coming out on third markets -- the former  Soviet republics and the countries of the Balkan region.  Bulgaria has already gained experience and can provide transport  for a joint coming out on third markets, Mr. Daskalov said.    Tomorrow the Indonesian Foreign Minister will be received by  President Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and will  meet parliamentary leaders. Before leaving Bulgaria Mr. Alatas  will give a press conference.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / MB-Caradon in talks with RTZ SHARES IN MB-Caradon rose 16p to 303p yesterday after the building materials group confirmed it was involved in preliminary discussions to buy a large part of Pillar, the industrial products division of the RTZ Corporation. Caradon's share price has been weak recently because of investor uncertainty about how it would spend the Pounds 428m cash pile it received from the sale in April of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the French packaging group. RTZ's price was virtually unchanged. The disposal of Pillar has been widely expected because RTZ says it wants to concentrate on its core mining business - it is the world's biggest mining company. Neither side yesterday would go beyond a brief statement issued at the insistence of the London Stock Exchange after news of the talks was leaked to Sunday newspapers. The leaks suggest that a price of Pounds 750m to Pounds 800m might be paid, depending on how many Pillar operations Caradon acquires. It is thought the talks have yet to cover some significant issues and might fall through. However, some analysts expect a quick conclusion, possibly as early as next week. At the time of Caradon's sale of its CMB stake, Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said his group favoured a big acquisition in one of its core areas and that it could afford to spend up to Pounds 1bn. Some analysts suggested yesterday Caradon could finance the Pillar deal partly by equity. The group's last rights issue was in November 1991 at 205p a share. Although RTZ recently spent nearly Pounds 900m on coal assets in the US it insisted yesterday that it was in no urgent need of cash. Following the sale of oil, gas and gold assets from Nerco, one of the acquisitions, RTZ's gearing was not uncomfortably high, an official said. MB-Caradon's building products activities include bathroom products such as Doulton, Twyford and Mira, heating such as Stelrad radiators, Everest double glazing, and plastic products including Terrain drainpipes. Pillar operates via four subsidiaries: building products, engineering, electrical and Indal, a diversified industrial company. Turnover was Pounds 1.4bn last year and net attributable earnings Pounds 17m, far below the peak contribution of Pounds 162m in 1988. Indal has been suffering losses and analysts suggested that it might be excluded from the Caradon deal. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

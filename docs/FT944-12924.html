			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: No excuse for a dull autumn - Gardening We have had the most marvellous days for autumn colour: the field maples have been the most brilliant yellow in every farm hedgerow in which these easy trees are planted. I have been trying to see them in context with an outsider's eye, with this result. For six months of the year, marooned wives, harassed weekenders, and financiers who really do want to create something more than a paper muddle, engage in a constant battle to weed their flower beds, swap round their plants and colour-plan their borders. Their aim is to grow as many flowers as possible, arranged to look like heaven on a golden evening. They start to ease off in October, whereupon trees, shrubs and many border plants turn to colours of a brilliance which flowers cannot equal. Gardeners, though, are still fussing about the last few blooms on their roses, considering that autumn's other colours are for park-owners and farmers - but not for them. There are excuses, of course. 'How can we give up space for something which lasts for just a fortnight? The garden is too small. Autumn is too muddy. We have enough leaves to rake up already. The best place to see colour is in somebody else's arboretum. When we are more organised, we really must try to go to Westonbirt. Once you have seen the fall in Vermont, you do not want to bother with Sussex on a wet afternoon . . .' I disagree. Once again, the agapanthi have turned a brilliant yellow while the white rose blanc double has started its third season, turning yellow to match them. Anyone with acid soil, good trees or a euonymus has added an extra fortnight to a season which flower gardens cut short. Admittedly, you need the right euonymus. In a smallish garden, the answer is E. altus compactus, the winged form with branches that will have spread only about 3ft high and wide after several years. Two or three of them stand well against the front of a shrubbery, woodland or lightly-shaded hedge. They turn to the most amazing shade of scarlet, equalling anything in flower, and grow steadily almost anywhere. They are cheaper and less susceptible to drought or lime than the small Japanese maples which gardeners seem to prefer. Red Cascade is a bigger alternative; it is twice as large and not so bright but set with masses of red fruit. On acid soil, there is no excuse for a dull autumn among the declining azaleas. A few bushes of the easy enkianthus go a long way unless you like bell-shaped flowers in a dullish white during high summer. This weekend, they are something else: a flaming mass of red which saves their reputation in a sudden finale. Again, they are not large plants. I like to see them behind the smaller azaleas with a bush or two of the sensational disanthus behind them, perhaps to one side. Although its flowers are negligible, this larger shrub has leaves shaped like hearts which go to the colour of deep claret and crimson in slight shade wherever an acid soil is not too dry. Higher up, on any soil, it has to be parrotia, a Persian tree which is surprisingly lime-tolerant but likes to spread widely. It looks superb in rough grass if two plants are spaced out in isolation: you can train the central stem into a tall leader by supporting it on a tree stake, persuading it to make height which parrotias otherwise avoid for spread. Behind it, at a distance, you can put the upright ginkgo biloba as a narrow, vertical contrast. I wish our town councils had planted this urban tree as widely as in New York or Seoul. Ginkgos turn the most brilliant shade of yellow all over those curious leaves, which look like a webbed little hand. People worry that they grow too slowly to be worth planting as a boundary, but I notice that one of the best sources of unusual autumn trees would disagree. The Bluebell Nursery of Blackfordby, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, lists all sorts of varieties and indicates their probable size after five years. It estimates that a ginkgo would be eight to 12ft high by then. The supreme advantage of a ginkgo is that, although an extremely old tree, it thrives in our polluted cities. In its place, many authorities have preferred the coarse and stiffly-shaped malus, which is now called Bonfire, or one of the more common types of flowering prunus. It is always worth considering the autumn colour when planting a prunus, or flowering cherry, but the prettiest in flower and leaf are not always the best known. This weekend, I am being pleasantly surprised by the upright, single white Umeniko, which has such elegant leaves of a fresh, lively green and such pretty white rounded blossom in spring. I have never known it turn such a magnificent shade of red. Its only superior is more famous for the autumn season: another single white of great distinction called Korean Hill. Either of these trees would make superb specimens on the boundary or towards the back of the lawn of a smallish garden.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Clash over tax policies as parties step up poll battle CONFLICT between Labour and the Conservatives over the economy intensified yesterday, as both parties heightened the atmosphere of election campaigning with attacks on each other's taxation policies. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, left open the possibility of tax cuts in this year's Budget, while pledging he would take no risks with the economy. In an interview on TV-am, the breakfast television station, he also claimed that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, could not be trusted to run a free enterprise economy. Mr Kinnock, in a separate interview, promised that a Labour government would reverse any Budget tax rate cut, and accused the Tories of 'mischievous and completely misleading' efforts to convince the public that everyone currently paying the 40 per cent tax rate would pay 50 per cent under Labour. Speaking less than a week before he is due to start drawing up the government's Budget strategy with senior Treasury officials, the chancellor refused to endorse remarks made last October by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that tax cuts would be 'fool's gold' and unwise. Instead, he underlined that he would agree to 'no artificial or inappropriate' stimulus for the economy in the Budget. He would make his assessment of what was needed in the coming weeks. 'If it were necessary to put up taxes, I would put them up,' he said. But he came under heavy fire from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats for 'paralysis' in the face of the downturn, while senior Labour spokesmen reacted swiftly to his attack on Mr Kinnock, saying the chancellor was 'peddling dishonesty' over Labour's plans. On BBC radio yesterday, Mr Kinnock emphasised that Labour's proposed 50 per cent top tax rate would affect only people on 'well over Pounds 30,000 a year'. Labour's plans to remove the ceiling on national insurance (NI) contributions would affect only the 12 per cent of NI contributors who were on Pounds 20,240 a year and over and paying the contributions on all their income. He also renewed Labour's promise to introduce policies 'that will be combating unemployment and recession directly, and at the same time building foundations for future economic growth'. Those two themes will be highlighted further this week. At tomorrow's shadow cabinet meeting before the House of Commons resumes next week, Labour's senior spokespeople will discuss campaigning and the party's plan to accelerate recovery. On Wednesday the party will publish a document on Labour's long-term strategy for the economy. Today the Tories begin a further campaign against Labour's taxation policy, headed by Mr Lamont and Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. This follows the claim at the weekend by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, that Labour's tax plans would send the housing market 'into a nosedive'. The Liberal Democrats will launch on Thursday their plans for first steps to be taken after the election. The party will aim to build momentum with a rally in London on Saturday.

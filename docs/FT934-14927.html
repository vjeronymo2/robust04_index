			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / People: Paul takes over as Norwich Union chairman George Paul, 53, chief executive of Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the agriculture and foods conglomerate, is to take over as chairman of Norwich Union, the insurance and investment group. He replaces Michael Falcon, now 65, who is retiring at the group's annual general meeting next April, after 30 years as a director of the group. Mr Paul, who has been a director of Norwich Union since April 1990 and vice-chairman since May 1992, has taken a keen interest in risk and insurance management, arguing that both insurance buyers and insurers themselves can much to reduce losses - and insurance claims - by implementing effective risk management schemes. At Harrison &amp; Crosfield claims from fires, thefts and accidents have fallen sharply and insurance costs reduced by between 30 and 50 per cent, since the group appointed a full-time risk manager and introduced safety features such as sprinkler systems to its factories, warehouses and offices. Mr Paul also plays an active role in crime prevention work in his native Suffolk and is an advocate of greater insurance industry involvement in the area.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Docklands venue in receivership THE London Arena, the conference, sporting and conference venue in Docklands, has gone into receivership with debts of more than Pounds 20m, Vanessa Houlder writes. Security Pacific, the project's principal banker, yesterday appointed Mr Jonathan Phillips and Mr Mark Homan, partners in Price Waterhouse, as administrative receivers of Arena Developments (Europe) Ltd (Adel), the majority of which is owned by Mr Frank Warren, the boxing promoter, and his partner, Mr John Botros. The Arena attracted insufficient events to survive, even though the events, which ranged from professional wrestling to a concert by Pavarotti, were sometimes well supported. It was handicapped by bad publicity and the delay in building up infrastructure in Docklands. The under-use of its facilities, together with construction cost overruns and the cost of safety regulations brought in after the Bradford Football Club disaster, severely handicapped cash flow. Mr Warren, chairman of Adel, said he had signed a sale and leaseback deal with Occidental Financial and Holdings, an international industrial and financial conglomerate represented by Mr Larry Gillick, on April 17. 'I expect this transaction to complete as contracted,' he said.</p>

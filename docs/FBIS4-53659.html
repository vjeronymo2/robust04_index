			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il recently bestowed again a benevolent solicitude  upon the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital.    He sent large quantities of baby's clothes of various styles  for boys and girls, precious pharmaceuticals needed for the  manufacture of medicines and articles to be used in ensuring  medical services on a higher level.    Always paying deep attention to the work of the Pyongyang  Maternity Hospital, he had sent more than seven tons of wild  honey and over ten tons of unshelled pine nuts on three  occasions this year alone.    The hospital completed in March, 1980, is a comprehensive  medical service base appointed with latest equipment, which was  built for women and children on the initiative and according to  a plan of Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The total floor space of the hospital is over 60,000 square  metres.    The hospital has a total of 1,500 beds, of which 600 beds  are  for the obstetrical section, 400 for the gynaecological section  and 500 for just-born babies.</p>

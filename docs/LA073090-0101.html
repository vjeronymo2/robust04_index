			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE NOT BANNED IN BOSTON;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: A SMALL MUSEUM IS THE FINAL DESTINATION OF THE TOURING EXHIBIT  THAT HAS AROUSED BITTER CONTROVERSY AND A MAJOR POLITICAL ROW.  </P> <P> The Institute of Contemporary Art is small by most museum standards.  Technically it isn't a museum at all, since it doesn't have a permanent  collection. It's located in the Back Bay section of town, adjacent to a  brownstone firehouse that was once a police station.  </P> <P> Right now, the institute's gallery space is in shambles as it prepares for a  new show. The place is a clutter of letters and paint buckets, exposed  electrical outlets and barrels of litter. Still on the walls are remnants of  "Diamonds Are Forever," a show dedicated to stylish baseball memorabilia. But  there won't be many Little Leaguers at the next exhibit, which opens Wednesday.  It's titled "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment."  </P> <P> Boston is the final destination of a seven-city tour that has aroused bitter  controversy and a major political row in Washington. In the balance hangs  artistic freedom and even the very existence of the National Endowment for the  Arts. And worse, the last institution to house the Mapplethorpe show -- in  Cincinnati -- now has its director facing a trial on misdemeanor obscenity  charges. Yet the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center attracted the largest  attendance in its history for the Mapplethorpe photographs.  </P> <P> One thing is sure: the ICA and its director, David Ross, are on the right side  of the law in Boston. On July 3, Massachusetts Atty. Gen. James Shannon was  asked by a reporter whether the Mapplethorpe show was obscene and he opined,  after viewing a catalogue of the show, that it wasn't. Shannon's official  declaration effectively precluded any prosecution by zealous local officials.  During the first week of July, a private group also asked Mayor Raymond Flynn  to cancel the show. The group calling itself the Catholic League for Religious  and Civil Rights charged that the ICA was housed in a city-owned building.  </P> <P> However, Bruce Rossley, commissioner for the mayor's office of arts and  humanities, denies that the building belongs to the city, and adds that no  taxpayer money -- even for police -- will be used in the Mapplethorpe exhibit.  (Rossley added, for the record, that Mayor Flynn will not attend the show.)  </P> <P> Despite having the upper hand, the ICA's director believes that the  Mapplethorpe exhibition has been damaged.  </P> <P> "The big lie of the radical right is that this exhibition is homosexual  pornography and pedophilic pornography," said Ross. "It's been told so many  times that, like all the big lies in history, it's begun to take place as a  truism. It's not even a debated issue among people of a broad range of  intellectual and ideological backgrounds."  </P> <P> Exhibit organizers may still have to face a battle from the state legislature.  With the Mapplethorpe show and the controversial photographs of Andres Serrano  (whose photograph of a crucifix dipped in a glass of urine sparked earlier  local protests) in mind, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a  last-minute amendment to bar state funds to any institution that displays  artwork that is "offensive" to a religious group or depicts the sexual  exploitation of children.  </P> <P> The legislation written by Rep. Thomas Finneran (D-Dorchester) was passed by a  2 to 1 margin in a late-night vote on May 22. It is currently bottled up in  conference with the state Senate, which defeated the measure. Finneran's  legislative aide, John Regan, said, "I venture to say this will not be a high  priority" at ongoing conference sessions.  </P> <P> In the Boston City Council, conservative councilman James Kelly wrote an open  letter to Mayor Flynn declaring that the Mapplethorpe photographs are designed  "to stir the minds of pedophiles." Kelly asked that the directors of the ICA be  charged with violations of the child pornography laws if they don't comply with  police demands to remove the photographs of nude children. So far, the mayor  has not responded, but a spokesman from the attorney general's office said that  the photos violate child pornography laws only if they are "lewd and  lascivious" and that the attorney general doesn't believe these photographs  are.  </P> <P> Even moral support for the opponents of the Mapplethorpe show -- who say they  "want the same thing to happen in Boston as in Cincinnati" -- has been lagging.  The archdiocese newspaper, the Pilot, condemned the exhibition but acknowledged  Mapplethorpe's artistic abilities. Even the conservative Murdoch-owned tabloid,  the Boston Herald, long the champion for conservative causes, wrote an  editorial on July 10 that stated "No one -- repeat -- no one is going to take  people by the hand and force them into Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art.  No one is going to impress innocent bystanders."  </P> <P> And recently, eight managers and directors from Boston's oldest and largest  arts institutions wrote to "affirm our support for the Institute of  Contemporary Art."  </P> <P> With their legal strategies blocked, opponents of the Mapplethorpe show only  have acts of civil disobedience and vocal demonstrations left in their arsenal.  Already there have been arrests at the Robert Klein Gallery, located near  Boston's South Station where Serrano's "Piss Christ" was on display.  </P> <P> Lisa Murphy, assistant director at the gallery, said that she was present on  June 19 when "five individuals came into the gallery and stood in front of  'Piss Christ' with their rosary beads and stood there silently and prayed. They  wouldn't speak to me. At the end of the day they went home. But they were  standing directly in front of the photograph. On Wednesday, three people came  back and again were standing in front of the photographs. They were trespassing  and Robert (Klein) called the police to have them removed. They didn't  acknowledge the policemen and they ended up being arrested. But we didn't press  charges."  </P> <P> The protesters failed to identify any group affiliations.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The transplanting of  humus-potted maize seedlings began in the Korean countryside.    Co-op farmers across the country have grown sturdy maize  seedlings for reaping a bumper maize harvest again this year.    They do farming on a scientific and technical basis on the  principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop  on the right soil. This year, too, they began transplanting  humus-potted maize seedlings all at once as the right time came.    Rural communities now are overfulfilling daily quotas by use  of various highly-efficient machines including tractors and  fertilizer-spraying machines.    The transplanting of humus-potted maize seedlings is one of  the important farming processes in Korea.</p>

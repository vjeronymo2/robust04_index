			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUDAN LEADER FACES CRISIS AFTER GENERALS REFUSE TO BACK HIM  </P> <P> The nation's leaders held emergency meetings Wednesday after army generals  rejected the prime minister's pleas for support, apparently leaving him little  choice but to resign.  </P> <P> With troops on alert throughout the country, members of Sudan's five-member  collective presidency -- the Supreme Council -- were meeting with political  leaders to solve the crisis, sources said.  </P> <P> On Monday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi had threatened to resign next Sunday  unless the army allowed him to form a broad-based government and assured him it  would continue to respect the constitution.  </P> <P> The day after his statement, the generals insisted that their demand for  reforms, given to Mahdi nine days ago, be carried out in full.  </P> <P> In their earlier ultimatum, the officers told Mahdi that he should either spend  more money on defense or accept a pact drawn up between rebels and the  Democratic Unionist Party to end the five-year-old civil war in the south.  </P> <P> Mahdi has also asked trade unions, whose frequent work stoppages have plagued  his 33 months in office, to freeze strikes so long as the war with the rebels  continued.  </P> <P> But 37 trade unions and political parties have rejected Mahdi's request.  </P></p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Technology: Sematech funding in doubt The US Department of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) plans to phase out funding specifically designated for Sematech, the US semiconductor industry research consortium, according to a report prepared by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional watchdog agency. Although Darpa plans to continue to spend Dollars 80m (Pounds 42m) per year for the next four years on chip manufacturing research, the defence agency is turning its priorities towards military rather than industrial needs. The future of Sematech does not appear to be in doubt, but the change is significant. It signals an end to the Sematech model of industry-government collaboration that has placed the consortium at the centre of an ideological debate over 'industrial policy', since its formation in 1987. For the past five years, Sematech has been in the unique position of receiving government funding for its efforts to boost the international competitiveness of an industry segment. It was established to enable the US semiconductor industry to regain world leadership in chip manufacturing. In the future, if Darpa has its way, Sematech will receive government money only on a project basis. Like any contractor it will have to mesh its goals with those of the defence agency. However, Darpa's decision has come as no surprise to Sematech. The consortium is already emphasising the defence value of its efforts and is downplaying its crusade for government intervention to prevent the US losing its technological lead. Sematech officials remain cautiously confident that it will continue to receive Darpa funding at the desired level of Dollars 100m per year. A Darpa proposal to reduce fiscal 1993 funding to Dollars 80m has been countered in Congress. Darpa's change of strategy is hardly the final word. Congress may well restore direct funding for the consortium. What is more, a change of president would all but assure Sematech's future. Al Gore, the democratic vice presidential candidate, is a strong advocate of the US high-technology industry.</p>

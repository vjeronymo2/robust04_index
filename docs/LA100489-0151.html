			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER TELLS U.S. OPTIONS ON PANAMA;  </P> <P> DISMISSES 'ARMCHAIR' CRITICS OF FAILURE TO ASSIST COUP  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today the United States reserves the  right to use military force against Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio  Noriega, and dismissed "armchair generals" who faulted the Administration for  not aiding Tuesday's failed coup.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration had known since  the weekend about the coup plans but the rebels never asked for U.S. assistance  and "we did not promise any involvement in the coup."  </P> <P> Baker, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, said: "The United States  retains the option to use American forces. That option has never been ruled  out. But if you're going to risk American lives, it's the President's view that  you do so on your own timetable.  </P> <P> "You do so based on your own plans. At a time of maximum opportunity and  advantage. You don't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in response  to rapidly changing circumstances," he said.  </P> <P> At the Pentagon, one official said various military options were discussed  Tuesday with the President as the coup unfolded. Another official said: "When  it appeared as though Noriega might have been dethroned . . . there were  several options considered, none of which was going in and getting him."  </P> <P> A number of members of Congress criticized the Bush Administration for failing  to support the coup leaders.  </P> <P> "It's easy to be an armchair general," Baker said, without informing the  committee members whether the rebels had at least tacit assurances of U.S.  support, as some reports have suggested.  </P> <P> Baker said Bush acted immediately to do two things -- to safeguard American  lives and to assure the security of the Panama Canal, just as the United States  is obligated to do under the Panama Canal treaties.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Baker refused to say whether the U.S. military had offered  any assurances of support to the insurgents.  </P></p>

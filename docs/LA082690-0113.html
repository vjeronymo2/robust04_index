			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> IRAQ GIVES BRITONS WEDDING PARTY  </P> <P> A British couple trapped in Iraq wanted a simple blue-jean wedding.  </P> <P> But Iraqi authorities insisted that the Persian Gulf crisis should not prevent  the betrothed from a more traditional Western wedding, including a champagne  toast, a wedding cake and a white bridal gown.  </P> <P> Thursday's ceremony was even broadcast on Baghdad television Friday.  </P> <P> "We have decided to get married while here. . . . We are happy anyway,"  Deborah, the bride, shouted over Western music blaring from loudspeakers.  </P> <P> The broadcast showed Robert (no second name given) in a dark suit kissing  Deborah Janes in a white gown to the tunes of an Iraqi musical band and a  children's choir.  </P> <P> About 40 Iraqi "guests" and fellow British hostages wished the couple a happy  life thereafter.  </P></p>

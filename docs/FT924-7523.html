			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Humana stops paying dividends HUMANA, one of the largest hospital and healthcare companies in the US, is to stop paying dividends next year. The news sent its shares sliding by almost 17 per cent on Friday. Humana linked the pay-out halt to its plans to split the business into two separate companies. Its healthcare management business is being spun off from its chain of 78 hospitals in the US and Europe. The company gave few clues as to why the dividend was being suspended after the payment due on February 1, merely saying that it would 'provide the resources for taking advantage of opportunities post spin-off, whatever they may be'. Many institutional investors, which had held Humana stock partly for its dividend, rushed to sell after the announcement. The shares were the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday and closed down Dollars 4 at Dollars 19 7/8 . Humana has disappointed Wall Street over the past year with lower earnings and reported a Dollars 166m loss for the quarter ended on August 31 after hefty one-time charges related to the spin-off. The company's hospitals appear to have been hurt by anger among doctors forced to accept discounted fees from the health management side of the business. The physicians have been sending lucrative patients to rival hospitals. The spin-off is intended to reduce this friction between the two sides of the business. However, analysts are at a loss to explain the reasons for the dividend elimination, pointing out that the company enjoys strong cash flow from its hospitals.</p>

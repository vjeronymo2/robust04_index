			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING / EARL GUSTKEY;  </P> <P> NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN MANCINI AND CAMACHO  </P> <P> Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini balanced a plate on one knee and stabbed at chunks of  fruit with a plastic fork. With his other hand, he slapped his free knee,  possibly imagining that it was Hector Camacho's face.  </P> <P> "This isn't for money!" he told a reporter, in an agitated manner.  </P> <P> He said he believes that beating Hector Camacho would be more a public service  than strictly a business proposition.  </P> <P> "People think I'm doing this just for the money. Hey, I've been offered more  money to come back and fight Roger Mayweather, Greg Haugen and Juan Coggi. But  none of those fights turned me on. This one does."  </P> <P> Mancini pointed across the room toward Camacho. The prince of New York's  Spanish Harlem was flexing his muscles for photographers, mock-combing his  hair, showing off his gold chains and preening.  </P> <P> "Can you believe him?" Mancini said, stuffing more grapefruit wedges in his  mouth.  </P> <P> "I can get up for this guy, believe me. It used to be, years ago, he just  bothered me. He was like a mosquito that had flown into a room I was in. But  now, he's a lot more annoying. Now I finally get to pick up the fly swatter."  </P> <P> This was at a news conference the other day to announce the date, March 6, and  site, Reno, for Mancini's return to boxing.  </P> <P> Mancini looked over his shoulder again at Camacho. The Macho Man was flexing  again and asking a woman if she was married.  </P> <P> "Look at that," Mancini said, disgustedly.  </P> <P> "See, those people are laughing, but he doesn't understand that they're  laughing at him, not with him."  </P> <P> Mancini, 27, has been out of the ring for 47 months, since he absorbed a second  beating from Livingstone Bramble and retired. Since then, he has appeared in  two movies, two TV shows and 10 commercials, made a workout video, done some  boxing TV commentary and bought a condo in Santa Monica and a house in  Youngstown, Ohio, his hometown.  </P> <P> "Santa Monica is nice, but Youngstown is forever," he said.  </P> <P> So we probably can believe him when he says he doesn't need to fight Camacho to  pay bills. It should be noted, however, that the promoters are saying that the  two will split a guaranteed $2 million, and that pay-per-view revenue could  kick it up to an additional $2 million to $3 million each.  </P> <P> Still, Mancini pushes the public service message.  </P> <P> "I don't respect a guy who looks down at society's rules and says: 'I'm going  to do anything I want.' He's bad for boxing, a poor role model for kids. How  would you like it if your son was looking up to this guy?  </P> <P> "People from Spanish Harlem have come up to me and said: 'Please, whip this  guy's . . . He's disgraced us."  </P> <P> Mancini's references to Camacho's questionable citizenship are presumably  spurred by Camacho's arrest record. The latest entry, last February, included  charges involving cocaine possession and assault in a Florida case.  </P> <P> When these two boxers were put in the same room this week, you wanted to hold  your breath, and not just because a company such as Warner Bros., the  pay-per-view telecast distributor, would enter into a multimillion-dollar deal  with a guy who once did 3 1/2 months at Rikers Island for grand theft, auto.  </P> <P> No, you also worried that since we're now in an era in which television's  influence is pulling pro boxing promotions alarmingly close to the cartoon-like  silliness of pro wrestling's, someone might throw a chair. Or a fruit plate.  </P> <P> Camacho tried. He got under Mancini's skin a couple of times, but Mancini  stayed cool. Camacho stayed silly. When they posed for photographers together,  fists up, the cameramen motioned for them to get closer together.  </P> <P> When they did, Camacho, leering, said to Mancini: "Hey, you're breathin' in my  ear, Ray. You must have a passion for me."  </P> <P> Mancini, who began training in Las Vegas this week, said he would train 5 weeks  in Las Vegas, then 3 in Reno. One Las Vegas oddsmaker already has made him a 3  1/2-1 underdog.  </P> <P> The bout will be at 140 pounds, a good number for Mancini.  </P> <P> "I weigh 140-141 right now," he said. "I'll have to maintain weight in  training, not take it off. Believe me, I'll be in shape for this guy, because  he's going to run from me all night. If there's a door in that ring, he'll find  it."  </P> <P> Dan Goossen, manager of Michael Nunn, said Thursday that Nunn could earn $8  million in 1989 without fighting Sugar Ray Leonard or Thomas Hearns, which is  what promoter Bob Arum is trying to arrange.  </P> <P> "It looks like 1989 will be a big year for Michael," Goossen said, grinning at  the understatement. "If it works out that Leonard and Hearns get together, and  that Michael wins the undisputed middleweight title and then gets the  Leonard-Hearns winner, that would be icing on the cake.  </P> <P> "But even without that happening, we project Michael making something like $5  million to $6 million meeting (Sumbu) Kalambay, then unifying the title against  the (Iran) Barkley-(Roberto) Duran winner.  </P> <P> "At that point, if Leonard or Hearns aren't there for us, we'd probably defend  the undisputed title once here, then maybe go to England (in early 1990, most  likely) and meet someone like Nigel Benn for $3 million."  </P> <P> At Thursday's Los Angeles news conference for the Nunn-Kalambay fight, which  will be March 25 at the Las Vegas Hilton, Hearns, who was present along with  Leonard, offered another name for the suddenly interesting middleweight  sweepstakes.  </P> <P> "I know that Marvin Hagler is back in the gym and working out, so I know he's  at least thinking of coming back," Hearns said.  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> A couple of big guys, in separate bouts, are set for the Ray Mancini-Hector  Camacho undercard: George Foreman and Riddick Bowe, the U.S. Olympic  super-heavyweight silver medalist. . . . "A Night with the Weavers" is the  theme for the Jan. 31 show at the Country Club in Reseda, where heavyweight  Mike Weaver, 37, and his triplet sons, middleweights Floyd, Lloyd and Troy, all  will box on the same card for the first time.  </P> <P> Also on Jan. 31, heavyweights Mark Wills and Donnie Coats will meet at the  Irvine Marriott. . . . CBS offers junior welterweights Frankie Warren and  Mickey Ward Sunday from Atlantic City.  </P> <P> When Mike Tyson, visiting his estranged wife, Robin Givens, was involved in an  altercation Wednesday night with a reporter and a TV cameraman in Vancouver,  Canada, his adviser, Don King, didn't even know he had left Las Vegas, a Las  Vegas Hilton source reports. Tyson had been in Las Vegas for 2 weeks, training  for his bout with Frank Bruno Feb. 25. The first posted Las Vegas odds favor  Tyson over Bruno, 9-1.  </P></p>

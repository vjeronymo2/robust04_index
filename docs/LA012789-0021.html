			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 50 ARE SLAIN IN SRI LANKA  </P> <P> About 50 people were killed in Sri Lanka in the worst single day of violence in  the campaign for Feb. 15 parliamentary elections, police in the Asian island  nation reported. Military sources said troops will help protect candidates. The  dead included a candidate and five members of his family. Eight candidates and  several of their supporters have been killed so far since the campaign began  Jan. 10. In most of the killings, victims were dragged from their homes and  shot. Police blamed the attacks on a left-wing, mainly Sinhalese, group based  in the south. Rival political groups could also be responsible, analysts said.  </P></p>

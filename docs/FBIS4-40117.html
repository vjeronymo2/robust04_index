			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1645 GMT on 13 June broadcasts, as part of its  pre-election programs, a 15-minute interview with presidential  candidate Oleskandr Moroz by correspondent Borys Oliynyk. Due  to a technical problem several minutes of this broadcast were  lost at the beginning.    Borys Oliynyk asks Oleksandr Moroz to explain his economic  program. Moroz replies: "With regard to the economy, when there  will be normal authority and when this authority adopts a  strategy of economic reforms that will be accepted by the  people, then society may be consolidated and these problems may  be resolved. In the last few days I worked with a group of  scientists on such a strategy. It is called the basic  directions of establishing a national economy of Ukraine. The  main point is to make the economy work in the interests of the  working individual--an honest individual who earns a living with  his labor and his intellect. People understand that it is  impossible to live like this because it is not fair."    Moroz goes on to expound on his economic program. He says  these were stabilizing the money system, changing the credit  policy in order to protect the producer, changing the country's  import and export policies, and reforming the banking system.  "It is important that relations between the state and the  producer are fair and they should be built on economic laws so  that the individual has the possibility of realizing his work,  intellectual, and other potentials," adds Moroz. He goes on to  say that the economy should be based on a "state regulated  market." He criticized the present system which, he said, some  people called reforms but really meant that Ukrainian goods were  being sold abroad for pennies. One result of this was that hard  currency was being stored abroad and this was a crime that  should be stopped. He also criticizes the shortage of books in  schools and advocated supporting Ukrainian culture and education  through raising the profile of the intelligentsia.    Borys Oliynyk then asks Moroz to comment on the rising level  of unemployment and organized crime. Moroz replies: "Much has  to be done in order to bring order to the state. You were right  in saying that one of the biggest concerns for people's honor  was the turmoil, uncertainty, and even fear." He adds that in  order to fight organized crime it is necessary to make use of  the security service and some military formations, as well as  the internal affairs bodies.    By way of conclusion, Oleksandr Moroz says that Ukraine  should be a powerful state in the world community and that he  would like the people of Ukraine to build a state with a society  that was in a process of progressive development.</p>

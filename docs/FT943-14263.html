			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology: Satellite sales - Emiko Terazono continues a series on electronic retailing with a look at Japan's used-car auction network A black BMW 525i flashes on to the screen and within seconds the three-year-old car, which has been repaired in four places, is bid up to Y3.21m (Pounds 20,400) from the initial price of Y3m. After 25 seconds, it is sold to a dealer 700 miles away from Tokyo. The blinking numbers and beeping noises are not part of a new video game, but of Aucnet, Japan's first satellite-linked, used-car auction network. The control room, situated in the company's head office in central Tokyo, hooks up more than 3,000 used-car dealers around Japan. They buy and sell 3,500 used cars through the system a week, about 5 per cent of Japan's overall used-car auction sales. The still photograph images of the cars along with full details of repairs and other relevant data are sent to the subscribers' computer terminals via satellite. The bidders use joysticks to register their bids, which are transmitted to the control room's IBM host computer through a telephone line. 'It's easier than a video game,' says Koji Sasaki, director of Aucnet. While the conventional used-car auction involves taking the car to a designated area, the system has allowed dealers to trade used cars while sitting in their offices, cutting costs for space, transport and personnel. The potential seller can hedge the risk of losing money on costs if the car is not sold, while also retaining the merit of keeping the vehicle as merchandise on the premises until a buyer appears. And although conventional auctions have been limited to local areas, giving rise to around 140 local used-car auction exchanges around Japan, the network has managed to create the country's first national auction network, linking dealers all over the country. The company was founded in 1984 by Masataka Fujisaki, who owned a computer software company and a used-car dealership. After finding auctioning for used cars time- and cost-consuming, he devised a plan to auction used cars through an electronic network. The initial attempt was made by sending members laser discs with the photographs and information of the cars through parcel delivery and conducting an auction through a telephone-linked computer network. However, the deliveries of the discs would sometimes be delayed; and the discs, vulnerable to rough handling, would often be broken or cracked. In 1989, with marketing and financial help from Orient, a consumer credit company, Fujisaki hooked up with Japan's first commercial communications satellite, launched that year. The satellite speeded up the bidding procedure and lowered costs for the company. Last year Aucnet linked 320 used-motorbike dealers around the country and has started motorbike auctions once a week. However, not everything went smoothly from the start. There was initial opposition from the nation's used-car dealers' association, which feared Aucnet would threaten the existence of the local auction exchanges. It launched an 'anti Aucnet committee' and threatened to eject any member who joined the satellite network. The association was eventually forced to accept Aucnet after many of its dealers joined despite its campaign, and the network's membership has grown sharply from the initial 500 in 1989. While only dealers can become members, individuals who want to sell their vehicles can participate via the company. Last year 100 cars belonging to individual owners were sold through the system every month. The key to Aucnet's success, says Sasaki, is the speed at which the information is processed through the system and transmitted to the bidders. But another important element has been the company's rigorous inspection and evaluation standards of the used cars. Aucnet officials had to convince members that the certified inspectors (who rated the used vehicles) were to be trusted and that members could buy the cars unseen. Aucnet currently has 120 inspectors nationwide, who rate the cars on a scale from one to 10, and provide a bidding minimum which reflects the car's state. The company's innovative system has been reflected in its profitability. It initially invested Y1.5bn in the computer system, and broke even in 1989. The company went public on the over-the-counter market in 1991, and last year, thanks to the popularity in used cars due to the prolonged recession, its pre-tax profit rose 25 per cent to Y1.14bn on a 15 per cent increase in revenue to Y4.73bn. The company derives its revenues from sales of the satellite receivers and computer terminals to leasing companies, which in turn lease the equipment to members. Registration, inspection and photography fees for the used cars and brokerage fees when a deal is completed are also part of Aucnet's income. Sasaki says there is room in the domestic market for Aucnet to expand. Only 15 per cent of the 20,000 used-car dealers are Aucnet's members, and there are regions where the system has not penetrated. The company sees the potential in applying its satellite network to other sectors which have inefficient auctioning processes, such as flowers, real estate and meat. Meanwhile, Aucnet hopes to crack the US used-car sales market, which is said to be five to six times as big as the Japanese market. The company, which obtained a patent for its system in the US in 1989, has set up a US subsidiary in Atlanta, Georgia and wants to start auctions from September. But it may take a while for Americans to become used to buying second-hand cars unseen. Sasaki says that it may take two to three years for the concept to be accepted. And Aucnet faces competition from other satellite auction operators, such as Independent Car Auctions, a UK car auctioneer. It has recently tied up with Manheim Auctions, a leading US automobile auction company, to set up a satellite service. Sasaki says he is not worried about the competition due to Aucnet's domestic success. However, he admits that Japanese and US used-car buyers look for different things in a used car and a data and rating system will need to be adapted. 'Japanese are picky about how a car looks, and hate small scratches and dents. US consumers are more conscious of the vehicle's basic functions,' he says.</p>

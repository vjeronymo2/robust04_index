			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wang Qiren, chairman of the board of the </F> Bank of China, by unidentified RENMIN RIBAO reporter; date,  place not given: "Striving for Steady Development of Hong  Kong's Banking Business -- Wang Qiren, Chairman of the Board of  the Bank of China, Answers Staff Reporter's Questions on  Issuance of Hong Kong Banknotes in Hong Kong"]    [Text] [RENMIN RIBAO] Please talk about the preparations  for the Bank of China's [BOC] participation in issuing Hong Kong  banknotes.    [Wang Qiren] The Hong Kong Branch of the BOC will issue Hong  Kong banknotes in Hong Kong on 2 May this year. This is a major  event in the history of the development of the BOC and is also a  grand occasion in the issuance of Hong Kong banknotes. The  BOC's preparations for its participation in issuing Hong Kong  banknotes began in September 1992. It took 20 months to design  the banknotes, complete the legal procedures, and print and  issue the notes. During this period, the relevant Hong Kong and  mainland departments assisted us effectively, and Hong Kong  citizens also supported us. This enabled the preparatory work to  proceed smoothly. Here, on behalf of the BOC and through your  newspaper, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the  relevant departments and friends who showed their concern for  and supported the BOC's issuance of Hong Kong banknotes in Hong  Kong.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What are the main characteristics of the Hong  Kong banknotes issued by the BOC?    [Wang] There are five face values. The design is based on  Hong Kong scenery. The obverse is the BOC Building, accompanied  by Eastern flowers and plants; the reverse depicts some unique  Hong Kong buildings and scenery. With this design, we would  like to portray Hong Kong's position as an international  monetary, trade, tourist, and shipping center; to display Hong  Kong's vigorous economic life and its style and features; and  also to express our wish for common development and prosperity  between the BOC and Hong Kong.    [RENMIN RIBAO] As far as I know, a bank must conform with  some strict conditions if it wants to become a note-issuing  bank. What conditions and basis does the BOC possess?    [Wang] For a long period of time, the BOC Group in Hong Kong  has abided by the principle of "basing itself in Hong Kong and  serving Hong Kong." It has actively developed its business,  loyally served its citizens, and supported local industrial and  commercial development, thus enjoying the citizens' trust. In  addition, it also has made marked development in all vocational  fields. Last year, deposits in the BOC increased by 30 times  over 1978 and the loans released increased by 46 times. Its  commercial banking business also has developed rapidly. By the  end of 1993, BOC assets amounted to 700 billion Hong Kong  dollars; it had more than 350 branches on Hong Kong Island, as  well as in Kowloon and the New Territories; and their employees  numbered 18,000; making it one of the important monetary groups  in Hong Kong. In the course of its development and growth, the  BOC has regarded performing social duties and supporting public  welfare activities as its unshirkable responsibility; has done  its best for the steady and healthy development of Hong Kong's  banking business; and has taken an active part in all kinds of  activities that promote social progress. The BOC has always  regarded preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and  maintaining its position as an international monetary center, as  being where its fundamental interests lie. We may well say that  the BOC's rich financial resources, steady style, and  distinguished reputation are the basic conditions that have made  us a note-issuing bank. These also serve as the basis for the  Hong Kong citizens and people in all circles to trust the BOC to  issue banknotes.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background for the BOC to  participate in issuing banknotes?    [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing Hong Kong  banknotes  before 1997 is the manifestation of our full confidence in Hong  Kong's future. We are happy to see that the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law have resolved Hong Kong's future  in a satisfactory way, under the principle of "one country, two  systems" and "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong." In the  economic field, China's reform and opening up in the last 15  years have promoted sustained economic growth on the mainland.  This has brought about many new development opportunities for  Hong Kong's economy and has promoted economic links and  cooperative relations between Hong Kong and the mainland. Now  the "China factor" has become an important one for Hong Kong's  economic development. In the future, China's economy can be  expected to maintain rapid growth rates of 8 to 9 percent, and  Hong Kong's economy will benefit from this for a long time.  This will lay a reliable foundation for Hong Kong's post-1997  prosperity and stability. Under these circumstances, the BOC  has participated in issuing Hong Kong banknotes. Together with  the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard  Chartered Bank, it will play a positive role in maintaining  monetary stability. This also corresponds with the good wishes  of people of various circles in Hong Kong.    [RENMIN RIBAO] As requested by the existing arrangements,  before issuing Hong Kong banknotes, the issuing bank should  submit U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange fund to obtain a  noninterest liabilities certificate as a preparation for issuing  banknotes. This arrangement has made it impossible for the  issuing bank to gain any profit from issuing banknotes. This  being the case, as a commercial bank, how does the BOC view the  significance of its participation in issuing Hong Kong banknotes?    [Wang] As you have said, under the existing arrangements,  the  BOC cannot derive any commercial benefit from issuing banknotes.  Instead, it will have to bear the operational cost for issuing  banknotes and undertake the risk of foreign exchange losses  owing to fluctuations in the Hong Kong dollar. We participate  in issuing banknotes out of consideration for the overall  situation and with the fundamental target of helping to maintain  Hong Kong's monetary stability. In the past, the BOC has played  a positive role in cooperating with the Hong Kong Government's  monetary management authorities in ensuring the steady operation  and healthy development of the monetary system. After becoming  a note-issuing bank, the BOC will help strengthen the Hong Kong  money market. This will be beneficial to the prosperity and  stability of Hong Kong banks and monetary business, to the  consolidation and enhancement of Hong Kong's position as an  international monetary center, and to a steady transition toward  1997.    [RENMIN RIBAO] As a note-issuing bank, will the BOC's  relations with other banks in Hong Kong change?    [Wang] No. After becoming a note-issuing bank, the BOC will  continue in its operations to abide strictly by Hong Kong's  monetary laws and will continue to support the position of the  Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard  Chartered Bank as the main issuing banks in Hong Kong. As in  the past and at present, we will be willing to engage in fair  competition with Hong Kong- and foreign-funded banks in Hong  Kong, to develop together, to cooperate with each other, and to  create common prosperity.    [RENMIN RIBAO] After participating in issuing Hong Kong  banknotes, what is your bank's great plan for development?    [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing banknotes means  that our social responsibility has become heavier. In the  future, our bank will continue to display its strong points,  advance with an enterprising spirit, carry out careful  operations, and strengthen our service. As always, together  with the other two issuing banks, we will make new contributions  to the stability and development of the Hong Kong monetary  system.</p>

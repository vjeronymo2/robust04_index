			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Australia revises inflation to 3% THE AUSTRALIAN government has revised its inflation forecast for 1993-94 to 3 per cent, down from its budget calculation of 3.5 per cent. The revision followed the announcement from the official statistics bureau that the consumer price index rose by only 0.6 per cent in the September quarter, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.2 per cent during the quarter. This is below all expectations of the market, which has been worried about the weak Australian dollar during the past six months and about a federal government budget loaded with new tax measures. The biggest price rises were in tobacco products, meats and vegetables, and motor vehicles. Price declines were biggest in mortgage interest rates, credit card charges, clothing and pharmaceutical goods. Australian business and trade unions have kept up the pressure on the government of Mr Paul Keating to cut interest rates and kick along the slow economic recovery. More encouraging news concerned the official figures on skilled vacancies, which have risen in two consecutive months. The September figure was 32 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>

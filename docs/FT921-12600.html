			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Blow to savers HUNDREDS of savers with the Nationwide Building Society, who found that it closed their accounts to new investors and then put a similar new account on the market with a better rate of interest, have little cause to rejoice at a ruling this week by the Building Societies Ombudsman, Stephen Edell. He asked Nationwide to pay compensation to an instant-access BonusBuilder account-saver who discovered that CashBuilder, another instant-access account, offered a better rate. But he ruled against similar complaints by Capital Bonus 90-day account-holders who found they were locked out of a better deal from a new account called CapitalBuilder. In the first case, the ombudsman decided that the society had not given adequate publicity to its rates but, in the second, he ruled that the publicity was sufficient. He felt that people who opened 90-day accounts consented to be locked into them for that time. Edell said: 'Investors should be vigilant about their investments, but I don't think that building societies ought to hide the interest rates paid on closed accounts.' Yet, the fact is that closed accounts are not some kind of unfortunate administrative accident. Building societies and banks use them to ensure that depositors earn less interest than they would otherwise do. Banks call the practice 'the recycling strategy' while it is known to societies as 'harvesting.' The aim is to keep the cost of bank and building society funds cheaper than they would otherwise be. It seems slightly ridiculous that savers should be expected to scan newspaper columns and notice boards in their branches to see if their building society is playing hide-and-seek with them over interest rates. That said, many savers are not as energetic in looking after their own interests as they ought to be. When Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester wrote to its customers with savings balances under Pounds 100 in October 1990, telling them they would no longer earn interest, it was surprised to find that many did not bother to take any action. The Nationwide case was a particularly outrageous instance of a savings institution not standing by its customers, and it is disappointing that there is not a hint in the ombudsman's ruling that he sees things this way. After all, for office was set up to protect the interests of consumers. The market seems to be moving ahead of the ombudsman, though. Since November, the National &amp; Provincial building society has been telling its customers what it thinks to be the best account for each of them. It has a free advice line on 0800-446 600.</p>

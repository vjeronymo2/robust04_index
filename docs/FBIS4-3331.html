			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Defense  Minister Chi Haotian, winding up his official visits to Brazil,  Uruguay and Chile, left here for home today.    During his four-day Chilean visit, the last leg of his Latin  American tour, Chi met with Chilean President Eduardo Frei,  National Defense Minister Edmundo Perez and other military  leaders.    This is the first visit to Latin America by a Chinese  defense  minister after the founding of the People's Republic of China in  1949.    Prior to his departure for home, Minister Chi said that he  was very satisfied with his tour as it had helped to increase  mutual understanding, expand cooperation and deepen friendship  between China and the three Latin American nations.</p>

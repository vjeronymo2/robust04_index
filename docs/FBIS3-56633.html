Changes  in Republic's Government Imminent"]    [Text] The measure of stability that has come to Azerbaijan  after a prolonged period of power changes has begun to attract  new economic partners to the republic. One piece of evidence of  this is the signing in Baku the other day by Latvian Vice  Premier Ojars Kehris and Azerbaijan Vice Premier Samed Sadykhov  of an agreement on trade and economic relations between the two  countries. In addition, Mr. Kehris signed with Azerbaijan  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov a protocol on the establishment  of diplomatic links.    The Latvian vice premier announced after the ceremony that  under the agreement on economic and trade cooperation,  Azerbaijan would deliver to Latvia mainly fuel and petroleum  products, and would receive vehicles, in particular locomotives,  rail cars, and instruments.    In the meantime, Azerbaijan's leadership has begun  behind-the-scenes discussions about a coming reshuffle. It is  not ruled out that Lala Gadzhiyeva, Azerbaijan's secretary of  state, will be appointed the republic's ambassador to the United  Nations in the near future.    Lala Gadzhiyeva, doctor of medicine, took the office of  secretary of state last summer after Geydar Aliyev came to  power. Before that she lived and worked in Moscow, engaged in  political activities, and was one of the authors of the scenario  of Geydar Aliyev's return to power. She is still regarded as  the current Azerbaijan president's right-hand person. The  reason for such an influential figure quitting the political  center stage were Lala Gadzhiyeva's bad relations with Prime  Minister Surat Guseynov. Using all his influence, the latter  demanded that Aliyev remove Gadzhiyeva from the office of  secretary of state. Mrs. Gadzhiyeva tendered her resignation on  16 December but the president would not endorse it before he  could find her a suitable position.    The vacated position is contested by Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov and Arifa Ragimzade, state counselor for  administrative-territorial administration. Your SEGODNYA  correspondent has learned from a completely trustworthy source  that this position will most probably be filled by Gasan  Gasanov, who was prime minister under Ayaz Mutalibov and who  even at that time did not hide his sympathy for Geydar Aliyev.</p>

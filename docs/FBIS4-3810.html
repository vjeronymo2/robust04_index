			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (AFP)--China revealed Monday that  one person was killed and a dozen injured in the "accident"  earlier this month that postponed the launch of the country's  first geo- stationary satellite. The death occurred after a  fire broke out during testing of the new "Fengyun 2" satellite  April 2 at China's Xichang launch centre in the western province  of Sichuan, a China Aerospace Corp. spokesman said. "One  technician was killed and around 12 were injured," he added.    Previous reports of the incident had merely mentioned an  "accidental event," without detailing the extent of damage or  number of casualties. The satellite and the workshop in which  it was housed were both badly damaged in the fire, the spokesman  said. The satellite had been scheduled for launching in June  aboard a Long March-3 rocket. A new launch date has yet to be  fixed.    China has launched three metereological satellites since  1988  but the Fengyun-2 is to be the first "geo-stationary" model,  orbitting 36,000 kilometers (22,500 miles) from the earth and  monitoring one third of its surface.    China is extremely sensitive about its satellite launch  programme which has suffered several setbacks since its  inception in 1970, including an aborted attempt to send the  Australian Optus-B2 satellite into orbit in December 1992 aboard  a Long March 2E rocket. China pinned the blame for that failure  on the US-made satellite, but some foreign experts have called  into question the construction and relatively simple technology  of the Chinese rockets.    In October last year, China and the United States got  involved in a row over a Chinese satellite that had got lost in  orbit and which the Americans claimed had plunged into the  Pacific. China, while admitting the satellite was lost,  repeatedly denied that it had fallen to earth.    A total of five Chinese satellites have been scheduled for  launch this year.</p>

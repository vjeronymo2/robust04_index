			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 28 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The  Malaysian Armed Forces is expected to herald a new era as  studies are underway to equip the army with tanks to enhance the  country's defence in facing future challenges and threats.    Armoured Corps Chairman Brigadier General Mohamed Ariff Ali  said Tuesday the study was important to gauge the effectiveness  of deploying tanks to strengthen the country's defence as the  armed forces did not have any at present.    Tanks are now necessary in modern warfare. The armoured cars  being used do not come under the category of armoured cars, he  told reporters in east Malaysian Sarawak state. [sentence as  received]    He said the study involved evaluation of modern tanks made  in  Eastern Bloc countries like Russia in line with Malaysia's  recent purchase of military equipment like the MiG-29 fighter  jets.</p>

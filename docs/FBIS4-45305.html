The government also called on Mainland China to help  crack down on the island's worsening drug problem. Within 10  minutes, the heroin, estimated to be worth 6 billion new Taiwan  dollars on the street, was consumed in the fire in the national  incinerator outside of Taipei.    The drugs were roughly 10 percent of the [amount] stored at  the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau's headquarters in  Hsintien, Taipei County. Justice Minister Ma Ying-chiu said he  believes if the mainland cooperates, it will be a great help.  It is apparent that all [word indistinct] drug come [from] the  mainland. He added: Even drugs from the Golden Triangle where  the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Burma meet, are smuggled by  fishing boats from Mainland China. Drug smuggling addiction has  surged since Taiwan lifted the martial law in 1987.</p>

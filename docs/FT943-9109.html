			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Milosevic stands by Bosnia blockade: Serbian leader hopes enforcing the boycott will bring an end to sanctions At first, it seemed another Machiavellian manoeuvre to hoodwink the international community. But a week into Belgrade's embargo against the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia appears to be carrying out his decision to isolate his former proteges over their rejection of the international peace plan. In May 1993, when Bosnian Serb leaders spurned his efforts to promote the Vance-Owen peace plan, the embargo he threatened was forgotten within days of being announced. However - at least for now - Belgrade's move seems genuine. Except for a handful of lorries, transport to Bosnian Serb-held land has ground to a halt. Financial transactions are blocked. Most telephone connections have been cut. The pliant state media no longer vilify the west for 'unjust sanctions'. Instead commentaries blame the war profiteering and bellicose politics of Bosnian Serb leaders for sanctions against Yugoslavia. Mr Milosevic has not had it all his own way on the propaganda front. Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, calls it betrayal - anathema to a population fed a steady diet of nationalism over the past three years of war. The Serbian Orthodox Church this week also accused Mr Milosevic of treachery. However, after more than a week of aggressive television propaganda, public opinion in the distorted political landscape of Serbia is now widely in favour of the plan which calls on Bosnian Serbs to concede a third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control. At the same time, surveys suggest that many Serbs who support the plan oppose the embargo against their Bosnian kith and kin. Tired after three years of war in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia, and more than two years of UN sanctions, Serbia has been surprisingly quick to embrace Mr Milosevic's turnaround in the hopes that peace will go hand-in-hand with economic recovery. Mr Milosevic claims peace is 'the single most important interest of the Serbian people'. The Serbian president over the past year paved the way for the final showdown with the Bosnian Serbs. To get rid of extremists in Serbia, he called early elections and unleashed a merciless smear campaign against his erstwhile ultra-nationalist ally, Mr Vojislav Seselj, a deputy and paramilitary leader. He systematically purged nationalists from any position of power - the ruling Socialists, the police and the Yugoslav army. He has replaced nationalistic rhetoric with leftist nostalgia for former Yugoslavia. He had a hand in the well-placed 'revelations' that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his associates were involved in various criminal affairs, depriving Serb citizens of millions of dollars. Mr Milosevic is now looking to the west in the expectation that his gamble to cut off the Bosnian Serbs will be rewarded with the easing of sanctions. In Serbia, hopes have been raised that any day now the UN embargo could end. Meanwhile, western governments and Russia have not yet formulated their response to Mr Milosevic. They will most likely ask him to agree to the despatch of UN monitors along the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In return, they may offer the opening of the airport in Belgrade. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, yesterday met Mr Milosevic in Belgrade in an apparent attempt to persuade Serbia to back the dispatch of monitors to the 48 border crossings. If Mr Milosevic continues the blockade, the Bosnian Serbs will have little choice but to endorse the peace plan. Aides to Mr Milosevic predict that Mr Karadzic will not hold out for more than 10 days, claiming Bosnian Serb reserves are depleted. Yet, despite their total isolation, Bosnian Serb leaders seem confident. The thought that the war is nearly over appears far from their minds.</p>

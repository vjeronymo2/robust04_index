Foreign companies in China "are rushing to buy foreign cars  before the duty is imposed," an official at Nissan Motor Co.  said.    "But the boom will be short-lived. After the duties are  slapped on in April, shipments will plunge," he said.    In January, the Chinese Government decided to impose a  uniform 110 percent custom duty on cars to be purchased by both  domestic and foreign companies. The latter have up to now been  allowed to import cars duty-free.    Under the tax reforms, import licenses issued last year will  be extended to the end of March. This gave foreign firms  operating in China a three-month grace period to import  duty-free cars.    Nissan shipped some 2,700 vehicles to China in January, more  than double the number for December.    Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports have doubled since December to  some 250 vehicles a month, according to the industry sources.    The Chinese import boom has helped Japanese automakers  reduce  their inventories of completed vehicles by more than two-thirds  from 20,000 at the worst stage last year, they added.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Fraudster flees to northern Cyprus A TURKISH Cypriot businessman serving a five-year jail sentence for tax fraud is believed to have fled to northern Cyprus after failing to return from weekend home leave. It will embarrass the authorities, who are already smarting from former Polly Peck chairman Mr Asil Nadir jumping bail and fleeing to northern Cyprus three months ago while facing theft charges over his collapsed business empire. Mr Gultekin Mustafa Ben left Stanford Hill open prison in Kent, on Saturday morning for a five-hour family visit. A police spokesman in northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, told Reuters news agency that a man calling himself Mr Ben arrived there on Sunday with his wife. Mr Ben was jailed for five years and fined Pounds 100,000 in March after a five-month trial relating to a Pounds 12.5m VAT and PAYE fraud involving clothing factories, illegal immigrants and false invoices. Mr Ben, an accountant, had set up bogus businesses selling false invoices to his clients.</p>

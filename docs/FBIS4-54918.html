			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Imre Szekeres on the Official </F> Position of the Hungarian Socialist Party; Stormy Socialist  Debate"]    [Text] At yesterday's Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] news  conference, managing vice chairman Imre Szekeres announced the  official socialist position regarding statements made as part of  the television program A HET, and reported on what he had  learned during his trip to the United States and Canada. During  his visit, the vice chairman met with a number of leading  government officials and businessmen, including Democratic  Representative Tom Lantos, Thomas Dine, chairman of the Foreign  Investment Coordination Committee, and Republican Representative  Benjamin Gilman.    In his introductory remarks Imre Szekeres said that  according  to indications, all political parties regard the MSZP as their  chief opponent, and that this is understandable because the MSZP  enjoys the broadest societal support. In contrast to 1990,  political parties running in the present elections will have to  accept the decisions made by voters, the vice chairman stressed.  He added: The MSZP intends to take the place of the present  coalition government, but contrary to certain statements, this  does not mean the end of democracy. Relative to the program A  HET, Szekeres said that in an unprecedented manner, the chairmen  of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] and of Fidesz  [Federation of Young Democrats] were asked to make statements  relative to the MSZP; this was done in a manner that no elected  officer of the socialists could express his position. In  addition, by mentioning a possible dictatorship, party chairmen  Lajos Fur and Viktor Orban offended the will of voters, and took  the same position as Istvan Csurka. Matyas Szuros, who is not a  member of a single elected MSZP body, expressed his own views  only; these are not the same as the official situation analysis  of the MSZP, and besides, he had no right to judge who could,  and who could not be a party member, because he enjoys no  support either from the party leadership or the membership, at  least insofar as his statements are concerned.    In summarizing the experience gained during his trip to the  United States, Imre Szekeres emphasized that representatives of  political as well as business circles told him that they had no  reservations whatsoever about a possible socialist government.  The socialist politician reported on the MSZP's foreign policy  and economic policy goals, and on the situation that evolved in  and around the Hungarian public service media. According to  investors and economists, the economic situation is Hungary is  extremely critical, and therefore there is a need for changes,  and for a strong and effective state to resolve the problems,  Szekeres said. In answering questions on anti-Semitism, the vice  chairman had reassuring words to say. He made it clear that  anti-Semitism in Hungary is not at all stronger than in West  Europe, and that political anti-Semitism is not unmanageable  either, but having said that, every means must be used to combat  anti-Semitism.</p>

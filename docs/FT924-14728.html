			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart at Pounds 6.7m sees gloomy outlook HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, said yesterday it was assuming that there would be little improvement in the economy before 1994. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of the Glasgow-based group, said the recent collapse of the government's economic policies had brought further uncertainty into the deeply recessionary construction industry. The six months to July 31 saw pre-tax profits fall by 16.5 per cent to Pounds 6.73m (Pounds 8.06m) on turnover marginally down from Pounds 90.6m to Pounds 89m. Sir Matthew said these results were a 'first-class achievement,' particularly in view of the drying up of work for the tower cranes division . These activities lost more than Pounds 500,000 in the first half, compared with profits of Pounds 1.8m last year, but remained strongly cash generative. In the last three years the number of tower cranes owned by the group has declined from 180 to 80. Sir Matthew said efforts were continuing to further reduce the tower crane fleet and seek more work overseas, but it would be some time before the division returned to reasonable profits. Strong cash flow meant that at July 31 cash balances were between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m, in spite of spending almost Pounds 13m. The group expects to spend less than Pounds 10m in the second half, but said it might exceed that if offered good second-hand equipment at favourable prices. The remaining hire companies increased both turnover and profits, although bad debt provision was doubled to Pounds 1.3m. Sir Matthew said: 'Trading conditions remain very difficult as we approach the winter months and it is obvious that many of our customers are being heavily supported by their bankers and restricting capital expenditure. Unfortunately the construction industry is seeing a serious shortfall in its workload, which must act as more than a counter-balance to the improved situation which could otherwise have been anticipated from a continuing reduction in the amount of equipment available for hire.' Earnings per share fell to 2.39p (2.96p), but the interim dividend was given a nominal increase to 0.875p (0.865p). COMMENT Hewden Stuart is a class act - what a pity it has to operate in such a bombed-out industry. Analysts are impressed by the group's ability to generate cash and conservative depreciation policy, which led it to write off Pounds 11.85m from operating profits of Pounds 18.28m. But things are grim indeed when so staunch a supporter of the Tories as Sir Matthew refers to government policy in such scathing terms. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 12m put the shares on a hefty prospective multiple of about 19. Hewden Stuart will certainly benefit when the gloom eventually lifts from construction, but buyers at this level will have to join the management in taking a long-term view. See Observer</p>

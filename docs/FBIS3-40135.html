Studying this work again not  only helps remind us of the great achievements of Mao Zedong,  but contributes to a correct understanding of history during  those early days of New China, and enables us to gain useful  insights into many theoretical and practical issues.  <H3>  I. "On New Democracy" Includes Not Only "The Theory of New  Democracy" But Also "The Theory of New-Democratic Society" </H3>   From materials that I have come across, since "the theory of  new democracy" was first put forward, practically all  discussions on the topic either wittingly or unwittingly treated  "the theory of new democracy" as "the theory of new-democratic  revolution" and made no mention (at least not clearly) of "the  theory of new-democratic society." After the idea that "the  transitional period is a new-democratic period" was put forward  in 1953, whether or not there existed a new-democratic society  independent and distinct from the transitional period became a  theoretical problem. In 1955, the formulation "the transition  from a new-democratic society to a socialist society" was  reworded to read "the transition from capitalism to socialism."  After this rewording, whether or not there existed a  new-democratic society in theory again became a fundamental  theoretical problem. It was only under the guidance of the  Marxist ideological line of seeking truth from facts, which was  restored at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, that people began discussing these issues. For  example, in his paper entitled "On the Historic Mission of `The  Theory of New-Democratic Society'" and his long article entitled  "From `The Theory of New-Democratic Society' to `The Theory of  the Primary Stage of Socialism,'" Yu Guanyuan [0060 0342 6678)  systematically expounded, for the first time, the view that "the  theory of new democracy" established by Mao Zedong included two  closely related and inseparable components, namely, "the theory  of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic  society." (Footnote 1) (Yu Guanyuan: Studies on  Socialism in Political Economy, Vol 5, People's Publishing  House, 1991 (same below), pp 494-495) Bo Yibo also  unequivocally pointed out in his famous work entitled "Reviews  on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events": "Some people  said that this theory (that is, `the theory of new  democracy'--author) only applies to the period of new-democratic  revolution. This is not true. It also covers the conception of  a new-democratic society." (Footnote 2) (Bo Yibo:  Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and  Events, Vol 1, CPC Central Committee Party School Press,  1991 (same below), p 61) However, this question does not seem  to have aroused too much interest among Chinese academic  circles. As noted above, it will be useful in historical,  theoretical and practical terms to acquire a clear understanding  of this question.    In order to further illustrate that "the theory of new  democracy" covers "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and  "the theory of new-democratic society," it is necessary to  analyze the basic ideas of these two theories. The basis on  which Mao Zedong established "the theory of new-democratic  revolution" was that "Chinese society as it exists today is  colonial, semicolonial and semifeudal in nature." The  international background of that society was: "After the first  imperialist world war and the October Revolution in Russia," the  "Chinese bourgeois-democratic revolution" "became an integral  part of the world proletarian socialist revolution." (Footnote  3) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 2, People's  Publishing House (same below), pp 633, 666-667)    This being the nature of Chinese society, "it follows that  the character of the Chinese revolution in its present stage is  bourgeois-democratic, that its principal targets are imperialism  and feudalism and that its basic motive forces are the  proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, with  the national bourgeoisie taking part at certain times and to a  certain extent; it also follows that the principal form of  struggle in the Chinese revolution is armed struggle."  (Footnote 4) (Ibid, pp 604) Later, this was summed up by Mao  Zedong as: "A revolution against imperialism, feudalism and  bureaucrat-capitalism waged by the broad masses of the people  under the leadership of the proletariat. This is China's  new-democratic revolution, and is the general line and general  policy of the Chinese Communist Party in the present historical  period." (Footnote 5) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong,  Vol 4, pp 1316-1317)    This nature of Chinese society also determines that "the  Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages. The first  step is to change the colonial, semicolonial and semifeudal form  of society into an independent, democratic society. The second  is to carry the revolution forward and build a socialist  society." (Footnote 6) (Selected Works of Mao  Zedong, Vol 2, p 666)    The new-democratic society emerged as a great  accomplishment of new-democratic revolution. As a theoretical  reflection of this social practice, "the theory of  new-democratic society" is also a natural conclusion derived  from "the theory of new-democratic revolution." However, this  is only the interrelated side of "the theory of new-democratic  society" and "the theory of new-democratic revolution." The two  theories are also different in other ways.    In order to show their differences, it is necessary to look  at the history of this concept of new-democratic society.    Mao Zedong wrote his famous work The Chinese Revolution  and the Chinese Communist Party in 1939. In this book, he  not only systematically put forward the theory of new-democratic  revolution, but put forward the basic notion of a new-democratic  society. He said: "The whole picture will show the development  of socialist as well as capitalist factors. What will the  socialist factors be? The increasing relative importance of the  proletariat and the Communist Party among the political forces  in the country; leadership by the proletariat and the Communist  Party which the peasantry, intelligentsia and the urban petty  bourgeoisie already accept or are likely to accept; as well as  the state sector of the economy owned by the democratic republic  and the cooperative sector of the economy owned by the working  people. All these will be socialist factors. With the addition  of a favorable international environment, these factors render  it highly probable that China's bourgeois-democratic revolution  will ultimately avoid a capitalist future and enjoy a socialist  future." (Footnote 7) (Ibid, p 650) However, the concept of  new-democratic society was not yet used in this writing and was  only used for the first time in "On New Democracy." After this,  he also used this concept and other related concepts, such as  "new-democratic state system" (or "new-democratic states") and  "new-democratic economic forms" on several occasions. (Footnote  8) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 3, p 1056;  Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 4, pp 1253, 1433,  1476) He also analyzed the politics, economics and culture of  the new-socialist society on other occasions.    In short, in so far as the content of "the theory of  new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic  society," goes, the former is about the nature, targets, tasks,  motive forces, road and future of the Chinese revolution after  the October Revolution in Russia, while the latter is about the  politics, economics and culture of Chinese society after the  victory of the new-democratic revolution.    However, the fulfillment of the above-mentioned tasks of the  new-democratic society after the nationwide victory of the  new-democratic revolution is not something that can be  accomplished within a short time, but has to go through a  historical period. Mao Zedong talked about "the entire  historical period of new democracy" in "On Coalition  Government," written in 1945. (Footnote 9) (Selected  Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 3, p 1093) Here, "the entire  historical period" primarily includes the time needed to  complete the new-democratic revolution, but it also includes the  time needed to fulfill the various tasks of the new democratic  society. Mao Zedong further elaborated on this at the Enlarged  Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in  September 1948. At that meeting, Liu Shaoqi delivered a report  entitled "On the Question of Building New Democracy." The  central idea of the report is that after winning the democratic  revolution, we cannot directly and immediately make the  transition to socialism. He said: "We will make `Left'  mistakes if we take steps to eliminate capitalism prematurely."  Mao Zedong agreed with his view, but added in particular:  "When should we make an all-out offensive then? Well, perhaps  15 years after nationwide victory." (Footnote 10) (Quoted from  Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events,  Vol 1, p 47)    In this way, a distinction is made between the time needed  to  realize the new-democratic revolution and the time needed to  realize the new-democratic society. Of course there are areas  where the two overlap. This overlapping has a dual meaning:  First, the time between the "May 4 Movement" in 1919 and the  founding of the PRC is the time when the new-democratic  revolution took place. However, between 1928, when  revolutionary bases were established, and the year New China was  founded policies of the new-democratic society were implemented  at different times and to different extents in the revolutionary  bases and the liberated areas. Second, the founding of New  China marked the completion of the new-democratic revolution and  the beginning of the new-democratic society. However, during  this period, it was still necessary to fulfill some of the tasks  left by the new-democratic revolution, the most important task  being the completion of the land reform. On the whole, the  new-democratic revolution began and finished earlier than the  new democratic society. Although the new-democratic revolution  ended prematurely, the period between the founding of New China  in October 1949 and when the general line of the party for the  transitional period was put forward and implemented in 1952  still constituted the new democratic revolution. This is  because "The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference," as a comprehensive program for the  new-democratic society, was still realized quite thoroughly.  This made Chinese society at this time a rather typical  new-democratic society.    To sum up, whether we look at the whole process of the  formation and development of "the theory of new democracy," or  whether we look at the differences between "the theory of  new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic  society" in terms of content, duration and the practical basis  upon which they were formed, "the theory of new democracy" does  include two interrelated yet different components, namely "the  theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of  new-democratic society." It is simply not in accord with  reality to understand "the theory of new democracy" only as "the  theory of new-democratic revolution."    The formulation that the transitional period is a  new-democratic period is also difficult to substantiate  theoretically. The theory of transition was first put forward by  Marx in "Critique of the Gotha Program" and was subsequently  developed by Lenin in "Economics and Politics in the Era of the  Dictatorship of the Proletariat." It actually refers to the  transition from capitalism to socialism in capitalist countries  after the victory of the proletarian revolution. The new  democratic society in China is a special period of social  development after the victory of the new-democratic revolution  in semifeudal and semicolonial China. Although during this  period political and economic factors of socialism had the upper  hand and its future lay in the realization of socialism, as a  special social historical stage it was different in principle  from the transition from capitalism to socialism.    Even from the perspective of Chinese history, it does not  make sense to equate the transitional period with the  new-democratic period. As noted above, China was a typical  new-democratic society during the years between the founding of  New China in October 1949 and 1952. China's transitional period  covered the period between 1953 and 1956, when the party's  general line for the period of transition was put forward and  implemented. There is a clear distinction in time between the  two. It is true that the socialist transformation of individual  agricultural and handicraft undertakings and private capitalist  industry and commerce had already begun during the years between  October 1949 and 1952. However, during this period, the  principal economic feature was still the implementation of the  above-mentioned three major economic programs of the party for  the new-democratic period, and what we had was the economic form  of new democracy which comprised five economic sectors. There  is a difference in principle between this and the principal  economic feature of the subsequent transitional period, which  was the transformation of various private ownership systems into  socialist public ownership.    Meanwhile, the formulation "the transition from capitalism  to  socialism" does not hold water in whatever sense given the  conditions in China. The reason is: China already had  liberated areas before October 1949 while it was still a  semicolonial and semifeudal society, and after that it existed  as a new-democratic society. Where does the "transition from  capitalism to socialism" come in?    Thus, as discussed above, the view that "the theory of new  democracy" includes both "the theory of new-democratic  revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society" will  stand despite the putting forward of new formulations, such as  "the transitional period is a new-democratic period" and "the  transition from capitalism to socialism."  <H3>  II. "The Theory of New Democracy" Is Mao Zedong's  Development of Marxism </H3>   Half a century has elapsed since the publication of "On New  Democracy" in 1940. However, we still cannot claim that Chinese  academia has fully grasped the great significance of "the theory  of new democracy." Take for instance the recent academic  dispute over "the theory of two leaps" and "the theory of three  leaps" in the history of the development of socialism. The  proponents of the first theory believe that the first leap in  the history of the development of socialism was when Marx and  Engels turned socialism from a utopian dream into a science,  while the second leap was the completion of the transformation  of scientific socialism from its conventional mode into  present-day socialism, which in China is socialism with Chinese  characteristics. (Footnote 11) (GUANGMING RIBAO, 24 April 1993,  p 3) The proponents of the second theory believe that there was  another leap between the two mentioned above, and that was the  development of Marxism by Lenin and Stalin. (Footnote 12)  (GUANGMING RIBAO 21 July 1993 p 3) It is not my intention to  give a full appraisal of these discussions here. However, it  should be pointed out that they have all overlooked the fact  that the putting forward of "the theory of new democracy" is  also a leap in the history of the development of socialism; in  other words, it is an epoch-making development of Marxism.    Marx and Engels no doubt brought about a leap in the history  of the development of socialism by turning socialism from a  utopian dream into a science. However, the founders of Marxism  could not have answered the numerous new problems which were to  determine the destiny of socialism (including the victory of  socialism and the consolidation of the victory of socialism)  after their deaths. For example, they once put forward two  concepts: First, "the communist revolution will be no merely  national one; it will be a revolution taking place  simultaneously in all civilized countries, that is, at least in  England, United States, France and Germany." (Footnote 13)  (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol 1, p 221)  Second, "with the seizing of the means of production by  society, production of commodities is done away with and,  simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer.  Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic,  definite organization." (Footnote 14) (Selected Works of  Marx and Engels, Vol 3, p 323) However, neither of these  two concepts conformed to the subsequent practice of socialism.    Based on his analysis of the basic economic and political  characteristics of imperialism, particularly his analysis of the  law of the unbalanced development of economy and politics, Lenin  drew this conclusion: "Socialism may triumph first in a few  capitalist countries, or even in a single country." Moreover,  "the chain of the imperialist front must, as a rule, break where  the links are weaker and, at all events, not necessarily where  capitalism is more developed." (Footnote 15) (Selected  Works of Lenin, Vol 2, p 709; Stalin: The Question  of Leninism, p 22-23) Thus, Lenin replaced the outmoded  theory of socialist revolution put forward by the founders of  Marxism with the new theory of socialist revolution under the  new historical conditions of imperialism. We can see clearly  that without the guidance of this new theory, there could not  have been the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in  Russia in 1917, or, for that matter, the birth of a string of  socialist countries after World War II. Thus, we should regard  this new theory and the theory of the dictatorship of the  proletariat put forward by Lenin as an epoch-making development  of the theory of scientific socialism.    On the second concept, if we had followed in the footsteps  of  the former Soviet Union and the socialist countries in Europe,  we would not have been able to consolidate the socialist system.  It was Deng Xiaoping who, with the great courage and resolution  of a proletarian revolutionary and guided by the universal  principles of Marxism, negated this concept on the basis of a  scientific summing up of the practice of socialism. He also put  forward step by step the theory of the socialist market economy  and the general principle of reform and opening up after the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Under  the guidance of this theory and principle, China has attracted  worldwide attention with its achievements in economic structural  reform and its economic development, which is mainly the work of  reform. Thus, while the socialist countries in Europe were  falling apart one after another, China's socialist cause  flourished as never before. Thus, the theory of socialism with  Chinese characteristics (which includes the theory of socialist  market economy) put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and further  summed up by the 14th CPC National Congress in 1992 should be  seen as another epoch-making development of Marxism.    In these respects, we do not disagree in principle with "the  theory of two leaps" (for the most part) or "the theory of three  leaps" (in its totality). However, for the purpose of this  article, what we need to analyze is the notion that "the theory  of new democracy" is also an epoch-making development of Marxism.    It should be affirmed that the concept of the leadership of  the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution put  forward by Marx and Engels, and particularly many of Lenin's and  Stalin's ideas about national liberation movements in colonies  no doubt provided important guidance in the formation of "the  theory of new-democratic revolution." However, as an integrated  theory, "the theory of new-democratic revolution," particularly  as an integrated general line and formula for new-democratic  revolution like "the revolution of the masses of the people led  by the proletariat against imperialism, feudalism and  bureaucratism" was entirely Mao Zedong's own creation. Moreover,  it was under the guidance of "the theory of new-democratic  revolution" that China, which accounted for a large proportion  of the world's population, won a victory in its democratic  revolution and paved the way for the subsequent victory of the  Chinese socialist revolution. Thus, it is wrong to deny "the  theory of new- democratic revolution" as an original idea of Mao  Zedong's when we see that this theory includes the ideas of Marx  and Engels, and particularly the ideas of Lenin and Stalin.  This is the first point I want to make.    Second, although "the theory of new-democratic revolution"  has Chinese characteristics, its basic content still had  universal significance as a guiding principle for revolutionary  movements in colonies and semicolonies after the October  Revolution in Russia. Mao Zedong noted the following in "The  Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "We call  this special type the new- democratic revolution and it is  developing in all other colonial and semicolonial countries as  well as in China." (Footnote 16) (Selected Works of Mao  Zedong, Vol 2, p 647) He also wrote in "On New Democracy":  In the era after the October Socialist Revolution in Russia,  "any revolution in a colony or semicolony that is directed  against imperialism ... no longer comes within the old category  of the bourgeois-democratic world revolution, but within the new  category." (Footnote 17) (Ibid, pp 667-668) It should also be  noted that in the era of the proletarian socialist world  revolution, although the proletariat of capitalist countries  constituted the main force, and the oppressed peoples in the  colonies and semicolonies were the allies, the latter played a  decisive role in the proletarian socialist world revolution  because they made up a large proportion of the world population.  Thus, as a guiding ideology for national-democratic revolutions  in colonial and semicolonial countries, "the theory of  new-democratic revolution" was of immense international  significance.    Third, if we look at how socialist countries in Europe fell  apart one after another in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we  can see that the victory of the Chinese revolution, as well as  the existence and development of socialist China as a result,  are of decisive importance to the world socialist revolution.  Of course there are many reasons why China's socialist system  can be consolidated, the most decisive reason being the  systematic implementation of market- oriented economic  structural reforms, yet taken all in all, it is because the  consolidation of China's socialist system always has the victory  of the Chinese revolution as its precondition.    Based on the above analysis, we have every reason to regard  "the theory of new-democratic revolution" as an important aspect  of the epoch-making development of Marxism.    However, while "the theory of new-democratic revolution"  includes many of the ideas expressed by Marx and Engels, and  particularly by Lenin and Stalin, "the theory of new-democratic  society" takes its place in the history of the development of  Marxism as something new. Here it is mainly a development of  the doctrine of socioeconomic forms with historical materialism  as its basic content. According to the concept of Marxism,  there are the following five chronologically arranged  socioeconomic forms in the history of the development of human  society: Primitive communist society--slave society--feudal  society--capitalist society-- communist society (including the  socialist stage and the communist stage). In addition, there  are also other nonfundamental socioeconomic forms. For example,  semicolonial and semifeudal China was a nonfundamental  socioeconomic form, and the new-democratic society established  in China after the new-democratic revolution was another  nonfundamental socioeconomic form. However, this new-democratic  society not only existed in China, which had the largest  population, but also existed in Russia after the victory of the  October Revolution and in all colonial and semicolonial  countries after the victory of their democratic revolutions.  Hence, it is of widespread international significance.    Furthermore, with "the theory of new-democratic society"  guiding practice in the first three years following the founding  of New China, semicolonial and semifeudal China was turned into  a new-democratic society on the basis of its victory in the  democratic revolution. This was the first new-democratic  society established in populous China in the history of mankind.  "The theory of new-democratic society" also guided the  restoration of the national economy during this period. This  enabled us to achieve great successes which amazed the world  within three short years in spite of immense difficulties, and  laid a solid foundation for the subsequent victory of the  socialist system in China.    Thus, given that "the theory of new democracy" (including  "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of  new-democratic society") developed Marxism in such significant  ways, and that it comprehensively and systematically paved the  way for the development of the national-democratic revolution in  colonial and semicolonial countries, which occupied an important  position in the proletarian socialist world revolution and  accounted for a large proportion of the world population, and  for the realization of socialism after winning the revolution,  it is not unjustified to call it an epoch-making development of  Marxism.    Regrettably, China prematurely ended the new-democratic  society in 1952 and entered the transitional period in  accordance with Lenin's theory of transition in 1953. Because  of this, the role of "the theory of new-democratic society" had  not been fully brought into play, and its great significance at  home and in the international arena had not been fully  demonstrated.    However, after 45 years of practice following the founding  of  New China, it is now possible for us to compare the conditions  during the periods 1949-1952 and 1978-1993 with those during the  years between 1953 and 1977. This will enable us to come to the  conclusion that if, after 1953, we had not followed Lenin's path  of transition but had, instead, taken the above-mentioned road  of "the theory of new-democratic society," that is, the road of  "new-democratic society" started by Mao Zedong and developed by  Liu Shaoqi, around the time of the founding of the people's  republic, then China would have fared much better in  socioeconomic development, the buildup of its overall national  strength, the improvement of the people's livelihood, and so  forth after 1953. (Footnote 18) (Bo Yibo did a good job of  summing up the "concept for consolidating the new-democratic  system" advocated by Liu Shaoqi between 1948 and 1951. He was  also correct in the following comment: "I believe that Comrade  Shaoqi's conception in fact originated from Chairman Mao's  ideal. They are basically in agreement on major issues"  (Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and  Events, Vol 1, pp 46-61]    However, the second road is different from the first not  because there are contradictions and struggle between socialist  factors and capitalist factors, not in the fact that it gives  priority to the development of the socialist economy, not in its  transitional nature, or in the fact that it will lead to the  socialist society. Both roads are basically the same in these  respects. The difference between the two lies in the following:  First, in so far as their original meaning is concerned, the  former refers to the period of transition from capitalism to  socialism after the victory of the proletarian revolution in  capitalist countries, while the latter refers to the special  stage of social development toward socialism after the victory  of the new-democratic revolution in semicolonial and semifeudal  countries. According to the first road, we will actually regard  the old Chinese society as a capitalist society rather than a  semicolonial and semifeudal society, and will not observe the  need to develop social productive forces in the transformation  of the capitalist economy. Thus, even if we have the subjective  will to develop social productive forces, and have even given  careful consideration to the need to develop social productive  forces in the steps, form and method for the transformation of  the capitalist economy, in having skipped the stage of the new-  democratic society in our strategy for reforming the capitalist  economy, we will end up giving priority to changes in the  relations of production rather than to the development of social  productive forces. According to the second road, we will  proceed from the actual national conditions of the backward  productive forces in our semicolonial and semifeudal society  prior to the victory of the revolution, and take the development  of social productive forces as our central task. In this way,  we will truly observe the need to develop social productive  forces in the transformation of the capitalist economy.    Second, it is true that according to the first road, we  could  have adopted the method of transformation rather than the  confiscation of capitalist economy, but even so, we would still  have taken the transformation of capitalist economy as our  fundamental task as soon as the period of transition started.  It is precisely this which fundamentally determines that we  cannot, while restricting the negative role of the capitalist  economy (its harm to the national economy and the people's  livelihood), fully bring its positive role (its benefits to the  national economy and the people's livelihood) into play. This  is particularly true in China, where we completed the socialist  transformation of capitalist economy only three years after the  transitional period started. Mao Zedong was aware of this up to  a point. He advocated in December 1956 that after the basic  completion of the socialist transformation of the private  ownership of the means of production in our country, we should  continue to implement "new economic policies" for some time, and  preserve and develop some "private industry and commerce,"  "husband-and-wife stores" and "free markets." He also said that  "big private factories may be opened, ... and should not be  confiscated after 10, 20 years." "Those funded by overseas  Chinese should not be confiscated even after 20 or 100 years."  "We can open investment companies, ... and engage in either  state-owned undertakings or private undertakings." "After  abolishing capitalism, we can engage in capitalism again."  (Footnote 19) (Quoted from Reviews of Certain Major  Policy Decisions and Events, Vol 1, pp 64, pp 433-434) Of  course this does not mean a return to the new-democratic society  which spanned the years between October 1949 and 1952. Rather,  this means achieving, to a certain degree, the ownership  structure suited to the initial stage of socialism as put  forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee in 1978. In other words, we should, while ensuring  the dominant role of socialist public ownership, suitably  preserve and develop some individual, private and  foreign-operated economic undertakings.    In following the second road, naturally we should also  restrict the negative role of capitalism and ultimately abolish  capitalism and realize socialism. However, this should be  realized not by way of confiscation or transformation, but  through "economic competition" between socialism and capitalism.  In this process, "the weighting of socialist and semisocialist  economic sectors will gradually increase, while the weighting  and role of private and individually operated economic sectors  will be relatively reduced ... in order to steadily but surely  realize socialism." In adopting socialist steps, "the state  should not resort to confiscation, but should rather persuade  the capitalists to continue to run their factories by offering  compensation and high salaries. (Footnote 20) (Ibid, pp 53, 59)    Third, following the first road, we had, as can be seen in  events that took place in China, basically completed the  socialist transformation between 1953 and 1956 shortly after the  restoration of the national economy in 1952 without a solid  foundation of modern industry.    According to the second road, after going through the  new-democratic society, "industry and agriculture would have  seen substantial progress. The state would be in a much  stronger position to lead the economy. ... Economic management  cadres would have matured and increased in number. Party  technocrats would have developed, and the worker-peasant  alliance would have become much better consolidated politically  and economically. That is the time to take steps to make the  transition to socialism." (Footnote 21) (Ibid pp 60-61) It is  quite obvious that all these are important conditions for  smoothly advancing socialism, bringing into play the superiority  of the socialist system, and promoting the development of social  productive forces.    In short, taking the first road implies acting in accordance  with Lenin's theory of transition. It also means basically  taking over the planned economic structure originating from the  theories of Marx and Lenin and later established by Stalin.  Thus, in 1956, a planned economic structure which was mainly  characterized by its unified socialist public ownership system  (mainly state-ownership) and which chiefly relied on mandatory  plans and rejected the market mechanism was established in the  main. This not only rendered it impossible to fully bring the  positive role of the capitalist economy into play, but became a  fundamental reason why the Chinese economy did not make much  progress for a long time thereafter.    A popular view today is to attribute our failure to achieve  economic progress for many years after the socialist  transformation to the havoc wrought by the "Great Leap Forward,"  and particularly the decade-long "Cultural Revolution." On the  surface, this view is no doubt correct, but the fundamental  reason still rests with the planned economic structure, although  it is true that the "Great Leap Forward" was indeed touched off  by the investment expansion mechanism of the planned economic  structure. The "overconcentration of power" that sprang out of  the highly centralized planned economic structure "was one  important cause of the `Cultural Revolution.'" (Footnote 22)  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p 289)    Of course we are not trying to deny that the basic  completion  of socialist transformation within a short span of three years  in a big country with a population of several hundred million is  an unprecedented achievement in the history of the development  of the socialist movement. Nor are we denying the great  ground-breaking achievements scored during the transformation.  The following are some of the major achievements: New forms of  transition were adopted in the socialist transformation of  individual agricultural and handicraft undertakings and  capitalist industry and commerce; in addition to the majority of  peasants and handicraftsmen, many bourgeois elements also  accepted the socialist transformation without showing too much  of a grudge; rather than taking a plunge, social production  achieved relatively sustained, steady and rapid development  (compared with the First Five-Year Plan and many subsequent  plans).    However, seen over the long term, our analysis of the  negative effects of the first road still holds water.    If we had taken the second road, we would have been able to  fully exploit the positive points of capitalism and ultimately  completed the transformation, and we would have been able to  promote the sustained development of productive forces and  realized socialism. This means that we not only would have  opened up the road of "new-democratic revolution" in  semicolonial and semifeudal China, but also would have opened up  a new road of "new-democratic society" after winning the  revolution. This would have made "the theory of new democracy"  so much greater in theory and practice, at home and abroad.    However, there is another point of view which is also worth  discussing here. In recent years some scholars have put forward  the view that "the theory of new-democratic society" may have  continued to play a direct guiding role in "the theory of the  initial stage of socialism." In other words, they are saying  that Chinese society could have entered the initial stage of  socialism from the new- democratic society. Strictly in  theoretical terms, it is no doubt correct to say that "Chinese  society could have entered the initial stage of socialism from  the new-democratic society." But even then, whether or not  "`the theory of new-democratic society' could have continued to  play a direct guiding role in `the theory of the initial stage  of socialism'" is open to question. "The theory of  new-democratic society" makes no mention of the socialist market  economy. In any case, seen from the practice of new democracy  between October 1949 and 1952, there was already an embryonic  form of the planned economic structure and we were already  developing in that direction. The establishment of the  socialist market economy is a basic component of "the theory of  the initial stage of socialism." Of course this does not mean  that the market economy exists only in the initial stage of  socialism but not in the intermediate and advanced stages.  Nonetheless, the market economy remains an indispensable basic  component of "the theory of the initial stage of socialism."  Thus, although we could, under the guidance of "the theory of  new-democratic society," prepare important grounds for China's  advance from a new-democratic society into the initial stage of  socialism, it is not altogether correct to think that we could  give shape to the initial stage of socialism as proposed step by  step after 1978 merely by relying on the guidance of "the theory  of new-democratic society" without developing it (particularly  the theory on the development of the socialist market economy)  and putting it into practice.    The above analysis of the two roads was made on the basis of  practice during the 45 years since the founding of the people's  republic, and questions were raised from the angle of past  experience. In reality, however, it is by no means easy (or not  altogether possible) to follow the guidance of "the theory of  new- democratic society," and it is difficult not to follow the  guidance of Lenin's "theory of transition." Here, we are not  going to concern ourselves with other social reasons (including  the well-meaning desire to hastily make the transition to  socialism), and will instead venture to discuss the reasons from  the perspective of Marxist epistemology. Mao Zedong wrote the  "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Problems in  Our Present Rural Work (Draft)" in 1963. In this document, he  made good use of Marxist epistemology first put forward in his  1937 article, "On Practice." He wrote: "Often, correct  knowledge can be arrived at after many repetitions of the  process leading from practice to knowledge and then back to  practice again." This is also true of our present issue. In  1952, due to limitations in practice and understanding, the  question of whether China should follow the road of "the theory  of new-democratic society" or the road of "the theory of  transition" baffled not only the vast numbers of party cadres  but also the party's highest policymakers. This in a way shows  that while Mao Zedong himself established "the theory of  new-democratic society," he also ended this society prematurely;  and that while Liu Shaoqi had upheld and developed "the theory  of new-democratic society" for a long time around the time of  the founding of the people's republic, he only fully accepted it  at long last after repeated criticism by Mao Zedong.  <H3>  III. Some Useful Insights Given to Us by "The Theory of New  Democracy" Established by Mao Zedong </H3>   Whether in establishing "the theory of new democracy"  (including "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the  theory of new-democratic society"), or in ending the  new-democratic society prematurely, Mao Zedong gave us many  useful insights that are full of practical significance.    First, we must always seek truth from facts. Upholding this  principle means fundamentally upholding Marxist dialectical  materialism. In the final analysis, Mao Zedong could establish  the scientific "theory of new democracy" because he took as his  point of departure the semicolonial and semifeudal society which  was the basic national condition. This is expressed most  clearly on the question of the united front with the national  bourgeoisie and the armed struggle, which formed the basic  characteristics of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong ended the  new-democratic society prematurely partly because he overlooked  our national conditions.    Second, we must always keep abreast of the need to develop  social productive forces. Upholding this principle means  fundamentally upholding Marxist historical materialism. In  directing the revolution against imperialism, feudalism and  bureaucrat-capitalism in "the theory of new democracy," taking  the national bourgeoisie as one of the motive forces of the  revolution, and making use of the positive aspects of capitalism  while restricting its negative aspects in the new-democratic  society after winning the revolution, Mao Zedong took the  development of social productive forces in China as his basic  point of departure. In this sense, transformation of ownership  is the means, while the development of productive forces is the  end. (Footnote 24) (See Zhou Shulian [0719 0647 5571]:  "Ownership Is an Economic Means," JINGJI SHEHUI TIZHI BIJIAO  [COMPARISONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES], 1993 No.  5, pp 26-29) Mao Zedong ended the new-democratic society  prematurely partly because he overlooked the need to make use of  the positive aspects of capitalism.    Third, we must uphold the integration of the universal truth  of Marxism with concrete practice in China, and oppose "Left"  and right erroneous tendencies, particularly "Left" dogmatism.  Upholding this principle means upholding Marxism in its most  complete form. The fundamental mistake of the right opportunist  theories put forward by Chen Duxiu [7115 3747 4423] during the  period of democratic revolution lies in his negation of the  universal truth regarding the leadership of the proletariat and  the worker-peasant alliance in Marxism-Leninism. The  fundamental mistake of the three "Left" opportunist deviations,  particularly the "Left" opportunist theories of Wang Ming [3769  2494], lies in their mechanical copying of the methods of  proletarian revolution in capitalist countries. This is  expressed most clearly in the way we dealt with the national  bourgeoisie and in the road we followed in armed struggles.  "The theory of new democracy" is a classic example of the  integration of the universal truth of Marxism with concrete  practice in China. However, Mao Zedong prematurely ended the  new-democratic society. To a certain degree, he was affected by  dogmatism. Here, the most important reasons why words like "to  a certain degree" and "affected" are used have been discussed in  the previous paragraphs. They are: There are many points in  common between the transition from capitalism to socialism and  the new-democratic society; there are objective conditions for  their implementation; there are many creations in the course of  implementation; and the result is successful (although it has  brought about serious negative effects). The significance of  this theory lies in its distinction in principle from "Left"  dogmatism during the period of democratic revolution. Later we  mechanically copied the methods of foreign countries. With the  absence of objective conditions, the revolution ended in failure.    Fourth, we must thoroughly study and widely publicize the  basic theories of social development, truly achieve unity of  understanding in the party's highest policymaking circles, and  see to it that these theories take root in the minds of the vast  numbers of cadres. In this respect, "the theory of  new-democratic revolution" is a classic example. This theory  reached the peak of its development at the Seventh CPC National  Congress held in 1945. Through publicity, unity of  understanding was achieved in the whole party, and the theory  was truly grasped by all cadres. This was an important reason  why we were able to win the War of Liberation less than four  years after winning the War of Resistance Against Japan. By  comparison, "the theory of new-democratic society" seems lacking  in something. This is primarily due to restrictions in  objective reality. However, it is also true that due to  insufficient study and publicity, many cadres did not understand  that "the theory of new democracy" included "the theory of  new-democratic society" in addition to "the theory of  new-democratic revolution." This was an important reason why  the party's general line for the transitional period was adopted  without a hitch in 1952. Reviewing the historical experience of  this period is of great immediate significance to our present  efforts to adhere to and implement the call made by Deng  Xiaoping in early 1992 that "the party's basic line should be in  force for 100 years." Of course, in order to do so, we cannot  simply study and publicize the party's basic line. We must also  uphold the party's democratic centralism, develop socialist  democracy and strengthen the socialist legal system.</p>

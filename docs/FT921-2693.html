			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Ukraine responds to Moldova tension THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday ordered Ukrainian border forces to be deployed along the frontier with Moldova, where a long-standing struggle between Moldova and the Russian-speaking population of the trans-Dniestrian region has erupted into open fighting, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The Ukrainians want to stop the shipment of arms from one part of trans-Dniestria to another. They also want to stop the movement of mercenary 'Cossack' units from Russia to the embattled region via Ukraine. The conflict is likely to be on the agenda at the meeting of Commonwealth heads of states on Friday.</p>

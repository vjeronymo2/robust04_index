			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Little 'Red Book' now needed for Europe The most important aspect of a British Budget is very often not the tax measures announced by the chancellor, but a publication issued on the same day known as Financial Statement and Budget Report - or more briefly as the Red Book, because of the colour of its cover. The publication originated in the obligation to give parliament information about the government's own accounts and is, indeed, traditionally signed by the financial secretary. But over the years, it has grown into the nearest thing to a full-scale economic survey that the British Treasury publishes. Apart from outline accounts for the whole public sector, it also contains two other key chapters: one on the Medium Term Financial Strategy, and another on short-term economic prospects. The Medium Term Financial Strategy chapter focuses, rightly in my view, on the medium-term growth of the national income in cash terms ('Nominal gross domestic product') and its past and prospective division between inflation and real growth. The Red Book is also a mine of information on matters such as the Treasury's view of the growth of productive capacity, the development of the public-sector debt ratio, as well as trends in the growth of money supply and velocity, and much else. The chapter on economic prospects is very useful, even to dyed-in-the-wool sceptics about short-term economic forecasting, like myself. For the effort to make a forecast forces Treasury economists to sketch a systematic and coherent picture of the past and present: which is far from simple, as economic statistics do not speak for themselves. Even in the rush of Budget day, I mentally earmark many of the charts and tables for subsequent use in Financial Times articles and longer pieces. The Red Book has the great advantage over commercial forecasters that it is not under pressure to put all the emphasis on simple forecasts and is able to treat history as something other than bunk. None of this is to pretend that the Red Book contains a boring, cold-bloodedly impartial view of trends. Its purpose is to state government macroeconomic policy more coherently than the House of Commons would ever allow ministers to do. There must, of course, be some contributing economists whose own economic outlook is very different, and who privately sneer at people like me for taking the document seriously. Even they may learn something in the process of compiling the material. What is the 'but' to follow this encomium? It is that the main instrument for macroeconomic management is nowadays monetary policy, which even without full-scale European monetary union, is decided at a European level with the Bundesbank calling the shots. The true UK Medium Term Strategy is now to try to remain in the exchange rate mechanism at the present parity; and this will remain so irrespective of the election result. So the Budget Red Book has to rationalise policy decisions over which the British government has little power, and to concentrate on a geographical area, that of the UK, which is not the relevant unit for macroeconomic decisions. What is clearly needed is a Red Book at the European level. Already, it is more sensible to ask whether demand in money terms is rising too quickly or too slowly in the core countries of the Community than it is in, say, Britain or France taken alone. It is European and not just British Nominal GDP that is relevant for European monetary policy. For the moment, the Bundesbank may say that other countries make their own choice in pegging their currencies to the D-Mark, and that it will continue to make its decisions in relation to the German economy. But as other countries begin to satisfy the Maastricht conditions for monetary union, this approach will become less convincing; and once the immediate unification hump is over, the Bundesbank will find itself having to take into account the trends of the wider European economy and the views of other central bankers. Who then should publish the European Red Book? It would be death to entrust this task to the Brussels Commission. The material would be out of date before it was even printed. It would be disseminated in a series of phoney leaks to Brussels correspondents, and not be made available conveniently and on time to economic commentators. It would have to respect too many national susceptibilities and political orthodoxy. Yet the Commission would not be able to resist using the document to push the case for centralisation and harmonisation. The obvious body to publish the European Red Book is the European Monetary Institute, to be established at the beginning of 1994, as a precursor to the European Central Bank. But the Institute itself already exists in embryo in the form of the EC Committee of Central Bankers, which avoids becoming bogged down in the Brussels institutions by working very sensibly from the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. The Committee already has a small staff of economists, who are of a basically monetary orientation, but who are healthily sceptical of the competing orthodoxies in the field. It would be a very good exercise for them to start publishing a European Red Book every quarter. The authors would have to be very cautious to start with, embody the financial targets of member governments and central banks, and try to put them into a coherent framework. But, in time, they could develop a perspective of their own, which will also govern their briefing of European central bankers; so it would not be just pie in the sky.</p>

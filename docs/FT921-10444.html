			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Court to rule on Nadir suit A HIGH COURT judge will rule today on a bid by Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, the electronics and fruit group, to halt the Pounds 378m civil action against him pending the outcome of his trial on criminal charges. The civil suit was launched last October by the administrators of Polly Peck in a bid to recover money allegedly misappropriated from the company by Mr Nadir, who is also facing 76 criminal charges of theft and false accounting. Mr Nadir denies the charges and said he has a 'complete defence' to the civil action. The court has heard that the criminal trial is expected to start early next year.</p>

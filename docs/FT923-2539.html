			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Observer: Every day story Organisers of Sovereign, the Victoria and Albert Museum's long-running exhibition (of which Pearson was one of the sponsors) have the pensioners of Ambridge - rather than the tabloid newspapers - to thank for a late rally in attendance figures. The show, which marked the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession, at first did abysmally. However, after a final gate of 180,000 by the time it closed last Sunday, it is now being hailed as a 'popular success'. In August, Sovereign's visitor figures did improve - coinciding with revelations about the Windsors' marital difficulties. But then the V&amp;A had the bright idea of contacting The Archers, BBC Radio 4's immortal soap about Midlands village life. In the first week of September, an audience of around 7,500,000 heard Jack and Peggy wave off the coach containing Ambridge's Over Sixties Club on its annual summer outing - to see Sovereign. The result, gloats the V&amp;A's upmarket press office, was a final week which was 'absolutely heaving'. A plug on The Archers must now be every pr's dream.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Moderate Interest in Debate on </F> Constitution"]    [Text] Bonn, 4 February -- On Friday [4 February] the  Bundestag began its discussion on the recommendations of the  "Joint Constitutional Committee" of the Bundestag and Bundesrat  on an amendment to the Basic Law with a four-hour debate. The  basics of the amendment to the Constitution had been set down in  the "Unification Treaty" negotiated in 1990 between the FRG and  the still extant GDR. According to the legal politicians of the  Bundestag groups, the package of laws is to be discussed in the  Legal Committee in Berlin on 25 May and adopted by the Bundestag  before the summer recess. Speakers of various Bundestag groups  regretted that the debate on the Constitution has met with  little response by the public. Attendance at the first hearing  in the Bundestag confirmed that. Parallel to this first  hearing, the leaders and the Bundestag group of the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] made their decision on a  successor to Education Minister Ortleb, who had resigned, and  during the debate Interior Minister Kanther, Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], and Justice Minister  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) presented a package of laws on  internal security.    CDU Deputy Scholz and Hamburg Mayor Voscherau, Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the chairmen of the  Constitutional Committee, paid tribute to the body's work.  Scholz said the Basic Law is the "best constitution in German  history." The success of the Constitutional Committee must not  be measured solely by the number of proposals for amendments.  Voscherau said a more intensive debate in a larger body  (Constitutional Council) could have done more for Germany's  internal unity. However, the chance to contribute to Germany's  unity through discussions on the Constitution should not be  overestimated. The Constitutional Committee's work also  confirmed the quality of the Basic Law in those places where no  changes have been proposed.    The recommendations of the Constitutional Committee, which  have been presented as a draft law by the groups of the  CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], SPD, and FDP, as well as by  the Bundesrat, apply to the list of basic laws, the relationship  between the Federal Government and laender regarding  legislation, as well as to the new structuring of the laender.  In order to achieve equal rights of the sexes, the following  sentence is to be included in Article 3: "The state promotes  the actual implementation of equal rights for women and men and  is working to abolish existing disadvantages." Furthermore, the  Constitutional Committee agreed on two new regulations on state  goals. One refers to environmental protection (in a new Article  20a): "Being responsible also for future generations, the state  protects the natural bases of life within the framework of the  constitutional order through legislation and, on the basis of  law and order, by the executive branch and jurisdiction."  Another regulation on a state goal refers to minority  protection (Article 20b): "The state respects the identity of  ethnic, cultural, and linguistic minorities."    In future the self-administration of the communities is  "also" to comprise "the basis of financial responsibility." The  new structuring of the laender is to require the approval of the  Bundestag, following a state treaty and referendums in the  affected laender; the unification of the laender of Berlin and  Brandenburg is to be made possible in accordace with that.  Concerning competing legislation, the rights of the Bundesrat  are to be expanded. The framework legislation of the Federal  Government for the university sector is to be limited to certain  basics (admission, course of studies, exams, university  degrees). The Bundesrat's rights to participate in legislation  are to be improved by extending deadlines.    Mr. Jahn, the constitutional policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU  group, made it clear in the debate that his group has  reservations about some recommendations of the Constitutional  Committee and will probably reject them in the course of further  debate. Jahn cited the university sector, where, in contrast to  the currently valid laws, the Federal Government would lose its  responsibility for the structure and tasks of the universities,  for research and university self-administration, as well as for  the recognition of university institutions. This might  contribute to the German university developing in different  directions and might endanger the recognition of university  degrees. "German universities would lose their relevance for  Europe." Jahn pointed out that the majority of the CDU/CSU  group rejected the recommendations on minority protection.  Individual minority protection is already guaranteed in the  Basic Law. The recommendation of the Constitutional Committee,  which goes beyond that, might promote the demand for double  citizenship or for a "duty to respect linguistic identity" (e.g.  bilingual schools).    As the main speaker of his group, former SPD Chairman Vogel  regretted the fact that the Constitutional Committee has not  been able to agree on more far-reaching regulations on state  goals and on plebiscitary elements for the Basic Law. These  have been presented as an independent draft law by the SPD  group. Vogel called for social state goals (employment,  housing, education,and social security), as well as the  possibility of a referendum. He recalled corresponding  formulations in the Constitution of the GDR People's Chamber,  which was freely elected in 1990, and also that such regulations  be set down in a number of land constitutions.    Jahn stressed that the CDU/CSU group will stick to its  rejection of the SPD's more far-reaching demands.  Representative democracy has proved its worth. Referendums  weaken federalism and devalue the parliament. There is "no  reason for a total revision of the Basic Law."    In the debate it became clear that the demand that  "fellowship [Mitmenschlichkeit] and community spirit" be set  down in the Basic Law has a chance of receiving a two-thirds  majority. It would be the only amendment to the Basic Law that  did not get the required majority in the Constitutional  Committee. So far, a legal initiative has been signed by 345  deputies. Vogel advocated it. On behalf of the CDU/CSU group,  Jahn said that even though there is no need for action from the  juridical point of view on this matter, there may be "legal  policy" reasons for it. The CDU/CSU group has deliberately left  its options open.    FDP legal politician Kleinert expressly said: "Not very much  is to be moved." This is required by the respect for the valid  Basic Law. The citizen must not be patronized by the  Constitution. Deviating from the coalition line, Hirsch  advocated plebiscitary elements in the Basic Law; these could  counter the disenchantment with policy. On behalf of Alliance  90/Greens, Deputy Ullmann criticized the fact that a referendum  on the amended Basic law has been rejected. Germany's unity has  not yet been completed. Saxony's Justice Minister Heitmann (CDU)  contradicted that, saying that the great majority of GDR  citizens wanted the Basic Law, but "not to immediately tinker  with and criticize it." Party of Democratic Socialism Deputy  Heuer criticized the amendments to the Constitution as  insufficient.</p>

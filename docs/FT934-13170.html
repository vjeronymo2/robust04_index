			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Secrets of cultivating Dollars 5bn in sales - Victor Mallet charts the growth of Thai group Charoen Pokphand GUARDED by a team of security men on the 30th floor of his headquarters in central Bangkok, Mr Dhanin Chearavanont is overseeing the rapid expansion of Charoen Pokphand, the secretive multinational conglomerate that is already Thailand's largest business group. According to its own, deliberately vague estimates, CP now embraces more than 200 companies, compared with 80 in 1979. Meanwhile, the number of employees has risen from 15,000 to between 50,000 and 70,000. Sales have risen tenfold to reach about Dollars 5bn in 1992, double the turnover of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the largest Thai company in Asiaweek magazine's annual list of the 1,000 biggest Asian companies. The CP group does not figure on the list because it has no parent company  - for tax reasons, according to Mr Dhanin  - and only a fraction of its Dollars 5bn of sales appears in the accounts of publicly-listed companies such as CP Feedmill in Bangkok and CP Pokphand in Hong Kong. The rest is attributable to the Dhanin family's private interests. The group's debt and profit figures are closely-guarded secrets. Much of the expansion has come from CP's core agribusiness, especially in China. 'We are confident that in five years we will be the first in agribusiness worldwide,' said the 54-year-old Mr Dhanin. His father and uncle migrated to Thailand from China in the 1920s and set up a vegetable seed store in Bangkok. The group has diversified and grown to become the largest supplier of animal feed in Asia, and the fourth largest in the world, with 50 feedmills in nine countries and more than 100 poultry-breeding farms. With its animal-breeding, feedmill and retail interests, CP pursues a policy of vertical integration in its agricultural businesses  - 'from the farmyard to the dinner table it's Charoen Pokphand all the way' is the slogan  - and stockbrokers tend to be wary of CP's listed companies because they cannot unscramble the relationships between the public and private sides of the group. Mr Dhanin, however, does not restrict himself to chickens, prawns and pigs. The group already has a petrochemicals division and joint ventures in China brewing Heineken beer and making motorcycles with Honda technology. In Thailand, it has franchises for Makro, the Dutch wholesaler, and 7-Eleven convenience stores. Earlier this year, CP launched a petroleum business group to refine and market fuels and open petrol stations in China, Thailand and IndoChina. TelecomAsia, another CP company, has meanwhile raised Dollars 1.9bn to finance the installation of 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok with the help of Nynex of the US. CP is expanding geographically, too. The company says it is investing in the Ukraine and looking at Russia, Kazakhstan and Burma. In sectors where it has no obvious previous experience or technological skill  - such as telecommunications and petrochemicals  - CP's biggest advantage is its political clout, especially in countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, where ethnic Chinese businessmen like Mr Dhanin predominate. Such influence can be controversial. Mr Anand Panyarachun, a previous Thai prime minister, accused government officials in charge of Thailand's telephone line expansion project of corruption after they awarded the job of 3m new lines to CP. He farmed out 1m lines to another consortium, leaving CP with the 2m they are presently installing. Mr Dhanin says he takes a hands-off approach to CP's various projects and simply hires the best people to do the work. However he rejects the suggestion he is merely a middleman who receives a percentage for directing foreign technology into difficult markets. 'CP is a project manager and not a middleman,' he said. 'We are also an investor. As a project manager you have to seek people or companies with the right technology. 'Many people harbour the misunderstanding that we have a lot of influence over high-ranking officials. If that was so, Thailand's frequent changes of government would have put us in deep trouble. It's just that we choose the projects that answer people's needs.' In spite of CP's wide geographic spread (it has subsidiaries in the US, Portugal, the Netherlands and Turkey as well as in Asia), the key to the group's future lies in China, where Mr Dhanin has plans for everything from satellite launching to power stations and property developments. Unlike some investors in China from the ethnic Chinese communities of south-east Asia, Mr Dhanin's group of companies, with feedmills at the forefront, has penetrated far beyond the booming southern provinces into China's heartland. 'Investment in China is our biggest target,' he said. 'Our formula for investing in developing countries is to try to be the first.' Quoting an Asian proverb about risk and opportunity, he said: 'It is said that if you don't go into the tiger's cave, you won't get a tiger cub.'

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Clinton's budget deficit target may fall short of election pledge THE CLINTON administration's budget deficit reduction goal might fall short of the targets set during the election campaign, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director-designate, hinted yesterday. Mr Panetta told a Senate confirmation hearing that the administration would set a credible and enforceable deficit goal. An important requirement was to stabilise the federal debt as a proportion of gross domestic product and then try to get the ratio moving down again, he said. Such a formula would represent an easier target than the goal of halving the deficit over four years that President-elect Bill Clinton set in the campaign. The ratio of debt to GDP is about 50 per cent, having doubled during 12 years of Republican presidential rule. Mr Panetta also signalled that Mr Clinton would not retreat on plans to increase federal investment. 'We have to achieve multi-year deficit reduction that is real and make targeted investments in areas such as healthcare, education and infrastructure.' He said Mr Clinton had not yet made any final budget decisions. A short-term stimulus to accelerate recovery was still under consideration. The pace of deficit reduction would depend on a judgment of the economy's strength and it might not be wise to do too much 'up front'. Mr Panetta indicated that tax cuts for middle-income families, another Clinton campaign pledge, were a low priority. The administration wanted to create a more progressive tax system but the immediate task was to make the 'very difficult choices' needed to control the deficit while also addressing the nation's 'investment deficit'. He told members of the Senate government affairs committee that all areas of the budget would be scrutinised for savings, but refused to make specific pledges. Mr Clinton would present an economic plan to the nation next month. A full-scale budget would follow in mid-March. Healthcare costs were 'increasing dramatically', Mr Panetta warned, and if unchecked would push the deficit towards Dollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) by the start of the next century.

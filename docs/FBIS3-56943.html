			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "Don't Close Window Into </F> Europe"]    [Text] It proved absolutely impossible to get hold of any  Belarusian Supreme Soviet leader. They were all attending a  session. Only the telephone of Aleksandr Sheleg, aide to the  first deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, was  answered: "Our Prime Minister Kebich has long upheld the idea of  a sound economic partnership. And his initiative for the  republic to enter into a single ruble zone with Russia is  consistent in this respect. After the breakup of the USSR  Belarus effectively remains the sole window into Europe for  Russia: The main air, railroad, and automobile routes and  pipelines pass through it. We would not be a burden. Our  flagships -- the tractor, automobile, and other plants -- are  effectively standing idle now. And the same thing is happening  in Russia. I am convinced that, if a decision were adopted --  and that is what our industrialists are waiting for -- things  would return to life here. And I think Yeltsin realizes this."    It has become known that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  will come to Minsk in the next few days. His visit may herald a  definitive decision in favor of unifying the two republics'  financial systems.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather settlement World of Leather, the USM-traded furniture retailer, has paid Pounds 150,000 in an out of court settlement with the distribution company which previously handled the warehousing and distribution of its furni-ture. The claim by the distributor was substantially higher than Pounds 150,000. Each party will pay its own legal costs. World of Leather's costs are expected to total Pounds 250,000, which will be accounted for as an exceptional item in the full-year results. World of Leather said that in the three weeks since December 26 its turnover had increased by 20 per cent year-on-year.</p>

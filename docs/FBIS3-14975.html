In this connection Kazannik  emphasises that "the prosecutor's office has not right to  legislative initiative. It does not discuss acts but accurately  and undeviatingly applies normative-legal acts".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that "upon release, Russia's  former  Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy applied to former parliament  speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov in a proposal to convene an  extraordinary congress of the people's deputies of Russia. This  was announced on Tuesday by presidential chief of staff Sergey  Filatov when he was introducing Aleksey Ilyushenko to the staff  of the office of the prosecutor-general. Ilyushenko was  appointed acting prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation  by a presidential decree."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on recent developments: "The events of the  recent days have shown once again the weakness of state power,  the need to strengthen which was mentioned by the president in  his message to the Federal Assembly. Not just the weakness of  all its elements but complete mismatch in their functioning.    "It has turned out that we have got a not so strong  constitution if the need for its interpretation arose when it  was necessary to take a serious decision"    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the crisis of power in Moscow:    "All maintain that the current crisis of power in Moscow has  been provoked by the State Duma's well-known decision on a  political amnesty. However, it is now clear that the crisis was  triggered by no means by the Duma decision but by the attitude  of former Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik (and, apparently,  that of former chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  Nikolay Golushko).    "Presidential assistants' incoherent reasoning, because of  which they are blamed for lack of professionalism and  efficiency, proves not the lack of the assistants'  professionalism but the non- professinalism of the order issued  to them -- to give explanations at a press conference. How can  they give explanations when Kazannik is backed by law and they  are backed only by their boss's instruction?"    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with State Duma  speaker Ivan Rybkin, who expresses his opinion about the  announced amnesty. He said "the amnesty is intended for a  sufficiently long period of time. According to the president's  legislative initiative, a total of 222,000 people are to be  released from places of confinement, plus those who were  involved in the events of the August of 1991, May, September and  October 1993.    "It so happened that due to insufficiently efficient  interaction of authorities, there was a certain inconsistency in  the realisation of the decisions taken. All this undoubtedly  brings about certain problems in society," Rybkin said.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article by Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev.    "It has long become clear that in present-day conditions an  aggressive nationalism, the Brezhnev and 'Berlin Wall'  doctrines, domination ambitions, and 'sanitary cordones' are  unacceptable," he writes.    "It is now essential to ensure stability and security for  the  entire Europe and jointly overcome ethnic conflicts... it is  important now not to lose the positive movement momentum created  by Presdient Boris Yeltsin's initiative which led to a major  breakthrough in lifting the siege of Sarajevo.    "Energetic and joint actions are necessary. Individual  powers and their associations, including NATO, will find their  place and make their contributions within the context of  combined efforts".    VECHERNYY PETERBURG reports that the assembly of lower  panels  in the Amber Room of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo is  nearing completion. Over the past nine years local restorers  have made anew almost 40 percent of panels.    The main restoring work will apparently have to be suspended  because not a single gramme of amber has come from Kaliningrad  over a period of almost three years. All amber is exported from  there at commercial prices.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Invisible benefits Three drugs companies have collectively forked out Dollars 13bn on so-called pharmacy benefit managers over the past 15 months. All three posted results yesterday. Eli Lilly was understandably silent about its PCS acquisition because the purchase is yet to be completed. More curious was that neither Merck nor SmithKline Beecham provided anything to enlighten shareholders whether their money had been wisely spent. Such information would have been appropriate because the two rationales given at the time of the deals are increasingly doubtful: that the drugs groups would gain market share by pushing their drugs through the distributors; and that the distributors' patient data would allow them to assess medicines' cost-effectiveness. With hindsight it is clear there are less expensive ways of accessing such patient data. Indeed, health maintenance organisations hold far more complete treatment information than distributors and are quite willing to share it for relatively small considerations. Meanwhile, the market share argument is threatened by the Federal Trade Commission's concern that prescribing policies which exclude other groups' drugs could be anti-competitive. Perhaps the companies' silence was motivated by embarrassment. The 1.5 percentage point increase in market share that Merck is estimated to have achieved after its Medco acquisition seems scant reward for a Dollars 6.6bn investment. The drugs industry's diversification into distribution looks an expensive mistake.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Principled Stand"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asaf Ahmed Ali, Foreign  Secretary Shaharyar Khan, and the Pakistan ambassador to the  United States Maliha Lodhi met with Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto in Prime Minister's house on Tuesday and exchanged views  on Pakistan-United States relations. The prime minister said  that using the Pressler amendment to stop aid to Pakistan is an  extreme action. Pakistan is opposed to this unfair action as  this amendment should have been imposed upon India also.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken a principled stand.  The allegations on which the aid to Pakistan was stopped were  totally false. This was done just because of the Indian  propaganda. The United States used it to deprive Pakistan of aid  and loans. The greatest accusation against Pakistan was that it  was involved in making nuclear weapons. However, it is clear now  that Pakistan never had such a program. Pakistan had started the  nuclear program to control the energy crisis, and this program  has been frozen for several years. Meanwhile, India is making  gradual progress in its nuclear program. It is involved in  making missiles that can reach their targets thousands of miles  away. It has increased the national defense budget by 20 percent  to increase its military strength. However, the United States is  not willing to impose any kind of restriction against it, and  has given it full freedom to become the supreme power in this  region. The second serious allegation against Pakistan is about  providing aid to the Sikhs involved in the Khalistan movement in  East Punjab. Threats to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation were  being made under this allegation.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, however, has unmasked these  false accusations levied by India and the United States in a  television interview with the BBC. Madam Bhutto's interview  revealed that she had helped late Rajiv Gandhi control the Sikh  movement in Punjab during her previous government. Had Pakistan  not helped at that time, God knows where India would be now.  Still, such is India's ungratefulness that it is bent upon  condemning and hurting Pakistan.    The truth is that India just cannot tolerate Pakistan's  existence, and the United States because of the Indian  propaganda is also bent upon annoying Pakistan. The U.S.  approach is totally wrong and prejudiced. There is no reason for  stopping aid to Pakistan using the Pressler amendment. If the  United States remains adamant then we should understand that it  is blackmailing Pakistan and wants to use it as a pawn in its  international political chess game. However, it is a mistake and  as this blackmail will not last long. Pakistan can survive and  make progress without the U.S. aid. However, this is possible  only if the pride of our nation is protected by a sincere,  courageous and self-respecting leader.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov has described as  unacceptable and provocative parliamentary discussions of a bill  intended to suspend the presidency law until a local  Constitutional Court has been formed.    The bill put on the agenda of a parliamentary session in  Simferopol on Thursday [23 June] follows a resolution of 14 June  stating that many of the president's decrees were out of line  with Crimean legislation.    Speaking in parliament, Meshkov said the Supreme Soviet was  out for a stand off with the president under the mask of demands  for compliance with the Constitution and laws. He said the  current situation was far too serious to raise the question of  stripping him of presidential powers.    Meshkov sees the parliament's action as an attempt to try to  put itself above the people of Crimea who elected him as head of  state in keeping with the Constitution.    However, the deputies are most likely to pass the law,  albeit  in a softer form, leader of the Crimean Tatars' faction in  parliament Refat Chubarov told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He described  what was happening as an attempt by the Russia faction which  backed up Meshkov during the presidential election to put him in  his place.    As discussion continues, a conciliatory group was elected to  work out a final resolution.</p>

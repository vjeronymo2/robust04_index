			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices have been holding up very well in Australia this week, when there were clearances of over 90% at Geelong and Newcastle. The season's first large offering of superfine wools came on the market and attracted strong competition, particularly for the choicest styles. The AWC market indicator rose to 428 cents a kg, an increase of 10 cents in a week. Business conditions in the UK and on the continent continue to be very quiet and Bradford top quotations remain virtually unchanged.</p>

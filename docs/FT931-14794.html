			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Bonn agreement on asylum - but not on army THE German government yesterday failed to forge a necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority in favour of changing the country's constitution to allow German soldiers to take part in UN peace-keeping and peace-making operations. In an often stormy debate, the opposition Social Democrats made it clear that they were not prepared to accept any use of the German Bundeswehr (armed forces) beyond exclusively UN peace-keeping operations. However, on a separate issue, the SPD agreed to a new formula to change the constitution on the disputed question of limiting the existing liberal law on political asylum, clearing the way for a deal next week. On the question of military operations, the Social Democrats accused the ruling coalition of seeking to turn the Bundeswehr into 'an army of intervention', and of being tempted to indulge in 'gunboat diplomacy'. In spite of a strong and direct appeal by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, for Germany to play its full role in future UN operations, the opposition said the government was looking for a 'blank cheque' to deploy its armed forces anywhere in the world. The charges were strongly rejected by government speakers. Mr Volker Ruhe, the minister of defence, said: 'Germany must take on the same responsibility as its neighbours in a new and altered international system.' Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, said that a re-united and sovereign Germany 'must face up to its responsibility in a changed world, without limitations. 'We want and must in our own interests, and in the interest of the community of nations, recreate the full capacity for action of the German federal republic as a member of the United Nations.' As for the proposal to allow operations in the context of other alliances, such as Nato and the Western European Union, it required that any such involvement of the Bundeswehr be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament. 'Could there be any greater brake on such an action?' he asked. The opposition was unmoved. Mr Karsten Voigt, the foreign policy spokesman for the SPD, said the proposal 'does not bring us one millimetre closer to a parliamentary compromise'. In addition, Mr Walter Kolbow, the defence spokesman, said that the amendment tabled by the government 'is moving us in totally the wrong direction'.</p>

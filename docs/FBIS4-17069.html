			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "VECHERNIY PETERBURG Has Decided </F> To Take Sobchak to Court"]    [Text] In the space of a week the dispute between the  VECHERNIY PETERBURG editorial office and City Hall has become  one of the most discussed topics on St. Petersburg radio and  television, and in its press. The reason for this was Mayor A.  Sobchak's directive No. 303-r "On the VECHERNIY PETERBURG  Editorial Office," which some organs of the mass media have  regarded as a all-out attack on the freedom of the press, while  others have seen it as the authorities' natural and inalienable  right. The VECHERNIY PETERBURG labor collective has decided to  go to court to protest what, in editorial office's opinion, is  an unjust verdict by the mayor.    At a specially convened press conference, VECHERNIY  PETERBURG's Chief Editor V. Mayorov judged the appearance of  directive 303-r to be a reaction by the authorities to a series  of hard-hitting pieces in VECHERNIY PETERBURG which, in his  opinion, gave rise to a desire in the powers that be to tame  this recalcitrant publication. He regards as an illegal  bureaucratic action the point in the directive in which the  mayor gives instructions for a scheme to be produced by 15 April  to privatize the newspaper VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property,  stipulating that no less than 20 percent of the value of shares  be made the property of St. Petersburg for a period of three  years. Mayorov considers that if the state does have some right  to VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property, it is to the closets and  chairs from 1925 and the decrepit typewriters which it actually  did supply to the editorial office once.    Many perplexing questions have been raised in the minds of  VECHERNIY PETERBURG's editorial office by the point in the  document signed by the mayor which talks about holding a  "city-wide contest for the post of leader of the paper VECHERNIY  PETERBURG's editorial office" in the period up to 15 May.  Nobody can grasp what powers this "leader" has and why such a  post is being established when there is at present a perfectly  good chief editor elected by the labor collective, and this is  regarded as an attempt by the mayor to make a resolute decision  to move staff about in VECHERNIY PETERBURG.    But later at a press conference in the Smolnyy, D.  Mezentsev,  chairman of the city hall committee on the press and the mass  media, explained in detail the city authorities' position. He  reminded us that the idea of selling shares in newspaper  enterprises came into being last fall at a meeting of editors of  several St. Petersburg and central newspapers. The mayor's  directive of 26 November fixed these views and ruling 303-r was  issued to develop the idea privatizing St. Petersburg's  newspapers. At the present time, the committee chairman  emphasized, VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property and that of other  publications in St. Petersburg belongs to the committee for  managing municipal property -- that is, it is 100 percent state  property.    As concerns the city-wide contest for the post of VECHERNIY  PETERBURG's leader, it is a question here of a managing  director, a manager, and not at all of a chief editor.</p>

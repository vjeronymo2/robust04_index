The MP and former cabinet minister, 54, received a warrant  formally advising him he is under investigation on the charge of  complicity in Mafia association.    Raised by the magistrates today were parts of testimony  provided by informants Giuseppe Croce Benevento and Leonardo  Messina who have told investigators that Mannino maintained ties  with Mafia families and promised to use his political clout in  matters of interest to the Agrigento boss. Thousands of "men of  honor" and their families were allegedly made available to the  Christian Democrat of the time, whose old party is now named the  Italian People's Party.    Informed judiciary sources here said Mannino was also  questioned on accusations which had not originated with the  mafiosi state's witnesses, mainly on his relations with public  notary Pietro Ferraro, arrested one month ago on a Mafia  association charge.    These magistrates, said the sources, have taken over the  records compiled during an earlier investigation of the  politician based on the word of another Mafia state's witness.  On October 11, 1991, an investigation into Mannino, the  minister for the Mezzogiorno at the time, was shelved. This  probe originated with an informant's testimony.</p>

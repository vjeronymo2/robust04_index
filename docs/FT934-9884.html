			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Crackdown on Kikuyu tribe Kenya police have arrested several leading members of the majority Kikuyu tribe in what seems a vendetta spurred by President arap Moi's government, Leslie Crawford reports from Nairobi. The president, who leads a coalition of minority ethnic groups, has ordered a crackdown on instigators of ethnic clashes. Police apparently see this as an order to detain Kikuyus.</p>

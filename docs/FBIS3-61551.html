			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. S. Koltunov, S. M. Baranov, and T. P. </F> Zharova; UDC 545.799.3]    [Abstract] In previous study [cf. 937M0174G] of the  reaction kinetics of Np(VI) with isopropylhydrazine it was  demonstrated the reactivity of the latter lies somewhere between  that of hydrazine and ethylhydrazine, depending on the  corresponding dampening of the positive inductive effect in the  series methyl- ethyl-propyl. The present work is a further study  of the relationship between reactivity and induction effect of  the radical substituent in the hydrazine molecule, using ter-  butylhydrazine. The reaction rate constant is 518  mole[.sup]0.1[/]/liter[.sup]0.1[/]min. at 25 C and  ionic strength  = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E =  61  kJ/mole and S[.sup]*[/] = 60 J/moleK. A correlation was  found to exist between the Np(VI)-hydrazine reaction rate  constant and the Taft induction constant. Figure 1; references  14: 11 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

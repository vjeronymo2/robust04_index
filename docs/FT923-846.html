			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: United Newspapers achieves 20% advance UNITED Newspapers, publishers of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday announced a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 46.5m in the first six months of the year. Lord Stevens, chairman, noted yesterday that the improved trading performance had been achieved in the absence of any economic growth. 'The results were due to the resilience of strong market positions and stringent management of costs,' he said. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said the results showed that 'we really can manage this business in difficult times and we really ought to have credit for that'. Apart from general pressure on margins United Newspapers was helped by a 25 per cent drop in interest charges from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 11m. About three quarters of the reduction was the result of lower interest rates on US debt with the other quarter coming from a reduction in debt level. The newspaper group also benefited from reduced newsprint prices. There was also considerable progress in national newspapers. In the six months to August, the Sunday Express - which went tabloid in July - showed a year-on-year increase of 6 per cent in circulation in a Sunday market which fell by 2 per cent. The Daily Express maintained its share of a market which shrank by 2 per cent. Overall an increase in advertising revenue helped Express newspapers to a profit improvement of about 50 per cent. Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said yesterday: 'Overall you have to call this a good result.' It was as if, he believed, the company had finally fought free from what he believed were the expensive acquisitions of Fleet and Extel. With 55 per cent of its revenue advertising dependent United was now 'a textbook recovery story, as and when you get a recovery.' Mr Terrington says he is now expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 96m for the full year. Turnover rose marginally from Pounds 411m to Pounds 416m. Earnings per share rose from 11.8p to 14.2p and the interim dividend is unchanged at 7.5p. Lord Stevens said he believed the overall performance was good in such difficult circumstances. 'It is too early to take a view about the results for the year as a whole but if we continue to trade as successfully as in the first half then it should be possible to improve on last year's second half performance,' Lord Stevens said. The company was not assuming any growth this year either in its UK or US markets. The shares rose 16p to close at 425p. See Lex</p>

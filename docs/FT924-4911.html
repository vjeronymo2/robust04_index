			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: The Rape of Tamar - Theatre Tirso de Molina (c1582-1648) is best known as the author who put Don Juan into the European consciousness. A Mercedarian monk, he was - with Lope de Vega and Calderon - one of the three great dramatists of the Spanish Golden Age, and an extraordinary artist. London is lucky that in recent years these men's plays have become more widely performed here. On the one hand, Tirso had a remarkably light, fresh, direct and funny touch. On the other, he was a serious moralist who believed that there is a point at which God's mercy stops and beyond which sin is punished. Both sides are evident in The Rape of Tamar - Paul Whit-worth's new translation of La Venganza de Tamar (probably written between 1621 and 1624). The Biblical King David's eldest son Amnon conceives an incestuous passion for Tamar, David's daughter by another marriage. Eventually, after discovering that she is in love with someone else, he rapes her. Tamar appeals to David and to her full brother, Absalom, to avenge her dishonour. David cannot bring himself to bring proper punishment (death) on his beloved Amnon. It is Absalom - partly out of ambition for the throne - who takes Amnon's life; and it is this death (with its intimations of Absalom's own impending death) that finally devastates David. Though the word 'rape' in the English title is eyecatching, Tirso's real theme was revenge (as for so many early 17th-century dramatists). As he tells the story (often with a light touch), he fills it with suspense - fills it also with acute, ambiguous, multi-faceted moral perceptions. He does not spell out every irony; he simply shows the appalling difference between David's evasiveness about Amnon's crime and his grief (with nary a thought of Tamar) at Amnon's death. And, again without commenting, he shows how much David and his sons are preoccupied by power, ambition and self-gratification. This is both a revenge tragedy and a history play. The play's most shocking (and psychologically most acute) scene occurs after the rape, when Amnon suddenly reviles Tamar as venomous trash. Later, Tirso makes much of a quasi-Shakespearian pastoral scene, in which the veiled Tamar wanders, wretched, among happy shepherds. After a nicely sibylline scene in which a countrywoman gives ambiguous prophecies to each of David's four sons, Amnon tries to seduce Tamar until he realises who she is. He has no sooner unveiled her than he tries - in vain - to re-veil her. Whitworth's translation is admirably fresh and transparent. He tries to keep parlance within rhyming quatrameters, but is prepared to sacrifice metre or rhyme to clarity. Only in a few yuppified quips ('Two days in that boneshaker make your buttocks turn to salmon steak') does he draw attention to himself. He also directs this production; and in this, too, clarity is his hallmark, with one or two ultra-modern blots. Tim Reed's designs catch nicely the way Tirso presents his Hebrew theme through a Spanish baroque filter. The cast of 12 (several of them playing more roles than one) play with unfussed simplicity and urgency. It is hard to take Patrick Wilde's Amnon, with his non-designer stubble, poor stance, and unpolished diction, as a crown prince - but his delivery is so natural that it is easy always to believe, if not in the character, then in him. Morris Perry's account of King David has just the right unforced authority and near-cloying paternal solicitude. His account of his first scene - starting with a very difficult piece of grand rhetoric - is the only over-florid part of his or anyone's performance. Most remarkable is Jules Melvin as Tamar - a kitten, then a tiger; a princess, then a young crone. Though there are a few immaturities in her performance, this is a young actress who speaks verse with a properly supported voice (rare), naturally communicative force (rarer), and surprising effects of phrasing. As Jean de Reszke used to say, never take a breath when they expect you to. At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, until December 12</p>

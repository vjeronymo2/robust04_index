			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Wangda (0712 4986 1129): "Shanghai Closes </F> Down Four Illegal Publications"]    [Text] Shanghai, 19 May (RENMIN RIBAO)--The press and  publications administration and the industrial and commercial  administration in Shanghai recently took joint action to ban a  number of illegal publications. Four newspapers and journals,  including SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL],  were closed down, and the units running these newspapers and  journals were fined.    While the stock market in Shanghai was developing, many  books  and journals about the stock market were published and sold  well. Some units found that the business of publishing such  material was profitable. They disregarded state laws and  regulations, and illegally published and distributed these types  of publications to the population. According to complaints made  by the masses, the Huangpu District Industrial and Commercial  Administrative Bureau discovered that some of the publications  sold openly in front of various major securities companies in  Shanghai were of questionable origin. Through the investigation  of the Shanghai Press and Publications Administration, the four  newspapers and journals, SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK  NEWS], HUGU KUAIXUN [EXPRESS REPORT ON SHANGHAI STOCKS],  SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL], AND CAITONG  ZHOUXUN [WEEKLY FINANCIAL REPORT] were illegal publications  which had been published without the approval of the relevant  authorities. The industrial and commercial inspection team of  Nanjing Road Central in Huangpu District recently inspected a  university printing house, and confiscated the above- mentioned  publications that had been printed there, including nearly  100,000 copies of the newspapers and 7,000 copies of the weekly  journals.    According to the investigation, SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO, run by a  university in Shanghai, published 39 issues and nearly 1 million  copies over the past six months; SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO, run by a  research institute published 27 issues and nearly 1.09 million  copies over last four months. The management over these  publications was not orderly, and the income from their  distribution was received in cash and was never entered in the  accounting books. The publications were all distributed and sold  by unlicensed hawkers.    The responsible officials of the Shanghai publications and  business administrations told reporters that no country in the  world would permit the illegal publication of newspapers and  journals which were not registered with the authorities. The  departments concerned in Shanghai will continue to properly  manage the publications market.</p>

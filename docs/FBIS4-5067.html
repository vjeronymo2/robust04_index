			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on the speech by Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK </F> Administration Council and Supreme People's Assembly (SPA)  deputy, entitled "On Successfully Fulfilling the Tasks of  Socialist Economic Construction in the Period of Adjustment  (wanchunggi) Set Forth by the Workers Party of Korea" delivered  at the opening of the seventh session of the ninth SPA held at  Mansudae Assembly Hall on the morning of 6 April]    [Text] [Begin Kan Song-san recording] Comrade deputies: At  a time when all the working people are vigorously accelerating  the general march of socialism under the wise leadership of the  party and the leader [suryong], upholding the revolutionary  banner of the chuche idea, today we are to discuss the matter of  successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic  construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the  Workers Party of Korea [WPK] at this SPA session.    The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee  held last December summed up the status of the fulfillment of  the Third Seven-Year Plan and set an adjustment period of three  years and presented an economic strategy based on the scientific  analysis of today's situation and the present state of our  country's socialist economic construction.    Effecting a turn in socialist economic construction by  thoroughly implementing the revolutionary economic strategy set  forth by the party is the most important revolutionary task  facing us today.    Solemnly pledging before the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, president of the DPRK, to fulfill the strategic goal  set forth by our party by thoroughly implementing the  revolutionary economic strategy at any cost, I am going to  present to this SPA session measures to successfully fulfill the  tasks in the period of adjustment of socialist economic  construction.    Comrade deputies: Successfully fulfilling the tasks of  socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set  forth by the 21st plenary session of the sixth WPK Central  Committee is of very important significance in the struggle to  strengthen the might of the fatherland of chuche and to further  add luster to the popular masses-centered socialism of our own  style.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In  socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming  three years as a period of adjustment as decided at the 21st  plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee and should  thoroughly implement the agriculture-first,  light-industry-first, and trade-first policies during this  period. Along with this, we should give priority to the coal  industry, the electric power industry, and railway transport,  which are the leading sectors of the national economy, and  should continue to develop the metal industry.    The task of the period of adjustment of socialist economic  construction is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first  policy, the light-industry-first policy, the trade-first policy;  to firmly give priority to the coal industry, the electric power  industry, and railway transport--which are the leading sectors  of the national economy--and to continue developing the metal  industry. This is an economic strategy to rebuild [kaejo] the  economic structure of the country in conformity with the changed  international circumstances and the present demands of our  national economy, and to bring about a change in the direction  of foreign trade [taewoe muyogeso panghyang chonhwanul halte  taehan].    The basic objective of the economic strategy set forth by  the  party is to rapidly improve the people's livelihood by  concentrating efforts on developing agriculture, light-industry,  and trade in two to three years to come; to regularize  production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading  sectors of the national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the  might of the existing economic foundation.    That our party has set forth the adjustment period of three  years and has determined its economic strategy is a wise step  which makes it possible to deepen and develop our socialist  construction to a new, high stage while consolidating the  successes registered in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year  Plan. [applause]    The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most  just-our-style economic strategy which totally corresponds to  the basic interest of our revolution and construction and which  precisely reflects the aspiration and desire of our people.    The revolutionary economic strategy, which should be  implemented during the period of adjustment of socialist  economic construction, reflects our party's firm decision and  will to epochally upgrade the people's living standard within  the near future and to develop our economy into an economy that  has strong independence and does not waver under any  circumstances and which can survive on its own strength.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most just  economic construction plan which enables us to drastically  enhance the people's living standard in compliance with the  demand of socialism. [applause]    It is a supreme principle in our party's activities and a  consistent policy of the republic's government to constantly  upgrade the people's living standard.    Thanks to the wise leadership of the party and the leader  and  to the popular policies of the republic's government, today our  people are enjoying a happy life without any worries and anxiety  with all conditions of life such as food, clothes, and spending  being ensured by the state and society.    When the revolutionary economic strategy put forward by our  party is embodied, a new turning point will be effected in  agriculture, light-industry, and foreign trade; and the  long-cherished desire of all people to eat rice with meat soup,  wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house will be  brilliantly realized within the near future. At the same time,  the people's material and cultural life will become more  abundant and plentiful [touk yuntaekhago pungjokhata] according  to the nature of socialist society.    The revolutionary economic strategy of our party is a just  plan which enables us to further strengthen the self-reliance of  socialist economy in our country and to firmly consolidate the  nation's economic foundation. [applause]    Socialism was frustrated in many countries and capitalism  was  restored in recent years. By taking advantage of this, the  maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate,  suffocate, and crush our republic, have been intensified more  than ever before.    Under such an acute situation and changed international  circumstances, it is an important issue related to the future of  the socialist cause to strengthen the independence and  self-reliance of our economy in every way.    Only when we consolidate the foundation of the nation's  self-reliant economy and strengthen its independence can we  survive with our own strength without wavering under any  economic blockade maneuvers of the imperialists. Thus, we can  victoriously advance the popular mass-centered socialist cause  of our own style.    When we effect a new turning point in the development of  agriculture, light-industry, and trade by thoroughly carrying to  accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy, and  when we continually develop the metal industry by giving  priority to precedent domains of the national economy, the  sectional structure [pubun kujo] of the economy will be further  perfected and its self-reliance and might will be remarkably  strengthened.    Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which enables  us to successfully implement the basic line of economic  construction in compliance with the prevailing situation and the  development of realities.    From the outset, developing heavy industry with priority has  not been aimed at developing heavy industry itself, but has been  aimed at developing light-industry and agriculture rapidly  through the attainment of speedy, expanded reproduction. At the  same time, state management has been aimed at enhancing the  people's living standard systematically. [wollae, chunggongobul  usonchoguro palchon sikinungosun, ku chachee mokchogi innungosi  anira, hwakttae chaesangsanui nopun sokttorul pojanghayo,  kyonggongopkwa nongobul ppalli palchon sikigi wihangosimyo,  kugyongun inmin saenghwarul chegyejoguro nopigi wihangosimnida].    Truly, the revolutionary economic strategy which our party  put forth firmly ensures a new great upswing in our country's  socialist economic construction and promises a more rewarding  future for our people's lives. [applause]    That our party set aside the period of adjustment for  socialist economic construction and put forth a revolutionary  economic strategy for this period was another important event in  our country's socialist economic construction. At the same  time, it was a revolutionary step that enables a firm prospect  to be opened to positively cope with the prevailing situation  and to attain a new high target of socialist construction.  [applause]    Our party's revolutionary measure is a banner of struggle  that arouses all the people vigorously to a new struggle and  heroic exploits, deals a hard blow to the imperialists and  reactionaries who vilify and attack socialism, and gives great  hope and faith in victory to the world's progressive people who  are heading for socialism. [applause]    We should successfully carry out the tasks for the period of  adjustment of socialist economic construction with a great pride  and self-respect in struggling with the revolutionary economic  strategy under the leadership of the great leader and great  party.    The agriculture-first policy is the task of primary  importance we should persistently keep up in the period of  adjustment. [applause]    We should thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy  and bring forth a great upturn in all areas of agricultural  production, including the production of grain, meat, eggs,  fruits, and vegetables, so that we can smoothly solve the  problem of food for the people.    In the historic letter to the national agricultural meeting  "On the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problem Under the Banner  of the Socialist Rural Theses," the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song clearly elucidated the tasks and methods to realize the  industrialization and modernization of agriculture and to  drastically increase the overall agricultural production,  including grain. We should uphold the great leader's plan and  intent and achieve a great upswing in all areas of agricultural  production.    Above all, we should solidify the successes attained in the  irrigation and electrification that have been completed, and let  their might be amply displayed. The irrigation facilities and  equipment that have been built should be in good maintenance and  repair. At the same time, we should actively introduce  efficient irrigation methods, such as circular irrigation,  vigorously push ahead with the technological modernization  project aimed at converting the water-pumping and irrigation  system into a multi-waterway watering system, and manage water  scientifically and technologically so that our country's great  circular irrigation system may be given full play.    In conformity with the rapidly increasing machinery and  power  facilities for farming and the ever-improving standard of  farmers' cultural life, we should build more power supply  facilities and improve the power supply system so as to  satisfactorily fill the rural area's demand for electricity.    To further enhance the general mechanization and  scientification standard of rural economy is an important task  to solidify and modernize agriculture. We should boost the  general mechanization and scientification standard of rural  economy to free the farmers completely from hard and difficult  labor, to continuously increase agricultural production, and to  remove the gaps between industry and agriculture and between  urban and rural areas.    To continuously enhance the general mechanization standard  of  the rural economy, we should maximize the utility rate of the  available farm machines. At the same time, during the period of  adjustment, we should increase the production and supply of  various farm machines, including the production and supply of  30,000 tractors and over 10,000 trucks, necessary to mechanize  the difficult work requiring much manual labor. We should also  smoothly solve the fuel problem for the rural economy.    In conformity with the enhancement of the general  mechanization standard of the rural economy, we should make the  paddies and fields into large-scale standardized and mechanized  fields.    The chemicalization of the rural economy must be raised to  a higher level. The fertilizer plants must be all the more well  repaired, maintained, and modernized, and their productive  capacity must be all the more created to sufficiently supply  production conditions including electricity and coal so that  various chemical fertilizers can be produced and supplied all  the more. Also, micronutrient fertilizer including silica  fertilizer, slightly burnt magnesia fertilizer, and boron  fertilizer must be supplied in assortments. In addition,  bio-fertilizer including the nitrogenous bacterial fertilizer  and phosphate (?decomposite) fertilizer, and botanical growth  accelerant must be produced more to send them to farms. Along  with this, highly effective agricultural chemicals including  spray chemicals, insecticide, and disinfectant must be smoothly  produced and supplied.    In accordance with raising the overall mechanization and  chemicalization of the rural economy at a high level, the method  of farming and the land cultivation system were developed.  Therefore, in the future, work must be carried out so that one  farmer can farm over 10-chongbo [1 chongbo = 2.45 acres] fields  in accordance with the party's plan and will.    Based on achievements accomplished in the modern biological  field, the green revolution must be vigorously accelerated in  the rural economy sector so that research and introduction can  be carried out on high-grade strains of seeds, which are  high-yielding, suitable to the climatic and soil conditions of  our country, early-ripening, and resistant to storms, cold,  moisture, blight, and harmful insects, including the first  filial generations of rice and maize which can yield 12-15  tonnes per chongbo.    An important reserve in increasing agricultural products  lies  in increasing the area of cultivated land. We must continue to  vigorously push ahead with the tidal land reclamation project,  and carry out the work to find new land through a mass movement  to increase cultivated land and thoroughly protect it so that  not even an inch of land is wasted. Also, cultivated land that  is buried and washed away must be restored at the appropriate  time.    Based on the agricultural technological revolution and the  scientific and technological results in agriculture, we must  develop the chuche farming method, carry out farm work  scientifically and technologically in accordance with it, and in  particular, the planned area for sowing and the number of plants  per pyong [1 pyong = 3.954 square yards] must be thoroughly  supplied to increase the yield per chongbo of fields from an  average of over eight tonnes to over 10 tonnes so that the goal  of producing 15 million tonnes of grain can be carried out  annually in the near future. [end recording]    The speaker [pogoja] continued to point out that the area of  orchards must be all the more increased and the fertility of  soil enhanced so that fruit production during the period of  adjustment can be increased by 30 percent. He said that the  work in growing vegetables and basic fertilization management  must be improved so that per chongbo yield can be increased  considerably, and that the stock breeding industry must be  further developed to increase meat production by over 30 percent  so that the problem of meat can be solved smoothly.    The speaker talked about putting great strength in  fulfilling  the policy that light industry is the best to all the more  defend, reinforce, and modernize the light-industry plants  during the period of adjustment, so that its potential can be  sufficiently manifested to normalize production at a high level.  Therefore, textile production must be increased by over 20  percent, shoe production by over 10 percent, and food processing  industry must be all the more developed so that the people's  dietary life can be all the more abundant and diversified.    The speaker said that the consistent policy of our party and  the republic's government is to actively investigate and  mobilize local raw materials and sources and inner reserves of  the plants and enterprises in production of people's consumer  goods, so that they can be used effectively. He continued to  say that the weight of the production of people's consumer goods  through local raw material in the local industrial sector must  be at a level over 70 percent, and export bases must be firmly  maintained through the mass movement to actively find sources  for export so that more foreign currency can be earned [suchul  wonchonul chokkuk chajanaeo tomanun oehwarul poltaedaehaeso  malhaetta].    The speaker talked about normalizing production at a high  level at chemical plants and various plants and enterprises that  supply raw material to light industry, so that production of  synthetic fiber and synthetic resins including vinalon can be  increased by 10 percent respectively during the period of  adjustment. He also talked about smoothly producing and  supplying various light industrial raw materials including  paper, dyes, and basic chemical products.    While talking about bringing about a new upsurge in foreign  trade in accordance with the changing environment, Premier Kang  said that the policy that trade is the best must be highly  upheld in all sectors of the people's economy, expand and  strengthen export goods production bases, and vigorously carry  out the struggle to raise the quality of goods so that exports  of goods can be increased decisively.    The speaker said without promoting the leading sectors of  the people's economy and developing the metal industry, the  agriculture-first, light-industry-first, and trade-first policy  cannot be implemented. He also said that during the period of  adjustment, the production of coal and electricity and the  volume of railway cargo transportation should be increased by  over 1.3 times respectively, and the metal industry should be  developed so that the increasing demand for steel material can  be satisfactorily guaranteed.    The speaker continued his speech:    [Begin Kang recording] Comrade deputies, the tasks of  socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set  forth by our party are historic and meaningful tasks of our  people's struggle to complete the socialist cause. All the  people should rise to carry out the rewarding tasks of struggle.  [applause]    In order to successfully implementing the tasks of socialist  economic construction in the period of adjustment, we should,  above all, properly and flawlessly carry out economic  organizational work and economic management.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In order to  successfully carry out socialist economic construction, economic  guidance and work management should be ceaselessly improved.    The question of successfully implementing the tasks of  socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment  depends on whether the State Administration Council [SAC] can  fulfill its role or not.    We should thoroughly implement the policy of strengthening  the system in which the SAC is the center responsible for  economic works set forth by the party so that the party's  unitary leadership in economic works is firmly established. The  SAC should implement the party's economic strategy and policy  without fail, taking a position of being wholly responsible for  each and every work of the party and the people.    The responsible functionaries of the SAC will learn about  strong discipline and order to flawlessly organize economic  operations and organizational works for implementing economic  strategy and the party's policy, promptly solve all the pending  problems rising from the economic works in a revolutionary  manner, strengthen hold on, guidance to, and control over all  areas and units of economic works, including the committees and  ministries, and the provincial administrative economic  committees, and thoroughly execute the decisions and guidelines  of the SAC.    Highly displaying the creativity of every unit on the basis  of firmly guaranteeing the country's unified guidance is one of  the fundamental principles of socialist economic management.    We should provide conditions for the committees and  ministries, provinces, cities, counties, plants, and enterprises  to highly display their creativity and should actively help  them. In particular, we should produce more goods demanded in  people's daily living by mobilizing local resources and reserves  to the maximum in provinces, cities, and counties, and  vigorously wage a struggle to secure resources internally  instead of being reliant to the center.    Improving the planning of works is one of the important  demands of socialist economic construction and one of the  fundamental conditions of successfully implementing the party's  revolutionary economic strategy.    Economic guidance functionaries should properly coordinate  economic balance under the principle of making everything  obedient to implementing the economic strategy presented by the  party, practically draw up the people's economic plan, and  implement daily, monthly, quarterly, and indexical national  plans without fail bearing a correct view and attitude that the  reform of the people's economy is the party's order and the  country's law.    We should give priority in unconditionally guaranteeing  electricity, coal, raw material, and equipment for agriculture,  light industry, and external trade sectors by properly carrying  out the material supply work, and should thoroughly guarantee  material and equipment demanded by the leading sectors of the  people's economy and the metal industry.    All domains and units of the people's economy should  actively  help agriculture, light industry, and external trade sectors and  vigorously carry out the people's support movement to these  sectors.    We should thoroughly implement the duty of the Taean work  system, and maximize economic efficiency in production and  management by pushing ahead with the management of labor,  equipment, and material and by taking good care of economic  assets. Under the party committee's collective guidance, we  should also scientifically and reasonably manage and operate the  economy so that the true superiority of the collective economic  management and operation method is further displayed.    In economic management, we should properly utilize  economic leverages such as cost, price, and profit; correctly  implement the independent accounting system; and intensify  control by won [Korean monetary unit].    To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of  adjustment in socialist economic construction, we should  vigorously conduct the struggle to produce more and save more.  One who produces more and saves more is the true loyalist and  patriot today.    All sectors and units should wage a vigorous struggle to  produce more and save more as a mass movement, while efficiently  carrying out the economy of the country in a position befitting  masters, taking good care of the properties of the state and  society, and effectively utilizing idle materials and waste  materials. By so doing, they should increase production to the  maximum degree with the available labor, facilities, and  materials.    The key to the produce-more and save-more strategy is to  innovate technology in all sectors of the people's economy. We  should go deep among the producing masses, actively arouse the  producers' wisdom and creativity, and see to it that scientists  and technicians exert their patriotic enthusiasm and talents so  that they can come up with more valuable scientific and  technological inventions, technologically innovative ideas,  creative ideas, and rationalization ideas, so that they can be  used effectively in production.    We should set up scientific and technological measures to  introduce in the production facilities and processes the  technology of plasma and heat radiation and the method of  compound (?burning material) and to effectively use low calorie  coal, [choyoltan], low-grade coal [poroktan--"bony coal"], and  meta-anthracite coal. We should make sure that methane gas and  (?grass briquettes) [`choyontan' not `chomuyontan'] coal are  used extensively in the provincial and rural areas.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the strategy  of self-reliance and fortitude. Self-reliance and fortitude is  the resolute revolutionary spirit with which one is resolved to  carry out the revolution and construction to the end with one's  own strength. It is the indomitable struggle spirit to adhere  to the revolutionary banner in the face of any obstacle and  difficulty. As we have advanced up to today under the  revolutionary banner of self- reliance and fortitude, so we must  in the future as well complete the cause of socialism under this  slogan. [applause]    Self-reliance and creative (?participation) -- this should  be  the struggle ethos and work ethos of our functionaries. As we  supported the front in the grim days of war by producing hand  grenades with bare hands and effected the chollima upsurge from  the empty lot after the war upholding the party by increasing  steel production under the party's slogan "Let us vigorously  accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the  revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and fortitude," so we  should thoroughly carry out the economic tasks for the period of  adjustment.    If we create something out of nothing and struggle with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, there will  be nothing we cannot accomplish. Our functionaries should  precisely fulfill the economic task entrusted to their sectors  and units, producing what they need and making available what is  short with an attitude and position befitting masters. By so  doing, they should powerfully demonstrate once again the  indomitable struggle spirit and heroic spirit of our people who  advance under the banner of self-reliance. [applause]    To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of  adjustment under the grave situation where the imperialists and  reactionaries are more viciously maneuvering to crush our  republic, we should further strengthen the wholehearted unity of  the revolutionary ranks. Wholehearted unity is an immortal,  glorious tradition of our revolution and a banner of victory.    To effect a new upsurge in socialist economic construction  upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we  should, in the future as well as we have done in the past,  vigorously advance under the banner of wholehearted unity. We  must push through the grim situation countering it [chunomhan  chongserul matppada ttulko nagaya hamyo] with the might of  wholehearted unity, and crush [chitpusigo] the enemy's maneuvers  with the might of wholehearted unity in order to carry out the  tasks for the period of adjustment.    All the functionaries and working people should arm  themselves firmly with the chuche revolutionary outlook. Uniting  more firmly around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and our  party, they must powerfully display the might of wholehearted  unity of the chuche revolutionary rank in carrying out the tasks  for the period of adjustment. [applause]    Invincible is the might of the popular masses who have  formed  a solid socio-political living organism firmly united around the  party center in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and  fidelity and cherishing the greatness of the party and the  leader as their absolute faith. [applause]    We should become true loyalists and dutiful children who  resolutely protect and defend the party and the leader in any  adversity and invariably and loyally uphold the party's  leadership.    We should become the resolute advocator and thorough  implementor of the party's policy with the firm faith and will  as in the slogan "What the party decides, we will do," and the  standard-bearers of struggle who unconditionally carry out the  tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic  construction.    The economic tasks set for us for the period of adjustment  are heavy and enormous, and in the course of implementing them,  there can be difficulties and trials. However, as long as we  have the tested leadership of the party Central Committee headed  by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, as long as we  have the inexhaustible might of the popular masses  wholeheartedly united around the party and the leader, and as  long as we have the strong socialist economic base of  self-reliance with the chuche industry as its backbone, there is  no difficulty we cannot overcome, nor any fortress we cannot  occupy. [applause]    There is no force in the world that can block the way of our  people who advance with redoubled courage and in high spirits.    Next year, we will be greeting the 50th anniversary of  national liberation and the 50th anniversary of the founding of  the Workers Party of Korea. We must bring forth decisive  progress in carrying out the economic tasks for the period of  adjustment by effecting a new great revolutionary upsurge to  brighten these significant anniversaries which are historically  significant in the struggle of our party and people with high  political enthusiasm and heroic exploits.    The tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic  construction are exceedingly rewarding and resplendent, and we  are assured of victory. Let us all be firmly united around the  party and the leader and wage a general onward march toward the  new position to charge at in order to occupy a new higher hill  of socialist construction under the banner of the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--with the  spirit of chollima to which the speed of the nineties is added.  [applause] [end recording]</p>

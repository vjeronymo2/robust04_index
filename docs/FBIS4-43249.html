			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jean Bothorel: "A Lesson for the </F> Presidential Election"]    [Text] For a some 20 years now, the discrepancy between  partisan struggles and the real concerns of the French has been  a recurring theme at every election.    In yesterday's European elections, this theme dominated  everything else. And the results, which could be likened to a  thunderbolt, at the very least bear witness to this discrepancy  which affects the very core of our democracy. To be sure, one  can seek comfort in the belief that this election was but a way  for voters to release some steam.    However, European elections have always provided a good  snapshot of national voting trends. A nationwide proportional  ballot, such an election is probably as reliable as any opinion  poll. One would be mistaken to dismiss them as an  inconsequential.    There will be power shifts within the Right -- the UDF  [French Democratic Union], RPR [Rally for the Republic], and  National Front -- as a result of the election. During the  campaign, it appeared clearly that the stage for the  presidential election was being set, albeit in a covert manner:  For potential contenders for the top job (Messrs. Chirac,  Balladur, and Giscard d'Estaing, among others), supporting the  UDF-RPR list was a mostly risk-free way of staking their claim.  All of them went all out in their support for the majority  list. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whom no one can suspect of  indecisiveness or incompetence in this area, was especially  active; in particular he was the only one among the majority's  main leaders to battle it out on television. His debate with  [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard on 8 June was  his first televised duel since he last locked horns with  Francois Mitterrand on 5 May 1981. However, the mediocre  performance of the RPR-UDF list cannot be blamed on the former  president of the Republic, nor on the prime minister or the  Paris mayor. Truth be told, list leaders made too many  mistakes, and they lacked ardor. In fact, the main lesson to be  derived from this election is not so much the performance of the  RPR-UDF list as the distribution of the votes among the three  lists (Baudis, de Villiers, and Le Pen), on the one hand, and  the abstention rate, on the other.    Ten months before the presidential election, Europe was  prone  to a double risk: first of all, the risk of indifference,  demonstrated by a high abstention rate; second, the risk of  fierce opposition, reflected in the results of the de Villiers  and Le Pen lists on the Right, and the Chevenement, Wurtz, and  Laguiller lists on the Left.    Given the 45-percent abstention rate, which remains high  even  though it is lower than that of 1989, and given the results of  the de Villiers, Le Pen, Chevenement, Wurtz, Laguiller, and  "Chasse-Peche" [hunters and fishermen] lists, this double risk  has been confirmed. Presidential contenders will not be able to  ignore such a negative reaction with respect to Europe. This is  not only true for Michel Rocard, who moreover has to worry about  Mr. Tapie, but also for the future UDF or RPR candidate or  candidates. Indeed, this rejection hinges on a widespread  resistance and aversion among the electorate of the  parliamentary Right. Being against Europe also means being  against technocracy, immigrant workers, the free flow of goods  and people at the borders, etc.    An "anti" and angry rhetoric has been gaining ground among  right-wing voters, leading them somewhat away from the liberal  model.    Such rhetoric, such negative reflexes are a reflection of  all  the fears and distress of the times.    Will future RPR or UDF candidates know how to thwart this  trend? Will they be able to? They should not underestimate such  trends which some people call "populism," "nationalism," or even  "fascism," and nor should they believe that the old Right-Left  divide will necessarily be revived at the time of the  presidential election. There is no hard evidence that the  so-called stray sheep who voted for de Villiers or Le Pen will  heed the call for unity of the RPR-UDF candidate in May 1995.  There was no foregoing evidence of the magnitude of the slide  suffered by the Socialists and the Greens in last year's  parliamentary election. And no evidence of yesterday's  startling results either.    Everything seems to point to a shift away from ideology  toward the irrational, the emotional, and a kind of tribalism.  In such a context, what will be the outcome of the battle to be  fought in May 1995? There is more to this challenge than  renewed growth or lower unemployment figures. It also refers to  the growing irrational and emotional charge relayed and  amplified by the electronic media. This is an issue which RPR  and UDF presidential candidates cannot ignore.</p>

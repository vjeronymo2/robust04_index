			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Immigration Department Director Antonio Dominguez  said yesterday "400 Haitians who are in the country on tourist  visas" will receive special treatment "when commercial flights"  to that Caribbean island "are suspended."    Dominguez said Haitians who are in the national territory  after 26 June--the date on which the suspension of commercial  flights to Haiti begins--"will not be classified as political  refugees" because they entered the country as tourists.    Dominguez asserted that among other mechanisms the  Immigration Directorate may implement regarding the Haitians,  "it is scheduling a charter flight to return the Haitians to  Haiti" if the crisis in that former French colony is not  resolved.    The Immigration Department director revealed that "Haitians  wishing to enter Panama must have an authorized visa, which has  been suspended for citizens of that Caribbean nation."    According to Dominguez, "visas are only being given to  Haitians who reside in the United States to come to Panama for  three days to purchase merchandise."    Finally, Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez remarked  "this situation will affect Panamanian companies which do  business with Haitians."</p>

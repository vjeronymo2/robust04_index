			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC JOB IS OPEN AGAIN;  </P> <P> TROJANS: SMITH SAYS MARINOVICH WILL HAVE TO EARN BACK STARTING QUARTERBACK  POSITION.  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich, USC's sophomore quarterback, probably would have been demoted  this week even if he hadn't been suspended for academic reasons, Coach Larry  Smith said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say he would have been benched," Smith said, "but he would have had  to have a hell of a week of practice (to start)."  </P> <P> Smith also said that Marinovich will not be given the starting position but  will have to earn it back in practice.  </P> <P> Marinovich apparently angered Smith when he complained of an earache Monday and  begged out of practice after Smith had warned Marinovich and his teammates that  such a move might cost them their starting positions.  </P> <P> Smith gathered the players at a film session before Monday's practice and laid  down ground rules in the aftermath of Saturday's 35-26 loss to Arizona. USC  squandered a 17-7 halftime lead against the Wildcats and was all but eliminated  from the Rose Bowl race.  </P> <P> "I told every player in that room that . . . I needed four days of all-out  practice," Smith said. "Guys with bumps, bruises, little aches and pains -- if  they weren't told by a doctor not to be out there, (they should) be out there.  </P> <P> "If they missed any part of a practice without something serious, then most  likely they wouldn't start in the game (Saturday against Arizona State at  Tempe.).  </P> <P> "Monday during practice, about 40 minutes into it, Todd told Coach (Ray) Dorr  (who coaches USC's quarterbacks) that he had an earache and he had to go see a  trainer, which was fine. So, I went over there and said, 'Is your earache so  severe that you don't think you can practice?' He said, 'I don't think I can.'  I said, 'OK, then leave the field and go get treatment.'  </P> <P> "I went over to the offense and said, 'We've got our first guy (out). Most  likely, Shane (Foley) will start this week. Todd is sick and you know what I  told you all, and I'm sticking to it.' "  </P> <P> Marinovich's ailment, Smith said, was later diagnosed as a "minor" ear  infection.  </P> <P> But Marinovich's father, Marv, said that the infection, which spread in the  last week from Todd's left index finger to his left ear, caused a severe  headache for his son and affected his balance and equilibrium in the Arizona  game.  </P> <P> Marinovich completed 18 of 35 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown against the  Wildcats, but threw three interceptions. And in the first three quarters, he  completed only seven of 18 passes for 61 yards, with one interception.  </P> <P> "As well as I know Todd's performance, I can tell when things are off," the  elder Marinovich said. "You watch a guy as much as I've watched that guy -- I  know when things aren't right. And I knew something was haywire."  </P> <P> Marv Marinovich said that antibiotics have improved his son's condition this  week.  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich declined interview requests made through USC and his father.  </P> <P> All that aside, Smith and Marinovich's father again stressed that Marinovich's  suspension was related only to academics. Marinovich missed classes last week  after making an agreement with Smith last month that if he didn't go to class,  he would be suspended.  </P> <P> He will be reinstated to the team next week, Smith said, if he attends all of  his classes this week and meets his academic commitments.  </P> <P> Marinovich fell behind in his classwork, it has been learned, at a time when he  was living with a teammate in what Smith described as a "small, dinky room."  </P> <P> The players were assigned the room after they waited until the last minute to  apply for student housing, Smith said.  </P> <P> "It really wasn't the ideal situation for a guy playing football and trying to  study," Smith said of the cramped conditions.  </P> <P> When Marinovich tried to move to an off-campus apartment, he was told that he  could not be reimbursed the scholarship money paid for his original room until  housing officials could find other students to move into it.  </P> <P> He lived for a time with friends, sleeping on couches, until moving to Torrance  a few weeks ago to live with his father.  </P> <P> "He did that so he could have his own room and his own schedule and could  concentrate," Smith said.  </P> <P> Last week, when he missed classes, Marinovich spent time with his girlfriend, a  graduate student at Georgetown and former USC student who was in town visiting.  </P> <P> "There are some extenuating circumstances, but I don't want to let Todd off the  hook because if he makes a deal with the coach, then that's what he's got to  do," Marv Marinovich said. "If he didn't live up to his part of the deal, he's  got to be (disciplined). That's part of growing up.  </P> <P> "I hope he will learn something from it. I hope it will be a positive  situation. If you take away his football, you've got his attention.  </P> <P> ". . . I feel horribly about it. He called the other day and it was very  emotional. I really felt for him. But again, when you give your word, when you  make an agreement -- Larry Smith had no other way to go."  </P> <P> Smith has described Marinovich as a poor practice player, but he said that he  has never questioned his desire to play.  </P> <P> "Todd Marinovich wants to play," Smith said. "There's no question in my mind.  He loves playing. I don't think he's tired of the game, or anything like that.  He wants to play in the worst way.  </P> <P> "Next week, if Todd is reinstated, they'll be competing to see who's the  starting quarterback," Smith said.  </P></p>

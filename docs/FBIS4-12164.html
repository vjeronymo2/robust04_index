			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary: "Innovation!"] </F>   [Text] The trend of a compromise with the Zionist regime  has assumed new proportions in the region, the first  manifestation of which can be seen in the invitation to Israel  to participate in regional sessions.    Qatar became the pioneer of this latest innovation when it  announced that it had invited an Israeli delegation to  participate in the multilateral talks on the nonproliferation of  weapons expected to convene in Qatar in Ordibehesht [21 April-21  May].    Accordingly, Oman has also announced that an Israeli  delegation will visit Muscat in the next few days to participate  in a multipartite working group session regarding water  resources. Thus, Oman becomes the first Gulf Cooperation  Council [GCC] member country to host a delegation from the  Zionist regime.    The following points may be noted with regard to this latest  dangerous innovation:    1. It can be conceded without doubt that the convocation of  the so-called experts' sessions with the inclusion of the  Israeli regime's representatives has only one objective, that  is, to pave the way for normalizing relations between the GCC  countries and this regime.    This can be confirmed in the context of the remarks of an  Arab diplomatic source who stated that the United States is  trying to persuade the littoral states to lift the Israeli  boycott in their multipartite talks.    Thus, the U.S. pressure to normalize relations with the  Israeli regime has increased and recently, reports have been  disseminated of covert contacts between the littoral countries  of the southern Persian Gulf and Israel. Thus, they are seeking  to bring them out of the closet and make these covert ties overt.    2. In circumstances when the Zionist regime, officially and  in full view of people everywhere, makes innocent Palestinian  civilians wallow in blood and dust and when little time has  elapsed since the al-Khalil debacle, what does the presence of  Israeli delegates at sessions held in Islamic countries mean?    Is this anything but the treachery of these countries to the  Islamic aspirations or at least Arab aspirations that have been  bandied about for years?    What answer do these littoral countries of the southern  Persian Gulf, which will host representatives from the most  rootless and illegitimate regime, have for the world's public,  especially the Muslims, whose hearts are still bleeding from the  heinous slaughter of the fasting worshippers while they were  prostrating themselves in the al-Ibrahimi mosque?    3. The Persian Gulf shaykhs have chosen the worst and most  dangerous path for protecting their thrones and diadems.  Permitting the ingress of the Zionists into the Persian Gulf  region will not benefit them; it will certainly generate  sentiments opposed to this action among the awakened societies  in their respective countries, which will certainly not be very  pleasant for their rulers.    The sins of the Persian Gulf shaykhs are unforgivable and  Israel's presence in the region will never be tolerated by the  Arab and Muslim public in the region.    Subservience to the U.S. policies on normalizing relations  with the Zionist regime will harm all the countries involved in  this trend, harm that will be too costly to redeem.</p>

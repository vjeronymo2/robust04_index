			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's risks flight of Names - and insurance giants will fill the void (2) Sir, Claud Gurney concludes (Letters, January 16) by stating that he has sent off his resignation to Lloyd's for the reasons which he so clearly sets out. I fear that his action will be followed by many more Members unless Lloyd's understands that its future is inextricably linked to a fair resolution of the problems of the past, as highlighted by its dreadful results for 1988 and 1989. The task force rightly points out, and Lloyd's has at long last accepted, the urgent need to 'cap' its Members' losses. However, the brief of the task force was only to look to the future. Thus Names who have already suffered losses exceeding 150 per cent of their premium income limit, and who see no end in sight because so many underwriting years of so many syndicates remain 'open', will derive no benefit as a result of the proposals which very belatedly are now attempting to address the problems. Lloyd's own estimate is that it suffered 4,000 resignations in 1991 and at least 2,000 Members cannot continue to underwrite because they have failed the solvency test. The 1989 results, to be published in June, are expected to reveal a loss of Pounds 1.3bn which can only exacerbate the flight from Lloyd's, It must surely be plain to Lloyd's that if it is to retain and indeed increase its capacity to take advantage of the hardening of the market, it must restore the confidence of its Members who are its only source of capital. If Lloyd's fails to do this the giants of the European and US insurance market will simply step in to fill the void. Michael Freeman, 1 Great Cumberland Place, London W1H 7AL</p>

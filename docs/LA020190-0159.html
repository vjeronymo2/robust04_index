			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL PANEL DEBATES CITY TREASURER'S FATE;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: LEONARD RITTENBERG COULD BE FIRED OVER ALLEGED DEFICIENCIES IN HIS  OFFICE. MAYOR BRADLEY ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg could face firing or a range of less severe  penalties for alleged deficiencies in the way he has operated his office,  according to City Council members who began debating Rittenberg's fate in a  closed session Wednesday.  </P> <P> A panel of five council members has been given the task of evaluating a city  Personnel Department report on Rittenberg ordered last year following  disclosures about Mayor Tom Bradley's employment by a bank that did business  with the city.  </P> <P> "I think there are very serious charges that have been made," said Councilman  Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the panel. "The city treasurer . . . is in very  serious difficulty."  </P> <P> The mayor, who usually handles such personnel matters, has stepped back from  the case because it poses a potential conflict of interest.  </P> <P> In Bradley's place, the city's Board of Referred Powers, composed of five  council members, began going through two thick volumes on Rittenberg's  performance prepared by the Personnel Department.  </P> <P> The contents of the report are secret, but several council members on the panel  said Wednesday that it contains no clear recommendation as to whether  Rittenberg should face disciplinary penalties.  </P> <P> Instead, the report outlines a range of options the panel may choose in  deciding Rittenberg's fate, they said. The options range from no disciplinary  action to firing.  </P> <P> One source said that a series of offenses, each carrying a penalty of a 30-day  suspension, were outlined in the report.  </P> <P> The investment policies of Rittenberg's office were called into question last  summer following disclosures that he deposited $2 million in city funds in Far  East National Bank shortly after receiving a phone call from Bradley, who had  been a paid adviser to the bank. Rittenberg and Bradley have denied that the  mayor influenced the decision to make the deposit.  </P> <P> Rittenberg became the subject of a Los Angeles Police Department investigation  following a disclosure that white correction fluid was used to blot out the  phrase "per the mayor" on a bid sheet that reported the deposit. The  investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> The council panel will meet again next week to continue its discussion of the  personnel report.  </P></p>

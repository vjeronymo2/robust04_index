			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Sin Hyong-chun: "An Issue of </F> Professionals Rather Than Progress"]    [Text] "Do most Kwanak members know several methods of  contraception? Do they know the method appropriate for  themselves? About 30 percent of Kwanak members have had a  sexual experience. However, have they ever been educated about  sex, contraceptives, or even falling in love?"    This is part of the article "The Third Generation," a  collection of policy materials written by Kang Pyong-won (a  23-year-old senior majoring in agricultural economics). Kang  was elected General Student Association president at Seoul  National University [SNU] on 26 November.    The Kang camp stated that the student movements of the 60's  and 70's, which followed students' consciences, were first  generation student movements, and the ideology-based movements  of the 80's formed the second generation. They then proclaimed  themselves the third generation, which dreams of the  "progressive professionals" of society.    The student movement is changing. Actually, the change in  the student movement is not new. It is natural that the  old-style student movement cannot survive the waves of change  that have followed the collapse of international socialism and  the progress of democratization in every facet of society.  However, the magnitude of change that emerged during the  elections for student association president at universities last  November was beyond expectations.    Yonsei University showed this most clearly in its student  association president elections held on 24, 25 November. Son  Yang-chol, a 25-year-old student who was considered a  "non-student movement candidate," defeated the NL (National  Liberation faction, whose main faction is the Chupasa faction)  candidate after a fierce contest requiring two rounds of  balloting. During the campaign, Son surprised his audience with  his bold assertions about the "abolition of Marxism" and the  comment that "inciting students through propaganda is nothing  more than a religion."    According to the Ministry of Education, following the  student  association president elections in November, as many as 37 other  universities have a student association president who does not  belong to the student movement. However, in 1992 there were 36  universities that elected presidents from non-student movement  circles, and so Yonsei and Kukmin Universities were the only  "major universities" to produce non-student movement presidents  during this election. Thus the rapid progress of the  non-student movement circles is not that important.    The most important point is not the advance of the  non-student movement circles, but the change in the characters  and pledges of candidates. During the campaign, candidates  consistently stressed university problems, such as education  quality, rather than social problems, such as class or ethnic  conflict. The organization of the "Committee for School  Development in the 21st Century" and the introduction of the  "system for evaluating professors' lectures" are some examples.  The fact that the "Progressive Student Alliance for a Reunified  Korea in the 21st Century" (the "21st Century Alliance," for  short), which claims to be a new student movement, produced  president elects at SNU, Sangmyong Women's University, and  Hansong University, and the good showing of the "Kyongsilyon  Student Association" in elections at SNU and Chonnam University  are remarkable in connection with the change of character in the  student movement.    The "Kyongsilyon Student Association" was founded in the  middle of last April and fielded candidates at SNU, Chonnam,  Chungang, and Choson Universities, and at the Ansan Campus of  Hanyang University. During the 25 November race at Chonnam  University--an "NL stronghold"--the Kyongsilyon Student  Association candidate ran a close race against the NL candidate,  and was defeated by a narrow margin of 50 or so votes. In the  SNU election, even though the candidate won 1,567 votes out of  the 12,200 or so cast and finished fourth among a field of five  candidates, he was judged to have finished very well for a  first-time candidate.    The "21st Century Alliance," which produced a  president-elect  at SNU--considered the "headquarters of the student movement,"  was founded on 9 October by 500 students from SNU and Yonsei,  Korea, Songgyungwan, and Sokang Universities. The various  factions, feeling that the student movement could no longer  survive by following the styles of the NL or PD (Peoples  Democracy) factions, met and founded this organization.    The "21st Century Alliance" has a goal of creating  "third-generation universities" that train progressive  professionals. It claims that the colleges have remained  unchanged and are not keeping up with society as it becomes  democratized and professionalized. Members of the group said  creating "progressive professionals" is their goal, but that  "professional" was more important that "progressive."    Kang Pyong-won, a member of the "21st Century Alliance" who  was elected student association president at SNU, said: "If  education were liberalized and Harvard University opened a  branch in Korea, SNU--which barely ranks among the top 200  universities in the world--would not survive." He also stated  he would "concentrate first on reforming college education." To  reach this goal, the university should lower the number of  credits required for graduation from the current 140 units to  120. It should strengthen the links between the disciplines and  raise the quality of education by instituting a departmental  system within each college.    Son Yang-chol, elected student association president at  Yonsei University, aroused interest both inside and outside of  the university by insisting on a "union-like student  association." Son said: "The student movement still keeps the  illusion of a bureacratic system, even though the trend of the  times is for the dissolution of a rigid bureaucratic system and  for the direct participation of individuals and organizations.  It is sufficient for the student association to have a `union'  role for the sake of regulating individuals' interests."    Son said: "The fact that the student association fights only  social and political issues while there are still various  desires on campus is a dereliction of duty." He explained, "The  `movement' will be lead by leaders of the `movement,' and not by  the student association."    He suggested several concrete tasks to carry out, such as:  Having faculty and staff use name tags, to give better service  on campus; allowing only amateur athletes to participate in  matches between Yonsei and Korea Universities--currently  professional athletes participate; and collecting students'  opinions using on-campus personal computer networks.    In elections for student association president at Korea,  Sokang, and Ehwa Women's Universities, radical political solgans  disappeared, and pledges to "start a campaign to gaurantee a 5  percent education fund," "increase the seating capacity in  library reading rooms," and "increase the number of faculty  members" appeared.    At Ehwa, one candidate called for the "disclosure of  election  expenses so that there could be student association elections  that do not cost money." Two candidates revealed that they had  spent 3.4 million won and 4 million won each. "Environmental"  issues were a major topic at some universities, and some  candidates used recycled paper for their leaflets.    How will the change among the student associations alter the  face of the university community next May? Will the months of  April and May, previously filled with tear gas and fire bombs,  recover the splendor of spring?    "It depends on the situation, but I think that the time for  us to resort to fire bombs has passed. We must act so that our  demonstrations win people's sympathies and earn comments that  what we are doing is satisfactory and good." (Kang Pyong-won,  SNU)    "I will guarantee the voice of fellow students when it comes  to political problems. However, I do not want the student  association to lead on political problems. Moreover, if outside  organizations such as Hanchongnyon [Korea Federation of  University Student Councils] choose Yonsei University as a  meeting place and the majority of students here are against it,  then that meeting cannot be held here. The student association  at Yonsei has no interest in the concerns of outside political  organizations." (Son Yang-chol, Yonsei University)</p>

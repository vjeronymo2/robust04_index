			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Lung cancer claims Madigan Mr Edward Madigan, former secretary of agriculture and a nine-term US congressman from central Illinois, died on Wednesday, aged 58. He was diagnosed as having lung cancer earlier this year and was admitted to hospital last week. Mr Madigan, a moderate Republican from Lincoln, was elected to the House in 1972 but lost his bid in 1989 to become Republican Whip to Mr Newt Gingrich of Georgia in a battle between the moderate old guard and the Republican party's younger, more confrontational wing. He was the ranking minority member on the agriculture committee when President George Bush picked him in January 1991 to succeed Mr Clayton Yeutter. As agriculture chief, Mr Madigan sought to make programmes more farmer-friendly, improve nutritional education, and increase research on new uses for farm products. In his last two weeks as agriculture secretary he presented a plan for closing and merging 1,300 field offices. After putting the plan on hold for a time, the Clinton administration this week announced the closing of more than 1,000 offices in the fourth-largest federal agency.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: India will stick to environmental and relief standards for dam without World Bank loan Sir, The report from your correspondent in New Delhi ('India to drop World Bank dam loans', March 30) gives a distorted picture about the government of India's decision not to seek further financial support from the World Bank for the Narmada project. There has been no reluctance by the government of India or the state governments concerned to meet benchmarks regarding environment and relief, and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) standards. Henceforth, too, with the implementation of the project through our own resources, we propose to fully adhere to the prescribed environmental and R&amp;R standards. Because of preoccupations of some of the states, arising out of certain developments between December 1992 and now, which are well known to everyone, progress in meeting a few benchmarks has been somewhat slower than planned; but they are in the process of being met. The government of India is determined to complete the project as it is of vital significance for the development of several million people in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. When completed, the project will provide perennial irrigation to nearly 2m hectares, generate 1450MW of power and provide drinking water in a chronically drought-prone area.

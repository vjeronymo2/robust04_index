			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding erodes early gains in Nikkei Arbitrage unwinding and position covering eroded earlier gains posted on buying for the first day of January settlements, and the Nikkei index finally closed lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average closed down 45.83 to 19,665.53 after a low of 19,599.40 and a high of 19,813.91. A rise in the futures market in the morning prompted arbitrage buying and purchases by traders, but gains were eroded by afternoon selling. Volume was 260m shares against 235.8m. Activity was led by dealers and arbitrageurs, with individual investors trading in speculative issues. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.26 to 1,551.79, while the Nikkei 300 index lost 0.68 to 285.24. Advances led declines by 478 to 474, with 210 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.37 to 1,200.16. Speculative issues were among the most actively traded. Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabric manufacturer, fell Y10 to Y725 on profit taking, while Minolta added Y14 to Y553. Nippon Soda, a chemical maker, rose Y26 to Y660. Investors were encouraged by the company's contract with a US drug maker to supply Aids-related materials. Konica, the photo film maker, closed up Y13 at Y818. The company's 20 per cent revenue growth of its new disposable cameras has supported its recent price rise. Higher ferro-nickel prices boosted Pacific Metals, the largest ferro-nickel maker, in the morning session. The stock however, closed unchanged at Y533. Other mining and metal issues were also stronger, with Sumitomo Metal Mining up Y1 to Y907. Profit-taking hurt shipbuilders. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, lost Y3 to Y750 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries fell Y5 to Y453.

Brokers said that most of the day's activity was the result of window-dressing of the year-end accounts, with little of the activity having an affect on prices. Smaller and medium-sized stocks were higher, but investors saw few reasons to establish new positions on the larger blue-chips before the year-end.

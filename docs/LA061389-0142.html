			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> OC BOARD REJECTS BAN ON AIDS BIAS  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors, after hearing more than two hours of  emotionally charged testimony, rejected an ordinance today that would have  prohibited discrimination against AIDS victims.  </P> <P> The board voted 3-2 against the law, which would have banned discrimination in  housing, employment, county services or by any business in unincorporated  county areas because a person has AIDS or tested positive for the HIV virus.  </P> <P> The rejection of the ordinance makes Orange County the only urban county in  California not to have an AIDS anti-discrimination law on its books. Los  Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Riverside and Alameda counties all have  enacted similar laws.  </P></p>

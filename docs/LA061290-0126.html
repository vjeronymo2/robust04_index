			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOMERS' DIALING PUTS DOLLARS IN '900' COMPANY'S POCKETS;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: A PROVIDER OF PAY-PER-CALL PHONE SERVICES PROFITS, BUT FEELS  THE EFFECT OF CONSUMER GROUPS' COMPLAINTS.  </P> <P> Sportswriters jeer it, but one of the popular "900" pay-per-call phone programs  right now has Oakland A's baseball slugger Jose Canseco providing recorded  messages so his fans -- for $2 a minute -- can hear about his recent  performance, get a batting tip or leave him a message.  </P> <P> Dial the number in Southern California and your call is taken by Pacific Bell  or GTE and handed over to a long-distance telephone company, which sends it to  a telecommunications complex in Las Vegas that is the home of Audio  Communications Inc., the company that produces Canseco's program.  </P> <P> ACI, whose West Coast sales office is in Canoga Park, claims to be the nation's  biggest provider of 900 numbers, handling about 350 programs that were  developed in-house or for others. The company, owned by Las Vegas businessman  Jim Feist, says it receives 1 million calls per month that provide it with $50  million to $75 million in annual revenue.  </P> <P> Besides Canseco, ACI's programs include messages from rock stars, such as Paula  Abdul, and rap singers, such as MC Hammer, horoscopes from Sydney Omarr and  stock tips from Wall Street analysts. ACI also offers a phone version of the  game show "Family Feud," in which callers accumulate points each time they call  (for 95 cents per minute). Magazines and retailers use ACI's 900 service for  promotions.  </P> <P> But with ACI's success has come problems. Although the company says it runs an  honest shop, the entire 900 business has come under criticism from consumer  groups for being more hype than information. And ACI feels the publicity's  sting along with its rivals.  </P> <P> The 900 industry overall was born in the early 1980s but did not take off until  1988, and now it encompasses thousands of services that had combined revenue of  nearly $500 million last year, according to Rich Parkhill, who publishes the  trade magazine InfoText in Capistrano Beach.  </P> <P> "It bothers me a lot, the criticism," said Charlie De Natale, who along with  Floyd O'Neil and Kris Kupczyk are ACI's top officers in Canoga Park. He blames  some bad apples in the 900 business that, in not delivering what they promise,  are not making "this instrument a valuable source of information and  entertainment for people."  </P> <P> Feist said the fraud that does occur on 900 programs -- namely, advertising a  product and then not delivering it -- has been done for decades in other media,  but "because 900 numbers are so new, they're getting an awful lot of  attention."  </P> <P> Another blow came last week, when Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based  consumer group, issued a study that blasted the 900 industry for fraudulent  advertising. The group said "most advertised 900 numbers are unfair at any  price," and urged state and federal regulators to stop "the rip-offs that  increasingly characterize pay-per-call services."  </P> <P> Consumer Action did not cite ACI nor any of its programs, and group researcher  Stephen Texeira acknowledged that "there are certainly some legitimate  players." Still, the complaints involve ACI at least by association. "It's a  problem," said O'Neil.  </P> <P> ACI also is not mistake-free. At one point last year, Canseco was supposed to  update his 900 message every day, but didn't bother for three consecutive days,  De Natale said. So ACI's customers weren't getting what ACI was advertising  either.  </P> <P> "We had to track the guy down to make sure he doesn't do this again," De Natale  said. "It's not his neck that's really on the line. Yeah, he'll get the  criticism in the paper, but we can't afford in the 900 business to have that  kind of thing happen."  </P> <P> Besides keeping Canseco -- whose 900 fee is not disclosed -- on a short leash,  ACI has another strategy to boost its image along with its revenue. The company  increasingly is trying to get Fortune 500 companies to use 900 numbers for  selling their products and services, sampling public opinion and offering  sweepstakes promotions.  </P> <P> "Corporate America is where the business has got to go," O'Neil said. "We've  got to legitimize our business much more. A lot of get-rich-quick people have  hopped on the bandwagon, put up programs and then walked away to go on to some  other business venture."  </P> <P> The 900 programs initially were too closely tied to adult phone services, which  left corporate America "sitting on the sidelines for years, afraid to join the  game, because of fears of tainting their corporate image," he said.  </P> <P> Those fears have abated somewhat, with companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble,  Revlon and ABC Television developing 900 services. In addition, the blue-chip  companies American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and American Express last year  formed a joint venture, Call Interactive, that develops and operates 900  programs for others.  </P> <P> ACI offers a similar "service bureau," in which someone can get a 900 service  started for under $5,000 -- excluding advertising, which is the biggest cost in  launching a successful 900 program. About half of ACI's revenue comes from its  service bureau.  </P> <P> As for ACI's plan to solicit more Fortune 500 accounts, the idea is not unique.  Call Interactive, which has 140 pay-per-call programs, also focuses on  "business-to-consumer applications," said Brian Rivette, vice president of  marketing.  </P> <P> Call Interactive also is trying to improve the public's perception of 900  services by closely evaluating each 900 proposal it gets and looking "for  programs that offer the caller a value equivalent to the amount paid" for the  call, he said.  </P> <P> Feist, 46, started ACI in 1987. But he'd been investing in 900 since the early  1980s, when he started a 900 service that gave out sports scores. Correctly  assuming that the 900 business would eventually explode and carry fatter profit  margins, he made a multimillion-dollar investment in 900 channels and in  telecommunications and computer equipment to handle the calls.  </P> <P> Today, calls to ACI's numbers average about 3 minutes, and the fee that ACI and  the telephone companies get from each call varies. But in the case of a $6 call  to Canseco's line, the long-distance carrier -- in this case Telesphere Inc. --  gets $1.71 and ACI gets the rest to cover its costs (including Canseco's fee)  and clear a profit, De Natale said. The local telephone company, such as  Pacific Bell, that initially hooks up the call negotiates its own fees with the  long-distance carrier, he said.  </P> <P> What if Canseco goes into a slump? De Natale isn't worried, because Canseco's  popularity stems as much from his controversial personal life as from his  batting average. In fact, he's the only sports star ACI is currently touting.  </P> <P> "We do not believe in the potential of other sports personalities right now,"  he said. For instance, rival New York Yankees slugger Don Mattingly "wouldn't  draw flies" on 900 because he's "low profile," De Natale said.  </P> <P> But De Natale is looking for the day when Canseco shares the 900 stage with the  likes of Kellogg and Kimberly-Clark. "All we have to do to maintain our status  is align ourselves with these people," he said.  </P></p>

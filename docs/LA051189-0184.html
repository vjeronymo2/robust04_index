			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STARTLING DELAY IN OLD TOWN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER EXPECTED APPROVAL FOR NEWEST PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Historical preservationists were cautiously optimistic last year when developer  Douglas L. Stitzel took over the ambitious Marketplace project, long considered  the cornerstone of rejuvenating historic Old Pasadena.  </P> <P> Stitzel had a reputation as a builder of high-class shopping areas and he said  he was willing to work with preservationists to end the rancorous debate over  the fate of the block of 16 historic contiguous buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Design Unveiled  </P> <P> But whatever good will existed last year disappeared in a puff Monday night  when Stitzel unveiled a new design for the project before the city's Design  Commission.  </P> <P> True to the promise he made last year, Stitzel abandoned the idea of building a  contemporary-style mall, by boring an atrium through the middle of the  turn-of-the-century buildings.  </P> <P> Preservationists, however, say that despite that improvement, Stitzel's design  is no better and in some areas is worse than previous proposals because of its  effect on parts of the historically important buildings.  </P> <P> "It is as damaging and in some cases more damaging than before," Claire  Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group, Pasadena Heritage, told  the commission. "Let us direct the developer to go back to the drawing board."  </P> <P> Although three members of the Design Commission were prepared to approve the  project, the four other members voted to delay action until next month so the  commission could receive an initial environmental review of the project.  </P> <P> It was a seemingly benign decision, but Stitzel, who expected approval Monday  night, said he saw the delay as a sign that the project may face tough  opposition from some in City Hall as well as from preservationists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battle Stage Set  </P> <P> Supporters and opponents agree that the commission's decision has set the stage  for a battle that could be as bitter as the one that has raged since the mall  concept was proposed in 1983.  </P> <P> Bogaard said Pasadena Heritage has begun considering a lawsuit to force the  project to undergo a more strenuous environmental review, which would include  an assessment of the damage to historic structures.  </P> <P> Stitzel appealed the Design Commission's decision to the Board of Directors on  Tuesday, asking it to step in approve the project, which he has renamed One  Colorado Boulevard. The issue is scheduled to be taken up next week.  </P> <P> But he said he has no desire for a protracted war in court or City Hall.  </P> <P> "I want to build a project and I have the financial wherewithal to do it," he  said. "But I'm not into spending months fighting through the bureaucratic  process. The fear is of eternal bureaucracy."  </P> <P> If his new design is not supported, he said he may resurrect the idea of  building the same mall, which the city approved last year over the protests of  historical preservationists.  </P> <P> "We have worked for the better part of the last 4 1/2 months to come up with a  better project," Stitzel said. "But if they want a Marketplace, they may just  end up with one."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Aspects Better  </P> <P> Opponents agree that Stitzel has improved on some aspects of the original  Marketplace design, which was proposed by developer John Patrick Wilson in  1983.  </P> <P> Wilson believed the only way to attract shoppers and get them to browse on the  hard-to-lease second floor was to build a mall atrium through the buildings.  The facades of the buildings would be left in place and restored.  </P> <P> The idea of a 350,000-square-foot mall in Old Pasadena, which is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places, provoked an outcry from preservationists,  who called it glitzy, phony and historically outrageous. (The nearby Plaza  Pasadena has 584,485 square feet of leasable space.)  </P> <P> Thus began the six-year battle over the block of 16 buildings, bounded by  Colorado Boulevard, Fair Oaks Avenue, De Lacey Street and Union Street.  </P> <P> Wilson's plans began to crumble in 1987 because of problems in securing  financing for the $60-million project.  </P> <P> The project was sold to CMC Capital Corp. and then Pierce/Lange Development.  Both groups adhered to the mall concept and both ran into similar financial  problems.  </P> <P> The project was sold last December to Stitzel and his partners, Berisford  Capital Corp. and San Francisco developer Leslie Schilling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Design Details  </P> <P> Unlike a mall, Stitzel has proposed a design that would keep the interior walls  of each building intact. The design calls for ground-floor entrances to shops  on both the first and second floors using a plan that even some  preservationists have called the plan ingenious.  </P> <P> To accomplish this, the front entrances of several buildings would lead down a  few steps to a first floor several feet lower than the street. The rear  entrances would lead up a few steps to a second floor slightly above the  street.  </P> <P> Because the floors would be lowered by a few feet, the buildings could  accommodate a third floor for offices, storage or retail shops.  </P> <P> The design not only allows an extra floor in a building, but it also doubles  the amount of valuable space accessible from the street.  </P> <P> The plan also includes a new three-story building on Union Street housing  restaurants, shops and six movie theaters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changes Raise Concerns  </P> <P> Preservationists argue that the design requires too many changes to the floors  of the buildings, the rear facades and a cobblestone alley -- all historically  important features, they say. The changes could result in the block being  dropped from the National Register of Historic Places, according to Pasadena  Heritage.  </P> <P> The changes include burying Hugus Alley under 2 1/2 feet of dirt and pavement  to meet the new heights of some rear entrances. The floors of some buildings  would also have to be adjusted to accommodate the double ground-floor scheme.  </P> <P> Preservationists also say the size and design of the new three-story building  overwhelms the architecture of the rest of the block.  </P> <P> "When I first saw this, I thought it was intriguing and ingenious," said Sue  Mossman, program director for Pasadena Heritage. "Now I find it to be an  artificial and phony concept for Old Pasadena. It is artificial Old Pasadena,  not real Old Pasadena."  </P> <P> Barbara Nyberg, a business owner in Old Pasadena, said the One Colorado project  will hurt businesses in the area because it is too focused on a central plaza  located behind the buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Interior Focus'  </P> <P> "This project is designed to have an interior focus," she said. "That is not  what Old Pasadena is about. All the energy will be drawn off Colorado  Boulevard."  </P> <P> Stitzel's lead architect, Jeffrey Horowitz, said the design requires far less  demolition of walls and floors than Wilson envisioned and the vast majority of  the facades would be untouched.  </P> <P> By abandoning the mall idea, the project also would fit in better with the rest  of Old Pasadena.  </P> <P> The proposal has won the backing of the Chamber of Commerce, Board of Realtors  and the Old Pasadena Business Improvement District, an association of Old  Pasadena business people.  </P></p>

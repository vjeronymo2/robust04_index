			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iulia Rosca, Cristian Anghelache, and Marius </F> Huc: "Will the PDSR Cross the Rubicon of One-Party  Conceitedness?"]    [Text] The fourth round of PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania] and PD [Democratic Party] talks lasted four hours,  despite initial predictions (two hours). Earlier, Ioan Solcanu  (from the PDSR) speculated that the dialogue was in danger of  breaking up because of some statements of Adrian Severin (from  the PD). The leader of the PDSR delegation [Solcanu] told  Nord-Est Presse: "We must be restrained." Solcanu was restrained  only with the representatives of the press who were impatiently  waiting for the end of the discussions. There was also a desire  to formulate the intentions of the PDSR in less vague terms.  Adrian Severin stated clearly that the failure to state these  intentions in concrete form would lead to the cancellation of  the discussions set for 20 April. Here are the statements of the  leaders of the delegations:    Adrian Severin, deputy chairman of the Democratic  Party: ``It seems to us that we should have a round of  discussions so that we can find out how things will be going  from now on. We have agreed on some steps to be taken in the  immediate future, but, I would like to express, at the very  beginning, my concern about a certain impasse in regard to the  capacity of this discussion to produce anything concrete.    ``We decided that, prior to the next meeting, we must  receive  a very concrete response to the proposal for an agreement on  political conduct (presented by the PD). Today we proposed the  creation of six joint working groups, which would eventually be  open to other parties in the opposition. There would be a group  that would draw up a list of legislative priorities; a group  analyzing situations in which the lack of independence of the  judiciary is noted; a group that will analyze situations in  which abuses or irregularities are noted in local  administration; another group that would treat the issues of the  politicization of economic agencies--making leadership positions  in such organizations dependent upon party membership and the  establishment of party organizations in enterprises and  institutions. There is also a group that aims at the isolation  of extremist parties and intolerant, xenophobic, and  anti-Semitic movements.    ``This is the concrete package of proposals that we made and  to which we expect a response. We have also received a draft  plan for parliamentary collaboration to which we will respond.  Basically, this plan does not upset us. On the contrary, it is  very welcome. But we cannot agree that the laws on reform should  pass with only the votes of the PD and the CDR [Romanian  Democratic Convention], while the laws on restoration should  pass with the assistance of the four parties that constitute the  parliamentary majority, along with the PDSR.    ``We also decided that, by the next meeting, each one of us  would present a precise list of subjects related to a political  pact and a pact on the management of the economy. The PD  believes that these are preliminary moves in preparation for  many discussions with the CDR, for the real restructuring of the  current parliamentary majority.    "We are asking the PDSR to clearly state its views in regard  to this possibility, even though we understand that some of the  representatives of this party are afraid of losing the bird in  the hand for two in the bush. We are alarmed by a certain lack  of decision, an inability `to cross the Rubicon,' `to cut the  Gordian knot,' lack of decision on the part of the PDSR, which  slows things down. It is obvious that if we do not obtain  anything concrete we will have to break off the negotiations set  for the end of April."    Eugen Dijmarescu, Democratic Party senator: "The  expectations were not too great for the fourth meeting but they  were greater than what we achieved. I would say, in fact, that  we achieved very little--actually, another postponement, when,  in my opinion--a few months after the Democratic Party had put a  draft national pact on the table and the PDSR had presented an  alternative formula--the premises existed for moving on to the  discussion of the main ideas which could lead to a document  which we would offer as an opening to other political forces,  with a view to the restructuring of the parliamentary majority.  The PDSR came up with a proposal on the achievement of an  agreement on parliamentary cooperation between the two parties,  with more limited point-by-point objectives compared to the  national pact. Unfortunately, the PDSR presented it late, the  night before the meeting, making it impossible to have a  thorough discussion and to put it in a form in which it could be  signed quickly. Therefore, we proposed that both parties  reexamine both documents more carefully, that they also reach an  agreement on their behavior, with a moratorium on agression and,  possibly, set up joint working groups on matters related to  reform and all that the transition signifies."    Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of the PDSR: ``It  was a meeting at which we evaluated the status of consultations  between the two parties and we agreed that we should go beyond  the listing of theoretical possibilities and take concrete  steps. Therefore, we presented a draft of a political pact which  is certainly subject to improvement. This is why we presented it  in this form. It would have taken some time to discuss the draft  at the current session since we are not in agreement about the  stage at which the respective draft was drawn up. We decided  that this possibility of drawing up principles and subject  matter for a draft of a political accord and a draft plan for  economic management would be on the agenda for a future meeting  between the two parties. Also, the PDSR presented a document on  an agreement on parliamentary collaboration and the PD presented  a draft agreement on political conduct.    "We agreed that the point-by-point development of the two  documents presented by the two parties would be on the agenda  for the next meeting."</p>

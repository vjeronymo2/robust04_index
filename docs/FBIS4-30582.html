			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Seoul by Correspondent of the Public Relations </F> Department Somphon Kitphonprasoet]    [Text] Today Prime Minister Chuan Likphai attended a  luncheon hosted by four Korean associations at the (Tibra)  Hotel. The prime minister delivered a speech, during which he  noted to Korean businessmen that relations between the two  countries are now entering a new dimension, that of a joint  investment, which will enhance stability and contribute to  regional prosperity as a whole. The prime minister took note of  the overwhelming success of South Korea in development of  democratic administration, free trade and industries, and  cultural progress, especially in sports. He said that ROK  achievements serve as a model to all developing countries.    The prime minister said that Thailand should not simply be a  market for Korean industry but should serve as a gateway for  joint investment ventures, which will certainly benefit South  Korea. He noted that the labor in Thailand is skilled labor,  and Thailand also boasts high financial stability. The value of  the baht is strong, and Thailand has the lowest rate of  inflation in Asia. He said South Korea should take advantage of  those favorable aspects of Thailand to expand trade and industry  to step ahead into Burma and other Indochinese countries in the  future.</p>

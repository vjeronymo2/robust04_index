			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON'S FOLLY  </P> <P> I cannot believe that Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) refuses to let  old wounds heal ("Japanese Internment Argument Is Revived," Aug. 17).  </P> <P> Added to his earlier virulent anti-homosexual statements, we now have his  racist stance with regard to Japanese Americans who were interned at various  camps in the United States.  </P> <P> Is Ferguson from the Dark Ages? He obviously has no sensitivity. I cannot  understand how anyone can reelect him to any office.  </P> <P> CRAIG G. MYERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

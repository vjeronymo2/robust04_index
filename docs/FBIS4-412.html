			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 9 Apr (PANA) -- The speaker of the  Burundi Parliament, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has confirmed the  arrival of U.S. planes at Bujumbura Airport, for the  repatriation of its nationals from neighboring Rwanda, where a  civil war broke out on Wednesday [6 April].    Ntibantunyanya, who made the announcement on national radio,  gave no detail on the type and number of planes expected in the  Burundian capital. He only said that immediately the Americans  applied for landing, the Crisis Committee met urgently and gave  the go-ahead to the U.S. planes.    The speaker appealed for understanding saying it was purely  a  humanitarian gesture. "The American planes have no other mission  than to repatriate U.S. nationals who risk death in Rwanda", he  explained.    The speaker, who under the Constitution is to lead the  country for an interim period of between 45 days and three  months, ended his short radio address by commending the  Burundian people for "the dignity they have shown so far in  these times of trial". He urged them to continue to safeguard  "peace which honors Burundi in the eyes of the international  community". The Crisis Committee comprises six eminent  personalities, including Ntibantunganya, Defense Minister  Colonel Cedeon Fyroko, and Armed Forces general chief of staff,  Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu.</p>

This program builds on NOAA's mission requirements and longstanding capability in global change research and prediction. The NOAA Program is a key contributing element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which is coordinated by the interagency Committee on Environmental and Natural Ressources. NOAA's program is designed to complement other agency contributions to that national effort. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Strict deadlines for submission to the FY 1995 process are: Letters of intent must be received at the Office of Global Programs (OGP) no later than June 14, 1994.

Current Program plans assume that 30&hyph;35% of the total resources available ($84 million) anticipated in FY 1995 will support extramural efforts, particularly those involving the broad academic community. Approximately $20 million will be applied toward extramural grants and cooperative agreements already in progress and those proposals submitted in FY 1994 that were recommended for funding in FY 1995. Remaining funds, approximately, $9 million will be available for new grants and cooperative agreements. This Program Announcement is for projects to be conducted by investigators both inside and outside of NOAA, primarily over a one, two or three year period. Actual funding levels may be subject to change depending on the final FY 1995 budget appropriation. The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that NOAA will be substantially involved in the implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument should be a cooperative agreement. Examples of substantial involvement may include but are not limited to proposals for collaboration between NOAA or NOAA scientists and a recipient scientist or technician and/or contemplation by NOAA of detailing Federal personnel to work on proposed projects. NOAA will make decisions regarding the use of a cooperative agreement on a case-by-case basis. Funding for non-U.S. institutions and contractual arrangements for services and products for delivery to NOAA are not available under this announcement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK to urge curbs on EBRD: Lamont says government made earlier pleas for greater economy THE BRITISH government will next week press for tighter controls of spending by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development following disclosure that it had spent more than Pounds 200m on overheads and equipping its building in the past two years. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said yesterday he had become so concerned at the level of spending by the EBRD that the government had frequently called for greater efficiency and economy in the way the bank was run. The call for tighter budgetary controls will come at the EBRD's annual meeting next week and follows disclosures in the Financial Times that the bank has spent Pounds 55.5m equipping its London headquarters, Pounds 600,000 hiring private jets and Pounds 52,000 on a Christmas party. The FT disclosed that from April 1991 to the end of last year, the EBRD had disbursed Pounds 101m in loans and investments against Pounds 201.5m spent on furnishing its offices, paying staff, travel and administrative overheads. Mr Lamont, who represents Britain on the board of governors and is in Tokyo for the emergency meeting of G7 finance and foreign ministers on aid to Russia, said he would make sure the government's concerns about efficiency would be fully considered at the meeting of governors. The EBRD governors are typically finance ministers from the 53 mostly western and east European countries, the European Community and the European Investment Bank, which make up the bank's shareholders. Mr Lamont said several of the bank's 23 governors, meeting informally, had voiced concerns about the EBRD's spending in the two years since it was set up. He indicated that the concerns were mainly about salary levels, as well as issues such as the use of private jets to ferry Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president and founder, to meetings. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the bank's executive director in charge of the budget, said the bank had become aware that spending on the jets was 'sensitive'. He introduced a new system for hiring jets 'a few months ago' by which the bank asks for tenders from three charter companies. All executives except Mr Attali and senior vice-president Mr Ron Freeman were also told a month ago to fly economy class. It also emerged that the bank's 23 directors, who are civil servant representatives of the shareholders, are pressing for greater control over the bank's budget-making process. 'There is a lack of transparency and accountability,' a UK official said. Mr Pissaloux said: 'We are very anxious to respond to requests for any additional information (from directors).' Founder European Community shareholders of the EBRD are also expected to use the bank's annual meeting to quiz Mr Attali about its spending record. But officials from the European Commission and European Investment Bank, which together hold 6 per cent of the EBRD's shares, said yesterday they were sympathetic to the difficulties of funding projects in the economic chaos of the former eastern bloc. Mr Lamont said: 'Britain is at the forefront of those calling for economy and efficiency.' The UK would continue to make such calls, but he noted that the bank was playing a vital role in the reconstruction of eastern Europe. Economy class flights Page 8 Editorial Comment Page 23</p>

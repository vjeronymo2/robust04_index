			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Cinderella rides the waves: The growth potential of UK commercial radio For the past 20 years, CanWest, Canada's largest privately-owned television group, has been offered radio stations or stakes in stations. It has always said No - until now. The Canadian group, which also has television interests in New Zealand, Australia and Chile, this week took a 24.5 per cent stake in Talk Radio UK, the UK's third national commercial broadcaster; CanWest regards the deal as one of the most exciting media investments it has made. Mr Arthur Price, who used to run MTM, the Hollywood independent production company responsible for the drama series Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant, is equally enthusiastic. His money is behind the UK-controlled Media Ventures International, the largest shareholder in the station, which saw off five rivals to clinch the winning bid. Mr Price may be running something of a risk with his share of the Pounds 6.5m equity. It remains unproved whether Talk Radio UK can replicate in the UK the increasing success of talk format radio stations in north America. It plans to mix news, controversy and debate with drama, comedy and quiz shows. The station, due to be launched on February 4, and the interest it has created among investors, is nevertheless the latest symptom of the renaissance in commercial radio in the UK. After more than a decade of trying, the Cinderella medium has broken free from its financial straitjacket: commercial radio accounted for only about 2 per cent of total UK advertising revenue, even as the number of stations has grown. Last year radio advertising leapt to Pounds 178.9m, compared with Pounds 140.9m the previous year, while the proportion of total advertising rose from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent - quite apart from a further Pounds 30m received in sponsorship. Commercial radio has increased its share of total listening to more than 45 per cent and on present trends should overtake all the BBC stations combined sometime next year. This overall improved performance has started showing through in the industry bottom line, with the largest commercial radio group, Capital Radio, reporting its best figures - a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.4m for the six months to March - an increase of 80 per cent over the same period a year before. Investors in the City of London, like the advertising industry, are starting to take radio seriously. 'Commercial radio has come of age. At the moment everything is positive for radio,' says Ms Lucy Brooke, an analyst who specialises in radio at the UK stockbroker James Capel. The arrival of the national stations, in particular the first of them, Classic FM, has been vital in raising the profile of an industry that was previously local, fragmented and seen as rather downmarket. 'I do think Classic FM made commercial radio respectable,' says Mr Peter Baldwin, director of the Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body. In this case respectability led straight to earnings. Commercial radio executives like to tell the story of how Barclays Bank became a convert to their cause. Scepticism on the part of marketing staff was overcome, it is suggested, by directors who were listening with pleasure to the new classical music station. Last year, Barclays spent considerably more than Pounds 1m on commercial radio. While Classic, Richard Branson's Virgin 1215, the second national station, and Atlantic 252, the other, 'unofficial' commercial broadcaster from the Irish Republic, which transmits to a large part of the UK on long wave, have been important in making radio a more central medium for advertisers, other factors have also been significant. One has been the creation of National Network Radio, an initiative by Mr Richard Eyre, the managing director of Capital, which made it possible for the first time to buy an advertising campaign on more than 120 local radio stations from a single purchase point - campaigns that can be aimed at targeted audiences such as football fans. In another move that has boosted revenues from commercials, radio stations set aside their rivalries to support the Radio Advertising Bureau, which promotes radio as a medium and advises potential new advertisers on how to make the most of commercial radio. Commercial radio has also received a big boost from radical changes at BBC Radio 1 taking the channel even further away from a hit music driven agenda. The result has been the loss of more than 3m listeners in less than two years. Further growth is likely to come from a host of new regional and local stations. Five regional stations launch in September - for example Heart FM in the West Midlands. Chrysalis, the media and record group which won the licence, plans to offer adult contemporary music. Mr Richard Huntingford, head of Chrysalis Radio, believes the potential for building assets is considerable. The franchise application - only national stations go to the highest financial bidder - cost about Pounds 50,000. The station will be worth, he believes, closer to Pounds 10m. Chrysalis is also planning to take its adult contemporary music format to London, where applications for four licences - two AM and two FM - are due in by June 28. Chrysalis will face competition, not least from Transworld, one of the largest commercial radio groups, which have been working on an adult contempory music format for more than two years. Mr Eyre of Capital believes that such initiatives will ensure that commercial radio continues to leap forward. He says the European average of 5 per cent of total advertising devoted to commercial stations is attainable in the UK - sooner than most people expect.</p>

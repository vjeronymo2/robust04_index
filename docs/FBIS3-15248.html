			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Zhudro] </F>   [Text] Tel Aviv March 3 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister Igor Ivanov, who is presently staying in Israel on a  Mid-East diplomatic mission, said today in a press release:  "Our visit to Israel, the same as the entire current Mideast  mission, is carried out by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  order. A decision to send a special envoy to the region was  passed by the president with due reagrd for the sharply  aggravated situation on the Jordan West Bank and in the Gaza  Strip, as well as for the threat of peace process disruption.  Being a great power and co-sponsor of Arab-Israeli talks,  Russia is fully aware of its special responsibility for their  further progress. In this connection, our main task is to do  our utmost to prevent peace process from being disrupted, to  promote the creation of such an atmosphere, such conditions that  would prevent any further escalation of violence."    The contacts established by us in Tunisia, with Chairman of  the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee  Yasir 'Arafat, and in Tel Aviv, with Israeli leaders Yitzhaq  Rabin and Shim'on Peres, revealed what we consider the main  tendency, the deputy foreign minister went on to say. The  essence of this tendency is that both sides understand quite  well there is no alternative to peace process. Only through a  dialogue, constructive and restrained, we will manage to address  the sensitive issues now facing Palestinians and Israelis,  Ivanov stressed.    During detailed conversations with the Israeli prime  minister  and foreign minister, and taking into account our meetings with  the PLO leader, we tried to find such a solution to the Hebron  crisis that would enable the confronting sides to return to the  negotiating table. In the context of these conversations,  Ivanov said, we also considered the problem of international  presence on the occupied territories, which is designed to  become an additional guarantee of safety and stability.    The Russian diplomat emphasised that "both Palestinian and  Israeli leaders highly praised the initiative moves by the  Russian co-sponsor taken under President Yeltsin's decision and  aiming to preserve and bolster peace process, pointed to their  timeliness and spoke in favour of closer contacts in the future."</p>

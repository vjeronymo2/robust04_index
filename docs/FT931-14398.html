			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Big rise feared on costs at Thorp COSTS AT British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp plant at Sellafield could soar by 'several hundred million pounds' in the first decade of operation, jeopardising its economic basis, a report commissioned by the environmental campaign group Greenpeace said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. The new attack comes during a fierce debate about whether the plant for reprocessing 'spent' or used nuclear fuel, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and nearly 10 years to build, should start operation. A government inquiry is considering whether the economic, environmental and political reasons for reprocessing have changed so much since the plant got the go-ahead that it should become a white elephant. BNF said that the figures were 'pure speculation'.</p>

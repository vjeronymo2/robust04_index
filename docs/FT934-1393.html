			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Radio History Now and Then was four discussions by academics on Radio 3, from Monday to Thursday, on the influence of current beliefs on our approach to history. 'Now' was not much after the industrial revolution; one piece was on the Civil War, but with no part for Ian Richardson. Roy Porter chaired. Monday was People's History, below the kings and battles we all know. A York excavation told about the food, clothes and health, even pets, of 10th-century folk, not in the history-books. But little about God. In the late 18th century the people drifted from the Church of England to Dissent; but what we now have is just 'cultural anthropology', inadequate on, say, sex. The panel spoke well of EP Thompson's History of the English Working Class and called for a history 'in depth'. Tuesday was gender (not sex). Eighteenth-century history is full of Great Men; women were generally victims or rebels. Good points on political influence in country houses, and things like tailoring - a man must have English-style kit to distinguish him from foreigners, while women could wear French clothes without reproach. A complete history must include all such things. Wednesday was school-book history, the Industrial Revolution - not such a revolution to historians as we had in the last 30 years. The data, as always, have a male bias; little is told of the changes for women and children, many of whom went to work. The standard of living from 1750-1850 was constant; height and nutrition were maintained; only later did they fall. Welfare depended on where one lived; workers in textile industries, for example, lost out to new items like the Spinning Jenny. The Civil War on Thursday dealt 100 years further back. Fascinating to know of the crowd playing football with an executed head at Dorchester; to hear of the division between Anglicans and the Church of England; but what concerned the crowds besides playing football with dead heads? Was Charles II often discussed in the Roundhead kitchens? Ray Gosling's is a lowbrow academic able to take some everyday thing and make it interesting. Gosling on the High Street (Radio 4, Wednesdays) picks a familiar household name and examines its familiarity. Last week we had Frank Hornby, whose Hornby Trains covered every sitting-room carpet not able to afford a Bassett-Lowke. This week, Joseph Rowntree, whose sweets have spread from York around the world. He was more interesting than Hornby, a mere engineer while Rowntree was a philanthropist. He worked with drunks in York and wrote a book on social reform that sold 90,000 copies. He founded three Trusts - for Quakers, social problems, and a model village where every villager got a garden with two fruit-trees. The sweet business was taken over by Nestle's, but Terry's name survives, is indeed his one memorial. 'He would hate a statue,' grandson Richard Rowntree believes. Next week, travel-king Thomas Cook, also a philanthropist, though not as keen as his rival Frame, who would make customers sign a no-drink pledge when they booked their excursion tickets. Cook thought the drunks themselves would be enough warning against drink.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (4): Nato still seen as the basis for security - Foreign policy, the country's role as peace-broker has led to new tensions at home There can have been few moments in the near nine decades since Norway gained its independence from Sweden in 1905 when the country's international reputation stood as high as it did last year, when it helped pull off the historic peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The months of providing secret settings for the talks and occasionally sensitive mediation between two of the world's most bitter enemies paid off, not just in the agreement signed on the White House lawn, but also in a burst of goodwill and appreciation for Norway from around the world. It was a reward for a foreign policy long pursued by Norway to be an independent nation, standing outside big power blocks, which, with the help of generous aid contributions, can play a role in promoting peace and stability on a scale beyond its small size and remote northern location. But, at least since the second world war, when Norway was occupied by the Nazis, there has been another side to this coin. With the experience of the war fresh in the nation's mind. and the cold war with the neighbouring Soviet Union deepening, Norway became a founder member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) in 1949. Now, within months of concluding the Israel-PLO accord, Norway has concluded an agreement with Brussels to join the European Union, a step deliberately taken to ensure that the country stands inside the organisation seen as driving long-term political and economic strategy in Europe. The Norwegian electorate has once before rejected membership of the European Community, in a referendum in 1972. As the campaign builds for the new referendum in November, the tension between the two aspects of Norwegian foreign policy are again evident - and could have an effect on the outcome of the vote. 'Norway has a strong tradition of idealism in foreign policy and a weak strain of realpolitik,' says Mr Nils Morten Udgaard, a foreign policy commentator for the daily newspaper Aftenposten. 'What happened in the Middle East is part of the idealistic tradition. If the idealistic tradition becomes too strong, it could suppress those features of realpolitik such as relationships with the large European countries.' The so-called idealistic side of foreign policy identified by Mr Udgaard is certainly strongly in evidence at present. In the Middle East alone, Norway now has nine areas of involvement. These include: chairing a donors group responsible for steering international aid funds to the new Palestinian self-rule authority, and provision of observers helping in the effort to suppress violence in the West Bank town of Hebron. Norway has also been deeply involved in efforts to bring peace to former Yugoslavia, with its former foreign minister, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, acting as the United Nations peace envoy. It has, since 1990, been helping to mediate between the two sides in the internal conflict in Guatemala. Lately, Norway has hosted at least one meeting to probe ways of achieving peace in Sudan. Such involvements have grown out of a Norwegian commitment to providing foreign assistance that has seen aid efforts extended to 100 countries over the past 30 years. Mr Jan Egeland, the deputy foreign minister who was closely involved in the Israel-PLO talks, says the Norwegian method of administering assistance through non-governmental agencies has allowed Oslo to build up trust, and to provide discreet channels of communication between warring parties without involving large numbers of government officials. Those campaigning to keep Norway out of the EU are afraid that this role - and the invaluable international prestige it has won the country - will be jeopardised by joining a union committed to harmonising foreign policy stances. But Mr Egeland insists that this is not so. 'We will not change our foreign policy by joining the EU. There is nothing involved in membership that will stop us taking initiatives for peace and democracy around the world, covert or overt. In fact, joining the EU will be a net gain for us, because we could rely on the networks of the EU, especially in follow-up work.' The government is nevertheless acutely aware that the EU's commitment under the 1991 Maastricht treaty, to work towards common foreign and strategic policies, is regarded with deep suspicion by many Norwegians wedded to Oslo's role as an independent peace-broker. This may seem in conflict with the country's long-established and long-accepted membership of Nato. But Nato membership is seen as a vital element in the country's defence policy, distinct from deeper political involvement in Europe. The government is therefore stressing that Norway wants to see the maintainance of Nato as the key to the country's security, and does not intend to upgrade its current observer status within the Western European Union. 'Norway has two feet - one Atlantic foot and one European foot,' says Mr Egeland. 'This makes us feel very strongly that we need Nato for the Atlantic leg.' Norway, the government argues, must join the EU to be able to influence developments in Europe. 'We should go in to be able to shape events in out part of the world. It is better to sit at the table than to stand out in the hallway,' says Mr Egeland. With a strong currency, low inflation and a relatively small budget deficit, Oslo is also a potential 'core' member of the drive towards a European Monetary Union set out at Maastricht. But talk of any kind of political union is unpopular and played down by the government. 'The problem is,' says Nils Morten Udgaard, of Aftenposten, 'that the decisive issue in the EU debate is solely political, and that is very difficult to sell.'</p>

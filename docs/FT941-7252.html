			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Compulsory job cuts not ruled out - 25,000 jobs to go British Gas executives told union leaders yesterday that no guarantee could be given that there would not be compulsory redundancies over the next five years. That followed news of an additional 5,000 job cuts to the 20,000 job losses announced last November as part of the company's restructuring programme. Union officials said, however, that there would be a serious prospect of industrial action at British Gas if the company went ahead and tried to push through compulsory job losses. Mr Mick Skidmore, a GMB general union official for the gas industry, said last night that the union believed British Gas could only expect to secure around half the redundancies it wanted by voluntary means. 'With a cut as savage as around a third in the size of its labour force we don't believe the company will be able to avoid compulsory redundancies', he added. Mr Skidmore said the unions were still waiting to be told by the company where the job cuts announced last November would come from, although some details at least of the broad sectors of the businesses affected were promised within the next few days. About 2,000 British Gas workers have volunteered so far to take voluntary redundancy, union sources said. Unison, the white-collar union, claimed last night that British Gas planned to shed about 33,000 jobs by 1998 and not the 25,000 it had so far announced. Union officials said they had obtained internal documents from the company that substantiated their claim. These suggest, on the basis of jobs to be allocated to the company's new business units, that its workforce will fall from 66,000 at present to just 32,000 in five years. The documents indicate the numbers employed in service and installation will drop from 22,200 this year to only 9,300 by 1998 while those in transportation and storage will decline from 23,800 to 15,600 over the same period. Other cuts involve nearly halving the workforce in the public gas supply unit from 11,100 to 5,700, a cut in retailing staff from 2,300 to 1,300 and a two thirds reduction in numbers employed in contract gas from 975 to 350.</p>

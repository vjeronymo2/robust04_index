			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Labour plans new regime for auditors LABOUR intends to remove the accountancy institutes' self-regulatory powers over auditors if it comes to power, it emerged yesterday. In an apparent toughening of her previous position, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on City affairs, said Labour planned to transfer auditing regulation to an independent body. 'We think the case is very strong for independence,' she said. The accountancy institutes for England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have been responsible for monitoring and regulating nearly 10,000 accountants who are registered as auditors since the system was set up by the Department of Trade and Industry last year. Ms Mowlam's statement corroborates a document circulated to prospective parliamentary candidates by her office some months ago which included a proposal to regulate auditors independently of the professional institutes. She said there was a common perception that the institutes were not independent but acted more as trade associations. 'I don't believe their track record suggests the kind of independence we would like to see,' she said. She added that she would not take any action until the end of this year, when the first annual report on audit regulation will be submitted to the DTI by the institutes. One possible body to take over the regulatory function is the Accounting Standards Board, but Ms Mowlam cautioned that it also required greater openness in decision-making and wider representation on its board. The Standards Board is funded and staffed by accountants. News of the proposals came as a surprise to the professional institutes yesterday. They maintain that self-regulation by accountants is the most effective way to police auditors. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: 'We need a chance to demonstrate that the new regulation system is working before anyone pulls up the plant by the roots.' Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night called for greater involvement by investors, brokers and analysts in the work of the Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing Practices Board to help raise the standards of corporate reporting. Recent company failures had highlighted weaknesses in company accounts but the accounts should not be 'the beginning and end of assessing a company's position,' he said.</p>

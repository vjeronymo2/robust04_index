			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly  failed to approve the newly appointed prime minister Thursday,  the last day of the extraordinary session, but decided to extend  the session by one day to try again.    At 11:15 p.m. Thursday, Speaker Yi Man-sop tabled a motion  on  approving the presidential appointment of Yi Yong-tok as prime  minister and an opposition proposal that all members of the  cabinet resign, but the plenary session could not vote because  of an opposition filibuster.    With eight minutes left until the session's official  adjournment at 11:52 p.m., the speaker acted on an opposition  Democratic Party motion and extended the session by one day.    The National Assembly, hindered by disagreement between the  ruling and opposition parties, could not break the current  impasse as it refused to approve the new prime minister unless  plans for parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal  are approved at the same time.    The major stumbling block for the Sangmudae plans was an  opposition demand to call 51 witnesses, including former  presidents and current chief executive Kim Yong-sam, to testify  in the Assembly. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party opposes  the motion.    Another opposition proposal demanding the resignation of the  entire cabinet was scrapped in accordance with the National  Assembly law that calls for parliamentary action within 72 hours  of a proposal.    Since the Kim administration could not obtain parliamentary  approval of the new prime minister, the expected appointment of  Yi Yong-tok's successor as deputy prime minister and head of the  National Unification Board, as well as a possible limited  reshuffle of the cabinet, will likely be delayed by one day.    Because of the political impasse at the National Assembly,  the Kim administration has been without a cabinet administrator  for one week.    The ruling and opposition parties plan to continue their  negotiations Friday on the Sangmudae scam investigation. If  they can work out a compromise Friday, the National Assembly  will vote on the new prime minister before acting on the  Sangmudae scam probe plans.    But the prospect of the rival parties agreeing on the  Sangmudae scandal was still uncertain Friday morning.    The Democratic Party wants the National Assembly to  investigate the Sangmudae scam, in which the president of a  construction company created a slush fund out of the proceeds of  the project for moving military facilities called Sangmudae in  Kwangju to the city's outskirts.    The opposition party claims that part of the slush fund  eventually was funnelled into the ruling party as campaign funds  during the 1992 presidential election.</p>

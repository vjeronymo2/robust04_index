			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Krasnenker, LogoVAZ director, by Yu. </F> Skidanov: "Why Ladas Are Cheaper: Encountering Market Laws,  LogoVAZ Chooses New Priorities"]    [Text] While everything else has been getting more  expensive, LogoVAZ declared a price reduction on its automobiles  made at the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant (VAZ). A month has passed  since then. Has this pricing policy been vindicated, given the  situation of galloping inflation? Responding to this question is  the director of LogoVAZ for the Zhiguli, Aleksandr  Krasnenker.    [Krasnenker] The February price reduction had a tangible  economic effect: today we are selling about 100 automobiles per  day. This was the choice: either drive up prices for VAZes sky  high and take our income from the sale of 15-20 automobiles a  day, or else win at the expense of large turnover, selling  automobiles at relatively affordable prices. We chose the  latter. And we weren't wrong. LogoVAZ is selling about 30,000  automobiles a year, which is equal to about 10 percent of VAZ's  production program for the countries of the former Union. We  have offices operating in more than 20 cities of the  CIS--Moscow, St. Petersburg, Bishkek. . . .    [TRUD] Nevertheless, currency prices for Zhigulis and Ladas  are quite high.    [Krasnenker] That depends on what you compare them to. If  you  buy an automobile from just anyone at a used car lot or at some  dubious street outlet, you are scarcely safeguarded against all  the various troubles you might have. Unfortunately, virtually  everything connected with automobiles here is thickly overgrown  with crime. Purchasing a car from LogoVAZ eliminates very many  of the most likely troubles you might have.    People know that. I will list only some of the benefits to  our buyers. First of all, our cars come with an 18-month factory  warranty. We guarantee complete security for our clients. It is  no secret, after all, that if you get a new automobile from some  middleman, you might barely be out of the parking spot when you  fall into the hands of thugs acting in collusion. Furthermore,  we can provide delivery of a car to virtually any point in the  CIS, and if an enterprise or commercial structure purchases a  good-sized lot of cars, we can offer a discount of up to $1000  per vehicle.    [TRUD] Recently I spent some time at the Honda factories in  Japan and was interested there in how they work with clients.  Simple things amazed me: the buyer is always right. They love  him. And they emphasize this in all sorts of ways, starting with  a cup of coffee while they are discussing the purchase of one  make of automobile or other and ending with advice about what  upholstery to choose for the interior. Why doesn't it work like  this here? Is it because LogoVAZ has a virtual monopoly on the  sale of automobiles and you are not stimulated by healthy  competition?    [Krasnenker] We're doing fine as far as competition goes, I  assure you. There are dozens of small firms trading in Volga  motor vehicles. But people come to us. Why? Because for the same  money we offer many advantages in the purchase of an automobile.  I'm not going to talk about coffee, like at Honda, but here, for  example, following the example of Western leaders, we are  learning how to do custom work, gaining in quality of service,  maximal good will toward the customer, and our ability to solve  his problems. When you buy an automobile you can order, "without  walking away from the cashier," additional equipment, an  anti-theft device, anti-corrosion treatment, car cassette-radio,  and so on. If you live, let's say, in Bishkek, again, then you  can buy any model VAZ through your local LogoVAZ office. They  will get it to you within an agreed-upon length of time. This is  the system for custom work.    Moreover, LogoVAZ specialists continue to pay attention to  the car you buy even after the sale, unlike, say, the so-called  re-export models. Think about the way people used to buy  automobiles: once you had driven out of the gates, no one cared  about your problems anymore. Should a serious defect be  uncovered immediately after the purchase of the car, LogoVAZ  makes an effort to resolve these problems without additional  payment. You see, the time has passed when people bought  automobiles indiscriminately, following the principle, "Thank  God I got it." Now there is choice; the automobile market is  well saturated. The only way you can be successful is by  improving service.    [TRUD] Or "lobbying," for instance. Let us recall the recent  introduction of draconian duties on imported automobiles.    [Krasnenker] Some people would really like to ascribe that  service to the VAZ structures. But let's reason logically.  LogoVAZ sells more than just Zhigulis; we have plenty of other  lines as well--Volvo, Mercedes, Honda, used foreign makes, and  so forth. Therefore, the new duties raised definite problems  around the sale of those automobiles. Taking these circumstances  into account, it is hard to see your suggestions as convincing.  Moreover, VAZ automobiles don't need that kind of protection on  the domestic market. Yes, you can find many advantages to  foreign models. But for our roads, for our oil and gasoline,  Ladas are better adapted. A VAZ can be repaired in virtually any  city in Russia or the CIS, and any driver can give advice even  on the highway about how to take care of a problem. With foreign  makes, you'll agree, this is somewhat harder to do.    [TRUD] We know that the auto industry in Russia, and AvtoVAZ  in particular, are not experiencing the best of times. Nor is it  any secret that investment in the development of transportation  is highly profitable. This is obviously why the state, through  the Aeroflot bank, has directed 1.7 trillion credit rubles into  the reconstruction of the Moscow airports and updating air  transport. Would this kind of policy be justified with respect  to automobile building?    [Krasnenker] Certainly. It could achieve a long-term  economic  effect. LogoVAZ and especially the Zhiguli management are  operating on a commercial basis, so we rely on our own forces.  We are interested in improving quality and updating models for  VAZ automobiles. For this to happen regularly takes extensive  investments. Naturally, as world experience shows, these  expenditures are repaid with interest, allowing, apart from  everything else, for an update in technology and production all  along the chain of plants that tie in to the production of an  automobile. This means dozens of major enterprises. It is just  this kind of approach that has the right to be called an  economically regulated policy. I think that sooner or later the  manager of state credits is going to reach a similar conclusion.  It would be good for this to happen sooner, though. After all,  the rate at which Zhigulis are bought up is very high; demand  for this make is not falling.    The telephone numbers for the LogoVAZ showroom in Moscow are  249-00-51, 546-07-80, and 140-52-31.</p>

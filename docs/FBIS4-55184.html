			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by Arijana Saracevic in Sarajevo  on 10 May -- recorded]    [Text] [[Saracevic] I would like to start by asking you  what we can expect from the talks in Vienna.    [Izetbegovic] The talks have been accompanied by many  difficulties. The fact that they have already been going for  four days shows that things are moving slowly. Anyway, this is  not surprising if one knows how difficult the problems on the  agenda are -- above all, the problem of the cantons. This is a  very complex issue and, as you know, everyone was trying to  avoid it, but it eventually had to be dealt with. There is also  the problem of the future government of the federation -- that  is, its structure and the allocation of cabinet posts. We also  have to deal with the issue of free movement and free passage  for our refugees. Finally, there is this issue of the  presidency; who will be the first president? The two sides have  differing views on this issue.    [Saracevic] It seems that the issue of the presidency of the  federation is the most disputed one. At least, that is the  impression one gets from the media.    [Izetbegovic] That seems to be the case from the Croatian  point of view. They have been forcing this issue from the very  beginning as the most important problem. That is why they came  here on several occasions. I want to tell our public that from  our point of view this is the least important issue when  compared with the other problems I have just mentioned. We  believe that it is much more important to draw up the correct  maps of the cantons, to avoid any mistakes. Such mistakes would  be permanent and incorrigible.    We also have to open the roads and let the refugees return.  Our refugees are facing great difficulties when travelling  through Croatia. Croatia introduced visas several days ago.  Some people get them, and some do not, even though the main  wave of refugees is yet to come. Individuals are having  problems at the Croatian border and they are forced to go back.  This stops the process of their return. This issue is very  important for us and we have placed it at the very top of the  agenda. We have said: Let us solve the important issues -- the  cantons, the fair allocation of government posts, roads,  refugees.    As far as the presidency issue is concerned we are even  prepared to make a concession. This means that we will not  insist on a Bosniak president. This will probably surprise our  public, but we think that the other four issues are much more  important. If the Croats are flexible over this we will be  flexible over the fifth issue, all the more so because we have  proposed a six-month mandate. According to the Constitution the  mandate of the first president of the federation should last  until the elections, which should be called within six months.  However, if the elections were not held within six months there  would be a rotating presidency.    [Saracevic] In your view, can we expect any progress in  Vienna?    [Izetbegovic] I think that we can, although I was told a  little while ago that difficulties still remained and that the  Croats were in a hurry and wanted to finish the talks this  evening. To tell you the truth, judging by the situation last  night -- I have been in contact two or three times a day either  with Ganic or with Silajdzic -- well, it cannot all be solved  today. However, the Croats have indicated that they only have  today to talk because of some other obligations tomorrow and  that all should be finalized this evening. Whether this pressure  of time will in some way help to make a breakthrough in the  current stalemate over some of the issues, we will see.  Probably as early as this evening we will know how things  stand. My view is that they will probably extend the talks  until late this evening and will finish this evening. I am an  optimist, [word indistinct] problems must be resolved. Our view  is that the Washington agreement must be implemented. I told  our delegation that if they needed to talk for another three,  four, or even five days -- we must be prepared to oblige to put  all the problems behind us. However, the Croats do not seem to  be prepared to extend the talks for another two or three days.    [Saracevic] Will the proposals for appointments in the  future  federation be settled in Vienna?    [Izetbegovic] If you mean names, I do not think that that  should be tackled [in Vienna]. That is something that calls for  consultations with all political parties and relevant assembly  [parliamentary] commissions, to weigh everything. It was my  view, at least it was my suggestion, that no names should be  named in Vienna.    [Saracevic] Who are the main personalities (you are counting  on) in the future federation?    [Izetbegovic] Well, these are first the three current vice  presidents of the [Muslim] SDA [Party of Democratic Action]:  Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicakcic. Then come the government  ministers who have passed their political tests: For instance,  that man Bukvic [deputy prime minister], Faruk Smailbegovic,  Munever Imamovic, Dr. Kreso, let me not go on listing any more  names, well, there is also Hadzihasanovic, and so forth -- there  is, in other words, a number of ministers who had an effect in  the preceding period. This was all about the government. As  for the soldiers, I should mention the corps commanders and no  one else. In the case of the corps commander, an injustice has  been done, which should be undone: [Words indistinct] generals  and brigadiers and [word indistinct] generals, while our corps  commanders are not generals, some of them have the rank of  brigadier, they have worked hard to carry out their tasks. They  have not had it easy. When it comes to the soldiers and army  personnel, I want to single out the corps commanders.    [Saracevic] You have been spending a great deal of time  with soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Mr President,  there has been a lot of talk recently about the fund for  invalids of the war and the families of the Islamic martyrs  [sehidi].    [Izetbegovic] We shall form a state institution, which will  probably be called the Ministry for War Veterans Affairs. It is  high time that the question of soldiers was resolved in a  systematic way. This issue has been completely neglected. We  have been busy worrying about the war, worrying about things  hanging over us, but unfortunately, cases of Islamic martyrs and  their families, war invalids etc are also hanging over us.  Although it cannot be said that they are not at all being cared  for, there has been no systematic care. They cannot see any  future prospects for themselves. The invalids do not know what  will happen to them once the war is over. What will happen with  the families of the Islamic martyrs when the war ends?    There is often no justice. Soldiers, fighters are the focus  of attention now, but they will not be during peace. People  fear that perhaps profiteers will come then. Perhaps you  remember a story, a novel which says: In the time of war you  have first soldiers, then sergeants, low ranking officers,  officers, generals, admirals, speculators etc, and in the time  of peace it is the other way around -- first speculators,  profiteers, etc. and fighters come at the end. Fighters, of  course, have well-justified fear of this.    So, this ministry is to be formed. I arrived at the idea,  some two or three days ago, when Dr Velayati gave me a check for  one $1 million. I asked him what it should be spent on. They  said: This is up to you, you must see what is most urgent. It  seems to me that the most urgent need is to provide for the  invalids of war and the families of fighters. Then I thought a  bit more about it, and concluded that perhaps we should set up a  fund, independent of the government, which would become a  permanent institution. This fund would, independently from the  state, provide for these people. It would not be a bad idea if  the two were linked, so that we also have a state institution,  and permanent care provided, where citizens would also take  part. It would provide for invalids financially and it would  also initiate the adoption of appropriate regulations. We now  want to pass a regulation which would state that in our  diplomatic and consular missions abroad, invalids will have  priority when applying for jobs. This means that healthy people  would gradually be replaced, let them come back here and do  something else.    This fund could take care of these issues -- what could be  done for our people who suffered most. These people are the  biggest victims, apart from those who lost their lives. They  and the families of the dead. I have thought about setting up  this fund. I would like to be the head of the fund. I would  like to form a committee, consisting of prominent people --  [writer] Alija Isakovic and some other ones. This would be a  public institution which would be accountable to the public and  would raise funds. I would help the war invalids to overcome  their problems, to get artificial limbs, to get treatment, to  get employment. [words indistinct]    I am working on this and I would be happy to end my career  as  a man who cares and leave the burden to some younger people.  That is a big burden for my age, and I would like to gradually  pass it on to somebody younger. I would like to take care of  these issues relating to the war invalids and the families of  the Islamic martyrs.    [Saracevic] Let me ask you finally, do you expect to see  President Tudjman in Sarajevo soon?    [Izetbegovic] I do not believe we will see each other soon.  There was an initiative for me to visit Split. He allegedly has  difficulties in coming to Sarajevo -- technical difficulties  because UNPROFOR cannot guarantee his safety. Then he invited  me to Split; I really would not mind this trip and talks in  Split. However, as you can see, I have been left here in Bosnia  to hold the fort because Silajdzic, Ganic, and many others are  abroad. That is why I have to be in Sarajevo and I do not  believe that we shall see each other soon. However, the  invitation to Tudjman remains open and we expect his arrival.  Well, I hope he will settle these problems with UNPROFOR.    [Saracevic] Thank you for this interview, Mr. President.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scottish TV nearly doubled at Pounds 2.2m SCOTTISH TELEVISION yesterday announced improved pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m against Pounds 1.16m for the half year to June 30. 'In a period when trading conditions throughout the country stubbornly refused to improve these results are very satisfactory,' Mr Bill Brown, the chairman, said. There was a rise in programme sales from Pounds 7.73m to Pounds 9.5m and underlying costs in the main television business continued to fall, the company said. Scottish benefited from a reduction in the Exchequer Levy from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 549,000, but there was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 2m to pay for voluntary early leavers and redundancies. Scottish, which retained its franchise unopposed with an annual bid of Pounds 2,000, said that it had been using this year for intensive preparation for the new 10-year licence period which begins in January. 'With the substantial reduction in our cost base we shall be able to take full advantage of the favourable conditions on which the licence was obtained,' Mr Brown said. Despite the depths of the recession, Scottish said its full-year result would be substantially ahead of last year's Pounds 8.6m. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, is forecasting Pounds 13.5m after Pounds 4m in exceptionals. Scottish believes that ITV will continue to be the most watched channel despite growing competition and that there will be real growth in airtime sales income across the decade. Turnover at Pounds 57.2m was up from Pounds 52.1m. Earnings per share rose from 1.6p to 2.9p and the interim dividend is lifted from an adjusted 1.4375p to 1.725p. Turnover at the company's main non-television business, the Pauline Hyde outplacement agency, rose from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 4.66m. Although the result was in line with expectations Scottish Television's share price closed yesterday 21p down on the day at 418p.</p>

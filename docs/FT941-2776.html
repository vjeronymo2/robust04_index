			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (6): High road, low road The reform of local government may spark more opportunities for the private sector: the new smaller unitary authorities will not have the capacity to take over from the large regional councils in maintaining principal roads. Some of these roads are likely to become government-managed trunk roads. It is not yet clear how maintenance of this bigger trunk network will be organised, but the government may want to expand routine maintenance contracts into more ambitious maintenance and management contracts. It is possible to envisage a contracting consortium building a road and delivering it ready to operate (a national road charging system would allow payment according to how quickly the road was ready for traffic), followed by a management contract with another consortium. Current government thinking means that, probably, the element of risk-sharing would be increased. New road schemes are being explored - a potentially large amount of road building, given the size of Scotland's trunk network. Four consortia are interested in building a second Forth Bridge - the need for which is a matter of some controversy. Any new bridge would be associated with improved road and other transport links from the bridges and the airport to Edinburgh. A new road link between the M8 Glasgow-Edinburgh motorway and the main M74/M6 cross-border road is also under consideration, together with improvements to the Kincardine Bridge across the Forth between Edinburgh and Stirling. Another potential opportunity is the proposed national driver information system for Scotland (the government is currently engaged in a consultation exercise about this). Upgrading of the electronic information system around Glasgow is proposed, and the creation of a new system in the Edinburgh area. Officials claim that the Scottish Office's integrated structure allows it to plan important road developments without the tensions surrounding similar schemes under discussion in Whitehall.</p>

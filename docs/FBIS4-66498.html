A number of condolence messages and statements,  denouncing the barbarous crime and the crusade of hatred, which  the fundamentalists are waging against Algeria and its citizens,  have been received by our editorial department. Most are from  anonymous citizens, like the young people of Tizi-Ouzou (Said  and Mouloud) who in their message of condolence call on  democrats and republicans to form a "united front against  fascist, fundamentalist barbarism..."    Two women's associations, RAFD [Algerian Rally of Women  for Democracy] and AFEPEC [Women's Association for Personal  Growth and Exercise of Citizenship], also made their views  known.    The only political party to speak out, in a long  statement from which we reprint extensive extracts below, was  the Ettahaddi movement--faithful as ever to its  antifundamentalist position and its struggle for republican  values.  <H5>  A Citizen Reacts [Article by Farida Ramse] </H5>   Abdelkader Alloula is gone. A man of culture, an Algerian of  talent and integrity, is with us no more. Another name has been  added to the grim roster of the victims of terrorism. Another  chapter of Algeria's history is written in blood. But our  politicians remain indifferent and do nothing to stop the  terrorism. And what does it mean, the silence of the  politicians, the absence of initiatives? Are the politicians  completely powerless to change the situation? What exactly have  they done? With every passing day, more men and women are  shamefully assassinated by villainous outlaws; not even children  are spared. The Algerian people are groaning in agony. Fear and  terror reign in the streets, homes, and schools.    No, no, no! Too much, it's too much! How can we tolerate the  wholesale slaughter of innocents at the hands of blind  fundamentalism? We have never really mourned our dead: We have  mourned only our own weaknesses.    But the majority of Algeria's citizens, myself included,  have expressed firm resolve to put an end to these terrorists  and to proclaim loud and forcefully, to their supposed  protector, that a policy driven by terrorism is unacceptable.  They have argued, time and again, that these terrorist tactics  are a distortion of authentic Islam and have openly condemned  the extremists, whose narrow economic and political interests  are so thinly veiled.    The Algerian people have suffered enough. They bear the  scars  of crimes perpetrated by those who were their adversary in the  past and remain their enemy today. The people aspire for peace,  in justice and freedom. To realize that hope, they are calling  on all patriots to insist that the regime put an end to all  efforts to destroy national unity, unmask the destabilizers  trying to exploit civil turmoil, and put an end to the massacre  of Algeria and Algerians.  <H5>  Ettahaddi Movement </H5>   The slender thread of hope for the survival of our brother  Abdelkader Alloula has been severed. One of the nation's  irreplaceable cultural and artistic treasures has been shattered.    This is what fundamentalism is really about, for nothing but  violence and extremism can result from its totalitarian,  obscurantist ideology. No so-called tactical concessions, no  conciliatory gestures, no rhetoric of appeasement will change  its fascist, dictatorial, and warlike character.    Honorable, patriotic Algerians will not forget that at a  time  when assassinations are taking the lives of its writers and  poets, of thinkers and scientists, of white-collar and  blue-collar workers, of men and women who reject fundamentalist  oppression and terror, almost the entire political class and  certain coteries within the regime are behaving with  ever-increasing cowardice and irresponsibility in their efforts  to absolve and rehabilitate the Islamist parties and their  criminal leaders.    Algerian patriots will not forget the work and struggle of  Abdelkader Alloula. They will honor his memory and that of those  before him who gave their lives for the preservation of the  state and the defense of democratic, republican, and progressive  values.    The Ettahaddi movement calls on the population of Oran and  the surrounding region, indeed on all Algerian men and women who  want their children to have a future of dignity and freedom, to  make the funeral services for A. Alloula a great occasion of  mobilization against fundamentalist terrorism, its instigators,  and its protectors. It is still waiting for the authorities to  quit shirking their responsibility. Algiers, 14 March 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of  the National Unification Board [NUB], said today during a  reunification advisory meeting held at the secretariat of  North-South talks in Samchong-tong that the nuclear issue is not  an easy one because North Korea is using the nuclear issue to  simultaneously carry out its plan for its regime's survival, as  well as its policy on South Korea, and that the issue will be  resolved in a phased manner through well-intentioned pressure  [sonuiui amnyok].    Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the NUB, stressed in a  government report that the ultimate goal of the resolution of  the nuclear issue is to block North Korea from developing  nuclear weapons and to completely abolish the weapons if North  Korea came to possess them. He added that along with the  International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection, efforts will be  exerted for the resumption of South-North dialogue to implement  the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Serp i Molot General Director </F> Nikolay Izvekov by B. Dmitriyev under the rubric "Rumors"; place  and date not given: "'Serp i Molot' Is Doing Fine"]    [Text] There are a lot of rumors everywhere. Including in  Moscow. Just recently, for instance, it was said that one of the  largest Moscow plants--Serp i Molot--is about to be shut down.  Well, rumors they may be, but the workers became concerned: Are  we being thrown out onto the street? It is not difficult to  guess what panic may cause at an enterprise. Who benefits from  inflaming the situation? MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent posed  this question to Serp i Molot General Director Nikolay Izvekov.    "I have to disappoint the sensation lovers: Nothing terrible  is happening at the plant," Nikolay Yakovlevich said. "On the  contrary, after a certain decline in production, it is on the  rise again. Although, of course, we have our share of problems.  We had some unpleasant things happening before the plant  stockholders' meeting. Somebody was spreading the most  outrageous rumors that the enterprise had been sold to "third  parties." In reality, outside companies, which are the source of  the rumors, did attempt to buy a controlling share of Serp i  Molot stock. For instance, ChIF [voucher investment fund]  Partnerstvo purchased at preferential prices from plant  employees about 15,000 shares and attempted to place their man  on the board of directors. Fortunately, we managed to keep  outside commercial operators from participating in running the  metallurgical plant, where incompetent people are simply  dangerous. Actually, I can tell you with certainty that  Partnerstvo has little interest in our production. What attracts  this firm is a different juicy morsel--huge commercial space  that may be used as warehouses..."    According to Nikolay Izvekov, after unsuccessful attempts to  place themselves on the plant joint-stock company's board of  directors, the investment fund management began sowing panic  among employees. In addition, clearly paid-for articles about  the plant's unstable situation appeared in the "yellow" press.    "Right now we need to reassure the workers," continue  Nikolay  Yakovlevich. "Because there are no serious reasons for concern.  We are working successfully, installing state-of-the-art  technologies, and are not even considering selling any of the  plant's property. And anyway, how could one of the plants most  needed in the country be sold? If we stop production, the entire  radio, automotive, and watch-making industry will immediately  grind to a halt. Everybody needs high-quality steel, which is  produced at only two or three enterprises in Russia."    Unfortunately a small part of the collective did fall for  the  temptation offered by commercial operators and sold their stock.  However, in the opinion of the Serp i Molot management, the  block of shares purchased by ChIF Partnerstvo is several times  smaller than the controlling share. So there is no reason to  worry. The metallurgical giant still belongs to the workers and  produces the output we all need.</p>

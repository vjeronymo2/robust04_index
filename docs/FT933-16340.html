			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Ireland blocks EC aid package THE 12 European Community member states were early this morning at odds over how to divide up the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) structural aid and regional development budget for 1994-99, with Ireland blocking an outline agreement broadly accepted by its partners. As each country tried to secure more EC funds, the larger member states also launched an assault on the European Commission's right to decide how money for the Community's industrially stricken regions is to be allocated. Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which this week took over the EC presidency, said that 'either we reach a timely decision, or we betray our jobless and break the promises of Edinburgh', where EC heads of government decided on the development package last December. Ireland and the Netherlands threatened to veto any agreement on disbursing the largest amount of development aid in EC history unless they received guarantees on the share they want. At 3.30am, the Irish government decided to block a deal because it had been offered IPounds 7.5bn, against the IPounds 8bn prime minister Albert Reynolds insists he was promised at Edinburgh. Germany, Italy and the four poorest member states - Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland - had earlier insisted that the eligibility threshold for Objective 1, which includes the most deprived regions, be held at 75 per cent of average per capita EC income. These regions will get Ecu96.3bn, plus the Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund, which is for the four poorest countries, on the most flexible terms reserved for the Community's most backward areas. The Commission wants Objective 1 status for Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands and Islands, in the UK, Hainault in southern Belgium, and Cantabria in northern Spain, even though they are above the 75 per cent limit. Fierce negotiations early this morning looked certain to add to this list. The French area of Valenciennes and Sambre-Avesnois adjoining Hainault  -even though it is not a region - Argyll, Bute and West Moray in Scotland, the Spanish Canary Islands and the Portugal and Madeira and the Azores are the new beneficiaries. This will almost certainly be approved, to preserve a 1988 political deal making Northern Ireland and Corsica eligible for the most generous funding. Since then, Corsica has effectively set a new eligibility benchmark, by raising its per capita income to 79 per cent of the EC average. The areas proposed by the Commission are just inside this. Germany, France and the UK were seeking to deny the Commission the right to decide on 'Objective 2' areas - those regions in industrial decline. In addition, the UK was blocking Brussels' plans to spend part of the package's money for training the unemployed or retraining workers who are in danger of losing jobs because of industrial restructuring.

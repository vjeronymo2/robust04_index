			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- Carl-Dieter Spranger,  German minister of economic cooperation, who has been in Romania  for a few days now and had multiple contacts, was received by  Romanian President Ion Iliescu on 6 May evening.    At the close of the interview President Iliescu termed the  Romanian-German relations as increasingly good, saying Germany  was the country that understood the best Romania's difficulties  caused by the processes of transformation that resembled those  of the former GDR. "We have found with Germany a more exact  perception of our problems in the process of transition," the  Romanian head of state said.    As far as the economic relations between the two countries  were concerned, the president pointed to the existence of mutual  interests, explaining that both Romania and Germany were located  "on the Rhine-Main-Danube trans-European axis, with two  terminals, Rotterdam and Constanta, and with the German economy  at the center, which will be the engine of the general process  of the European integration."    The German guest noted the good level of the bilateral  relations. "I believe the reforms these last few years in  Romania, and especially the situation after 1993 can stir the  interest of foreign investors," he said.    The German minister of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter  Spranger met on Friday, 6 May, in Bucharest with the Romanian  minister of state, head of the Council for Economic  Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, Mircea Cosea.    Within his presentation of the Romanian economy, Mircea  Cosea  said that Romania was giving a very special attention to its  relations with Germany, because there existed a tradition of  German industry presence in Romania in the sectors of railroads,  iron and steel industry, and telecommunications. The Romanian  minister expressed hope that Romania would benefit from German  aid of capital and technology in the process of reform. Cosea  said that the German business mentality could be a very  important factor in the process of reform.    The German minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said his visit was  a  signal for the extending of the relations with Romania. The  signing of the agreement on the non-reimbursable economic  assistance granted to Romania is a relevant sign, said the  German minister.    Minister Spranger said that Germany would send in Romania  experts in privatization, banking system updating, stock  exchanges, industrial restructuring, and social protection.    Romania is interested in developing a proper collaboration  framework with Germany, that should allow for the presence of  German businessmen here, the setting up of joint ventures, as  well as the intensification of the actions of cooperation and  commercial exchanges, said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu on 6 May, during his interview with Carl-Dieter  Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation of Germany.  The Romanian premier assessed that the signing of the technical  assistance agreement between the two countries was part of the  preoccupations to improve the management of the commercial  companies and update and retool the industrial units, especially  those built with German technology.    Minister Spranger said Germany would further back Romania's  efforts in the European Union, the OECD [Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development], and the World Bank.  Referring to the German minority in Romania, Spranger said the  Romanian state's policy with respect to that community was  favorably regarded in his country.</p>

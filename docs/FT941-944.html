			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Storm grows over tax increases Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday attacked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saying tax rises would be nearly twice as much as he said. The storm over the tax rises gathered momentum as Labour accused the chancellor of pulling the wool over people's eyes about the increases. Ms Harman said the average impact on households would be Pounds 10 a week and not Pounds 5.75 as Mr Clarke said. Ms Harman said: 'People will have to pay Pounds 500 more in tax from April. They will be dismayed to see that they cannot trust the chancellor to tell the truth about taxes.' She said she thought the chancellor's Pounds 5.75 figure must include people who were unemployed and not therefore paying income tax or National Insurance. Mr Clarke said concerns about the tax rises were 'exaggerated' and would probably be forgotten in two months. Those frightened by reports about the size of the increases would find they were not as bad as they expected. Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record, he said the average impact, taken across all households, would be about Pounds 5.75 a week, but this figure would vary enormously according to individual circumstances. On Saturday he told the Conservative central council in Plymouth that this was equivalent to 'about three or four pints of beer a week.' Mr Clarke dismissed claims that the tax rises would stall the recovery. Brushing aside claims that consumer confidence was faltering, the chancellor said business confidence was much higher than a year ago and growth was 'getting stronger all the time'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] rebels have stepped up their attacks and shelling  of the city of Cuito in the past 24 hours. Government forces  remain determined to defend the martyred civilians.    Between 2100 on 31 May and dawn today, UNITA fired more than  1,500 shells at the city of Cuito. Attacks were also carried  out in just about every corner of the city, with government  defensive lines coming under intense fire. UNITA has  strengthened its positions that keep the city under siege. The  aim is to storm the city of Cuito before the Lusaka talks end.  Troops from Andulo continue to move around the city to once  again try to fulfill what Mr. Savimbi often refers to as the  final assault. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, in Moxico Province, UNITA raided the [name  indistinct] Ward, 18 km north of the city of Luena at dawn  today. The ward was set alight and 153 civilians were left  homeless. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint dividend warning Shares in HunterPrint fell 9 1/2 p to 37 1/2 p yesterday as the specialist printer announced that it had no distributable reserves and so would not be able to pay a dividend on its convertible preference shares in the year to September 30 1993. However, this was not entirely unexpected because in July the group had announced that it was unlikely to return to the black at the annual stage, although the results would 'reflect a marked improvement over the previous year'. That news prompted a 5p fall in the shares to 45p. The July warning followed shortly after another announcement when HunterPrint revealed that talks with a possible bidder had ended inconclusively. This had sparked a 17p decline in the share price to 50p. In the six months to March 31, the group turned pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.85m into profits of Pounds 330,000. In December it underwent its second refinancing in two years. This included a Pounds 20m placing and offer.</p>

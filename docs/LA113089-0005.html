			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T THROW CAUTION TO THE WINDS  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's long night of repression seems to be ending as its embattled  Communist Party, shaken by the general strike last Monday that saw as many as  half of the country's 15 million people take to the streets, watches its  authority and control ooze away. The official concessions and promises tumble  out one after another, as astonishing in their substance as in their  suddenness: A new coalition government by the weekend. An end to the Communist  Party's monopoly on power. No more obligatory university courses in  Marxism-Leninism. Free elections within a year.  </P> <P> This at least is how things appear after 10 remarkable days of protest and  challenge. Certainly it is what the mass of Czechoslovaks want. Maybe the  appearance will in fact quickly prove to be the reality as a demoralized  Communist leadership, finally forced to acknowledge its miserably minuscule  popular appeal, gets ready for genuine power sharing -- and for the elections  that will almost certainly see it rejected.  </P> <P> But a sense of caution is not out of place. Drastic changes have been promised;  they have yet to be nailed down. The party, especially those top leaders who  rode into office in 1968 almost literally atop invading Soviet tanks, might yet  fight to hold on to what it has.  </P> <P> Amid all the euphoria, several disturbing signs stand out. The 250,000-man  army, opposition leaders say, has been confined to barracks since the  anti-regime protests began, reportedly cut off from news of what has been going  on and subjected to indoctrination from political officers. To what end?  </P> <P> At the same time the 60,000 members of the People's Militia, the party's  paramilitary armed guard, remains in service -- and under the command of the  party's top leaders. As professionals serving the state, the army might refuse  orders to fire on protesting Czechoslovaks; the militia might have no such  scruples because if the party leadership goes down, the militia goes down, too.  </P> <P> These concerns may well be unfounded. The move toward political pluralism and  freedom could roll on unimpeded. The party's retreat may in fact be the rout  that it appears to be, rather than a tactical withdrawal to a stronger  defensive posi- tion. All who cherish freedom and respect what the people of  Czechoslovakia have had to endure must hope so. But all must be alert to other  possibilities.  </P></p>

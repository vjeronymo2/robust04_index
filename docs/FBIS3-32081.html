Raul congratulated the teachers and students  for a rewarding cultural performance, which included scenes of  contemporary relevance as well as epidoses from the wars of  independence.    Later on, Raul met with Emilia Betancourt, president of the  Oriente Rebelde People's Council, who told Raul that the local  economy depends primarily on milk production, two Basic  Cooperative Production Units, two credit and service  cooperatives, and one farming cooperative. She added that  self-sufficiency in vegetable and meat production is being  promoted. Raul mentioned that Fidel had visited the area in  November. Betancourt also told Raul about efforts to expand  domestic fish farming in minidams and water tanks.    The tour included the Oriente Mill, the most well preserved  in Cuba, which is being restored as a sugar industry museum.  Raul also viewed the plaque marking two important historic  moments: Ignacio Agramonte's uprising, and General Maximo Gomez'  battle camp in 1896.    Omar del Risco, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Sibanicu, gave Raul a detailed briefing on the potential  of fish farming as a food resource and added that there are  plans to attain 500 metric tons of fish in 1994.    Raul also talked with fishing Vice Minister Enrique Oltuski,  who pointed out that compliance with technical specifications  will allow the region to produce large quantities of fish. Raul  stressed the rationality of the minidam program because it  produces higher yields within a smaller area and brings the food  closer to the consumers. Politburo member Julian Rizo agreed  with Raul, adding that 7,000 liters of milk are distributed  within Camaguey without the need for long-distance transport.    Raul concluded that he will follow up on the development of  this program, which will undoubtedly contribute to increasing  food supplies for the people. He noted that this experience  should be made available to other municipalities in the country.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BIL's Gibbs Mew bid lapses after purchase Brierley Investments' Pounds 11m hostile bid for Gibbs Mew, which hinged on the target's acquisition of a wholesale drinks distributor not being approved, lapsed last night as Gibbs shareholders gave their blessing to the UK D purchase. In the Salisbury-based brewing and commercial property group's extraordinary meeting the resolution to approve the acquisition was passed. Irrevocable undertakings for 51.9 per cent of Gibbs Mew's equity had been received by September 23. Gibbs Mew is 59 per cent family-owned. UK D is to be bought for an initial Pounds 2.33m in loan notes and shares with a further profits-related consideration of Pounds 540,000 in shares. In July when BIL, which holds stakes in Budgens, the supermarket chain, Alvis, the defence contractor, and Mount Charlotte, the hotels group, mooted launching a bid for the 80.3 per cent of Gibbs Mew that it did not already own, it made several pre-conditions. They included Gibbs Mew's activities continuing as normal, making no disposals or acquisitions and not issuing or allotting any shares.</p>

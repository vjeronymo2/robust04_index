			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPUTERIZED SIGN AUTHORIZED FOR COLLEGE  </P> <P> The Glendale College Board of Trustees on Monday authorized purchase of a  computerized sign for Glendale Community College after two major businesses  chipped in a portion of the cost.  </P> <P> Carnation Co. and Glendale Federal Bank each presented the board with a check  for $25,000, which will go toward the $76,320 cost of the sign, to be built  within three months by Doty Development Co. of Glendale.  </P> <P> The remainder will be paid for by the Glendale College Foundation, a nonprofit  organization that supports the college.  </P> <P> The 8- by 20-foot sign will be installed at Verdugo Road and Mountain Avenue.  It will be connected by a telephone line to a campus computer, which will be  used by school officials and student groups to program electronic messages  about school activities. New messages will flash periodically throughout the  day.  </P> <P> Messages on the existing marquee are changed manually.  </P> <P> "The new sign will put an end to the endless territorial battles as to who will  get their message on the marquee, how many letters and how long it can stay  there," Supt. John Davitt said.  </P> <P> The programmable sign was proposed by Walter Smith, dean of student activities,  after he saw one at Cerritos College. Jim Cashion, foundation president, asked  Glendale Federal and Carnation to participate.  </P> <P> The names of the companies will be permanently installed on the frame of the  sign.  </P></p>

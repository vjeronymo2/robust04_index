Last month, border guards detained 1,112  trespassers, among whom citizens of Afghanistan, Turkey (Kurds),  Vietnam, Syria, and some Balkan countries constituted 78 percent.    The authorities confiscated from the border violators, in  particular, smugglers, 2.5 tonnes of technological mercury, more  than three tonnes of nonferrous metals, over 30 units of various  types of weapons, 340.3 kilograms of narcotic raw materials, and  so on.    The State Committee for Borders points out that, with the  strengthening of border and customs control, the activity of  those criminal groups that struggle for influence on the  railroad transport system and that accompany the contraband  goods by road has intensified.</p>

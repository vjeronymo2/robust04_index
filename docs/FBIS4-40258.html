			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTELEKT report: "Invaders in Their Own Country?"] </F>   [Text] An anti-Ukrainian coalition -- Odessa's  "Dostoyinstvo" [dignity] association -- stormily and operatively  reacts to developments in Ukraine. It specializes in publishing  and disseminating leaflets. The first appeared immediately  after the well-known conflict between Ukrainian and Russian Navy  men near Odessa. In this leaflet, Ukrainian servicemen are  termed invaders. Another one came soon after the televised  speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy regarding the  situation in the Crimea. Apparently, the general wants to "throw  us into the meat grinder of civil war." Therefore, the  Ukrainian Supreme Council and the president should immediately  remove him from the post of defense minister. The key  expression in the leaflet is even more radical: "Dostoyinstvo"  calls on Odessa residents to defy the next draft of young people  into the Ukrainian Army, which is, obviously, an open violation  of Ukrainian legislation.    The association is headed by Oleksandr Shteyman, recent  candidate for Ukrainian people's deputy, whose real name became  known to Odessa residents during the electoral campaign. Before  that, he had been Kamenskiy for some reason.    The leaflet does not suggest under which army banners the  Odessa youth should fight. Nor does it explain why the  Ukrainian Army is considered invasive on Ukrainian territory.</p>

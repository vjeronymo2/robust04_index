			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Growers force poll on potato board Potato growers have forced a poll of the 15,000 producers in a campaign for the immediate abolition of the 60-year-old Potato Marketing Board. The board said yesterday that 420 growers, led by the Scottish Potato Trade Association, had called for the poll. The potato marketing scheme is due to be wound up in three years under proposals announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, but there could be a successor body to continue potato promotion and research. However growers are unwilling to continue paying a levy of Pounds 48 per hectare now that the board's principal function of intervention buying to support prices has ended. Mr Bob Doig, who heads the abolition campaign, yesterday described the board as 'an archaic talking-shop'. Mr John Heading, board chairman, urged growers to oppose abolition. He said: 'The industry needs continuing funds for research and development as it becomes more market-led and technical.' The board would be scrapped if growers representing a majority of the UK's 150,000 hectares of potato production vote in favour. the result of the poll should be known by the end of next month. The board has been planning a survey of growers to find out what sort of organisation they wanted from 1997. Commodities, Page 34</p>

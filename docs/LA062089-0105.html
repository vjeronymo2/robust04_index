			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BILL WOULD EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR POOR  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) introduced legislation that would expand Medicaid  health-care coverage to thousands of low-income children and pregnant women at  an estimated annual cost of $1 billion. Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee, is attempting to provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and to  children under age 6 in families whose income is 185% of the poverty level --  $22,385 for a family of four. Under legislation enacted last year and being  phased in during fiscal 1989 and 1990, Medicaid coverage is guaranteed to  pregnant women and infants under age 1 in families whose income is at the  poverty level -- $12,100 for a family of four. Bentsen's bill would expand  coverage to an additional 300,000 pregnant women and to 1.6 million children  under age 6 in fiscal years 1990 and 1991, his office said.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Payments slowdown squeezes exporters British exporters are having to wait longer for payment from customers on the Continent, the Association of British Factors and Discounters said yesterday. Many settlements were taking more than four months, an association survey revealed. The survey showed that Italian companies have replaced the French as the slowest European payers, settling invoices in an average of 130 days compared with 95 days a year ago. Normal payment terms in Italy are 60 to 90 days. French companies paid on average after 121 days, six days more slowly than they did last year. The study lends support to the frequently cited theory that recession encourages late payment. The record of German companies, which are normally considered prompt payers but are suffering from recession, also deteriorated. They settled on average after 55 days compared with 50 days last year. By contrast UK companies are paying more quickly as the economic recovery gathers pace. Payments were received by the ABFD's members in an average 59 days compared with 62 days last year. Mr Ben Allen, chairman of the ABFD, said: 'It is ironic that just as the picture starts to improve for British companies at home their struggle to get paid abroad gets tougher.' The study is compiled by a group of leading European factoring companies which advance cash to companies against unpaid invoices. Italy, France and Spain emerge as the European countries with the worst bad-debt record. Italy had bad debts equal to 4 per cent of sales in 1993, France 3 per cent and Spain 2.5 per cent. Dutch companies were the promptest payers, settling after 50 days compared with 45 days a year ago with normal payment terms of 30 days. The lowest bad-debt rates were in Switzerland and the UK. These two countries were the least bad payers after the Netherlands. The smallest companies appear to be worst hit. The association said: 'Profit margins are being squeezed because many European customers are now offering payment on time only if their suppliers accept sizeable discounts.'</p>

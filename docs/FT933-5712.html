			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Peres outlines his vision of peace: Veteran Israeli dove sees new era of co-operation in the Middle East MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister and the man who clinched the peace agreement with Palestinians in secret talks last week, yesterday outlined his vision of a revolution in the political and economic geography of the Middle East. The 70-year-old veteran politician and long-time Israeli dove spoke at a press conference of a new era of peace and economic development based on free trade, open borders, regional integration and mutual respect. Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, for assistance for the Palestinians, said the region could now slash its Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.7bn) a year arms expenditure and develop an Arab-Israeli alliance against extremists on both sides. He promised Israel would assist Palestinians and help raise foreign capital for a Palestinian entity. Mr Peres has always been ahead of public opinion on the peace process and it is by no means certain that he speaks officially for the government. But he does represent broadly the centre-left of Israeli politics and, in particular, the maj-ority of the Labour movement. He said it was in Israel's interests to end the suffering of Palestinians economically, politically and psychologically. 'There is nothing better for Israel than a good neighbour,' he said. 'Today the Middle East is divided into two parts more than Arabs and Israelis. It is between people who support peace and people who want to kill peace. 'I think the time has come to make a coalition of all parties who support peace in order to prevent and combat those forces that want to assassinate peace,' he said. On arms expenditure and foreign aid, Mr Peres said the Middle East needed not more money but a different structure. 'To be honest we are spending Dollars 50bn a year on the arms race. What for? How dare we go and ask other nations to contribute to the Middle East before we ourselves take our own affairs seriously. We have to correct our mistakes and once we correct them I am sure the rest of the world will support gladly the creation of a productive and serious peaceful Middle East.' He said Israel had agreed an agenda for peace with Jordan and, in the most recent meetings, the two sides had dealt with only trivial issues 'like to whom should the mosquitoes and flies ask for a visa to fly over from Akaba to Eilat. We were left without subjects but for mosquitoes and flies. We can sign tomorrow.' The Israeli foreign minister said there was no reason why Arab nations should not adopt normal diplomatic relations with Israel and lift their economic boycott. He likened an accord with the PLO on mutual recognition to the French recognition of the Algerian FLN. 'When the FLN became a political party the government opened a dialogue. This is the best comparison to our approach. . . the moment the PLO becomes a political party there will no longer be a problem.'</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Benefits mistakes hit record Pounds 716m MISTAKES IN the amount of social security paid to millions of unemployed people, single parents and low-income pensioners have reached a record level, the National Audit Office says today. The public expenditure watchdog says that errors in the payment of income support, the basic safety-net benefit, were Pounds 716m in 1992-93, 4.8 per cent of the Pounds 15bn total. Sir John Bourn, head of the watchdog, says that the Benefits Agency paid claimants Pounds 575m more in income support than they were entitled to. Much of this cannot be recovered because it is due to errors in calculating and paying benefits, which are written off. Underpayments of Pounds 141m will normally be paid when they are discovered. Sir John, who is responsible for auditing the accounts of government departments, has qualified the agency's accounts because of the errors. More than Pounds 134m of the overpayments were due to problems in paying claimants' mortgage interest direct to lenders, introduced last year as part of measures to help reduce mortgage repossessions. The value of errors has more than doubled in the past five years in spite of efforts by the Benefits Agency to bring it down to 2 per cent of the value of the benefit. Mr Michael Bichard, the agency's chief executive, said that he had introduced a series of measures to deal with the errors. These included management reviews of the worst-performing offices, more automatic processing of payments and additional checks on complex cases. Sir John has also qualified the accounts over uncertainties about whether correct payments have been made on housing benefit, where Pounds 82m has been repaid to 89 local authorities for 1990-91 and 1991-92 on claims which the auditors have been unable to verify. There are also uncertainties about the amounts refunded to employers for statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. The office has raised doubts about the accuracy and completeness of employers' annual returns setting out the amounts deducted from national insurance payments.</p>

They were charged  with forming a secret organization with the objective of  toppling the government by using the position of the mayor  supported by a number of other members of the council who belong  to the Labor Party to conduct secret activities and to use the  summer resort of Ra's al-Barr [name as published, presumably  Ra's al-Bahr], which is now empty, for their organization's  training, lectures, and other instruction.    The security men noticed some suspect activities by some  youths known for their extremist tendencies. By observing them,  it became evident that they were forming a secret organization  and that the mayor was abusing his office to support the  organization. [passage omitted]</p>

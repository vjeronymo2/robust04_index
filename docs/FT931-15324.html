			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Arabs urge UN to imposesanctions against lsrael ARAB NATIONS meeting in Cairo agreed yesterday to press the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel for refusing to take back more than 400 Palestinians expelled to southern Lebanon, but stopped short of threatening to walk out of the Middle East peace process. Foreign ministers of the Arab League urged the Security Council to apply the rules of Chapter 7, which provide for sanctions, because of Israel's refusal to implement UN Resolution 799. The resolution, passed on December 17, demands that Israel should return the Palestinians to their homes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel has insisted that it will defy the resolution and is confident that the US will veto any attempt by the UN to impose sanctions. Mr Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the US wanted to avoid Chapter 7 being invoked on this issue and believed no further action should be taken until Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, had exhausted his efforts to find a solution. Mr Boutros Ghali is to meet Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, in Paris today in an attempt to avert sanctions. Arab nations have been quick to contrast the US attitude towards Israel with its determination to see that Iraq complies with Security Council resolutions passed at the end of the Gulf war. Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said: 'Most of the Arab delegates spoke about double standards. Why should Israel be above the law when other nations are obliged to implement Security Council resolutions? ' The Arab League also warned that Israel's refusal to allow back the Palestinians posed a serious danger to the Middle East peace process which opened in Madrid in October 1991. The ninth round of negotiations is scheduled to begin in Washington on February 20, but the Palestine Liberation Organisation has warned that it would suspend the participation of its delegation if the issue of the 400 men was not satisfactorily resolved. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria argued that it would be premature to suspend the talks and believe that Mr Bill Clinton should not be presented with an Arab ultimatum before he takes over the US presidency. Little progress was made in the first eight rounds of talks, but with the Israeli government suffering widespread condemnation for its treatment of the Palestinian deportees there is some hope among Arab officials that it will return to the table with more positive proposals. Lebanon yesterday repeated its refusal to take the men.</p>

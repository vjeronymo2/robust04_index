He has made partial restitution and has until April 23, 1990, to pay the  remainder. Earlier, Osterkamp pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge that  he failed to pay an 8 1/2% bed tax to the city.  </P> <P> Shearson California Radisson Plaza Partners, which is headed by the investment  firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, had sought city permission for the management  change. Shearson bought the hotel from US Hotel Properties in 1987, and then  leased it to Osterkamp to manage.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The instant-replay rule is a great idea, but the execution -- or non-execution  -- of it still stinks. . . .  </P> <P> The Raiders were lucky when a failure to communicate kept the press box  official from looking at a replay that showed Mervyn Fernandez didn't have both  feet in-bounds on what was ruled a 45-yard completion from Jay Schroeder during  a touchdown drive early in the fourth quarter in Seattle Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Was that Jay Schroeder or Joe Montana on the Raiders' winning touchdown drive?  . . .  </P> <P> It was a tough call, but the Raiders should have gone for the sure three points  from less than a yard out when it was 3-3 late in the first half. If you don't  score a touchdown most of the time in that situation, at least you've pinned in  the opposition. But, in this case, the Seahawks only had to run one play before  halftime. . . .  </P> <P> Besides, once the Raiders lined up, everybody in the Kingdome knew that Marcus  Allen was going over the top. . . .  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that Jim Everett already has passed for more yardage in  his Ram career than Bob Waterfield. . . .  </P> <P> There's nothing wrong with Curt Warner, but Cleveland Gary looks as though he  belongs in the Ram backfield. . . .  </P> <P> Bonehead Call of the Day: The flat pass by Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny  Testaverde that was intercepted for a touchdown by Ram defensive back Bobby  Humphery with eight seconds remaining in the first half. . . .  </P> <P> Raider tight end Mike Dyal will be getting off easy if he's fined only $10 by  his teammates for dropping a pass in the end zone. . . .  </P> <P> If Denver beats Kansas City tonight, only one team in each of the NFL's six  divisions will be unbeaten after two games. . . .  </P> <P> Break up the Phoenix Cardinals! . . .  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda left Mike Morgan in too long Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> This is the year of lost opportunity for the Dodgers, who blew leads of 10 and  seven runs at home to Philadelphia and Houston, respectively, and left the  bases loaded three times in the most important game of the season in  Cincinnati. . . .  </P> <P> Oh well, when the Dodgers fell behind, 8-2, in the fifth inning, I was able to  give the remote control a rest and concentrate on the Raider-Seattle game. . .  .  </P> <P> Don Drysdale was being kind to the Reds Saturday when he described them as  being "very tentative."  </P> <P> .. .  </P> <P> The Chicago White Sox may be the second best team in baseball. . . .  </P> <P> The new star of the NBC broadcasting booth is articulate, lively, and  right-on-the-money NFL commentator Todd Christensen. . . .  </P> <P> What was that about a quarterback controversy at UCLA? . . .  </P> <P> A redheaded kid across town proved last year that a freshman redshirt  quarterback, like Tommy Maddox, can be effective. . . .  </P> <P> After victories over Syracuse and Penn State, USC is the leading candidate to  win the Lambert Trophy. . . .  </P> <P> In two games, the Trojans have committed a grand total of one turnover. . . .  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich on the goal line stand against Penn State in the fourth  quarter: "It was one of those USC moments that you always watch on television."  . . .  </P> <P> However, the Trojan running game will have to pick up to do anything against  Washington, which held Purdue to zero net yards rushing. . . .  </P> <P> Ty Detmer's remarkable start means most of the nation, including L.A., will get  BYU-San Diego State Saturday on CBS instead of Alabama-Georgia. . . .  </P> <P> Quite a hat trick for Oregon State -- consecutive losses to Montana, Kansas and  Nevada Las Vegas. . . .  </P> <P> If you think the Notre Dame-Michigan game was long, you should have watched the  Houston-Texas Tech game Thursday on ESPN. . . .  </P> <P> I wonder if Eastern Washington will be able to hold Houston to under 100 points  and 1,000 yards Nov. 17. . . .  </P> <P> It got lost in the shuffle, but Russell White of Crespi High fame returned a  kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in the University of California's defeat to  Miami. . . .  </P> <P> The best thing that Lou Holtz-coached teams do is win. . . .  </P> <P> CBS should eliminate those absurd ground shots from its college telecasts. One  of them fouled up the coverage of the tipped pass that sparked Notre Dame's  comeback against Michigan. . . .  </P> <P> Lights at Notre Dame Stadium are worse than lights at Wrigley Field. . . .  </P> <P> Have you heard the one about the dog that lost a Frisbee-catching contest  because he had only three feet in bounds?  </P></p>

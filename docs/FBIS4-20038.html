			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Ruehe Settles Dispute With Union's </F> Defense Experts"]    [Text] Bonn -- The dispute among security experts of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] on  the future of the Bundeswehr has been settled. At a meeting in  Siegen, the Bundestag group's working group on defense accepted  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's concept without any major  changes. It provides for cutting Bundeswehr troops from 370,000  to 340,000 and for reducing compulsory military service from 12  to 10 months. Ruehe will have to win the approval of the CDU/CSU  Bundestag group today. On Monday [25 April], Free Democratic  Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel seemed once again to be  uncertain about whether to agree to the troop reductions.    CDU/CSU Defense Policy Spokesman Paul Breuer said after the  meeting on Monday that the Bundestag group experts consider a  10-month military service in the main defense forces possible.  This is the part of the troops used for national defense.  Anyone who voluntarily does his service in the crisis-reaction  forces, must, however, serve for 12 months.    The working group says that the name "Soldier for Months  (SaM)," describing soldiers serving in the crisis-reaction  forces, has been dropped in favor of "W-12." This clearly shows  that the crisis-reaction forces used for missions abroad are  committed to society by their compulsory military service. The  10-month military service does, however, not imply a shorter  alternative service, because those doing military service do not  get compensatory time off and face higher demands.    The working group's resolution document also says that the  Bundeswehr must remain in a position to be extended to 370,000  troops in the event of an emergency. The necessary structures  must be maintained. But still, some of the sites could be  closed down, Breuer said. But this cannot be discussed before  the Defense Ministry's concept has been completed.    The working group demanded that profits be achieved through  rationalizations and cuts, stay in the defense budget. The  deputies also said that the number of civilian Bundeswehr  employees and their organization must be balanced against the  military part of the Bundeswehr. This means that of the  existing 151,000 civilian staff, 20,000 could be laid off.    Speaking after his party's presidium meeting on Monday, FDP  Chairman Klaus Kinkel said a strength of 370,000 troops remains  desirable, particularly for foreign-policy reasons. But he said  he could also see the bottlenecks in the Bundeswehr budget. The  FDP has never been opposed to reducing the Bundeswehr strength.  Yet, alternatives have to be considered first. Kinkel and FDP  Secretary General Werner Hoyer think that Ruehe's concept leaves  many questions unanswered. The CDU/CSU group wants to discuss  Ruehe's plans today. Resistance is expected from several  deputies. Breuer said that the meeting will once again bring  "sweat to Ruehe's brow."</p>

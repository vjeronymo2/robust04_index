			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Brussels blocks German pay-TV venture The European Commission yesterday blocked a multimedia deal among three of Germany's most powerful companies after deciding it would prevent other competitors from entering the German market for pay television. Using for only the second time its powers to block joint ventures, the Commission competition authorities argued that the deal was incompatible with the single market. At stake was a proposed venture between Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group; the Kirch group, one of Germany's biggest private television companies; and Deutsche Telekom. The companies intended to set up a company - MSG - to provide infrastructure, marketing and booking services for commercial pay-TV. Some sections of the multimedia industry said the Commission's decision would frustrate the development of multimedia services in Europe. 'A practical entrepreneurial attempt to create a market of the future has been prevented,' Kirch said. 'The decision means that the creation of a digital communications infrastructure with the required management will not be possible.' In July, the Commission launched an investigation, fearing the venture could create a dominant position in the German pay-TV market. 'In principle a joint venture like MSG is desirable because it is able to implement new technologies such as digital television,' said Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner with special responsibility for competition policy. 'But the structural features of MSG would lead to a protection of the market for services as well as for digital pay-TV.' The market for pay-television programmes and services is expected to expand as digital television is introduced. The Commission said the prospects were particularly good in Germany because of the high number of households - 21m  -which already receive television by cable or satellite. Bertelsmann said yesterday the ruling had, in the short term, closed possibilities for smaller programme producers to access future television technology. 'At the moment the merger partners are the only people in Germany who have the technical and administrative capabilities to run such a business,' it said. Mr Van Miert denied the ruling was a setback for Europe's multi-media industry, arguing that it was possible for cross-border deals to take place without individual markets being closed off.

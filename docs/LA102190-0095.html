			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSTER DOUGLAS HAS BECOME MAIN COURSE  </P> <P> Don King once called James (Buster) Douglas a hot-dog-and-beer fighter.  </P> <P> When Douglas fought, often before the main event, people went for hot dogs and  beer, the promoter contended in recounting how it was he who built the fighter  into a star.  </P> <P> While Douglas bristled at King's characterization, he did say, "I was always  the one on all the major undercards. I wasn't the one they looked at.  </P> <P> "They'd have Joe Blow or somebody . . . I was the one nobody considered. They  knew of me, but they really didn't think I had what it took to be champion . .  . they didn't know they were moving right past the man who was going to do it  all, who was going to shock the world."  </P> <P> Douglas often was criticized as being a reluctant warrior and sometimes for  being downright dull.  </P> <P> On Feb. 11 at Tokyo, Douglas figuratively smeared mustard on King's shirt and  dumped suds on his head, leaving the flamboyant promoter sputtering and dazed.  </P> <P> Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in the 10th round and won the undisputed  heavyweight championship, then James Douglas went home to Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> "I definitely feel at home in Columbus,," Douglas said. "I feel I'm James, not  Buster, the fighter. Being either one, I'm comfortable at. I'm more comfortable  as James because that's the every day guy."  </P> <P> He does, however, enjoy the celebrity of being Buster.  </P> <P> "All I ever wanted to be was the best," said the 30-year-old Douglas, who has  been fighting professionally since 1981 and who has a 30-4-1 record, with 20  knockouts. "Now that I am the best, it's new, it's exciting, it's unreal. Every  time I go to a hotel now I'm on the top floor. Before, it was, 'Let me try to  find you a room."'  </P> <P> The toast of Columbus could become the toast of Las Vegas Thursday night when  he defends the title against unbeaten Evander Holyfield, the No. 1 contender.  And, typical of his career, Douglas goes into the fight as an underdog  champion.  </P> <P> Douglas was soggy toast of any town when he fought Tony Tucker for the vacated  International Boxing Federation title May 30, 1987, at Las Vegas. Even with a  piece of the title at stake, Douglas found himself in a preliminary role. The  star of that show was Tyson, who stopped Pinklon Thomas to retain the World  Boxing Association and World Boxing Council titles. Douglas also boxed on the  undercards of three other Tyson title fights and as a prelim fighter on four  other heavyweight championship shows.  </P> <P> After after six rounds, Douglas was leading on all three official cards and the  scheduled 12-round match was even after nine. Tucker won in the 10th when  Douglas was stopped. It seemed to some observers that Douglas just quit  fighting.  </P> <P> Douglas admits to lacking mental toughness in that fight.  </P> <P> "There were things with my dad and I," Douglas said of his relationship with  his father-trainer, Billy "Dynamite" Douglas, a rugged middleweight- light  heavyweight of the 1970s. "I wanted to be my own man, I wasn't little Buster  any more."  </P> <P> Douglas also said his father "wasn't able to jell with other people in camp."  </P> <P> The professional relationship between father and son ended with the Tucker  fight. The personal relationship also became strained, but the father who was  not in Tokyo for his son's finest hour is in Las Vegas for his first title  defense.  </P> <P> Douglas began what has become a seven-fight winning streak after losing to  Tucker and he maintained a high ranking by the IBF, WBA and WBC, but, he said,  "the problems were building up."  </P> <P> Then his life changed.  </P> <P> "On July 20, 1989, I accepted the Lord into my life," he said.  </P> <P> "My training wasn't going well," said Douglas, who on July 21 fought Oliver  McCall in a preliminary to Tyson's first-round knockout of Carl Williams at  Atlantic City, N.J. "My wife and I had been at odds. I really didn't want to  fight. I told John (manager John Johnson), 'I'd like to pull out of this one.'  John said it would jeopardize my chances for a title shot.  </P> <P> "I was lying in bed in a hotel room in a pool of sorrow. I was feeling sorry  for myself. I was ready to give up."  </P> <P> Some friends from Columbus were in town for the fight, Douglas recalled, and  "they came to the room and we talked. I found out everybody had problems. We  joined hands and prayed and read scriptures.  </P> <P> "It was a wonderful experience. When I lie back down, it was a 180-degree  turnaround."  </P> <P> Douglas won an easy 10-round decision over McCall in an uninteresting bout.  </P> <P> "It (boxing) is a vehicle; it's a drive," Douglas said in reconciling his  profession with his faith. Pat Day, a top jockey who is a born-again Christian,  has said he considered giving up race riding, but then decided he must have  been blessed with his talent for a purpose.  </P> <P> Douglas, however, can understand being asked how he reconciles his beliefs with  boxing, which he took up at age 10.  </P> <P> "The main reason I walked away from boxing when I was 15 was because I didn't  like the way people perceived me as a fighter -- a brute, non-caring. They  acted like 'Man, don't hit me.' Man, like I couldn't control myself. It took me  years to look at it as a sport."  </P> <P> "My life was at a crossroads," remembered Douglas, who attended two colleges on  basketball scholarships, but who did not get a degree. "In my third year in  college things weren't going well. I wasn't applying myself, so I went back to  boxing as a pro at 21."  </P> <P> Douglas says his religious experience enabled him to focus his life, but one  night in early November at Columbus it got briefly, and dangerously, out of  focus.  </P> <P> He was supposed to fight underneath Tyson's defense against Donovan "Razor"  Ruddock Nov. 18 at Edmonton, Alberta, and hoped to use his appearance to  further his chances for a title shot. Tyson got sick, and the card was  postponed.  </P> <P> "When I found out that night that the fight was canceled, I went out and had a  couple of drinks," Douglas said. "I was flying down the highway and got into an  accident. It was my fault and I got into trouble for that. I just ran off the  road . . . I was being chased by the police.  </P> <P> "I had to do three days rehab and they suspended my license for three months, I  believe."  </P> <P> He also continued to believe in himself as a fighter and when the Tyson-Ruddock  match fell through he suddenly got his chance at the championship.  </P> <P> Douglas certainly needed to take a single-minded approach to his fight against  Tyson.  </P> <P>  -- He and his wife, Bertha, separated shortly after he fought McCall. "We're  back together again, and about to have a baby in January," Douglas said.  </P> <P>  -- The mother of his 12-year-old son, Lamar, was seriously ill. She since has  had a kidney transplant, Douglas said, and is doing well.  </P> <P>  -- On Jan. 18, Douglas' mother, Lulu, died.  </P> <P> "Through all of this I was able to stay focused," Douglas said. "I stayed  strong."  </P> <P> Before the fight, the general feeling of the boxing fraternity was, well at  least Buster is going to get $1 million for his beating. That amount far  outstripped his earnings for his first 34 fights.  </P> <P> Douglas was dominant against Tyson, despite a controversial knockdown in the  eighth round. Referee Octavio Meyran failed to pick up the timekeepers count,  instead beginning his count at "one," and the Tyson camp contended he should  have been awarded a knockout.  </P> <P> Douglas and Johnson charged King with breaching his promotional contract by  trying to get the result overturned. King contended he was just trying to  create controversy in order to set up an immediate rematch. It was while  claiming that he made Douglas into star that King made his remark about the new  champion having been a hot-dog-and-beer fighter.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the court settlement, King is not involved in Douglas' first  title defense for which the champion will make about $20 million.  </P> <P> "Attaining it has been everything I thought it would be and more," Douglas  said. "Only in America." His audience laughed at hearing the soft utterance of  the phrase King has boomed at numerous news conferences. The champion smiled.  </P> <P> Buster Douglas is pleased with life. So is James.  </P></p>

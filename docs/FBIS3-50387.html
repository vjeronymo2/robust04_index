			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received the announcement issued from  the session of the Presidency of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina held today and chaired by Alija Izetbegovic,  president of the Presidency.    The Presidency examined and adopted the report by President  Alija Izetbegovic on his visit to Malaysia, Indonesia, and  Brunei. Examining the situation regarding peace negotiations on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Presidency supported the initiative for  holding a Security Council session that would discuss the  situation in our country. If such a session does take place, the  Presidency assumes that the Security Council will reaffirm all  its resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted so far as well as  the London Conference decisions.    Mutual recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and  Montenegro is being proposed, considering this to be a way to  make a new contribution to solving the crisis on the territory  of the former Yugoslavia. The report by Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic and Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the General  Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the  talks at Sarajevo airport was also adopted at today's session.    Discussing the situation in the Bosnian Krajina, the  Presidency decided to consider the initiative of a large number  of former supporters of Fikret Abdic and to adopt an ordinance  with legal power about an amnesty. According to this ordinance,  no criminal prosecution will be instigated against members of  Fikret Abdic's paramilitary formations, as well as members of  parastate organs of the so-called Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia, who report to the legal organs of power of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10 February.    Regarding the crime in Zenica on which occasion a UNHCR  member, a British citizen, was killed, the Presidency expresses  its condolences and the resolution to have the people who  committed this crime found and punished.    Consent was given for the ambassadors of the Kingdom of  Sweden, the Republic of Austria, and the Republic of Albania to  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Presidency adopted the  decision on the election and release of a number of people  holding posts in the judiciary.</p>

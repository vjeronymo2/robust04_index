			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / City council quits in Rome THE MAYOR of Rome and city council resigned yesterday, after a councillor was arrested in a bribery inquiry, Reuter reports from Rome. Mayor Franco Carraro, a Socialist and former minister in Italy's national government, said the decision had been made with 'profound pain. It has become clear the political conditions no longer exist for this city council to continue working,' Mr Carraro, elected in 1989, said. On Tuesday, the Rome councillor in charge of urban planning was arrested by finance police. Three other councillors were arrested last year and charged with accepting bribes for public contracts. Magistrates are investigating dozens of politicians in a bribery scandal sweeping the country.</p>

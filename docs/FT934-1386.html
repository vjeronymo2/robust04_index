			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Private View: A dreamer with designs on life James Gardner's 70-year career began with Nellie Melba. Now he is working on Stonehenge Their work is all around us but we never know their names. They shape everything we see, from soap trays to shopping arcades, and leave behind no mark, no signature. These anonymous people are called designers. Who, for example, created the plastic shades that pull down over aircraft windows? Or the tree walk in Battersea Park? Or the superstructure of the QE2? As it happens, the answer to all these questions is James Gardner, a man known to his friends as 'G' and to the rest of his countrymen . . . hardly at all. Gardner has been designing things for more than 70 years. At the age of 15, he was at Cartier's studio in London's Bond Street working on a tiara for opera star Dame Nellie Melba. At 86 - which he will be in 11 days - he is doing a visitor centre for Stonehenge, a warfare museum for Hartlepool and an archaeological park for the Israeli desert. 'I'll be about 90 by the time it's finished,' he said. 'So I'd better put ramps in, hadn't I' When I asked him why designers in Britain were invisible, he said it was because they were not regarded as 'professionals'. They were seated always at the bottom of the table. Things are different abroad: arriving once in Sweden by boat, he found cameras at the quayside. 'I thought it was some politician or starlet going ashore. I went down and it was me they were taking]' The English were more literary than visual and were mentally anarchic and lazy, he said. They took their gifted Renaissance children and taught them to suppress their physical and visual senses. Gardner says he escaped. 'Education didn't touch me. I just ignored it. I was completely unteachable.' Were you bolshie? 'No, not particularly bolshie, just not interested. So the childish part of my brain still remains, you see. Directly I left school, I started reading and studying the books I didn't want to read at school.' You knew you could draw and that was enough? 'That was my way out, you see - an easy way out. The teachers were enemies in a sense, actors who knew the lines when I didn't. I wasn't all that interested in the play, anyway.' He was born a spectator and recorder. 'Scientists may classify me as homo sapiens. I'm not at all, really. I'm a chap from another planet and I've been sent here as punishment.' He chuckled. 'I'm very much a loner.' Does loner mean lonely? 'I don't have any close relationships but I deal with quite a lot of associates. And I find . . . I'm not very fond of myself as a person and I don't want to sit down and examine my navel and get introspective. So I work. And I just work. That's it.' What is it about yourself you don't like, then? 'Goodness knows. Never did.' He gave a nervous laugh. 'A lot of people are like this. It's a Calvinist thing, an inborn sense of guilt or something. I've got to work to justify myself, all the time.' Idleness is the great sin? 'Yes. People say 'what do you do for your leisure?' and I have to think: er . . . I look on leisure as a sort of retirement on the instalment plan.' You never wanted to retire and sit in the sun? 'Oh lord, no] I can understand other people doing it, just as I see walruses doing it on the beach.' Despite his obvious facility with pencil and brush, Gardner says he never wanted to be an architect or painter. He disparages architects who consider themselves intellectuals but forget for whom buildings are built. What do you mean by intellectuals? 'I put it this way. The world is populated by two kinds of people: the yakkers or talkers, and the doers. And I think the talkers can get dominant and then the doing goes wrong - for example, the Bauhaus in Germany.' Commercial art was not a poor relation: it just had different objectives. When he was a student, it was a blossoming industry and art with a capital 'A' was for people with rich uncles or a bit of money. 'I didn't have either. But I've never had an aim to express myself. I'm given a problem and I try and solve it - a ship or a museum. Give me a blank bit of canvas and I'm at a loss.' His secret, he said, is visualisation. 'I've practically got a photographic memory, to start with. You give me a problem and I can build a model in my head, almost instantaneously. The whole thing is real in my head, as you might get in a dream. Then I translate that on to the drawing board. 'When I hit problems of mechanics and technology, I ask experts, or experience teaches me. Then I'm able to translate it into 3-D again.' Gardner progressed from advertising and product design to exhibition work. During the second world war, he translated ticker-tape reports into battle-scenes for the Daily Express, and then found himself in the deception and camouflage game building pneumatic tanks, artillery pieces and landing craft to fool German intelligence, and an exploding bicycle pump to cheer the French Resistance. His experience of fairs and exhibitions led to the 'concept museum' of which he was a pioneer, replacing the traditional glass-case hall with the one-way circulation system 'where people go in one end and come out with different ideas at the other'. Among the many was the Museum of the Diaspora in Tel Aviv and (on a related theme) the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. He is most proud of his national museum of natural science in Taiwan, the story of man's evolution seen through his (Gardner's) eyes. But much of his large output had, of its nature, been ephemeral. Did that make him feel he had wasted his substance? 'Yes, but I think it's as far as one can go in modern society. I don't think the real is very acceptable. The only time people are interested in the past is where they go through the portals of a museum. The rest of the time, they're just running around like rabbits and not really thinking at all.' Gardner is an individualist, but with two personalities. The one I met tended to the gloomy. The other, portrayed in his recent autobiography The Artful Designer, is boisterous, quirky and irreverent. His father was a travelling salesman in ladies' hats, his mother the Belle of Tunbridge Wells. She died from a clot on the brain while cutting the bread for breakfast one morning. The boy was only 14, did not get on with his stepmother and went out into the world. He married Mary Williams, a goddess he met behind the counter at Selfridge's in London's Oxford Street. She was pregnant by a Spanish salesman and 'G' agreed readily to become her husband, and father to the twin boys. But the long marriage was dull, he said. When his wife died, he disposed of the house. What could not be sold or given away, he heaped into a sacrificial bonfire that lit up the hillside. In the office and on his travels, he was assisted by a succession of pretty secretaries named, collectively, 'Mehitabel'. Despite the book's apparent hints to the contrary, he assured me they were not mistresses. I said the book made him sound pleased with himself. 'Oh, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. People have told me it's a very cheerful book whereas I tend to be, frankly, rather a morose character. Anyway, I kid myself I am.' It was not black moods, he said, but a tendency to see half-empty pots where others saw half-full ones. I asked: where does the moroseness come from? He pondered. 'I think that I was rather over-idealistic when I was a youngster. And you find that everything flattens out and things just don't happen. 'I thought we were going to improve Britain's appreciation of design, but it's very difficult to get in under the British and change them. They've got this inertia that goes way back. And it's disappointed me, really. I feel we're not getting anywhere. 'You ask most people what will happen in their countries in five or 10 years and they'll give you an answer. But, in England, no one's got a clue. It's rather a poor show for a nation with our terrific past.' With the Roman senator and the Japanese samurai, the English Gentleman ('who's quite bogus really: he had to behave because of the servants') was one of the great creations of history. His taste, manners and literature had been copied the world over. 'Then two wars partly did it and we went flop. I feel I'm living in a flop period. That's what makes me slightly sad about things.' Your book offers no conclusion about your life, I said. What would it be? 'What am I doing here? This complex of electrons and molecules all buzzing like mad and keeping me up on my two legs. What's it all for? 'There's an over-developed brain which invents a purpose, whereas probably the football fans have got it right when they sing 'We're here because we're here because we're here.' 'At the end, all my confreres are either retired or dead and I'm still at it. So, I rather feel like doing a snook at life and saying 'Anyway, I'm still doing it.' 'That's about it, actually.'</p>

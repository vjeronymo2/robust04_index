			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fuji Xerox Chairman Yotaro Kobayashi by </F> editorial staff Hiroshi Nakajima; place and date not given]    [Text] [Nakajima] At the time the U.S.-Japan framework  talks broke down, you were in Washington D.C. as the deputy head  of the Japanese delegation to the U.S.-Japan Business Council.  What do you think was the cause of the breakdown?  <H5>  A Gap Between Supply and Demand </H5>   [Kobayashi] I think it was the fact that the Japanese side  did not fully understand what President Clinton wanted. The  political reality which surrounds President Clinton is severe.  President Clinton defeated President Bush by criticizing his  weak policy toward Japan. Against this background, he had to  get visible results from Japan.    They may have been too optimistic in reading the situation,  assuming that "even if things were not satisfactory, he would  not corner Mr. Hosokawa," because they thought the president  felt favorably toward Mr. Hosokawa. Of course, on the Japanese  side there was the political reality surrounding Mr. Hosokawa  and the fact he could not fully respond to President Clinton's  demands. There was a gap between supply and demand.    [Nakajima] What was it that President Clinton wanted that  the Japanese side did not fully understand?    [Kobayashi] He was looking for a macropolicy which would  make a strong impression, such as an increase in domestic  demand, measures to buoy up business conditions, and so on. The  president said clearly at the news conference that he did not  seek numerical targets.    [Nakajima] The Japanese side maintains that the talks broke  down because of numerical targets.    [Kobayashi] President Clinton said he was not seeking  numerical targets, but objective standards by which market  opening could be judged. He even declared that he would not use  the semiconductor agreement as a model. Numerical targets are a  sectoral issue. The effect individual sectoral targets have on  the overall problem is not significant. We must attack the  trade issue with a 70-80 percent macroeconomic policy.    Why did we have the framework talks to begin with? The  U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment Initiative was a similar case:  It derived from the worry that we had to do something to deal  with U.S. feelings that the Japanese market was closed.  Individual industries are a problem; but above all else the  issue is a macroeconomic one. Macroeconomic measures can be  effective, hence a selling point in the proposals. But in  Japan's proposals, there was nothing that could be called  macroeconomic measures. But in the Japanese proposal, there was  nothing you could describe as good macropolicy.    [Nakajima] What is your feeling about the reaction of the  American business sector?  <H5>  Microeconomy Was Sacrificed </H5>   [Kobayashi] They see that something has to be done about the  stark reality of the huge Japanese trade surplus. This is a  worldwide problem. But each industry has a different view of  individual retaliatory measures. It is not a situation in which  one industry stirs up another by saying "go after them, go after  them." We have to take it case by case. It is not going to be  all-out war.    But there were also those who said although 95 percent of  the  U.S. businessmen present were Republican supporters, they would  support the current president's policy 100 percent. It was not  Japan-bashing. They realized that unless the U.S. Government  followed a moderate and balanced policy, it would be the United  States which would get hurt. Nonetheless, the proposals Japan  brought to Washington were not well received.    [Nakajima] What about the view that the reason the talks  broke down was because the U.S.-Japan relationship has matured?    [Kobayashi] I don't think we should attach that much meaning  to them. It was President Clinton who first said no. He said  no because he could not evaluate our macroeconomic policy. I  understand that they had arrived at the stage where there was  partial agreement on some individual sectors. They had  approached a workable stage on insurance, for example, but in  the end the talks broke down because there was no macroeconomic  policy to follow and an agreement on insurance was sacrificed as  a result. As far as the microeconomy is concerned, there is  still room to achieve results by continuing the negotiations.    [Nakajima] What do you think must be done to satisfy U.S.  requirements on macroeconomic policy?    There Is No `Worst Case Situation'    [Kobayashi] For the expansion of domestic demand and an  upturn in economic conditions, we need something more than a  policy which is good for one year, we need something which will  take us into the future. A tax cut which lasts for only one  year will not satisfy the United States, even if it was  acceptable in Japan. Deregulation is also necessary. I do not  mean to follow the lead of President Clinton, but the attitudes  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the  Ministry of Finance are also a problem.    The microeconomy should not stop at the war of rhetoric, but  make actual progress, but the macroeconomic policy is the issue  on which everything is at stake. The United States will lose  patience if our reaction is simply to say that the talks broke  down because the United States demanded numerical targets, and  that the United States wants a managed trade system and Japan  opposes them because it is pursuing a free trade policy.    In the private sector there is enough ground for individual  industries to make good progress. I think it is better to leave  the industrial issues to the private sector. What the Japanese  side worries about is that even efforts toward industry-based  targets can be construed as a government promise. However, the  highest authority in the United States, President Clinton  himself, has said very clearly that he will not use the  semiconductor agreement as a standard. I think we should  believe him.    [Nakajima] What do people in the United States think about  the way Motorola gets the government to take action?    [Kobayashi] Most consider Motorola an exceptional case. But  since there is no other good precedent, when it comes to a case  study, Motorola is used. However, there are also those who say  the Motorola method is not a good one, and that the government  should refrain from giving special support to a specific  enterprise.    [Nakajima] There is a pessimistic line of argument that says  that U.S.-Japanese relations are following a dangerous course if  events continue the way they are at the moment.    [Kobayashi] I do not think relations will degenerate as far  as some believe, there is no merit in that for either side. The  key will be how much of a positive contribution the Japanese  side can offer to deal with the political reality that President  Clinton is confronting. Depending on the degree of that  contribution, will be the point at which the United States  lowers the fist it has raised.</p>

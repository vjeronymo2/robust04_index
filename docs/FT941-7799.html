According to Janet Scott, president of the Beaumont Society, which runs helplines for transvestites, having two photo cards could prove very convenient for some cross-dressers. 'Those who are confident enough to go shopping in their female persona would certainly want to have a second card.' And you could still blame the shopping spree on your other half.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Auditing dominated by six firms in Europe, says study SIX international accountancy firms dominate audit work among Europe's top companies and enjoy almost complete control over the sector in three EC countries, according to a study for the European Commission. The report, conducted by National Economic Research Associates (Nera) for Brussels' competition directorate, says the international networks of the 'Big Six' firms in Europe - largest by fee income and staff - audit almost 100 per cent of the top 200 businesses in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. The firms - KPMG, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse and Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu - also control more than half the audit work in Germany and Portugal. Nera says large accountancy firms rely on audit clients to generate substantial fee income from other activities, although there appears to be a high degree of client satisfaction with the present position. The report was commissioned in 1989 at a time of serious concern about the competitive consequences of the rapid growth of accountancy services, the merger of several firms and the development of international networks. The study, to be released next month, identifies a 'second tier' of medium-sized firms, including BDO, Grant Thornton International, Howarth &amp; Howarth, CLG/Clark Whitehill, Robson Rhodes, Pannel Kerr Forster, Moore Stephens, Moores &amp; Rowland, Neville Russell International and Spicer &amp; Oppenheim. Nera explains the dominance of the Big Six by saying that large companies need to draw on accountants with considerable resources, international contacts and a perceived higher level of quality. The study shows rapid fee income growth in all the firms from 1984 to 1989. Audit and accounting fees have declined as a proportion of the total in every country, to be replaced principally by management consulting and tax advice, which are perceived by the firms as more profitable. It shows the firms as significantly reliant on audit clients for fee income from those other sources. Proportions ranged between 9 per cent in France and 44 per cent in Ireland - and Nera says the figures are likely to be underestimates. Overall, 35 per cent cent of businesses did not employ any accounting firms other than their auditor and more than half gave at least 80 per cent of accounting-related fees to the auditor. The report suggests this is explained by cost savings contributed by the inside knowledge of a company an auditor has built up and the reputation gained from audit work. It says restrictions to prevent auditors from conducting other work for the same client in France, Italy and Portugal are 'not always matched by their effect' because 'related and interlocking firms' have been created to circumvent the rules. It found little evidence that these arrangements were anti-competitive or caused dissatisfaction among clients, but emphasised that they had implications for the independence of auditors. In a separate section, the study concludes that there is little evidence of genuinely international firms rather than networks that share resources. National practices appear to be 'insulated' from one another, as illustrated by wide variations in hourly staff charge-out rates. In 1989, Big Six partner fees varied between Ecu 120 in Greece and Ecu 248 in the UK. For medium-sized firms it ranged from Ecu 73 in Belgium to Ecu 184 in the UK. For newly qualified staff, hourly rates varied between Ecu 30 in Portugal and Ecu 89 in Denmark for Big Six firms, and between Ecu 32 in Spain and Ecu 82 in Denmark for medium-sized firms. The study argues that the main advantages of the international networks of firms are to permit referral of work, and to generate a powerful shared marketing image. Co-ordination between fellow firms in different countries also gives rise to common standards and techniques, and allows for staff secondments. Few foreign firms are involved in audit and likely to threaten other members of the same international network. They are impeded by legal factors, professional restrictions and the existing conduct of international networks. 'We would doubt that the competitive behaviour of accounting firms located in one member state is constrained by the existence of the competitive threat from those located in another,' it says.

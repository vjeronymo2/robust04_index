			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / West's budgetary trends unsustainable: World economic outlook CURRENT budgetary trends in many big industrialised countries are unsustainable, according to the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook. It warns that the overall budget deficit among industrialised countries is expected to reach 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year, about the same as the previous record in 1982. In recent years public debt burdens have risen sharply and many countries have almost lost the ability to use fiscal policy as a tool to stabilise their economies. According to the IMF: 'Major additional efforts are necessary to achieve fiscal sustainability as well as broader economic objectives', such as the restoration of adequate national savings rates and higher growth. The fund argues the large fiscal deficits 'need to be addressed with a considerable degree of urgency'. It says high real long-term interest rates and lacklustre growth can be traced back to high deficits. Although the IMF acknowledges many countries have either proposed or adopted 'significant deficit-reduction measures', it warns that most of these efforts 'will not be sufficient to restore fiscal sustainability over the medium term'. Failure to reduce structural deficits during the growth years of the 1980s has made the job of governments more difficult. However, the IMF believes 'gradual, but cumulatively substantial' deficit reductions are possible without jeopardising global economic recovery. A brief survey of the leading industrial countries emphasises the problems, however. Achievement of the US administration's budget reduction efforts will still leave a deficit of 2.75 per cent of GDP in the 1998 fiscal year; Germany's deficit reduction plans are based on over-optimistic economic assumptions; Britain, France and Italy face structural budget deficits of respectively 3.5 per cent, 2 per cent and 5 per cent of GDP a year over the medium term. The IMF says it is not sufficient to stabilise present levels of public debt to GDP: instead, governments should aim gradually to reduce debt ratios over time. Such a goal is all the more necessary because measures of government indebtedness understate the extent of the problem. The IMF says government debt figures do not include future entitlements to pensions in public pension schemes. It warns that it will be necessary for countries either to increase borrowing or taxes when social insurance assets are drawn down to fulfil pension obligations. Unemployment is also taking a fiscal toll on the industrialised world. The fund estimates that unemployment benefits accounted for 3.5 per cent of total government spending in the industrial countries in 1991. They have since risen with the lengthening of dole queues.</p>

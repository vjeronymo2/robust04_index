			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Language of television Sir, Christopher Dunkley (Television: March 2) bemoans the fact that his satellite/cable equipped viewers do not have anything to watch. Perhaps this is because the selection offered to them is so feeble. Here in Geneva we are cabled and I have 34 channels in seven languages. Agreed, much of it is of mind-boggling tedium; I can only take so much of HTV for example. But if one continues to zap around, one can find some fascinating programmes even if one's command of the language is shaky. The German channels, denigrated by Mr Dunkley, have excellent documentaries in the evenings. Tiring of the interminable ice hockey on all three Swiss channels the other night, I flipped to a German channel and found a fascinating 45-minute documentary on the fall of East Germany which taught me a lot that I did not know. The same channel a year or so ago had a touching report on the Volga Germans who yearn to go 'home' but can't. Of course, one has to speak more than one language to appreciate all this, and I assume Mr Dunkley is telling us that his monolingual viewers can't handle anything other than English. In that case, they are missing a lot of good TV. But then that's all to do with the British education system, isn't it? And that's another subject.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Japanese current account growth easing THE growth in Japan's current account surplus, which could be the focus of sharp criticism from both the US and the EC at next week's Tokyo summit, is running out of steam, according to official figures published yesterday. However Japan's current account surplus with the EC rose sharply from Dollars 25bn in 1991 to Dollars 37bn (Pounds 24.6bn) last year, according to Finance Ministry figures for Japanese trade in 1992 published yesterday. The 48 per cent rise in the surplus with the EC compares with an 11.25 per cent rise in the surplus with the US. Japan's current account surplus in May was Dollars 9.5bn, up about 0.9 per cent from the same month last year, while the trade surplus fell 1 per cent to Dollars 9.9bn. The latter fell because imports rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 16.2bn while exports rose only 5.6 per cent to Dollars 26.2bn. The Japanese government is likely to point to the slower growth of the surplus as evidence that its pump-priming measures over the past year are beginning to revive demand for imports. The US and the EC have both called on Japan to halve the current account surplus, which is expected to be worth about Dollars 150bn this year, about 3.5 per cent of Japan's gross national product. The US is expected to renew its calls for Japan to stimulate its economy and cut the surplus during next week's Tokyo summit of heads of state from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. The Bank of Japan's regional officials will meet in Tokyo early next week to review the state of the economy. In the past such meetings have been followed by interest rate changes. The case for a further cut in Japanese interest rates has been strengthened by the yen's rebound against the dollar in the past week in the face of political turmoil. Japan's global current account surplus in 1992 was Dollars 117.5bn, a 61.2 per cent rise from the year before, according to Finance Ministry figures published yesterday. The merchandise trade surplus was Dollars 132.3bn, up from Dollars 103bn the year before. Exports rose by 7.9 per cent at Dollars 330bn, an increase the Japanese government attributes mainly to a shift in the terms of trade which has increased the value of Japanese exports. Imports fell from Dollars 203bn to Dollars 198bn and there was a Dollars 7bn fall to Dollars 10bn in Japanese consumption of foriegn services. Japan's current account surplus with the US was Dollars 44.5bn, up from Dollars 40bn the year before, while its surplus with south east Asia rose from Dollars 33.8bn to Dollars 41.6bn.</p>

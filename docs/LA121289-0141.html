			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FRANCE TO LIFT BAN ON CASH FLOW  </P> <P> France, a leading backer of European Monetary Union, said today it will lift  its last foreign exchange controls at the start of 1990, eliminating  restrictions on sending money abroad for the first time since World War II.  </P> <P> The action is linked to the European Community's movement toward a single  European currency, which suggests as a first step the elimination of all  domestic currency controls.  </P> <P> "The French government has decided to completely free the movement of capital  from Jan. 1, 1990, onward," Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said in a  statement. "This expresses our confidence in the good health of the French  economy and in the stability of our currency."  </P></p>

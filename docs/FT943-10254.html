			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Chile plea for copper inquiry Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to ask UK and US regulatory authorities to investigate a 'series of unusual operations' said to have been conducted with brokers on the London and New York metals exchanges last year. It said it might take legal action against the brokers concerned. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, lost up to Dollars 270m (Pounds 174.1m) between September 1993 and January of this year when its chief metals futures operator, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, went on a disastrous trading spree. He is believed to have dealt with more than 20 London and New York brokers.</p>

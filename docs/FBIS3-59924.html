			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Requested to  comment on Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov's statement in  connection with missile systems being taken off combat alert,  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said on 21 November [date as  received] that, indeed, 17 SS-24 missile systems had been taken  off combat alert in Ukraine. This does not constitute a  violation of the law, he explained, since the latter does not  deal with missiles being taken off combat alert, but only with  them being withdrawn from Ukrainian territory. "It is better to  take missiles off combat alert. Then they will not be used by  anyone because the nuclear button is in Russia and no mention of  that fact is made by those talking now about law violation."    The issue of compensation and security guarantees, in the  president's words, will be provided for in a trilateral  agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. "This  agreement will put none of the states in an awkward position,"  said Kravchuk.</p>

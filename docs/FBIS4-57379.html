			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Colombian Liberal Party presidential candidate </F> Ernesto Samper Pizano to Dario Arizmendi, news director of  Caracol Network on the cancellation of the scheduled  presidential debate; date of letter not given]    [Text] Dear Dario: Last week, Conservative Party  presidential candidate Andres Pastrana sent a message to the  media in which he tried to schedule a program of debates  specifying the topics, participants, and hours of the debates  among the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Within  this timeframe, a debate was scheduled for tomorrow in Cadena  Caracol studios on the topic of farming.    Subsequently, Dr. Pastrana sent a message expressing his  refusal to participate in the debate proposed by himself. I  deplore the situation created by this inconsistency, which has  occurred previously in responses by Dr. Pastrana to other media  proposals.    Consequently, I believe that none of the meetings proposed  for tomorrow in Caracol studios will be held. This, however,  does not preclude their being rescheduled in the future. Please  receive a cordial greeting.    [signed] Ernesto Samper Pizano.</p>

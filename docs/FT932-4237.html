			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Game set matched for audit negligence - Andrew Jack reports on a mock trial which provides important training for observers and participants MR Garth Tweedale, looking haggard and alone, leaned against the wall for comfort and lit another cigarette. It was his third in succession during the short morning break, before he had to head back into court for cross-examination. He was looking forward to the end of his ordeal at lunchtime. His job was to justify his expert's report, which was a damning indictment of the work of accountants Bowles, Marsh and Wegerle in failing to pick up evidence of fraud at one of its audit clients, Low Ball. Bowles had failed to detect fraud during its audit of Low Ball's Italian subsidiary, which was conducted under tight time and budget pressures imposed by the firm's Atlanta office - tempting more than one observer to wonder whether the names of the client and the accountant might just as well have been reversed. But it was a rather unorthodox court to which Mr Tweedale returned. While in many civil cases the stacks of paperwork easily out-number the people, this room was full. There was a strictly obeyed timetable, which pushed the entire case through in a single day. The verdict was determined by a show of hands. There was even tea and coffee on tap just behind a partition at the back. In fact, this was a mock trial, held at the Law Society's offices in London last week, located very near to the real law courts but at a safe enough distance to allow for a little more experimentation and error. Mr Michel Kallipetis, QC, played the judge, and two more junior barristers from 2 Crown Office Row were the counsel for plaintiff and defendant. Mr Garth Tweedale and Mr Francis Small, both from Ernst &amp; Young, played the expert witnesses on the two sides. Most of the other names of individuals and companies mentioned during the day were fictitious: Bowles' audit partner was Dave Fendant, Low Ball's finance director was Brad Boondoggle and Globio, the company's Italian subsidiary, was headed by Giovanni Mafioso. But there was a serious point behind the game. The problem is that audit negligence cases rarely get as far as court, settling - normally without publicity, details or admission of guilt - on the steps or before. That might be cheaper and less time-consuming for all those involved, but it also causes problems. Certainly, it means there is little case law or precedent to guide others on accounting and auditing issues in the future. But there is also an intriguing logistical snag: it is difficult for expert witnesses and their forensic teams from accountancy firms to gain experience of the ultimate scrutiny of barristers and judge. Mr Robert Hughes, head of Ernst &amp; Young's litigation support unit, explains that the mock trial provides important training - both for observers and participants. It is also a rare chance for lawyers to see members of his department - not to mention barristers - working under court conditions, so they can assess whether they would hire them on a real case. As a result, the 40-strong audience was divided between accountants in training and solicitors at least partly talent-searching. All no doubt also took a little sadistic satisfaction in watching the unfolding events. The day was the culmination of several weeks' work to exchange writs, statements of claim and experts' reports compiled from specially prepared material. The morning was set aside for cross-examination of the plaintiff's expert witness, and the afternoon for that of the defendant. Those watching had to flick frequently back and forth through several inches of documents, following a rambling flow as different documents and assertions were compared. Several previous trial runs of the case in the past had allowed for careful tweaking to try to ensure that the material was balanced and did not automatically point to a victory for one side or the other. The skill of the experts' reports and the barristers was vital. It was a case riddled with nuances: Bowles used an Italian associate firm and - to save costs - able but very junior staff. There were difficulties over language and differing national auditing and accounting standards. What distinction should be drawn between a review and a full audit from London? Were there enough signs of fraud at the time or was the criticism only justified with the benefit of hindsight? But aside from the facts, the fickle psychology of the courtroom was stressed by Mr Kallipetis. 'Regardless of the strength of the evidence, the mood can suddenly change and the case turn to shreds in your hands,' he said. 'It may be unjust but it is human nature.' Indeed, he lamented the growing trend for exchange of witness statements in advance, which has cut down on the level of examination which takes place in court. Kallipetis would take over the cross-examination from time to time, picking up on a point that had not been satisfactorily answered and which showed the expert's report or views in a bad light. He would tenaciously persist as the expert squirmed with a 'yes, but' or 'on the whole, perhaps' response while growing increasingly frustrated as the question was honed more precisely until Kallipetis got his very simple if unfair 'no', at which point he would abruptly stop the examination with a curt 'thank you' (case destroyed). He would also personalise everything, demanding the expert to speculate when it suited, but rejecting speculation in the report or in answers when it did not. Tweedale argued that failure from the Italian associate auditors to meet deadlines should have raised concerns from the British firm. 'Have you ever been late on a deadline? Does that make you incompetent?' probed Kallipetis. Tweedale suggested concerns over quality because of the low audit fee. 'If my learned friend did this case for nothing would you question the adequacy of his work?' Kallipetis asked mischievously. 'And I might be tempted to ask about your fee, Mr Tweedale]' Afterwards, Tweedale said one of the most important lessons for him was remembering to study the statement of claim on the legal action rather than simply the experts' report. Another, related, point was the importance of ensuring that every single assertion could be justified individually, rather than simply the impression given by a series of factors which overall suggested negligence or cause for concern. One point which also emerged was the difficulty in building a case around current auditing guidelines, to which both expert witnesses frequently referred in their reports. 'I suggest you are being selective in your use of the guidelines,' said one barrister. 'They really say 'how long is a piece of string', don't they?' Kallipetis had a final word for prospective expert witnesses. 'Try not to be partisan,' he said. 'It is a very difficult line. There are times you wake up at night and think 'did I do the right thing?' Just ask yourself 'what would I have done, what would a competent accountant have done?'' And the verdict? At least among a democratic consensus from lawyers and accountants, it was bad news for Bowles the auditor.</p>

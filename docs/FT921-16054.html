			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: Protecting the investor Sir, In the wake of such unhappy events as the Barlow Clowes, BCCI and Maxwell affairs the public does not view regulation to protect investors, depositors or pensioners as being effective as it should be. The idea of an investor's charter to crystallise the rights and obligations of different parties in relation to investor protection has been put forward. The suggestions that there should be a single regulator for those who retail investment and life insurance products and services is also receiving some support. There is reason to believe that the general public is becoming increasingly aware of the concept and value of polarisation expressed through independent and tied sales outlets. Switching to a single regulator for retailers would cause an upheaval in the system of regulation which will not have been in force for four years until April 1992. It would undoubtedly blur the gradually emerging distinction between independent and tied sources of financial services. By all means let us have a charter, but don't cause confusion by overturning the present still fledgling structure.

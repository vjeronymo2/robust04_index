			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FORMER OFFICER GETS FINE FOR FAKE REPORT  </P> <P> A former Torrance police officer was fined $2,250 Thursday in Los Angeles  Municipal Court and placed on probation for one year, six weeks after he  pleaded no contest to charges that he filed a false police report and  obstructed an investigation.  </P> <P> Timothy Pappas, 27, was fired from the Torrance Police Department after he shot  an unarmed construction worker, Patrick J. Coyle, and then gave false reports  about the incident to superiors.  </P> <P> Pappas said at the time of the shooting in May, 1988, that he fired his gun  when Coyle moved suddenly as if to reach for a weapon, police reports say. Two  backup officers supported that account for a time but one, Officer Timothy  Thornton, eventually told superiors the story was a lie and that Pappas fired  the gun accidentally, the reports say.  </P> <P> Thornton was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing  information about the incident.  </P> <P> The third officer at the scene, Mark Holden, is fighting allegations he  conspired to obstruct justice and to falsely charge another with a crime.  </P> <P> Holden's preliminary hearing began Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court and  is scheduled to continue Dec. 19.  </P></p>

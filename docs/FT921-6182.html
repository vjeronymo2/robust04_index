			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Management: When we were very Young - Lucy Kellaway pays a visit to the chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and finds a good deal of image and rather less substance in the sleek modern interior / My office Image has always meant a lot to Lord Young. When he was running the Department of Trade and Industry, everything had to be British. In his study at home, where old-fashioned family values are foremost, the theme is traditional. As the chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the most important thing is that the look should be modern. 'This is the office of someone who is looking forward,' he says, in case the symbolism had not got through. 'A regency-style office means you are looking backward.' The main statement of modernity is a desk and matching coffee table with a top made of limed oak and legs of oddly contrasting Perspex. The angular black leather sofa and chairs, Venetian blinds and cool grey walls complete the picture. As you would expect from a skilful marketing man, Lord Young has got the tone right: the room is comfortable and light. Even if it is not quite 'utilitarian', as he suggests, it is certainly not ostentatious. Like the man himself, the office is slick; also like him it is strangely lacking in presence. There is no clue either from his surrounding or from his commentary as to how he has risen to the top in both business and politics. The only personal touch - and one which points to a sentimental streak somewhere - is to be found on his computer screen. There Lord Young, who is a keen photographer, has input a photograph of his granddaughter as a background to the electronic menu. Scattered around the room are signs of his previous incarnation. One wall is covered by political cartoons - showing him doing heroic things like cutting through red tape - which he says remind him 'of a misspent decade'. The joke has the flat sound of one that has been often repeated. Another trophy is a cheap metal plaque celebrating the 'Plain English Award' won by a booklet called 'Action for Jobs', which he wrote when he was at the Department of Employment. A red ministerial box sits on a Perspex side table; inside there are no secret papers (these are in a mighty locked cabinet by the door) but a large collection of tangled plugs and wires. These allow Lord Young, who is a more than competent typist, to connect his laptop computer to the telephone system anywhere in the world. On the whole, he seems happy to be back in the comfort of the private sector, and looks supremely relaxed in his dapper navy suit. He is nowhere near so busy as before. His new 'leisurely' life as executive chairman involves working from 9 am to 7 pm in the office and taking papers home with him. He is a great one for lunch and dinner dates, and there are few free slots in his diary for either meal this side of June. He is usually to be found in private dining rooms at the office or at the Savoy Grill 'getting a rapport with people, or cementing a relationship'. In his old Cabinet days he had a private staff of 12 people who made sure 'that I did not waste a second'. Now he gets by with just one secretary, who he says has worked with him for 17 years. Her version is slightly different. Margaret, who sits in a smaller more cluttered room next door, briskly states it is only 16 years that she has worked for him. 'He always gets it wrong,' she says with the sort of dismissive tolerance that makes it clear who is boss. Margaret - like another Margaret in his past - is a capable looking middle-aged aged woman with highlighted hair, who evidently has considerable sway. Indeed, the rapport is so good, that he never dictates letters. 'She writes all my letters,' he says. 'If I wrote them, she'd only re-write them for me.' Lord Young - like most managers these days - insists that his door is always open to any of the other directors who share the sixth floor of the post-modern Mercury house. 'There are no locks on these doors,' he says. Instead there are circular peepholes so that anyone can peer through and see what he is up to. Back in the private sector, Lord Young no longer scans the papers so carefully. 'I used to read them all to see if I was being hit over the head. If I'm being honest - which is a terrible habit - my skin got thinner over the years.' Another difference between this job and his old one, he says, is that these days he is 'more accountable for decisions'. Shareholders in Cable and Wireless might be pleased he is taking such a keen interest in the bottom line; the taxpayer might take a different view.</p>

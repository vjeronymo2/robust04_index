			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 188(f) contains two different legal tests. The first test applies to a waiver of the serious area requirements and requires that EPA determine that anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly before EPA grants such a waiver. The second test applies to a waiver of an area's attainment date and requires that EPA determine that nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly before waiving the attainment date. The first test is more stringent than the second.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Application of the Waiver Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several questions must be answered before the waiver provisions can be applied. Each of these questions is discussed in the subsections that follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What types of sources should be considered anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history of the 1990 Amendments indicates that Congress intended that the term ``nonanthropogenic'' sources of PM&hyph;10 refer to activities where the human role in the cause of such emissions is highly attenuated (see H.R. Rep. No. 490 at 265). Naturally occurring events such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, unusually high pollen counts, and high winds which generate dust from undisturbed land are examples of nonanthropogenic sources that EPA believes meet the intent of Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 emissions are those resulting from human activities. Some of the traditional and nontraditional anthropogenic sources generally considered in PM&hyph;10 SIP's are commercial, institutional, and residential fuel combustion; fossil fuel-fired electric power plants; industrial processes; vehicular traffic on paved and unpaved roads; construction activities; agricultural activities; and other sources of fugitive dust which are directly traceable to human activities and which are reasonably foreseeable incidents of such activities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;86&hyph;001, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, 1987, p. 5&hyph;5, Table 5.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. What criteria should be used in determining when nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly and when anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violation of the NAAQS in the area?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act does not define the term ``contribute significantly'' as it is used in section 188(f), nor does the legislative history provide any useful guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the meaning of a statutory term, a reasonable agency interpretation of the term must be given deference by a reviewing court (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron U.S.A., Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;845 (1984)). The EPA thus believes it has the authority to select reasonable criteria by which to determine when nonanthropogenic/anthropogenic sources in an area do/do not ``contribute significantly'' to levels of pollution which exceed the NAAQS, as well as to consider for this purpose, criteria utilized in other statutory contexts. In light of the different legal tests set forth in section 188(f), the EPA believes that different indicators of significance are needed to serve the statutory purpose of encouraging protection of public health and welfare while avoiding unreasonable control actions. The criteria which EPA believes provide a reasonable approach to making such a determination, as well as a discussion of the basis for selecting these criteria, are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that the term ``contribute significantly'' (or variations of that term) has been interpreted differently throughout the Act, e.g., in the ozone/carbon monoxide programs (see section 107(d)(4)(A)(iv) and (v)), the new source review (NSR) program, and in specific provisions of the statute, such as sections 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) and 126(a)(1)(B). An agency is permitted, but not required, to give a similar meaning to similar terms which appear in different parts of a statute. Thus, although EPA is not bound to adopt the interpretation given the term ``contribute significantly'' in other parts of the statute, it is likewise not precluded from according this use of similar language some interpretive weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS PROTEST CANOGA PARK FIRM'S USE OF RAIN FOREST WOOD  </P> <P> About two dozen environmental activists, many smeared with mud or wearing  masks, demonstrated Monday at the Canoga Park branch of the nation's  third-largest wood- products company to protest imports they say are depleting  the world's rain forests.  </P> <P> The protesters, most of them members of LA Earth First, held 10-foot banners  across the entrance to Georgia-Pacific Corp., 7891 Deering Ave., during most of  the hourlong demonstration.  </P> <P> Robert Pendergast of the Rainforest Action Network said activists are starting  to focus on lumber companies around the country that import materials from rain  forests, hoping the public will boycott their products. Georgia-Pacific's  retail and wholesale outlet in Canoga Park is the only business targeted in the  Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Scientists have predicted that the destruction of rain forests will create a  disastrous global warming trend and lead to the extinction of many plants and  animals.  </P> <P> Georgia-Pacific employees said the protest was misguided. Sheila Weidman,  manager of corporate communications in Atlanta, said the company uses rain  forest lumber only as backing for plywood and attributes much of the decline of  rain forests to agricultural programs.  </P> <P> She did not have figures available showing how much lumber the company imports  from rain forests but said countries that are involved plant trees to replace  those harvested.  </P> <P> At Monday's demonstration, a handful of protesters wore colorful monster masks  signifying the "demon killers" of trees, while others were plastered with mud  to signify "oneness" with the earth.  </P> <P> The only tense moment occurred when protesters tried to stop a truck from  entering the property. About eight demonstrators tried to push the truck  backward as it inched into the company lot.  </P> <P> As a demonstrator yelled "tree and people killers," the truck driver, who  worked for another company, got out of the cab and pushed a man who had climbed  up and opened the passenger door.  </P> <P> About the same time, an employee who was upset about being called a pig angrily  invited a protester to fight. "What about the unborn babies?" yelled forklift  driver Mike Cormier, one of several Georgia-Pacific employees who said it was  more important to fight human abortions than to save trees.  </P></p>

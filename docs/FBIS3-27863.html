			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Economic Planning Agency  Director General Manae Kubota hinted Tuesday [1 February] she  favors a plan to separate the issue of a consumption tax hike  from a reduction in income tax.    A proposal made by the government's Tax Commission last  November on the tax issue appears to be focusing too much on the  concept that the proposed income tax cuts should be financed by  tax revenues, Kubota told a regular press conference.    The scope of such sources could be further expanded, Kubota  said, citing the possibility of unexpected revenues emerging  from "economic adjustment" under various proposals by an  advisory body to the prime minister.    Kubota was referring to the easing of government controls  proposed last year by the advisory group for economic  restructuring.    The Tax Commission tends to think of everything only in  terms  of a tax framework, she explained, while the government advisory  body has a broader framework that would create new business  needs in the future.    Kubota's remarks came at a time when the ruling coalition  parties and the Finance Ministry are engaged in a tug-of-war  over how to finance the income tax cuts which are expected to be  included in the government's new economic stimulus package  Thursday.    The Finance Ministry, adamantly against issuing "untreated"  deficit-financing bonds, or bonds not backed by financial  sources to repay them, has proposed hiking the consumption tax  rate from the current 3 percent.    The coalition parties are in disarray over the issue,  chiefly  due to strong opposition to the consumption tax raise from the  Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the seven-party  coalition.    Kubota, an SDP member, said she hopes the coalition will  reach a consensus that would lead to tax reforms which balance  income and consumption taxes.    Kubota, the head of the agency that is responsible for  formulating the economic package, refrained from specifying the  size of the proposed income tax reductions.</p>

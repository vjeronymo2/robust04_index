			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Intercare restates accounts Intercare Group, the manufacturer and supplier of healthcare products, yesterday restated figures in its 1992 accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. In the 1993 accounts published yesterday, the company amended items in its cash flow statement after agreeing that it had departed from the requirements of FRS 1, the accounting standard which deals with the statement. In the original version, it incorrectly included as cash items shares issued as consideration for an acquisition, which were not cash flows. Mr Gary Vicary, finance director, said: 'It's irritating. This was basically a small technical misclassification. It has no impact on the profit and loss account or the balance sheet and there was full disclosure in the accounts.' The company is audited by Price Waterhouse in Manchester, which did not qualify the 1992 accounts. The Review Panel highlighted in a statement three errors made by Intercare: cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries and cash inflow from financing included sums that were not cash because they related to shares issued as consideration for an acquisition cash consideration for acquisition of subsidiaries did not include the negative balances of cash and cash equivalents acquired in the subsidiary undertakings the figures shown for interest receivable and payable were not on a cash basis, although the difference was not a material amount.</p>

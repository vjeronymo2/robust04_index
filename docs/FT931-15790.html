			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Drug prices Sir, Dr John Griffin (Letters, November 10) and Mr Sonabend (Letters, October 30) have cited different drug price indices for the year 1991. The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, made in 1988 an often cited EC drug price comparison which was updated in 1992 by the German Federation of Pharmacists Association, ABDA. This renewed EC drug price comparison shows a figure for 1991 as: Denmark 143; Netherlands 134; Irish Republic 130; Great Britain 125; Germany 111; Belgium 101; EC average 100; Italy 96; Luxembourg; 95; Greece 86; Spain 84; France 64; Portugal 58.

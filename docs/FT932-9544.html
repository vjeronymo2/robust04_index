			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Local authority watchdog warns on government grants THE FAIRNESS of standard spending assessments, used to distribute government funds of Pounds 40bn per year to local authorities, is called into question today in a report published by the Audit Commission. The commission, a watchdog of local government spending, says the system means 'neither central nor local government accepts responsibility for decisions on particular services'. It also says that a failure to adjust the SSA system before local government reorganisation is brought fully into force would would 'risk triggering significant levels of public protest'. A formula set by the Department of the Environment produces a standard spending level for local authorities, which is used to set the grants they receive from central government, more than 80 per cent of total council spending. The 'cap' by which government limits their spending is also derived using the SSAs. However, the commission questions the All Ages Social Index, which calculates an area's deprivation using social and demographic, not economic, factors. This formula shows Cambridge to be more deprived than Hartlepool, and Cambridge therefore has a higher SSA. According to the commission, 'the complexity of the formula hides underlying key political choices, obscuring decisions and who makes them'. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said the report contained a 'most serious warning' for ministers, and called for an independent commission to allocate grants to councils. He said: 'An independent commission is the only answer. No one trusts these ministers any more to act fairly.' The Department of the Environment said the report would be studied as part of its continuing review of SSAs. It said: 'Standard spending assessments are based on detailed research evidence and calculated according to general principles applied to all authorities.' The department said decisions reached using SSAs were 'fair and reasonable', and said their next revision would be helped by 1991 census data. The Associations of County Councils, District Councils and Metropolitan Authorities all welcomed the report and criticised 'the government's use of SSAs to cap local authorities'.

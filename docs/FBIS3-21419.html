			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inder Malhotra: "Reality of Indo-U.S. Relations"] </F>   [Text] On February 8, the U.S. charge d'affaires  in New Delhi, Mr Kenneth Brill, wrote on this page, under the  heading "All's Well Between India and the United States," that  relations between the two countries were on a "sounder and more  substantial footing than they have been for decades." The  widespread contrary impression, that the Indo-U.S. relationship  is at a "low ebb," he attributed to the media's proclivity to  play up differences, "real or imaginary," rather than positive  developments.    Mr Brill was, of course, doing his duty as any good  professional diplomat would, especially if he carries the heavy  burden of running one of America's largest embassies which has  been without an ambassador for nearly a year. Moreover, and more  importantly, most of what he had to say was doubtless factually  accurate.  <H5>  Big Leap </H5>   It is a fact, for instance, that economic relations between  India and the United States have taken a big leap forward. A  fifth of all Indian exports do go to America, and the two-way  trade in 1993 seems to have touched the record figure of $7  billion, compared with $6 billion in the preceding year.  Equally, if not more, welcome is the dramatic rise in U.S.  investments in this country, more American funds having been  invested during the last 12 months than in the previous four  decades. And, although Mr Brill did not say so, the formation of  an India Interest Group by a number of U.S. corporate giants is  a fact of great importance and something to be built upon.    At the same time, all this adds up to a classic case of  facts  obscuring the truth. For, if it is wrong to overlook or  underplay the significant upswing in Indo-U.S. relations, it is  equally erroneous to concentrate only on positive developments  in the economic sphere and brush aside, with a flippant wave of  the hand, the very real and, at times, hurtful differences of a  political and strategic nature. These are neither imaginary nor  inconsequential.    In any case, to Mr Brill's ill-luck and this country's  growing dismay, shattering blows have been delivered to his  basic thesis within days of the publication of his article. This  was done first by Ms Robin Raphel, arguably the most powerful  assistant secretary of state and the Clinton administration's  "pointsperson" in running South Asia policy, in her speech to  Asia Society. And now President Clinton has added insult to  injury by "sharing Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses  in Kashmir."    This was no off-the-cuff remark. It was a statement of U.S.  policy on the occasion of the presentation of credentials by  Pakistan's new ambassador, Ms Maleeha Lodi, who had not only  embarked on an anti-India tirade but also invited the U.S.  President to use his "good offices" to "put the Kashmir issue on  the front-burner of world attention."    Mr Clinton's subsequent and feeble remark--that his country  also opposed "infringement of individual human rights as a  result of extremism and fanaticism, whether of religious or  secular nature, wherever it occurs"--can in no way diminish the  deep offence he has caused to this country.    Doubtless, strenuous efforts would be made in the coming  days  by Washington to try to limit the damage done by the U.S.  President who is known to have little time for foreign policy  (witness the eight minutes out of 63 devoted to international  affairs during the State of the Union speech) and whose  understanding of the complexities of problems like Kashmir is  even more limited. There would, once again, be homilies that  India should not "over-react" to what has been said. But no  amount of special pleading can explain away the wounding element  in the U.S. policy towards India which remains a complex mix of  the good, the bad and the indifferent.    In order to understand what is really going on, Mr Clinton's  latest performance has to be viewed in the context of his own  two recent letters--which have given great comfort to the  merchants of terror and secession in both Kashmir and  Punjab--and the words and deeds of his hand-picked assistant  secretary of state for South Asia.  <H5>  Vigorous Protest </H5>   No one could have forgotten that, after Ms Raphel's Asia  Society speech, the official spokesman of the external affairs  ministry, not just the much-maligned Indian media, had protested  vigorously against her extraordinary attempt to equate the civil  war in Afghanistan (at least partly a product of America's  massive support to rival Mujahideen groups through the conduit  of Pakistan's infamous ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], now  busy in Kashmir) and the Pakistan-backed scattered insurgencies  by various militant groups in the Indian state of Kashmir. The  sentiment on this score at a subsequent meeting of Parliament's  consultative committee on foreign affairs was even stronger.    It would, of course, be churlish to pretend that all policy  statements on South Asia, emanating from the Clinton  administration, are entirely negative. In Ms Raphel's speech at  Asia Society, as in her earlier testimony to a special panel of  the Senate foreign relations committee, there was a lot about  India which was positive and friendly.    Indeed, what makes Mr Clinton's statement on human rights  abuses in Kashmir as puzzling as it is pernicious is that its  spirit and tenor run counter to what happened at the Senate  panel's hearing on this subject. In her presentation Ms Raphel  had repeatedly emphasised the various actions India has taken to  enforce the observance of human rights in Kashmir and to punish  those who did commit excesses.    So much so that Senator Jesse Helms, a known India-baiter,  interrupted Ms Raphel to exclaim: "But killings took place in  Kashmir last week." To which Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,  now on a visit to Delhi, retorted: "And they will take place  next week, just as they will take place in Belfast." Little of  this percolated to the Indian public but surely the White House  could not have been unaware of the proceedings. That is where  the conclusion is inescapable: that there is a connection  between what the U.S. President has just said and the Kashmir  policy, as enunciated at Asia Society by Ms Raphel.  <H5>  Full Backing </H5>   It is noteworthy that, while equating Afghanistan and  Kashmir  and announcing her government's determination to do something to  bring "warring parties" in both places to the "conference  table," Ms Raphel had told all concerned that this was not her  personal policy but had the full backing of Mr Clinton. The  President's remarks obviously confirm this which means that Ms  Raphel's observations, especially on Kashmir, require close  scrutiny. Even while conceding that there were "limits" to what  the United States could do about Kashmir, she had emphatically  asserted that Kashmir would remain "high" on "my agenda." It is  legitimate to wonder what that agenda might be.    Time was when it appeared that the United States needling,  prodding and hectoring of India over Kashmir was but a ploy to  force it to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This no  longer holds water as any number of ranking Americans have  acknowledged that India would not sign this treaty, no matter  what. It follows therefore that pressures on Kashmir stand on  their own. In this context, is it purely accidental that China,  in top-level talks with Pakistan, has vehemently opposed the  idea of an independent Kashmir which, according to Beijing, is  sponsored by the United States?    This brings me to what the Americans would call the bottom  line. Economics may have become the principal factor in  international transactions. But burgeoning economic relations  between India and the United States by themselves cannot make  for a friendly relationship if, at the same time, India's unity,  territorial integrity, supreme interests and deepest  sensitivities are sought to be trifled with.</p>

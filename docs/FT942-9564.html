			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Fashion: A look that's fine and dandy - Me and My Wardrob / John Morgan discusses clothes with a smart Italian 'I think I shall ask Kohji Tatsuno to design me a suit in the style of Der Rosenkavalier,' says Manfredi della Gheradesca with a seriousness of tone that other men might reserve for talking about an investment in index-linked gilts. He is describing his costume for Minuetto, a fund-raising Venetian masked ball that della Gheradesca is organising at The Royal Academy in June. Sandwiched between Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, it will, he hopes, be one of the great parties of the summer. Count Manfredi della Gheradesca is one of the more social of the insatiably sociable army of smart Italian ex-pats, who find Italy too parochial and New York too frenetic, and base themselves in cosmopolitan but cosy London. He is also, in a community for which narcissism is the official religion, one of its snappiest dressers. 'You only have to look at 15th century frescoes, to see we Italians have always been very concerned about clothes,' he muses, assuming a passable resemblance to a bearded Renaissance saint. An unabashed dandy, della Gheradesca, has inherited more than a title from his forbears. 'My great-grandfather sent his shirts from Tuscany to London to be washed and starched and then there was a great uncle who was a neckwear junkie and left 1,870 ties in his will.' Many of these form the basis of young della Gheradesca's collection of accessories, which includes 300 ties, 80 Swatch watches, 50 waistcoats and 150 pairs of antique spectacles. However, for all his affectations, it would be a mistake to dismiss della Gheradesca as a mere modern day Macaroni. After studying at Florence University, Hunter College and receiving an MA from New York University of Fine Art, della Gheradesca worked as a European private art dealer and gallery manager in Manhattan. Now, as well as raising money for The Royal Academy from a younger generation of patrons, he works as an art-advisor for Citybank Private Bank. 'I act as a private curator buying, insuring, restoring art for a few high-powered international collectors,' explains della Gheradesca, who never thought he would 'end up in a financial institution'. Quite. But is he not rather an exotic figure in the sober world of finance? Is there not a tension between dressing with the probity of the banker and the air of the aesthete? 'Working in the private banking arm, I deal with very high net worth individuals, who tend to be very worldly people, that accept more easily my wearing a Mickey Mouse tie, than those working in commercial banking might. Although I have to conform to a certain extent, my clients are looking for more than the bland banker. In this way the clothes I wear are very much part of the language of my business,' he says. And what a feast of sartorial semiotics they are. Ranging from Balinese sarongs to fur hats fit for a Russian dictator, they kit him out for every fashion eventuality whether it be: 'roller blading in Miami or meeting corporate collectors in Geneva'. His suits have been made-to-measure for the past 14 years at the family tailor in Florence. 'Until recently ready-made suits were a very negative issue in Italy,' says della Gheradesca darkly. He tends to supply the tailor with fabrics he has acquired elsewhere. 'I sometimes like to buy unusual cloths that although appearing slightly 'poor taste', will nevertheless work when made-up. It's part of my own personal challenge of not wearing a uniform.' He favours the looser Italian cut and is currently enamoured of a 1940s silhouette. He feels the 'English military milk bottle-style' and 'too short trouser look favoured by men of obviously Wasp origins', are not for him. He prefers single-breasted styles. 'l don't like double-breasted - all that fabric, buttons and pockets overlapping on the stomach. Also, I am very picky about details. It annoys me particularly if the breast pockets are badly-placed, cuff buttons are too close to the edge of a sleeve and a waistcoat is cut too small.' He also has several blazers: 'Quite the most useful and versatile item in a man's wardrobe.' Shirts are custom-made in Italy. He tends to choose plain colours but, as with his suits, enjoys stretching the boundaries of good taste. 'I like to pick up some dubious taste fabric and have it cut it into a very formal shirt and then wear it with a very serious suit. I hate dressing to perfection. In my opinion, one element of bad taste in an outfit such as a fun watch, silly cuff links and amusing tie, can be playful and amusing. However, you have to learn to play the game - dominate the beast - otherwise you just end up with unadulterated vulgarity.' However, it is the waistcoat that forms the mainstay of il stile della Gheradesca. 'It is a much more satisfying accessory than a tie: there is only so much you can do with a narrow strip of silk, but a waistcoat offers endless possibilities,' he enthuses. He began his love affair with the garment by wearing relatively subdued sporting styles from WH Gidden as a 'sweater substitute against the British climate', but soon graduated to a feathery confection from Favourbrook made entirely from pheasant plumage. 'I quite launched a fashion in Italy, when I wore it for boar hunting.' Now he wears a waistcoat on every possible occasion. The choice includes a lavishly embroidered 18th century example bought at Sotheby's, a funky one made from US college flags, an amusing numero from Italy constructed from a patchwork of ceramic tiles and several ethnic ones. Della Gheradesca lavishes as much attention on his casual clothes as his more formal outfits. 'I learned about casual dressing in America, where the compelling need to dress down has resulted in the best casual clothes in the world.' In addition to endless sweat pants, denim shirts and hounds-tooth jackets beloved of a certain class of Italian, he has 20 pairs of jeans. 'I adore wearing jeans because they are the only garments that change as you wear them. By the time you have thrown them away, if ever, they have undergone a complete metamorphosis.' He is also intrigued by the fashionable 'rich man's, poor man's look' and adores buying downbeat utility clothes that are made in luxury fabrics. 'The secret to stylish dressing is not to show you are trying too hard,' says della Gheradesca. And does he have this quality? 'I think I give myself away in small ways.'

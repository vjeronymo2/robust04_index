			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / People: Jack Gleeson Jack Gleeson, former chairman and managing director of construction, housebuilding and property group, MJ Gleeson, has died at the age of 84. He held the two top posts at the company for 38 years following the retirement in 1950 of his uncle MJ Gleeson, who founded the company in 1903. Jack's nephew Dermot became md in 1988 but Jack remained non-executive chairman until his death. He ran away from home at Cloonmore in west Ireland at the age of 16 to travel to Sheffield where his uncle reluctantly agreed to employ him and rose rapidly as the company expanded. It was under Jack Gleeson that the group went public in 1960. The extended Gleeson family still owns about 40 per cent of the company. The business in the year to June 1993 made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.2m on a turnover of Pounds 168m. It has yet to announce a new chairman.</p>

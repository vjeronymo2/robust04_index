			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Droughts send world tea prices higher DROUGHT IN Africa, southern India and Sri Lanka has curbed world tea production, sending London auction prices steadily higher since the beginning of the year. Quality tea this week fetched 180p a kilogram, compared with 150p in early January. Over the same period good medium quality tea has risen from 115p to 135p a kilogram. 'It has changed from a buyers' to a sellers' market,' said one trader yesterday. The drought in Africa has hit production in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Kenya, where problems are thought to have been exacerbated by tribal unrest. In Sri Lanka and southern India, which had record crops last year in conditions generally considered ideal, drought also led to output cuts. At the same time stocks in consuming countries are low. In the UK, still the biggest tea importer, basic stocks are down to just over 30.6m kg from last year's 34.4m kg, itself considered to be a low level. The destocking was prompted by high interest rates, a weak market and improvements in efficiency, observers believe. Further complicating the picture has been the reappearance of buying by the Russians, who had been staying away because of their lack of hard currency. 'If the Russians stay in, the outlook is quite favourable,' one trader said yesterday. Mr Illtyd Lewis, executive director of the Tea Council, said most tea offered at the London auction had been taken up recently. Buyers were taking fully into account the climatic conditions, the Russians and low stock levels. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects black tea production this year to fall by 20,000 tonnes to 1.69m tonnes. It estimates consumption at 1.73m tonnes. The best hope for an improvement in prices is the continuation of the decline in world export availability, the EIU says in its latest World Commodity Forecasts.</p>

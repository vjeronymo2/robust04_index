			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, Defence Correspondent, PA News] </F>   [Text] The Royal Navy was forced tonight to postpone the  first launch of a Trident ballistic missile from a British  submarine because of protests by Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear  campaigners claimed.    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was aboard the 16,000-ton  HMS Vanguard submerged off the coast of Florida to witness the  historic firing of the unarmed Trident II D-5 missile.    But as Vanguard put its mast out of the water, Greenpeace  activists converged on the area in inflatables, while their  helicopter hovered overhead.    "One of our merchant ships Solo was in the area and we were  able to identify Vanguard's precise position when they put up  its mast," said a Greenpeace spokeswoman in London.    "We launched inflatables as well as the ship's helicopter  and  the test firing has had to be postponed."    The Ministry of Defence [MoD] said it was awaiting  information from its vessels in the area.    Vanguard, first of the fleet of four Trident submarines and  built by VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria took missiles on  board at the US facility at King's Bay, Georgia.    Britain is buying 70 US missiles, which it will arm with  British-manufactured nuclear warheads, to replace the existing  Polaris system gradually from the end of this year.    The aim of the first firing on the US range off Cape  Canaveral was to prove that the crew could safely handle and  operate the sophisticated missile system.    The US Navy has successfully test fired 55 D-5 missiles  after  a disastrous first firing when the missile careered out of  control like a giant Catherine Wheel firework.    The MoD said later: "Due to the intrusion of a number of  surface vessels that have sailed into the range area, the launch  of the UK's first Trident II D-5 missile has been temporarily  delayed."    Greenpeace said a US Navy helicopter was attempting to force  its helicopter out of the area.</p>

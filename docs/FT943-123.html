			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: USAir to pass payout on preferred stocks The financial troubles of USAir, the loss-making US airline in which British Airways owns a 24.6 per cent stake, deepened yesterday with the announcement that it would pass the quarterly dividend on two classes of its preference stock. The decision would cost BA about Dollars 25m in a full year. It would cost Mr Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment group, another large investor, about Dollars 33m. The move sent BA shares tumbling in London yesterday with the shares losing 16p, more than 4 per cent, to close at 348p. BA shares have fallen by just over 6 per cent during the last two days. The announcement, which raises further concern about the financial health of USAir, prompted fears that BA would have to carry out its threat to write off all or part of its Dollars 400.7m investment in the troubled US carrier. Earlier this month, it suffered its fifth fatal accident in five years with the crash of a passenger airliner outside Pittsburgh, killing 132 people. However, BA remains confident its partnership with USAir will this year achieve Pounds 70m-worth (Dollars 110.6m) in gains from added revenues and savings from its combined operations with the US carrier. BA said it had this year received half the annual Dollars 25m in dividends due on its preferred shares. However, Mr Chris Avery, the London-based aviation analyst at Paribas, said the announcement 'is more evidence of the very deep difficulties facing USAir'. An increasing number of City analysts expect the US carrier to file for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although the airline is not facing an immediate liquidity crisis. The decision is seen as a signal of USAir's willingness to share sacrifices with its unions, from which it is seeking wage concessions. USAir's shares dropped Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 4.</p>

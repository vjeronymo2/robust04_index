			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of an unspecified number of installments of an </F> "abridgment" of an interview with Workers Party of Kurdistan,  PKK, leader Abdullah Ocalan by Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip Duran, and  Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas Lebanon on 21 March]    [Text] [Reporter] In your cease-fire proposal there is the  following important message to the Turkish public: "We do not  insist on the division of Turkey." By this, do you mean to say  that the real representatives of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples  should come together and initiate a new process of democratic  reconstruction?    [Ocalan] Of course. Contrary to public perception, I am not  engaging in "maneuvers." I do not think it is suitable to  consider Kurdish independence in the form of separation from  Turkey, even if we forge a military capability capable of doing  so. This is certainly not my ideal solution. We want to  discuss this issue with those sectors that really want to think  about and understand Turkey and solve her problems. That is, we  do not believe that the Kurdish problem can be solved without  Turkey, or that Turkey can advance without solving the Kurdish  problem, or surmounting some of these problems. I can clearly  demonstrate this. Even the present intensity of the war has  halted Turkey's progress. Everything is tied to the war effort.  Even they themselves have been saying so for the last two  years. This trend will escalate, thereby undermining the  internal balances in Turkey, and it will push the country into a  major crisis and wreck it. Hence, those who really love Turkey  and are concerned about it should come forward now.    I know well the mentality of the special warfare forces.  This mentality has been evident not only today, but during all  the previous Kurdish uprisings. The mentality is: "Suppress  the Kurds, massacre and hang some of them, and force the rest to  surrender. That is how the problem will be solved." The method  of repression is evident: "This job can then be completed by  starting a process of assimilation." This has been the official  thesis for the last 70 years. We are now proving the futility  of this thesis. One cannot ensure Turkey's territorial  integrity this way. The Kurdish principalities had considerably  greater autonomy even under the Ottoman Empire. They were even  in power for a long period. Compared to the Turkish Republic's  oppression and assimilation system, the Ottoman tolerance was a  splendid blessing. There was no Ottoman pressure on the Kurdish  language and culture. The republic ushered in a policy of  suppressing and eroding identity! A policy of destroying a  centuries old culture. It tells the Kurds: "Stop being  yourselves." This is a heavy punishment, a frightening  humiliation! The effects of the official ban on language, on  people's minds and psychology must be understood.    And, here I am not even talking about economic, social, and  political conditions. Already, even the slightest political  stirring is punishable by execution! One must realize what  effect all this will have on the people. There should be some  progress beyond this republic's theory of national unity and  integrity. All right, you Turks managed to deport the  Armenians. It was a solution for you. The Kurds face an even  worse situation than the Armenians, but you are unable to deport  them. Why are you unable to deport the Kurds? Because there  are various [Kurdish] clans and there are the mountains. The  situation is a bit different. The suppression and genocide of  the Armenians cannot be effectively applied in the case of the  Kurds. It has now been realized that the genocide of our  identity will lead nowhere and Turkey will face bottlenecks  henceforth. Can Turkey achieve a turning point at this stage?  Can the state's official ideology and policy chart a new  course? These are their own problems. But, these last few  governments have persistently tried to press ahead with the  policy of the last 70 years, and at least for some time to come.  [Former president Turgut] Ozal tried to end this policy but  died under mysterious circumstances. As for us, we have to  issue a call to our banner. Being the bearers of Turkey's  70-year old policy, this government, or a possible national  front government, will want to continue with this policy. They  will say: "Let us continue the war for yet another year." At  this point, let me also say the following: We have made  preparations to continue the war for yet another year. Look at  our strength in 1993; and if it means anything to you, our  strength in 1994 will be at least quadruple that! At present  our armed forces number around 20,000. If we wish to, we can  increase it to 30,000 at any time! Supposing that each  guerrilla is equivalent to 10 soldiers; then, if we lose 30,000  people they will lose 300,000! It is not difficult to arrive at  this figure, judging by last year's casualty figures.    [Reporter] But, those in Turkey who think that there can be  no talk of any solution before the "PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] is completely eradicated" are still very influential.  To what extent does such an approach obstruct a possible  solution?    [Ocalan] To persist with this mentality means the  destruction  of Turkey. Could they ever venture to inflict so much  destruction on Turkey? Undoubtedly, some would. People like  [leader of Nationalist Movement Party, NMP, Alparslan] Turkes  are saying "we can destroy the PKK." His companions might  venture to try such a thing. But let me state that we will not  remain silent if they do try it. If they launch a massive  massacre, we will definitely defend ourselves! We too could  speak in the language that Turkes understands. He has  frequently massacred leftists and committed big massacres. Now,  he is forming a special army. We know that the special army is  being organized by his men. They are all members of the NMP.  We will form a special army in response! We will raid their  homes! We will raid their villages! If they escalate the  conflict, we will do the same! We will move against these  fascist leaders if the Turkish people do not break with them.  We will move against them because we do not consider them to be  a part of the Turkish people, but fascists. We will not harm a  hair of any Turk who does not side with the fascists. Such an  escalation of the conflict is not our choice. But the opposing  side might want to escalate the conflict. The counterguerrilla  faction and Turkes' supporters within the state belong to the  group that wants to escalate the conflict. They want to  escalate the war to eradicate the PKK and the Kurdish people.  They showed this inclination in their recent behavior in  parliament. We will try to stop this trend and we will succeed!  It is time for us to listen to the voice of reason.    [Reporter] What does the "voice of reason" say?    [Ocalan] Let us remove the shadow of force from  Kurdish-Turkish relations; we are ready for any solution. I  assure you of this. I am saying: Renounce the use of force and  let us rearrange things according to the free democratic choice  of the peoples, firmly within the existing borders! I am not  evading this; rather I am stating it openly. I guarantee this,  if you have the power to bring about such a solution! I ask:  Where is the separatism in this? They repeatedly claim that  "the PKK will divide and dismember the country." The public  should not be taken in by such claims. We believe that the  improvement in relations will generate enormous riches, that  democracy will uplift the peoples, and that it will also be an  enormous gain for Turkey if the Kurdish people develop their  culture, it will enrich our lives and uplift every individual!  This is what I want! Is it a sign of magnanimity to utterly  degrade the opposite side? By way of example, would you be able  to enjoy the friendship of your spouse if you beat her every  day, maimed her, and even cut out her tongue?    [Reporter] A provision in the decisions adopted at the  Brussels conference calls on you to inform the Swiss Government  that you will abide by the Geneva Convention. Are you thinking  of complying with this call even if there is an intensification  of the conflict?    [Ocalan] We expressed our desire to abide by this convention  a long time ago. But, Turkey rejected it by refusing to  recognize us as a counterpart. Anyway, Turkey does not  recognize us as a belligerent party. There is a de facto war.  They also know this, but they deny its de jure existence. Of  course, we would like to abide by the Geneva Convention. Let me  state that we will abide by the war conventions word by word.  But, the other side has a counterguerrilla organization, and  there are many unsolved murders. Is there a war convention that  contains provisions about unsolved murders? Theirs is a dirty  war, unrivaled even by the wars of the Middle Ages! In those  times they had their own methods of fighting, but nothing like  this existed. Theirs is a dirty, filthy war. We want to abide  by the war conventions. But they are not abiding by them.    [Reporter] Speaking realistically, do you expect the  official  circles to respond to your call for a cease-fire by this spring  or summer? The General Staff regards these months as  advantageous for this.    [Ocalan] We entertain no such cheap illusions. But making  such a proposal at the beginning of spring was important from  the point of view of our going on record as one of the  belligerents in the conflict.    A feeling of responsibility is also important. We want peace  and a democratic solution. We hope this problem will be solved  without bloodshed. This is an expression of goodwill. Will the  Turkish General Staff take it seriously? This is a General  Staff that thinks it is above everything. It sees itself as  more powerful than the Ottoman sultans. But, it has to start  thinking about the heavy cost of this war, about who would gain  or lose during the spring and summer months. Supposedly they  were going to finish us during the heavy winter conditions.  Check out carefully who really faced difficulty during the  winter. The guerrillas might gain great advantage in the coming  months. In the meantime, we are improving our combat methods.    They have already launched the spring offensive. There is an  operation around Gabar Mountain. According to our observations,  some 12,000 to 13,000 troops and village guards took part in it.  They lost at least 80 troops killed and 150 injured, and then  withdrew, leaving behind a considerable amount of military  hardware on the battlefield. This is despite the fact that  Gabar Mountain is close to where the army has been massed. This  is how their major spring offensive is faring. They are now  attacking Mount Ararat. According to wireless reports from  Ararat, more than 40 troops were killed on 19 and 20 March.  They suffered twice as many wounded. We lost only two  guerrillas. We lost four guerrillas on Gabar Mountain. This is  an indication as to who will achieve better results in spring.  I know how well trained our forces are. We have never been so  sure of ourselves.    [Reporter] Aside from Ararat and Gabar, how do you view the  general situation in the region?    [Ocalan] Lately, area meetings have been held and a  restructuring of forces was carried out. Take Botan [region  covering Semdinli, Baskale, Hakkari, Uludere, Cukurca, Sirnak,  Cizre, and Catak], where we will attempt to establish a federal  government. At present our influence there is greater than that  of the state, our weight is greater there. We will spread the  area of this influence. We will also establish local  governments in other provinces, and it is highly likely that we  will run these governments. We already have nearly a 10,000-man  guerrilla force in Botan. This is a very powerful force. Some  60 to 70 percent of the territory there is under our control.  It could be stated that despite strong attacks, the army is  unable to enter it, whereas we are enlarging our own army there.  They want to subjugate Serhat [region covering Kars, Agri,  Erzurum, and Van], but they are unable to go higher than the  foothills of Mount Ararat. In Dersim they are unable to venture  out of the city. They also tried to penetrate the  Diyarbakir-Bingol-Mus triangle, but could not even prevent the  guerrillas from consolidating there. They also could not evict  the guerrillas from Kozluk, Sason, Mutki, Tatvan, and Hizan --  these regions form the Garzan line. There are guerrilla cells  on Taurus, and in an area extending from Malatya to Binbogalar  to Adiyaman. No matter how many plans of destruction the  General Staff draws up, they will not be very effective. It  will only lead to bloodshed; the spring and summer of 1994 will  be violent. We might also suffer losses during this period, but  the Army will lose at least 10,000 men. We really do not want  this degree of butchery of the troops.    [Reporter] This would mean a major crisis for Turkey?    [Ocalan] Definitely, and the already paralyzed economy will  reach the point of complete collapse. Probably only then will  some people really start to think about a solution. I think at  that point this government will leave--should leave--the scene.  Those pro-special warfare people who are shaping this  government's policy will be called to account. Maybe only then  might the democratic alternative be placed on the agenda.    [Reporter] Could the opposite happen? Could Turkey attack  the region in a manner similar to the Serbian attack on Bosnia?    [Ocalan] They are already walking along that path.    [Reporter] But, this is being concealed from the public?    [Ocalan] You are correct when you say that this is being  hidden behind the screen of the Serbian massacres committed in  Bosnia. The attacks on the Kurds in Kurdistan is worse than the  Serbian attacks on Bosnia! The Turkish public does not know  this because the special warfare forces have extraordinary  control over the press. Turkey's emulation of the Serbian  attacks will become obvious once the Bosnian issue moves toward  a solution.    [Reporter] Will we too have Milosevics?    [Ocalan] What Milosevic? There will be worse and more  extremists ones. Let me remind you, the General Staff has some  plans of repression. We believe that the final stage of the  plan envisages the complete destruction of villages and the  massacre of everyone having any link with us. This plan is now  in force. They might escalate the implementation of this plan.  They have already destroyed more than 1,000 villages. Only, a  few thousand more villages remain. They will also destroy them.  Because of the destruction of the villages, cities, primarily  Diyarbakir, have grown in population. Writing in the THE TIMES  [not further specified], an American said: "The situation in  Diyarbakir reminded me of America's fate in Vietnam." They have  interesting observations. The situation here is similar to  Saigon when the fortunes of the war turned against America. He  is saying: "I have now seen both Saigon and Diyarbakir."    They brought the war to this stage. You know what the  situation is like in Diyarbakir. It is ready to explode. They  emptied the villages and now a single huge village has cropped  up. What are they going to do with that big village? Where are  they going to send the people from there? They expanded  Istanbul and gave it a peasant character. Istanbul will vanish  with further peasantation. Is this a solution? It will backfire  if they transport so many Kurds to Istanbul. Already this  policy has Kurdified Cukurova, and the Aegean is fast becoming  Kurdified.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): Brokers' prayers are answered at last - Japanese fund managers return to market A recent visit by leading Japanese brokerage officials to Ise Shrine, an important Shinto sanctuary, to pray for a recovery of the Tokyo stock market, may have failed to support share prices, but it seems to have brought Japanese institutional investors back into the market. The recent falls in the stock market are pushing share prices to levels which make the Tokyo market's value seem reasonable. Leading life insurance companies recently said they were considering stepping up purchases of Japanese shares. During the first half of the business year, sharp declines in interest rates prompted increased bond investments. However, investors are becoming increasingly wary that bond prices may be peaking out, and are searching for alternative investments. With buying by foreign investors and public pension funds petering out, Japanese stocks failed to find support until recently. But the Tokyo market broke through the main psychological support levels in November, making stocks more attractive. Nippon Life, the country's largest life insurance company, says it will actively buy stocks of companies with good earnings performances if the stock market continues to decline. The company bought stocks worth Y30bn in November. Officials at Sumitomo Life said the company purchased Y50bn during October and November. Investment in tokkin, or specified trust funds, by insurance companies, which accounts for about 3.8 per cent of total assets, were up by 19 per cent over the last year. Foreign investors and public funds have been the main buyers of Japanese shares. Public pension funds have been pumped into the market by the government to prop up share prices since the Nikkei plunged to a six year low in August last year. The sharp appreciation of the yen attracted foreign investors, and foreigners have been the leading buyers since last March. However, a recent halt in the yen's price has caused profit taking; overseas investors have become net sellers of Japanese shares since the end of September. Until recently, domestic investors invested heavily in the bond market. Life insurers, the largest category of institutional investor with total assets of Y157,000bn, actively placed funds in the government bond market. Bond yields have fallen sharply as the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate to a record low 1.75 per cent. According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo, total investments in bonds by life insurers rose by 42 per cent during the year to June, accounting for almost half of net cash flow. Government bond investments rose by 71 per cent, while local government bond investments rose by 66 per cent. In sharp contrast to bond investments, life insurers' attitudes to shares have been conservative. Equity investment has fallen to below 20 per cent, with only 5.8 per cent, or Y710bn of net cash flow, invested in the stock market. The strength of the yen has taken away incentive for Japanese institutions to invest overseas. 'We're trying to reduce European and US investments because of currency movements and the high prices,' says a fund manager at Tokio Fire and Marine, a non-life insurance company. Uncertainty over the Nafta trade negotiations has also been a reason to restrain allocation of assets to the US. Overseas investments have been reduced by life insurance companies over the past year by Y1,100bn to about 10 per cent of total assets. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at the second investment division of Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, expects to maintain a portfolio weighted heavily towards bond investments, keeping weightings in equities at a minimum. He expects a further rise in government bond prices, but does not see an upturn in the stock market and advises taking profits in equity holdings. Meanwhile, Japanese fund managers have recently joined in the rush among US institutions to invest in Asian markets, where growth potential is expected to overcome currency risk. Over Y210,000bn in Asian funds has been established this year. Nomura Investment Trust set up two large scale investment trusts based in the region at the end of October. But Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, believes that Japanese institutional investors are eventually going to be forced to invest in the Tokyo stock market because of the lack of alternatives. Some insurance companies are becoming increasingly nervous about the rise in the bond market, and are starting to take profits. Growth in corporate loans, which accounts for 40 per cent of life insurers' assets, is likely to be difficult to sustain, as demand for funds is declining. Companies have slashed capital spending, and refinancing needs for equity-linked bonds issued during the late 1980s have also peaked. Property investments have grown strongly. Mr James believes that low interest rates and low equity weightings at financial institutions offer buying opportunities which could 'represent the start of a sustainable new trend.'</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Capital injection of FM 1.7bn for Finnish bank KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest commercial bank, announced yesterday that it would take a FM 1.7bn (Dollars 422m) financial injection from the Finnish government to strengthen its capital base and improve its capital requirement ratio. The capital provision will bring an estimated immediate increase of about FM20bn in the bank's lending capacity. The group's half-year results, due to be released at the end of next month, are expected to show a continuing loss. The capital injection comes from a FM8bn provision made by the Finnish government in June to strengthen the capital base of Finnish banks. This follows the creation earlier in the year of a FM20bn government deposit guarantee fund established in response to a serious deterioration in the country's banking sector caused by mounting loan losses. The financial injection to KOP takes the form of a preferred capital certificate and carries a coupon of 0.50 per cent a year over one-year Finnish government Treasury bills until the end of 1997. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chairman and chief executive, said that the bank had been looking at ways of strengthening its capital base to ensure capital adequacy requirements would 'under no circumstances' constrain its operations. 'The capital investment offered by the state has turned out to be the most attractive alternative,' he added. As a result of the capital injection, KOP said its capital ratio will rise by nearly 1.5 per cent under both Bank of International Settlement and local regulations. At the end of April the ratio stood at 8.9 per cent. Since he became head of KOP last February, Mr Voutilainen has been carrying out a comprehensive programme of rationalisation of its organisation which has included halving the size of its executive committee, a cut of 10 per cent in the bank's payroll by the end of the year and a shift in the focus of KOP's activities to basic banking services through a reallocation of its capital from real estate.</p>

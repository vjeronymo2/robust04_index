			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP],  participated in the closing session of the workers parliament  held at the National Center for Scientific Research, Cenic, the  last one scheduled in the timetable for these meetings.    [Begin Alarcon recording] I want to say, first of all, that  we must have a scientific approach, trying to do things  rigorously, trying to get to the roots of the problem, as many  have said. I can assure you that if the much ballyhooed measures  existed in somebody's pocket -- please, give us the benefit of  the doubt by not taking us to be so stupid as not to realize  that the country's problems are so serious and complex that we  have never thought of pulling those much discussed measures out  of our pockets. This looks like a secondary issue, but it is  not. We must be aware that these problems are not easy and  simple; they will not be solved the day after the National  Assembly meeting. [end recording]    The parliament at the Cenic was not at the level of others  insofar as analysis of the center's efficiency is concerned, and  Alarcon said that the most important decisions must be adopted  in the workers parliaments.    [Begin Alarcon recording] I have seen measures adopted here  by workers who do not have a dining room, who have no work  clothes, who have no work shoes or protective gloves for  handling harmful substances, but who have been able thoroughly  to discuss the concrete problems of that factory or unit, to see  ways to produce more at lower cost; or in the work centers where  they have to pay 1.60 or 1.30 pesos a meal, they agreed to  reduce that deficit -- because it is part of the country's  deficit -- they agreed to pay for what they are receiving. These  are two examples that come to my mind after participating in  several dozen workers parliaments over the past few weeks.    These are concrete measures our hard working people are  adopting at this moment; and here there are people working under  deplorable and difficult conditions and who also produce  products that generate currency they never see, not even from a  distance, and who neither can have, as is the case with some  workers of the tobacco industry, working conditions like those  in other areas of our country. [end recording]    Alarcon also discussed adjustment measures implemented in  other countries, based on reduced social expenditures and wages,  on worker layoffs, and the closing of unprofitable companies.  Alarcon said:    [Begin Alarcon recording] The essential question is this: Do  we want this? Do we want the free, universal education program  to be eliminated? Do we want the free, public, and universal  health program to be eliminated? Do we want the aged, the  retired worker, or the worker who lost his job to be abandoned?  If that is what we want, I think we do not need workers  parliaments or ANPP meetings, if adjustment measures are adopted  every day. The only thing we have to do then is to take the IMF  model and implement it; that is all.    In our case -- and I can tell you I am fully convinced that  this is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the workers  of this country -- we can start from the basic element, that we  must save this social project; that we must look for a socialist  way to face this problem, and not by privatizing public  education and health, abandoning the poor and the aged or  disregarding their right for social solidarity, liberating  prices, eliminating subsidies on production, etc. What will  prevail then is the law of the jungle, which is capitalism. [end  recording]    The ANPP president stressed the double objective of the  parliaments in work places.    [Begin Alarcon recording] One important aspect of these  workers parliaments, of these meetings, has been that each and  every one has been able to express his or her opinion or point  of view, or any idea on how to face the national, general  problem of the country's financial situation, but also and above  all, to analyze the specific set of problems of each center, to  try to identify problems and solutions the unit might have, and  especially to see that the solutions found to those problems are  implemented.    I can tell you that in some of those meetings in which we  participated we have been able to verify with satisfaction that  more than one of those measures adopted by the workers are in  effect. Besides -- we have been able to verify this in the area  of tobacco -- the same factories we visited in January and in  February, factories that through their workers parliaments began  to discuss concrete measures to be adopted in those factories,  today are producing 110 and 115 [figures as heard] more,  depending on the factory, as compared to their production before  that date. [end recording]    Alarcon said that we Cubans have grown accustomed to free  and  universal education and health programs, social security, and  welfare. But these benefits cost the country 4.3 billion pesos  every year.    [Begin recording] Much has been said about the prices of  some  products on the black market. And it is true. It is also true  that supply to the market controlled by the state is  experiencing a slump. We are all aware of this. But for many  years, and also today, the scarce products, with very few  exceptions, have been subsidized for many years. That is, what  we pay for rice today is not what it costs or what the state  pays for it, because it must be bought from elsewhere in the  world and must be paid for in hard currencies, currencies which  are associated with the hard currency stores but do not exist  for hard currency stores alone, but for many other things.    We can also talk about bread, because many workers complain  about the quality of bread, etc. But bread does not just fall  from the sky as manna; it comes out of the oven, and wheat to  become bread must be put into that oven. And wheat must be  purchased at a price which is not what we pay for bread. Bread  may be of poor quality and scarce, but for years these products  have been subsidized by our society. By subsidizing that staple  product the country has been spending more than 400 million  pesos every year. [end recording]    Alarcon said that 69 percent of our industries are not  profitable, and that keeping them in operation costs more than  they contribute, especially since they do not have the raw  materials or input they had before, because they have lost the  market. However, we are not going to follow the neoliberal  policy of closing those industries and laying off workers,  because they are not to blame for the drop in the country's  import capacity from more than $8 billion to $1.7 billion in  1993. To solve the current economic situation, preserving the  conquests of socialism, is very complex; but it is worth making  all necessary effort. And for this reason the parliaments have  been called in the work places.    These were some of the basic ideas expressed by Ricardo  Alarcon on closing the workers parliament at the Cenic.</p>

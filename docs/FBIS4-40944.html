			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council and Duma are to receive from  President Yeltsin Tuesday or Wednesday a bill on the Prosecutor  General's Office. The Council's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko  announced in the parliament's upper house on Tuesday that  Yeltsin will submit the document as part of his legislative  initiative.    Shumeyko explained that Yeltsin is offering lawmakers the  opportunity to first discuss the role of the Prosecutor  General's Office and only "then choose a person to run it."    So far Aleksey Ilyushenko has been acting as Prosecutor  General, despite the fact that he has proved unpopular in the  Federation Council.    After Shumeyko's statement, the issue of making the proposal  on a Prosecutor General part of the session's agenda was put to  a vote at several legislators insistence. However, it was not  included in the agenda because the motion did not collect the  necessary number of votes.</p>

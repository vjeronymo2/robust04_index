			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Army called out in Srinagar The Indian army was called out in Srinagar, Kashmir, yesterday, after paramilitary troops failed to enforce a curfew for the fourth consecutive day, following the killing of a seven-year-old boy and his parents by Border Security Force personnel at the weekend, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Shops and offices remained closed as hundreds of Kashmiris took to the streets defying the curfew to protest against the killing of the family at point-blank range in their home in Daribal-Khanyar, in Srinagar. At least 20 people have died since Sunday night, in police firing to quell the demonstrations, and over 50 people are injured and being treated in the city's hospitals.</p>

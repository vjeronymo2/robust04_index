			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Grigoryevich Zaytsev, former deputy </F> director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Latin  America and now trade representative to Mexico, conducted by  Vladimir Krestyaninov, the journal's editor in chief; date and  place not given]    [Text] In late 1993, Nikolay Zaytsev, who for several  years held the post of deputy director of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Institute of Latin America, was appointed trade  representative to Mexico. On the eve of his departure, he  visited the journal's editorial office and answered the  questions of editor in chief Vladimir Krestyaninov.    [Krestyaninov] You, Nikolay Grigoryevich, are a doctor of  sciences and an economist who has worked in the Academy of  Sciences system and is suddenly leaving for the foreign trade  sphere. What is the reason?    [Zaytsev] Mr. editor in chief, there is no secret here and  it  can seem strange only superficially. Now is generally a time of  surprise appointments, but as for me, up to now I have  considered myself a cadre foreign trade employee: my first job  was the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Specifically I was involved  in the problems of Cuba and Latin America. My work in  Switzerland was also connected to foreign trade. I do not think  that I am leaving academic activity, and academic regalia will  not be an obstacle. I am simply returning to what I began with,  and I am traveling to work in Mexico with a good, business-like  attitude.    [Krestyaninov] In your opinion, what is the level of  Russia's  trade-economic ties with Mexico as of today?    [Zaytsev] I cannot answer that question unequivocally.  Traditionally the flow of goods in the two directions was  relatively small. The situation has been the same in recent  years. The volumes of trade are no more than 40-50 million  dollars, which is not much for countries like Mexico and Russia.  But it is noteworthy that in recent years very interesting  contracts have been signed to supply sets of equipment from the  former Soviet Union, from Russia now, and from a number of other  CIS republics, above all Ukraine. These deliveries are  concentrated in the power engineering sphere. Russian companies  are exporting equipment for large GES's [hydroelectric power  station] which are being built in Mexico. There are also  deliveries for other energy installations. We have good  prospects for the incursion of other types of equipment; among  others Khimmasheksport [Chemical Machine Export] is actively  working on this market. A contract for exporting equipment to  produce prussic acid has been signed and is being realized. A  contract for assembling tractors produced at the Lipetsk and  Vladimir plants continues to be realized, though not at as rapid  a rate as before. These machines are the same ones which were in  demand in Mexico back in the 1970s, although the market, I  repeat, is complex and practically no operations to ship  components to assemble them have been carried out this year.  There is also some progress in such directions as deliveries of  aviation equipment--above all helicopters--and Ural trucks,  which may also arouse the interest of Mexican buyers. Although  it must be admitted that this was done in previous years.    As for imports, instead of a number of the traditional  Mexican goods, we continue to buy large batches of pipe. The  import of particular types of consumer goods like coffee, above  all instant, cigarettes, and certain other goods is being  expanded. And characteristically, this is being done to a  significant degree by independent commercial structures.    [Krestyaninov] Will the signing of NAFTA in some way help  or,  on the contrary, hinder the development of our ties?    [Zaytsev] That is a very interesting question. You know, I  think that 17 November, that is, the day when American  legislators in fact responded positively to the North American  Free Trade Agreement, will determine the development of  economics and politics in the northern part of America for the  long-term perspective. And, of course, NAFTA will both directly  and indirectly affect Russia's interests, and I may be wrong,  but it is more likely to be negatively. Serious additional  competition may appear for us in the United States and Canada  for a number of those goods which we can still move and are  moving onto those markets. In the medium term, as our economy is  normalized and becomes more competitive in terms of realizing  international deals, I think that NAFTA must be treated as a  kind of given. Undoubtedly this bloc is not closed but half  open, and I assume that in the future one could in fact conceive  of categories for setting up particular competitive production  facilities, say, on Mexico's territory, like the "maquiladoras,"  in order later to move this output onto the markets of the  United States and Canada. And there are already some concrete  proposals in this direction. Among others, those small  production facilities which we have, in Canada for example, I  think could in time be more profitable in Mexico and could  support commercial interests in the entire subregion. I repeat  that this question has not yet been raised on the practical  level. So one of the first tasks for me right away will be to  figure out seriously and in detail what this means for Russia's  foreign economic interests.    [Krestyaninov] But in addition to that, what in your opinion  hinders the more serious development of our trade-economic ties  today?    [Zaytsev] I think there are traditional obstacles of an  objective nature and some new difficulties. As for the  traditional factors, I think that all the same I must  unequivocally say that Mexico and the Soviet Union and Mexico  and Russia have essentially never opened their doors to one  another and have not even tried to. Mexico is traditionally  oriented to the northern market, that is understandable. But its  policy of diversification of foreign-economic ties is notable,  even with the signing of NAFTA, and I think that even Russia  will sooner or later but inevitably be included in it. And on  our part, the new entrepreneurial circles have not yet marked  the position which Mexico will take in their export and import  strategy or in the movement and attraction of foreign  investments. In my understanding, this country is no longer a  traditional developing state. In the past 5-6 years, in  conditions of very great economic difficulties, Mexico was able  to realize an exceptionally powerful set of structural  transformations. Today Mexico has a modern infrastructure and  competitive industry and has every possibility of another leap  into the future. I do not think that a Latin American "tiger"  such as Mexico should escape our attention.    Among the difficulties of a traditional nature I would add  distance, since what can be saved or lost on freight is quite  important. I will also mention the circumstance that by no means  do we always have adequate potential to finance export-import  transactions.    As for difficulties related directly to the present stage,  the instability of our economic situation must be singled out of  course. I mean those problems which we still have and sometimes  are even accelerating on the level of realizing foreign economic  operations, including a weak legislative base and the  inexperience of some new commercial organizations, which for now  are not always qualified to work on the new markets. But I  believe it is unproductive to speak only of difficulties. I  would raise the question above all of the possibility of and  need to assist Russian and Mexican entrepreneurs find one  another, since up to now a certain number of trade operations  have not been conducted directly but through third countries.    [Krestyaninov] But apparently our legislation does not allow  us to establish serious cooperation either?    [Zaytsev] Absolutely, although we are more viable and our  foreign trade organizations now are in the process of preparing  to work in the new conditions. I have had meetings and contacts  with 35-40 Russian foreign trade associations and banks, not to  mention talks in the Ministry itself. And it seems to me that  foreign economic enthusiasm is fairly strong among  entrepreneurs. If domestic matters are arranged, I think the  Russian mind will lay and already is laying a unique path.    [Krestyaninov] Our entrepreneurs have very little  information  on what Mexico is like and what Mexican goods are like.    [Zaytsev] I agree with that absolutely.    [Krestyaninov] That obviously applies to conditions for  importing them too.    [Zaytsev] And both the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations  and the trade representation are to blame for that, I believe.  Tuning up information channels should be one of the most  important tasks. But on the other hand, it seems to me that for  now Russia's entrepreneurial circles are still unaware of the  unique possibilities for realizing their own interests they can  obtain by cooperating closely with the trade representatives'  apparat. To be honest, that disturbs me, since very often they  go right out and find unreliable firms and frequently get  "burned," while the trade representations were in fact created  for that very reason, to find reliable partners and provide  information on markets. Trade representatives send an enormous  flow of information to Russia but, unfortunately, it by no means  always finds the consumer.</p>

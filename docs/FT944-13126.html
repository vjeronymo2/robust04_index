			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (4): Financial system on the move - Banking / The emphasis is on greater efficiency A brightly-coloured van pulls into a remote village in northern Portugal and a crowd gathers. A few years ago villagers would have been lining up to buy household wares from a travelling salesman or to borrow a book from a mobile library. Nowadays, they are checking on their investment portfolios. The van, run by Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), is a motorised bank branch with a satellite dish on the roof that establishes a link with the bank's computer systems. Customers who previously had to travel long distances to the nearest branch now have regular access to a wide range of banking services on their doorstep. BPA's mobile branches beaming transactions through the sky are an indication of how competition has intensified in Portuguese banking. In less than a decade, the sector has been transformed by the opening of new banks, the admission of foreign competitors and privatisation, propelling banks towards greater efficiency and productivity. Until the mid-1980s the financial system was heavily regulated and dominated by state-owned banks. But liberalisation is steadily forcing banks to compete on similar terms to their counterparts in most other European countries, in terms of both market and regulatory conditions. In particular, banks have been under pressure to reduce their financial margins, the difference between the rate at which they raise funds and that at which they lend to customers. The average margin for Portuguese banks has fallen to about 3 per cent from 7 per cent in 1989. Miguel Namorado Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, calculates revenue from financial margins for the banking sector at about Es600bn in 1994, Es100bn less than last year. Because they enjoyed high margins, Portuguese banks have tended to waive commissions and fees. Now tighter margins are compelling them to bolster fee-based income. But, as Alexandre Vaz Pinto, vice-president of Banco Espirito Santo (BES), points out: 'It's not easy charging higher prices in a competitive market. Banks will have to be very imaginative in conciliating service quality with competitive pricing.' A joint attempt by banks to introduce a 1 per cent charge on purchases made with direct debt cards in March this year stirred consumer associations to organise a 24-hour boycott of bank cards. A parliamentary commission stepped in and the charge was indefinitely suspended. Mr Vaz Pinto says the 'plastic money' revolt taught banks the dangers of not paying sufficient attention to customer relations. Economic conditions have added to competitive pressures in squeezing bank profitability. As a result of recession, credit to the private sector is forecast to grow by 8.5 per cent this year, down from 13.3 per cent last year. Non-performing loans are increasing as a proportion of total credit and deposit growth has been virtually stagnant for the past two years. Portuguese banks are estimated to have lost Es80bn as a result of this year's drop in interest rates on government debt securities - although some banks do not register these losses in their accounts. 'This year's combined loss of Es180bn from narrower margins and lower bond revenue is equal to the sector's net profits in 1993,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. The profits of most large banks are forecast to remain close to their 1993 level or show relatively small losses. The outlook for next year is a little brighter and from 1996, the level of non-performing loans is expected to stabilise. As economic recovery takes hold, credit growth is forecast to make a strong contribution to profits. BES, like several other banks, is investing in increased productivity. The group, which expects to have 320 branches and 5,500 employees at the end of 1994, has reduced the number of workers per branch from 24 to 17 over the past two years. But the banking system as a whole has an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 workers more than it needs to work efficiently. The regulatory framework for banks in Portugal is also moving towards European norms. From November 1, the compulsory cash reserve requirement will be cut from 17 per cent to 2 per cent of customer liabilities. A deposit guarantee fund will be in place by January 1995, some provision requirements are being changed and banks are being compelled gradually to cover their pension liabilities. Banks are concerned about the additional costs these reforms could incur. But Antonio de Sousa, governor of the bank of Portugal, is confident the costs and benefits will cancel each other out in 1995 and that the balance will evolve to the advantage of banks over the medium term. The estimated Es2,200bn in liquidity to be released by the reduction of cash reserves will initially be absorbed by certificates of deposit (CD) with maturities of two to 13 years. Banks will be able to use these CDs to make all of their 1995 contributions to the deposit guarantee fund, says Mr de Sousa. Banks will initially contribute a total of Es20bn to the fund and the Bank of Portugal an equal amount. On the benefit side, Mr de Sousa says a planned reduction in the level of provisions required to cover mortgage credit will be a substantial advantage for banks. He also envisages extending the 1997 deadline for banks to cover pension liabilities.</p>

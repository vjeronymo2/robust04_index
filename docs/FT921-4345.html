			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Mexican growth slows THE Mexican economy grew by a slower-than-expected 3.6 per cent last year, compared with the government's most recent forecast of 4 per cent, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. The trade deficit widened to Dollars 11.18bn (Pounds 6.3bn) last year, 170 per cent higher than 1990's deficit, and substantially above recent estimates, the government said. The slowdown in GDP growth partly reflects a sharp upward revision in 1990's figure, from a 3.9 per cent estimate to 4.4 per cent. But the government's tight fiscal and exchange-rate policy played its part. The manufacturing sector, which has grown 7.1 and 5.2 per cent in the previous two years, grew 3.7 per cent in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Hui (3769 1920)] </F>   [Text] Macao, 7 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying,  deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, said here today that the British side is not  cooperating in the political area but China will still cooperate  as much as possible with the British side in other areas. The  matter hinges on the British side. Concerning the talks on Hong  Kong's new airport, he hopes that progress can be made and an  important breakthrough achieved.    Chen Ziying said that regarding the Hong Kong question,  China  has always advocated Sino-British cooperation because it is  conducive to Hong Kong's smooth transition. Although the  British side is not cooperating in the political area he hopes  that, in other areas, it will not repeat the methods used in the  political area. In other areas, we will try our best to  cooperate with the British side. China's attitude has always  been clear and we have made efforts in this regard and the  matter rests with the other side.    Talking about the issue of Hong Kong's new airport, Chen  Ziying said that along with Hong Kong's economic development, a  new airport should be built and everyone had identical views on  this. He said: Concerning the issue of Hong Kong's new airport,  we think that things should be done according to the regulations  stipulated by the original Memorandum of Understanding on the  Airport and no extra financial burdens should be created for the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. In order to  protect the interests of Hong Kong residents, and in order not  to create extra financial burdens for the Hong Kong SAR, we have  negotiated with the British side. Concerning this question, the  Chinese side has never raised any extra demands; we have only  one thing to say: Act according to the Memorandum of  Understanding on the Airport.    Chen Ziying said that China is positive and enthusiastic  about the airport talks and hopes that the talks on the new  airport make progress and an important breakthrough is achieved  as soon as possible.</p>

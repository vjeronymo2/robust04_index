			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER TO JUDGE ART CONTEST THAT TAKES A SWIPE AT THE NEA  </P> <P> Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R -- Lomita) will serve as a juror for a  "conservative art" contest whose sponsor, Pasadena-based radio station KKLA,  hopes to attract exhibition funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> "I'm just basically participating in a spoof," Rohrabacher said Thursday from  his office in Washington. "A lot of things the NEA has funded in the past look  strange to most Americans. The other aspect of (the contest) is mainly aimed at  drawing attention to the fact that quite often more classical and traditional  artists are discriminated against in favor of the weird and wacko."  </P> <P> The contest was announced Friday at a press conference in Los Angeles. KKLA  (99.5 FM), which claims its biggest audience is in Orange County, bills itself  as the largest religious talk station in the country.  </P> <P> "We would like the NEA to recognize all forms of art, not just the artistic  elite," says Jeff Powell, producer of John Stewart's drive-time talk show,  "Live from LA."  </P> <P> "We don't feel the average taxpayer should fund the NEA. But if we must, then  the average taxpayer should have a say in what art actually is. If you're  taking money from the general population, the artistic elite shouldn't  determine what art is."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, who has repeatedly stressed his opposition to federal funding for  the arts, will judge only the "best satire" category of the contest. The  winning works in this category are likely to involve "some kind of parody on  the NEA, or on obscene art or some kind of political parody directed to the  'croissant elite' in the political community," according to Stewart.  </P> <P> Told that KKLA is serious about getting the NEA to fund a show of the winning  work, Rohrabacher said he had "no intention of doing anything that would try to  pressure the NEA on any specific artworks, one way or the other."  </P> <P> "I've given people at the NEA a lot of grief for funding things most people  think are obscene or indecent . . . but I've never really told them to fund  what I like. My role as a congressman is not to pressure the NEA to sponsor any  specific work of art. . . . I'll put a big disclaimer on my participation."  </P> <P> Participation in the contest, which closes June 1, is open to amateur and  professional artists working in all media. There are no guidelines on subject  matter. In addition to best of show, three awards will be given to work in each  of four categories: most creative, most inspirational, best satire and most  conservative. Stewart says the latter category has to do with upholding  "traditional family values."  </P> <P> Besides Rohrabacher, the show's other jurors are Tim Solliday, a Pasadena  painter and illustrator who works in a traditional style; Lindsey Price, a  teen-age actress in Disney films and commercials; and talk show host Stewart of  Yorba Linda, who was a leader of a public protest against the film "The Last  Temptation of Christ" in 1988.  </P> <P> Powell said he has been in contact with several possible venues for an  exhibition but wouldn't specify them. He said he has made some inquiries at the  NEA about the exhibit but refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> Told by a reporter that the NEA funds only exhibitions sponsored by a nonprofit  group, Stewart said he was certain a suitable space could be found ("even  churches, schools," he suggested).  </P> <P> Susan Ludowsky, director of the Visual Arts Program at the NEA, said her  program funds only artists and nonprofit groups. "It's very rare that we fund  an exhibition." (The NEA's Museum Program pays for exhibitions, but only those  sponsored by a nonprofit arts organization.)  </P> <P> "From time to time," Ludowsky said, "we're asked what proportion of grants we  award to realist artists. Generally speaking, approximately half of our awards  do go to artists working representationally, but that general category is very  broad. To isolate artists working in a traditional academic style would be  highly subjective. However, I can certainly say that those artists are  represented within this larger pool."  </P> <P> Ludowsky mentioned such better-known realist artists as Martha Alf of San  Diego; Catherine Murphy of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; Julie Bozzie of Ft. Worth, Tex.;  Altoon Sultan of New York City, and Willard Dixon of San Rafael as recipients  of grants from the Visual Arts Program. She added that "many lesser-known  artists working in this manner" have also received grants.  </P> <P> In a press release Stewart is quoted as saying the exhibition would "determine  whether the NEA is merely a front for anti-Establishment liberal bigots intent  on censoring conservative expression."  </P> <P> Informed that the NEA does fund artists who make traditional art, Stewart said  he was "pleased it does happen. . . . Rather than attacking the NEA, this  (exhibit) will give them a chance to act consistently with what they (believe)  they are and promote art that is appreciated by a diverse group of people,  especially the conservative majority . . . who would not consider (photographs  by Robert) Mapplethorpe to be art."  </P> <P> Last year's cancellation by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington of an  NEA-funded exhibit that included homoerotic photographs by Mapplethorpe lit the  still-simmering debate between defenders of artistic freedom and defenders of  traditional values in art.  </P> <P> Solliday, the juror whose art includes both landscapes and figurative paintings  illustrating scenes from the Bible and literary works, said he believes  "relativistic thinking has taken its toll on the art world" ever since the  heyday of Impressionism.  </P> <P> In his view, even Vincent van Gogh was "nowhere near the same (exalted)  category" as 19th-Century academic painter William Adolph Bougereau. Solliday  sees his role as an academic painter as "trying to bring beautiful art back  into people's consciousness."  </P></p>

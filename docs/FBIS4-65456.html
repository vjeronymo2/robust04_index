			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Libyan foreign minister visited Paris twice  during this current month. [passage omitted]. A report by  Laurent Bazin, Eric Bourbotte, and David Cosset:    However official it might be, the visit smacks of heresy.  Twice in less than a week, the Libyan foreign minister spent a  few happy days in Paris, staying at the glamorous Hotel de  Crillon. The first time [Libyan Foreign Minister] 'Umar  al-Muntasir stopped in Paris was when he was on his way to South  Africa. The second time, for a longer period, was on his return  from South Africa. The long weekend was organized by his old  friend, Adnan al-Khashoggi, a Saudi businessman who specializes  in all kinds of transactions between the West and Arab  countries. [passage omitted]    No official contact with al-Muntasir was made, the French  Foreign Ministry stressed, but there was no reason to ban the  visit:    [Begin Juppe recording] He is the foreign minister of a  country with which France has not severed its diplomatic  relations. When he asked us to travel via Paris, as was the  case today, I don't see on what basis we could refuse the  stopover. [end recording]    After a rest, the Libyan minister returned to Tripoli via  Tunis.</p>

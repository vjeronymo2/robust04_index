			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch Group seeks listing A GROWING market share and optimism over prospects for the London insurance market were among the reasons given yesterday by Fenchurch Group for its plans to seek a stock market listing, probably early next year. Insurance analysts estimate it could be worth up to Pounds 80m. Fenchurch, which specialises in insurance broking and as Lloyd's agent, was bought by management in 1989 from GPG for Pounds 36m. Its former chairman, Mr Geoffrey Knight, who led the MBO team, retired last week to be succeeded by Mr Rupert Hambro. Profits fell last year from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.45m, but Mr Roger Earl, the group's managing director, said these reflect - ed the start-up costs of the group's expanding activities. 'We have laid the foundations in the past year for revenue earners which should come through to the balance sheet in the next 12 months. The signs are very encouraging', he said. Last month, Fenchurch won the contract to insure the former Soviet Union's trading fleet. The contract for the 117-strong Sovconflot, one of the biggest commercial fleets in the world, was worth a 'high six-figure number', according to Mr Earl, and complemented similar business deals struck in Cuba and North Korea. Fenchurch has also opened offices in the past year in Germany, Switzerland and a management consultancy in Texas, as well as additions to the group's core operations in London. All businesses were now operating in the black, said Mr Earl. He added that the group's debt of Pounds 21m would be reduced significantly with the proceeds from the flotation. It would also give Fenchurch the chance to pay its first dividend to the 250 shareholders among its 550 staff.</p>

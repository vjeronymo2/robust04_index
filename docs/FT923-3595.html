			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Vietnam may lift investment curbs VIETNAM is considering liberalising its foreign investment law, according to Professor Nguyen Mai, vice-president of the State Council for Co-operation and Investment. He told a conference in London yesterday the proposed changes included: allowing foreign investors to lease land for up to 50 years instead of 20; permitting the sale of shares in some state enterprises to foreigners - thereby creating a new category of foreign investment; giving preference to joint venture investments, spread around the country. Mr Mai said he had brought to London a list of 548 projects for investors to consider. There were 416 joint-venture projects in operation at the end of August, involving capital investment of Dollars 3.35bn, for which Dollars 1.69bn has been raised. The main foreign partners, Mr Mai said, came from Taiwan, Hong Kong, France, Netherlands, Japan, Britain, Australia, the Commonwealth of Independent States, South Korea and Canada. Of the 416 projects, 233 (with capital investment of Dollars 1.11bn) were in industry, 18 (Dollars 900m) in oil and gas, 41 (Dollars 660m) in hotels and tourism, and 55 (Dollars 166m) in services. A report* issued at the conference said Vietnam could become one of South-East Asia's most important tourism destinations if hotel building plans were fulfilled. It said 40 hotels had opened in Ho Chi Minh City and 40 more were to be built. The total number of visitors to Vietnam in 1991 was about 850,000, including 300,000 from western Europe, South-East Asia, Japan, Australia and North America. The figure for tourism was 36 per cent higher than in 1990 - with indications that in 1992 the figures would grow by at least that amount again. *Vietnam: The Next Asian Tiger?

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Saddam to sue former ambassador to Canada Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is suing his former ambassador to Canada, who defected to the UK in August, claiming Mr Hisham Al-Shawi wrongfully took Iraqi funds from the embassy. Writs were issued in the royal court of Jersey yesterday for recovery of Pounds 280,000, plus damages and costs. The writ named two other defendants, Mr Harith Sami Swadi and Mr Naif Khadem Shnyien, and Midland Bank was cited as a party to the action. The action arises from Mr Al-Shawi's decision at the time of his defection to place cash held for operational expenses at the Ottawa embassy in a Jersey trust fund until the Hussein regime was brought down. Mr Al-Shawi said at the time that the funds were being expropriated 'to ensure that they are not used to further sustain a regime that has treated its people so vilely'. Iraq claims that Mr Al-Shawi took CDollars 345,153 (Pounds 175,000) and USDollars 155,950 (Pounds 105,000) from the embassy. The writ claims that a lesser sum was transferred to a trust account in Jersey. Iraq is seeking to freeze the funds and and Mr Al-Shawi's own assets to the value of Pounds 320,000, to cover costs. The UK Home Office is considering his application for political asylum, along with that of Mr Hamed Alwan Al-Jubouri, former ambassador to Tunisia.</p>

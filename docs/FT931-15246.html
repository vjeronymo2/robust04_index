			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / LDP considers economy boost JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday set up a task force to consider plans to revive an economy only being saved from outright recession by expansionary public spending. The task force, the LDP's response to mounting business pressure for tax cuts, is expected to propose new measures to be brought in after the 1993 budget is approved in early April. The group is to be headed by Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, who recently made outspoken attacks on official complacency about the state of the economy. The group will provide a counterweight to the influence of the Finance Ministry, which is opposed to higher government spending, and the Bank of Japan. The task force will focus on plans for a supplementary budget to augment the Y72,400 (Pounds 383bn) draft budget which will provide only a 0.2 per cent rise in public spending. Top business organisations are pressing for a tax cut package to revive consumption and investment and Japan's trading partners are likely to call for a boost to domestic demand to cut its ballooning trade surplus. Demands for tax cuts will intensify with the traditional spring wage negotiations in which employers will insist on a low increase. The Japan Federation of Employers' Associations has urged its members to award no more than 2.3 per cent rises, in guidelines for bargaining agreed this week. Rengo, the largest trade union federation, has called for a 7 per cent rise. Low wage rises will dampen consumption which ended the year badly depressed, figures published yesterday show. Tokyo department store sales in December were 11.2 per cent down on the year before.</p>

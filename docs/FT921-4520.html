			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Management: Japan is the catalyst for conversion - Transformation in working practices at the Unipart motor components group A more unlikely location for a Japanese-inspired revolution in working practices is hard to imagine: a cluster of run-down industrial buildings in the back streets of Coventry, surrounded by terraced housing little changed since the 1950s. Three years ago, the plant was churning out replacement engines for its owner, Unipart, Rover Group's former parts and accessories division, in dingy surroundings and a sour industrial atmosphere. Today, using the newest, specialised manufacturing equipment from Japan and the latest in worker and management practices, it is out to become a 'world class' maker of components. The plant, whose brightly lit and clinically clean interior contrasts starkly with the dowdy exterior, is still a Unipart subsidiary. But it is now the home of Premier Exhaust Systems, which will be opened formally today by Peter Lilley, the industry secretary. It is seen by John Neill, the chief executive of the Unipart Group of Companies (UGC), as a model for the other companies in the group. It is producing exhaust systems and preparing for large-scale production of catalytic converters for both the resurgent Rover and Rover's Japanese partner, Honda, whose own 100,000 cars-a-year UK plant comes on stream at Swindon in October. In recent months, Neill's conviction that Japanese attitudes and work practices needed to be instilled throughout UGC has begun to be put into striking effect. In a move unthinkable a couple of years ago, Unipart is ending recognition of unions for all 4,000 workers, who are acquiring staff status. 'Clocking in' is out. Japanese-style team working is being introduced and old, hierarchical structures dismantled. Responsibility for quality is falling on individuals. Salaries are being linked to performance. Nowhere are the changes being felt more keenly than at Oxford Automotive Components (OAC), whose Oxford and Kidlington-based parts making activities have formed the largest part of Unipart Industries. Honda was an obvious potential customer for Unipart components. Originally, Honda said Unipart's proposed prices for fuel tank supplies were too expensive but nevertheless awarded it the business, along with an introduction to Yachiyo Kogyo, its tank supplier in Japan. Subsequently, Yachiyo supplied Unipart with the equipment to make the tanks, sent a team of engineers to Oxford to help install it and - pre-dating the Premier operation by nearly two years - trained OAC's operators for six weeks on its own lines in Japan. Mark Trevelyn, one of the trainees - who has gone from shop floor operator to group team leader - says it 'came as a surprise to hear the Japanese talk of 'our company', not the management's'. The whole team, he says, came away with strong impressions - among them an unfamiliar and overwhelming stress on quality, and the rebukes that flowed from producing rejects and ignoring paperwork. suppliers harbour deep suspicions about the long-term intentions of the Japanese car makers in Europe, and their true willingness to expand parts sourcing from indigenous suppliers. Neill will have none of it. As an example of the Japanese desire for long-term 'partnership' commitments, he says that Honda plans progressively to rely on Unipart for its exhaust emissions research and development programmes in Europe. He says he is not worried that there is no agreement down on paper, nor that there are no formal guarantees. 'It's all based on mutual trust.' But the links with Honda were not forged without some disillusioning days. Unipart executives came away from one visit with 20 pages of problems with their products. Some of the rejections might have mystified European vehicle makers. 'For instance,' recalls Neill, 'they wouldn't tolerate weld splatter on a silencer, even though it has no bearing whatsoever on the part's performance. A western company simply wouldn't care and would probably claim, when the parts were rejected, that it was all part of a hidden agenda for the Japanese trying not to do business with the west.' The Premier plant, in which Unipart has invested several million pounds, is already turning over Pounds 15m a year. It does not go in for pre-shift calisthenics. But the Japanese influence is immediately obvious in the state-of-the art production equipment and the de rigueur company 'uniform' worn by all 175 employees. All employees have staff status. There is no privileged parking, differentiated canteens or washrooms. Remuneration is knowledge-based, linked to a star rating system as operators acquire the ability to operate more machines and sustain quality standards. The maximum is five stars and, says Neill, 'the idea is that every employee should be a five-star operator'. There are no supervisors, only leaders of small, flexible teams. Anyone can stop the production line if they think quality is under threat. In terms of management, says Frank Burns, managing director of the Coventry venture, who joined Unipart four years ago, 'there is simplicity in everything: one layer of 10 managers, then the shop floor'. The search for continuous improvement encouraged in all employees has resulted, says Burns, in exhaust output now requiring less than half the space of a conventional assembly line. In recruiting Premier's work-force, its management placed flexibility above work experience. As a result, says Burns, 'we have ended up with people who had little or no factory experience'. The price of this approach - extended training - is one Premier has willingly paid for what it says is an exceptionally enthusiastic work-force. The plant operates contribution circles - different from quality circles in that they were designed to reflect the heritage and culture of UGC. They can be initiated by management or employees but the latter is heavily favoured. Contribution circles have now been running for about nine months at Unipart. With more than 80 operating, savings of Pounds 1.8m have already been achieved, according to Neill. Burns himself recalls earmarking Pounds 300,000 for new process machinery, a decision that was abandoned after shop floor workers adapted existing machinery. Peer pressure is claimed to be keeping absenteeism down to under 2 per cent. Several years into their relationship, Honda has now nominated Unipart as its 'model supplier' in Europe, and is using it as the example of progress in its training brochures outside Japan. 'What we liked about Honda,' recalls Neill, 'is that they made clear that initially they wanted not so much technical ability, but the right attitude and commitment. When we got the business, we knew they had a lower quote from elsewhere.' Now, says Neill, 'I go once a year to see Honda in Japan to maintain our good relationship and say 'We promised to do things, we've done them - now what can we do for the future?'' The deepening relationship, says Neill, means that 'we don't have to look at a one-year horizon. We can make capital and people investments, and we've now got young engineers we are training so that we can provide them (Honda and Rover) with high-quality research and development and production expertise. 'If all their Japanese suppliers work in that climate, is it any wonder the Japanese are winning?' ponders Neill. 'They eliminate all useless argument, instead putting all their efforts into improving. This is so much more efficient than the west, it's hard to see how western companies can catch up.' It is what he regards as a remorseless pursuit of perfection by the Japanese which makes the task for western producers so hard: 'You have to be personally offended by producing a product which is not perfect. Japanese people get emotionally upset; so far, the Brits mostly don't,' says Neill.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Cause of concern DEALERS will be keeping a close watch on events inside the European exchange rate mechanism this week following the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, writes James Blitz. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's vice President, said at the weekend that he hoped the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish currency, the largest in the system's history, would bring renewed calm inside the ERM. Finance Ministry officials in Ireland were also hoping that the country's banks would bring down wholesale and retail rates of lending in the next few days. The market could view the Irish devaluation as an isolated event, which was principally triggered by the punt's overvaluation against sterling rather than the D-Mark. They may decide not to put pressure on the other weaker currencies in the system, the Danish krone and French franc. However, Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, said yesterday that the Irish devaluation should cause concern. 'This is the first low inflation country with a big current account surplus to devalue,' he said. 'The market needs to ask itself whether it is now targetting countries with high unemployment as devaluation candidates. If that is the new mentality, the franc and krone will soon come under pressure.' The Bank of France's money market operations, today and on Thursday, will be scrutinised lest the authorities raise official interest rates. Three-month francs were trading at 13 1/4 per cent on Friday night, 125 basis points above the official overnight lending rate. Tomorrow's Bundesbank announcement of the rate at which it will offer repurchase agreements in its weekly money market operations will be closely scrutinised. The German central bank holds a council meeting on Thursday, although few analysts anticipate a cut in official rates.</p>

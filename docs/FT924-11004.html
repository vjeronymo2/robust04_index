			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory party opinion Mr Major's decision to attend the 1922 meeting tomorrow has stymied an initiative by backbench loyalists to set up a 'breakaway' committee which would, they say, more accurately represent Tory party opinion at Westminster. The loyalists had planned to boycott the regular meeting of the '22 and hold their own discussion instead, to register disapproval of the high public profile of Sir Marcus Fox, the committee's chairman. Whether the planned breakaway is merely postponed or lapses will now depend on how Thursday's meeting goes.</p>

Ovezgeldyyev, the author of the  concept of a long-term program of research into the problems of  the Caspian and well-known Turkmen academician, declares:  "Unless an international center coordinating the actions of the  Caspian countries to save the Caspian is formed in the very near  future and unless these countries pool their scientific,  economic, and legal forces to this end, we will simply lose it,  like we lost the Aral."    Having become a sump of industrial enterprises' toxic waste,  the Caspian is today essentially suffocating from phenols,  acids, alkalis, and organic substances. Scientists believe the  overall volume of harmful effluent long since exceeded the  annual flow of such rivers as the Ural, Terek, Kura, and Samur  put together.    Added to the grim ecological situation is concern that the  constant rise in the sea level since 1978 continues. In the  current situation immediate coordinated actions of the five  states with an outlet to hoary Khazar--Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,  Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran--are required.    We had become so accustomed to and comfortable with the  practice of the wasteful use of natural resources that in  unthinkingly and unhesitatingly having closed off by a sealed  dike the Kara-Bogaz Bay and having thereby interrupted the  natural process of accumulation of hydro-mineral raw material in  the bay it did not even occur to us that we were thereby ruining  a renewable source, most unique on a world scale, of chemical  resources. With the closing off of the bay the natural balance  in the region was disturbed for it was not just something but  Kara-Bogaz-Gol, as the thermal regulator of the Caspian, which  mainly stabilized the level of the sea.    "Had Turkmenistan been able to comprehensively assimilate  the  unlost Kara-Bogaz-Gol," Academician O. Ovezgeldyyev says, "this  would have been sufficient for putting together a fully balanced  state budget. And no oil or gas would have been needed here  since types of raw material that are much more efficient than  hydrocarbons could have been recovered from the bay. Look, the  Japanese are spending immense resources to recover minerals from  the ocean. We in Kara-Bogaz-Gol, on the other hand, could get  them practically free of charge...."    Another well known scientist, A. Khodzhamamedov, president  of  the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan and head of the  Institute of Chemistry of the republic's Academy of Sciences, is  insistently recommending to the leadership of his country today  that the Caspian be plugged into the economic and mineral-raw  material base of Turkmenistan. But he warns here that it will be  very, very dangerous if each Caspian country begins to view the  Caspian and its possibilities individually, without coordinated  actions. The predatory catch of fish, the barbaric production of  oil on the shelves, and the nonstop discharge of industrial  effluent into the rivers feeding Khazar, as the Caspian was  called in ancient times, would begin in this case. Agreed  ecological norms and an international center for study of the  problems of the Caspian are needed to prevent this.    There is, strictly speaking, none of this as yet. No Caspian  state has yet embarked in earnest on a monitoring of the level  of the sea or a geological inspection of its depths, not to  mention the elaboration of scientifically substantiated  ecological norms.</p>

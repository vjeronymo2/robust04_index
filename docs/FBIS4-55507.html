			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "B.D." from Lodz: "Coupons in Return for Lost </F> Property; 300 Trillion Zlotys Worth of Claims"]    [Text] Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw  Kaczmarek said in Lodz on 13 May that "there will be no  reprivatization in Poland in the literal sense." The government  proposes that former owners be given coupons instead of property  or cash on the condition that the owner in question used to hold  Polish citizenship.    The government's draft law on compensation for real estate  seized illegally on the basis of provisions enacted in the years  1944-58 envisages that reimbursement be paid out and that  nationalization be finalized.    Sixty-five percent of reimbursement claims submitted to date  apply to returning agricultural real estate and forests, 17  percent pertain to urban real estate, 5 percent to units dealing  with services and trade, 2 percent to industrial enterprises,  and 6 percent to other types of premises. The Ministry of  Ownership Transformations estimates that all of the claims  together total approximately 300 trillion zlotys [Z].    According to Kaczmarek, paying out such an amount or  returning all of the property would endanger the state budget.  He described the governmental reprivatization draft law as  relatively safe, one that alleviates financial tensions and does  not arouse new social conflicts.    Reimbursement is to be in the form of compensation  coupons--that is to say, securities that reflect the value of  the claims. Only individuals with Polish citizenship--at both  the time the property was seized and currently--would be  entitled to such coupons. They will also be distributed among  owners of property left on the territory of areas that currently  are not included within the Republic of Poland.    The draft does not allow for the possibility of returning a  piece of property partially in the form of coupons and partially  in the original form.    The coupons' value will be determined according to the  principle of regression. If a claim does not exceed Z1 billion,  100 percent of the value of the property would be returned in  the form of coupons. In the case of claims worth between Z1 and  3 billion, 1 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the  remainder, while, in cases of property valued at Z3 to 10  billion, Z2.5 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the  remainder. For property worth over Z10 billion, it would be  Z4.1 billion plus 10 percent of the remaining amount over Z10  billion.    The reprivatization law would become effective three months  after its publication. Applications would be collected over a  year's time.    Coupons would be valid for 10 years and would be valorized  by  having their value increased by 10 percent for every calendar  year.    With these coupons, one could purchase real estate and  movable property being sold by the State Treasury, by gminas  [small administrative units], and by self-governmental  associations. Five percent of shares of each company being  introduced onto the stock market would be reserved for owners of  the coupons.    The draft law, which applies to reimbursements associated  with loss of property in the years 1946-58, was approved by the  Council of Ministers' Economic Committee on 6 May, while, on  Friday, it was debated during a session by a Council for  Reprivatization that operates as attached to the ownership  transformations minister. "The governmental draft  reprivatization law was written in a hurry and in accordance  with the worst examples of the Polish People's Republic," said  Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's chairman. In his view, the  coupons that are being suggested by the government as  compensation for property lost will be conducive to corruption.  These coupons, for which nobody will be willing to sell  anything, will be losing their value with every passing month.  But, most probably, so-called skillful people will emerge, who  will begin purchasing the coupons for pennies while the rightful  owners will be left with what they have had for the past  40-something years, which means they will be left with nothing.  "Only foreign countries will know that, because a law is in  force, the problem of reprivatization has already been resolved  in Poland. I think that is the only intention here,"  Laszkiewicz added.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nuclear review conclusions not obvious Sir, Professors Fells and Lucas (Personal View, November 2) rightly point out that the issues facing the nuclear industry necessitate a wide-ranging inquiry with broad terms of reference. The conclusions of such a review are, however, far from obvious, and they may not be so clearly pro-nuclear as the authors might wish. The authors think it wise to maintain a 20 per cent reserved market for nuclear power. There is, though, nothing magical about this level of contribution, nor any obvious reason why this bit of the market should be reserved for nuclear power. Furthermore, the authors are quite wrong to assert that 'electricity from Sizewell C can be competitive with gas'. The large construction costs, the long time period, the uncertainty about load factors and about the disposal of waste fuel do not compare very well against the economics of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). To suggest that 'it is a question of convincing prospective investors', rather than one of fundamental lack of cost competitiveness, is unconvincing. Indeed, having extolled the virtues of more pressurised water reactors (PWRs), the authors concede quite rightly that 'a new nuclear plant is unlikely without government support'. What the authors really want is terms of reference which give the answer: 'Sizewell C'. May I suggest the relevant question then is: 'If 20 per cent of the British electricity market were reserved for nuclear power, should a new PWR be built?' It is precisely because it is far from obvious why nuclear should have a special place in the market that the terms of reference of the nuclear review should indeed be broad: a thorough investigation of the costs and benefits of nuclear power is needed, so customers who will have to pay for new reactors can see whether the bills are worth paying. Only then will the nuclear industry have a degree of stability in planning its future. Dieter Helm, fellow in economics, New College, Oxford</p>

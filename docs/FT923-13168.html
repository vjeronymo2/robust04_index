			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fiat to expand Japanese link-up FIAT has decided to expand its co-operation with Japan's Hitachi and Sumitomo in the field of earth-moving equipment. The Turin-based automotive group yesterday signed an agreement to form Fiat Hitachi Construction Equipment, controlled 80 per cent by Fiat Hitachi Excavators and 20 per cent by NH Geotec. Fiat Hitachi Excavators is already controlled 51 per cent by Fiat, 44 per cent by Hitachi and 5 per cent by Sumitomo. The new venture is to be controlled ultimately 51 per cent by Fiat through Geotec and based at Lecce in southern Italy. Whereas the previous venture combined the Italian groups and the two Japanese companies' production and technology in hydraulic excavators, the new deal extends this to roller loader, dozers and construction equipment. The agreement follows the decision by John Deere earlier this year to pull out of a three-pronged venture. Fiat will be pooling its resources from FiatAllis in Geotec which includes a commercial network in Europe, Africa and the Middle East; while the Japanese partners will bring in Equipco, Hitachi's French-based distribution arm as well as technology and quality control. In four years, the original Fiat Hitachu alliance has seen its share of the European market rise from 7 per cent to 13 per cent. The capital for the new venture has yet to be decided.</p>

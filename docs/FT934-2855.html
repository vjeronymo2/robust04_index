			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Retiring hurt but wise to the world: Norma Cohen talks to those whose plight has led to an inquiry into UK pensions Jonathan Knowles's problems started with a Metropolitan Police sports day in 1989. Mr Knowles, 29, with seven years of service under his belt, ran into a fellow officer he had known at training school. 'He told me he had got a personal pension that was better than the police force's. But he said he couldn't tell me about it - I would have to go to the main office of the insurance company.' The man at the main office of what was then Merchant Investors Group, now owned by insurance group Cannon Lincoln, was a former police officer. 'I trusted him,' says Mr Knowles. 'When you speak to an officer, you are talking to one of your own. And who better to talk to about the police pension scheme than an ex-policeman?' Thus began a tale that left Mr Knowles bereft of roughly four years of pension benefits from one of the best schemes in the country. The Metropolitan Police have told him it will cost at least Pounds 24,379 to buy back the pension benefits he gave up. He only discovered he had been badly advised when talking to The Donnellsons, the independent financial adviser which does not accept commissions, about his mortgage. After a review of his financial affairs, it pointed out how much he had lost by leaving the police scheme. Mr Stephen Bourne, pensions specialist at The Donnellsons, says the sales process had been seriously at fault. 'Here's a chap who is perfectly intelligent, who can understand the benefits once you sit down and explain it to him, and yet, has got a bad deal.' Mr Knowles is not unique. Earlier this week, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, said that as many as four out of five people who have left employers' scheme in the past five years to take out a personal pension may have received bad advice. The SIB estimates that some 500,000 people have been transferred out of occupational schemes and into personal pensions since 1988. The SIB, which used the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick to investigate a random sample of personal pensions transfers, found that in most cases, sales agents had not asked for enough information from clients to offer proper advice. Because SIB insists that pension entitlements must be restored when clients have been misled, several hundred million pounds will have to be paid out by life insurance companies and banks. But many pension holders could still lose out. Exactly how a crisis of such proportions could have developed unchecked for so long is a troubling question. It is also an embarrasment for a Conservative government which in the late 1980s was actively encouraging the spread of personal pensions. Though personal pensions remain appropriate for many people, the regulators, industry officials and the government must now agree how to prevent misleading advice being given. In Mr Knowles's case, he says he was overwhelmed by the sales patter, 'You feel like a bit of a mug,' he says. He is now back in the police scheme but is in dispute with MI group about how much they should pay the scheme to restore his entitlements. The sales agent's pitch, say others in the business, was all too familiar. Mr Knowles was told that if he contributed Pounds 100 a month to a MI personal pension it would give him a Pounds 300,000 lump sum at maturity. 'He (the sales agent) told me I would get a lump sum of Pounds 45,000 from the police . . . Then he took a pencil and started drawing me all these diagrams,' he says. After all the drawings and numbers - meant to show the merits of a personal pension - Mr Knowles was convinced. The Donnellsons says those figures are hard to believe. The police scheme, which allows full retirement at 50, cannot be matched by any personal pension plan, it says. Mr Jon Minchin, who runs Pensionline, an independent financial advisory service specialising in pensions, says Mr Knowles' sales agent appears to have followed a often-used script - know as the 'ice-breaker' because it makes people think about buying a product they were not even contemplating before. First, the agent asks, what interest rate the prospective client gets on a building society account. This is then compared with the current rate of inflation - a comparison likely to show low real returns. 'Is it really worth going down to the building society on a cold wet day for 3 per cent? If I could show you an easy way to save and give you 12 per cent, would that be of interest to you?' could be the sales agents next questions. 'He'll then start drawing you diagrams and you are dead meat from now on,' Mr Minchin says. There are other approaches, that critics say are inappropriate for selling complex financial products. To get an appointment, sales agents try the 'lucky slot' gambit. 'I've just looked in my diary and I'm in your area on Tuesday and I could fit you in at 2:30. If you say that date or time is inconvenient, you will be amazed at how many other times he can 'fit you in'' he says. Mr Minchin also details the 'fear pitch', sometimes known as 'back up the hearse and let them smell the flowers'. The agent asks: 'Will your children be able to eat if you are run over by a bus?' One former salesman for Pioneer Life, later sold to Swiss Life, the insurance company, describes the pitch he was taught: 'You get a guy and say to him 'Do you see yourself staying in the same job for 40 years? How many jobs have you had so far?'' He would then tell the prospective client that unless he planned to work for the same employer for the rest of his life then they needed a personal pension. Under the rules set by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and pensions industry, agents are supposed to show a range of possible returns under different interest rate conditions. But the salesmen would show only the highest, the salesman says. One group of workers that proved particularly vulnerable was mineworkers, says Mr Simon Hill of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme. One pit in Nottinghamshire, learning it would soon close, sponsored a seminar on alternative employment at the local town hall. Along with the department of social security and government-supported employment agencies, came insurance company representatives. They offered free buffets and beer, and staffed them with sales agents offering immediate details on the benefit of transfering to a personal pension. A significant number of those on the receiving end found the tactics irresistible. Mr Allan Hayes, 38, a former coal miner at the British Coal Selby pit, was enticed out of the MPS and into a personal pension with Allied Dunbar, the life insurance company owned by BAT industries. 'The sales agent asked me what my scheme benefits were and he turned to me and said 'without a doubt I can do a better deal for you'. And him being brighter than me, I took his word.' So in 1989, after 10 years in the MPS - a scheme which provides fully indexed benefits - Mr Hayes took out a personal pension. 'They come to see you and they blind you with all these numbers,' he says. While the figures shown to him looked substantial in 1989 pounds, the sales agent failed to remind him of the likely effect that future inflation would have on returns. Matters came to a head in June 1991, when Mr Hayes crushed his forearm in a pit accident. In November 1992, the MPS wrote to him saying it was offering to re-admit those who had opted out. Mr Hayes, on sick leave at the time, jumped at the chance and was allowed to rejoin once he returned to the pit. After a short time, it became clear his injury made him unfit for work and he sought early retirement. Because of the four-year hiatus from the MPS, Mr Hayes is only entitled to a pension of Pounds 54 per week. Had he not opted out, he would have been entitled to receive Pounds 106 per week, according to the MPS. 'This is a cruel thing that they (Allied Dunbar) are doing,' says Mr Hayes. He says it is ironic because Allied Dunbar initially turned him down on the grounds that he was better off in the MPS. But the sales agent told him to sign a letter to the company, which Mr Hayes says the agent dictated, saying he had already opted out of the MPS and had nowhere to go except Allied Dunbar. Although that was not the case, Mr Hayes agreed. In response, Allied Dunbar says the sales agent no longer works for it and the case is being investigated, although it has taken some time to collect the relevant documents. Currently, Mr Hayes says, the insurance company is citing the letter in its refusal to accept his claim that he should be bought back into the MPS scheme. The MPS says it will cost Pounds 15,700 to restore his entitlements; Mr Hayes says Allied Dunbar has offered only Pounds 1,300. Such a tactic of obtaining a client's signature absolving the sales agent from responsibility for advice given is apparently not unique. Mr Minchin cites the case of another client, a teacher in Hampshire, who had approached the TSB, the high street bank, to discus concerns about the adequacy of her pension after a seven-year absence from work. She said she was advised to leave the Teachers' Pension Scheme and buy a TSB pension instead. On April 10 1990, the sales agent completed a 'fact find' which concluded that a TSB pension was the most suitable product for her. But on April 25, she was asked to sign a disclaimer which said she was acting independently of the advice given by the sales agent. When the teacher realised she would have been better off remaining in the Teachers' scheme, she tried to transfer her personal pension back in. But she found that after paying more than Pounds 2,000 in premiums, the value of the fund was almost nil because commissions and charges had eaten up the balance. After an exchange of letters, TSB agreed to place funds in the Teachers' scheme to fully reinstate her, a sum estimated at Pounds 8,000. Aside from the question of how to compensate thousands of people who have been persuaded to undercut their own retirement benefits, regulators must now ask whether an unsophisticated public can reasonably be expected to choose between two alternative forms of pension when a commission-hungry sales agent is touting the merits of one. The evidence so far suggests the answer is no.</p>

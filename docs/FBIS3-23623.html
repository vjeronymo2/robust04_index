At that meeting, which was mediated by Army  General Pavel Grachev, a protocol was signed on a total  cease-fire in the Republic of Nagornyy Karabakh, a withdrawal of  troops, and the creation of mutual security zones manned by  mixed forces and a joint staff consisting of representatives of  Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of Nagornyy  Karabakh.    If Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev can secure the parties' final  consent to implement the protocol's provisions, a joint staff of  about 250 men will be created. Sixty-nine Russian servicemen  will serve on that staff. They will be dispatched to the  conflict zone only after a cease-fire and the withdrawal of  troops and heavy equipment.    It should be pointed out that Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev  traveled to Tskhinvali with a similar package. The mechanism for  a cease-fire in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone proved  successful. Will it work in Nagornyy Karabakh?</p>

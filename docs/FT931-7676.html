			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Interest fall helps Ashtead rise 7% IN WHAT Mr Peter Lewis, chairman of Ashtead Group, described as a period of 'relentless recession', the equipment rental company raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.61m in the six months to October 31. The 7 per cent profits rise was struck on turnover up Pounds 860,000 at Pounds 16.8m. Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 2.15m) but interest charges fell to Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 644,000) on lower rates. Some two thirds of the group's profits accrue in the first half. Mr Lewis said that the oversupply in the non-operated plant hire market which has pertained since 1990 was showing signs of declining as competitors withdrew from the market. This would benefit the group, he said. He was pleased with the continued strength of the balance sheet and the neutrality of the group's cash flow during the period, in spite of a Pounds 2m increase in capital expenditure to Pounds 5.3m. The group bought only new equipment, whereas competitors had either bought second hand or hardly at all. Ashtead also increased its payroll numbers. With the group's level of operational gearing, a 10 per cent rise in its UK prices would double its profits, though a rise of that size should not be assumed, he added. In spite of the survey and inspection side making operating profits of Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 452,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 2.03m) and the US plant hire side making Pounds 74,000 (Pounds 164,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 980,000), the management was concentrating on the UK plant hire market. The group now relies for less than half of its turnover on the construction and civil engineering industries, with local authorities, public and private utilities and specialist companies making up the balance. Earnings grew to 5.2p (4.6p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted 3 per cent to 1.133p.</p>

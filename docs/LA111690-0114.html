			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ACT RESPONSIBLY TO CONSERVE FUEL  </P> <P> Around town, my 2.8 V-6 auto burns fuel at 28-30 miles per gallon; at 55  m.p.h., it burns fuel at 35-38 m.p.g. and at 65 m.p.h., it burns fuel at 32-34  m.p.g. At 55 m.p.h., it burns almost 10% less than at 65 m.p.h. I try to obey  the law and conserve fuel.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission reports that 72 million  gallons of fuel are burned each day on the freeway system (the Valdez spill was  88 million gallons).  </P> <P> If one out of three would ride-share, we would save 24 million gallons of  gasoline a day, reduce traffic congestion by one-third and improve our air  quality.  </P> <P> Our free system of democracy requires responsibility, first to obey the law and  second to act responsibly by making some personal sacrifices and suffering some  inconveniences. This will conserve fuel, reduce congestion and clean our air  for a better and healthier life for all.  </P> <P> Don't wait for George to do it. Start now with you and join me in doing it.  </P> <P> NORMAN N. LUECK  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

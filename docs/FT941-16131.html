			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Overseas comeback for Chrysler - US carmaker seeks to double retail sales outside North America to 200,000 Chrysler, the smallest of the three big US carmakers, is aiming to double retail sales outside North America to 200,000 by the end of the decade. It increased such sales by 45 per cent last year to 109,100 and exceeded 100,000 retail sales for the first time since it re-entered international markets in 1987. Chrysler was forced to sell most foreign operations at the end of the 1970s when it came close to financial collapse. The company has been rejuvenated in the last three years by a drastic restructuring and a series of highly successful new product launches. It achieved record profits in the first nine months of last year, and is leading a resurgent US car industry's drive into export markets. It increased US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per cent to 2.047m in a market that grew by 8 per cent, and raised its share of the market to 14.7 per cent, the highest level for 23 years. Chrysler is still a small player in foreign markets, but sales last year rose by 36 per cent in Europe, 87 per cent in Latin America and doubled in the Asia Pacific region. Europe, its main foreign market, accounted for about 55 per cent of its international sales last year, with 20 per cent in the Asia/Pacific region, 10 per cent in the Middle East and 11 per cent in Latin America. Mr Tom Gale, Chrysler vice president of design and international operations, said the company planned to launch more new products in international markets in the next three years than at any time in its history. It would introduce at least six new left-hand-drive and four new right-hand-drive models by 1997. Chrysler was the first of the big three US carmakers to begin to engineer its North American-built vehicles for right-hand-drive markets such as Japan, UK and Australia. Mr Gale said its new Neon small family car and its Jeep Grand Cherokee four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle would include right-hand-drive versions as well as the possibility of a right-hand-drive version of its next generation Chrysler Voyager multi-purpose vehicle (MPV). Chrysler is planning to build its Grand Cherokee for international markets in Graz, Austria from late 1994. It has small volume kit assembly operations in China, Venezuela, Egypt and Malaysia, and last year agreed two new vehicle assembly deals in Indonesia and Thailand. It has also started supplying engines to Mitsubishi for some of the Japanese carmaker's US-built products. The company's initial return to international markets was based on its Jeep four-wheel-drive and Voyager MPV models, but it is now seeking to establish more of a presence in mainstream passenger car markets helped by radical renewal of its car range. Last autumn it unveiled its Neon small car, to be launched in Europe in September in left-hand-drive form. Last week in Detroit it added its new JA range of large family cars, the Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus, which will compete with rivals such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.</p>

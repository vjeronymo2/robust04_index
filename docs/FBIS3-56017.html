In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday Panov underlined  that, after the Russian president's historic "break-through"  visit to Beijing, Russia is now engaging in a wide, dynamic  range of cooperation with China both on the international scene  and in their bilateral relations. Panov said China is a high  priority in Russia's foreign policy.    The deputy minister reported that Kozyrev's visit will  include preparations for a return visit to Moscow by the Chinese  chairman.    Panov thinks that the fact that Russia's new year is  beginning with visits by the American President to Moscow and  then the Russian foreign minister to Beijing is symbolic.  Although these delegations are in different "weight  categories", the two visits will maintain equilibrium in  Russia's foreign policy, which is directed to the east as much  as it is to the west.</p>

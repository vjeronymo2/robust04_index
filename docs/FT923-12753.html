			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television ONCE again we arrive at The First Night Of The Proms. The 98th season begins with a live relay from the Albert Hall (7.30 Radio 3 and BBC2) of Verdi's Requiem. Andrew Davis conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers, the London Symphony Chorus and the BBC Symphony Chorus, and an international band of soloists led by Susan Dunn. It looks like Mavis Nicholson benefit night, and why not? Channel 4 begins evening repeats of her daytime programmes. In With Mavis (8.30) starts with an interview about Alzheimer's disease. Then at 10.00 the estimable Nicholson presents the 2-hour Radio 2 Arts Programme which features Meredith Edwards talking about his career in films. It looks as though Nick Utechin, the new producer of Any Questions, is doing the business: at the time of writing, his panel contains not a single MP, which is what listeners so often plead for (8.05 Radio 4). BBC2 repeats Alan Bennett's award-winning drama A Question Of Attribution, featuring Anthony Blunt and the Queen, played by Prunella Scales.</p>

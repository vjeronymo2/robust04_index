			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens tumbles into the red HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, fell into a net loss of Fl 49m (Dollars 29.7m) in the first six months of 1992, compared with a net profit of Fl 55m in the same period last year. The loss confirmed the company's earlier predictions that it would see no improvement during the period. The company, which was forced to omit its 1991 dividend after it posted full-year losses of Fl 51m last year, said it did not expect any improvement in European steel and aluminium markets in the 1992 second half. It warned there was a 'serious possibility' that results in the second half on ordinary activities would be substantially lower than they were in the first, when these activities - comprising operating profit and financial income and charges - posted a loss of Fl 70m, against a profit of Fl 73m the previous year. First-half operating profit tumbled to Fl 35m from Fl 169m a year earlier, while financial charges widened to Fl 105m from Fl 96m. Group turnover fell 5.2 per cent to Fl 3.9bn. The weak economic climate in Europe and competition from non-EC countries such as Russia had undermined prices for most of Hoogovens' steel products. Similar factors were at work on the European aluminium market. Hoogovens' steel production rose in the first half from the reduced levels of the first six months of 1991, when a key blast furnace had been undergoing refurbishment. However, the company said it would probably maintain steel production at the new lower levels introduced in June. Aluminium production fell in the first half because of a reorganisation, aimed at refocusing the group's Belgian plant on higher added-value products.</p>

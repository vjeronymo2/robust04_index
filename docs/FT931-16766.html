			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Roadworks won by Tarmac company Newly-formed TARMAC REGIONAL CIVIL ENGINEERING has got off to a flying start with contracts totalling almost Pounds 6m for roadworks in north Wales, Kent and London. At St Asaph in Clwyd, Tarmac is to build a junction over the A55 dual carriageway. The junction will serve a planned business park. The single-span bridge will have four slip roads to the A55 and various service roads. The Pounds 2.2m project, for the Welsh Development Agency, also includes a landscaping scheme involving 17,500 woodland transplants and 175 specimen trees. The London Borough of Newham has awarded Tarmac a Pounds 2m contract to build the next phase of the East Ham town centre relief road, a half-mile section between Harrow Road and Barking Road. From Kent County Council comes a Pounds 1.6m contract to improve nearly a mile of the South Thames Development Route, adjacent to the Dartford river crossihg, upgrading the route from single to dual carriageway. Operating from bases in Wolverhampton, Manchester and Newbury, Tarmac Regional Civil Engineering was created earlier this year to tackle works up to Pounds 10m. Larger schemes are undertaken by its sister organisation, Tarmac's major projects division.</p>

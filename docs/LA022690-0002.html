			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WINNING LOTTO TICKET SOLD IN CARLSBAD  </P> <P> Tickets containing all six winning numbers in the California Lottery's weekend  "Lotto 6-49" game were sold in Carlsbad and Eureka, lottery officials said  Sunday, and each is worth $3,186,409.  </P> <P> There were six tickets containing five winning numbers and the bonus number,  and each was worth $282,498. The tickets were purchased in South Gate, Newhall,  Los Angeles, Baker, Covina and Modesto.  </P> <P> The winning numbers were: 18, 30, 33, 36, 44, 49 and the bonus number, 43.  </P> <P> There were 277 tickets sold with five of six winning numbers, and each ticket  was worth $3,152. Some 14,012 tickets with four of six winning numbers paid off  at $56 each, and the 260,149 tickets with three of six winning numbers were  worth an automatic $5 each.  </P> <P> Saturday night's televised drawing was delayed for 50 minutes by what officials  first thought was a breakdown of the machine that spits out the balls  containing the winning numbers.  </P> <P> "It was human error," California Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Walker said later.  </P> <P> She said a person who was supposed to press three buttons on the machine that  randomly selects the numbers forgot to press the third button in the sequence.  </P> <P> The buttons cause the numbered balls to drop out of the machine. Citizens are  chosen randomly to press the buttons that release the numbered balls for the  twice-weekly drawing, Walker said, because lottery employees are prohibited  from starting the drawing.  </P> <P> Lottery officials already had stopped the 7:55 p.m. statewide broadcast of the  drawing before they realized what went wrong, Walker said. When the final  button was finally pressed, the balls dropped normally.  </P> <P> Security cameras in the Sacramento TV studio made the required videotape of the  drawing, so it is valid even though it wasn't broadcast live, she said.  </P> <P> Sales from Wednesday night to Saturday's drawing were $15,878,153. Wednesday's  lottery jackpot is expected to be worth about $5 million.  </P></p>

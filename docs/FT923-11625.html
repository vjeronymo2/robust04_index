			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex embarks on a Dollars 1.85bn gamble - The Mexican group's acquisition of Spain's top cement companies Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex), North America's largest cement company, has taken a considerable gamble in bidding Dollars 1.85bn for Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson. The acquisitions, announced within a fortnight of each other, are easily the largest undertaken in Mexico, and they give a company with little experience of managing overseas operations 28 per cent of the Spanish cement market, more than double that of its nearest competitor. The purchases will not just stretch Cemex's managerial abilities, they will increase long-term debt by Dollars 760m - and that is assuming re-financing and fire sales of assets and shares go according to plan. Cemex's immediate borrowings will rise by Dollars 1.35bn. In short, the turning points are awesome. For almost a hundred years the company's fortunes have been rooted in Mexico. Cemex first produced cement in 1906, and in 1931 merged with its rival, Cementos Portland Monterrey, to become Mexico's principal cement maker. With the Spanish acquisitions, sales last year would have been Dollars 2.8bn, turning Cemex into Mexico's second largest industrial company following Vitro, the glass maker. About 40 per cent of Cemex's shares are controlled by the Zambrano family. Forbes magazine recently estimated that Mr Lorenzo Zambrano and his uncle and president of the board, Mr Marcelo Zambrano were worth Dollars 2bn. Mr Lorenzo and Mr Marcelo Zambrano evidently feel that sticking to Mexico makes them vulnerable to foreign competition. Investors may have other ideas, however. US and Mexican investors have acquired Cemex stock in the belief they are buying into Mexico's fast-growing construction market. Spain's construction market, unlike Mexico's, is slowing, and its cement industry is suffering. In future some 40 per cent of Cemex's earnings will come from Spain. In the two days following the announcement of the Valenciana deal, Cemex's B shares, which are open to foreign investment, fell 17 per cent. This week the shares have been especially volatile as investors have reacted to the second Spanish acquisition and a 15 per cent increase in net profits for the first six months of 1992. 'Most investors who bought Cemex bought it on a high growth story. To the extent that Cemex diversifies into countries with less attractive growth prospects, earnings slow down,' said Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin American equity research at Goldman Sachs. However, with high cash flows and a mature share of the home market, Cemex clearly needed to do something. It controls 65 per cent of the Mexican cement market and expects to generate Dollars 1.5bn in spare cash over the next five years. The choice was stark - expand in high-growth Mexico but away from cement, or buy more cement companies in slower growing markets abroad. Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive and controlling shareholder, said: 'The global cement business is becoming increasingly concentrated and we need to stay with the leaders.' The Spanish acquisitions will raise Cemex's annual cement capacity from 21.6m tonnes to 32m tonnes. However, the company is facing increasing pressure at home. Its main Mexican competitor, Apasco, part of Holderbank, the world's largest cement producer, is planning a Dollars 260m expansion in Mexico, to raise output from 5.4m tonnes to 7.15m tonnes by 1994. To Cemex's obvious concern, Apasco last year opened a plant in Saltillo, Coahuila, in the heart of what had previously been Cemex territory. Apasco will open another plant in Colima, on the Pacific coast in 1994, where it will be able to take on Tolmex, Cemex's subsidiary. Cemex saw the threat from Holderbank in 1988, and decided then to concentrate on core cement business, and sell most non-cement operations. In 1989 Cemex bought Empresa Tolteca (Tolmex), then the number two Mexican cement producer, for Dollars 663m, bringing its market share in Mexico up to 64 per cent. Cemex at the same time bought cement operations in the south and west US. 'In purchasing Tolteca our main interest was not to put it in the hands of the Europeans,' said Mr Gustavo Caballero, group finance director. The decision to buy Valenciana and Sanson is part of the same defensive strategy. 'The (purchases) strengthen the strategic position of Cemex in the Mexican market' said Mr Zambrano. Mr Zambrano is quick to emphasise other benefits of the Spanish acquisitions. Spain's cement market is large and likely to grow faster than the rest of Europe's, prices are high, and with 28 per cent of the market, Cemex will becomes the dominant cement producer. The company will cut administrative costs by merging Sanson and Valenciana. Nevertheless most foreign investors would doubtless have preferred Cemex to have stuck to Mexico, given the present weakness of Spanish demand. In contrast, Mexican construction is booming, and many analysts expect cement demand to grow by 6 to 10 per cent a year over the next decade. The Mexican government has recently released price controls on cement which has substantially increased profit margins. In some ways Cemex's bid for Valenciana and Sanson mirrors a strategy pursued by Vitro, Mexico's monopoly flat glass producer. Vitro moved into the US market in 1989 with the purchase of Anchor Glass. The deal put more than half of sales outside Mexico. In common with Cemex, Vitro said it needed to become a global glass producer to survive. Yet with sales suffering from the US recession Vitro's share price has badly lagged the Mexican stock market. The worry for Cemex must be that Spain's economy may not grow as fast as Mexico's over the next decade.</p>

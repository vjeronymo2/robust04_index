			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Church wins Portuguese TV channel THE Portuguese government yesterday awarded franchises for two private television channels, ending months of delays and controversy including a damaging row with Portugal's powerful and conservative Roman Catholic church which emerged as one of the victors in the contest. The two channels, which come on air this year, will end the duopoly of two state channels - Canal 1 and RTP2 - which have spent the past year revamping their programmes in preparation for tougher competition. The strongest competition is likely to come from Sociedade Independente de Comunicacao (SIC), headed by Mr Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a former prime minister and founding member of the ruling Social Democratic party, which won the 15-year franchise for the new third channel. Mr Pinto Balsemao heads Sojornal, the company that owns Expresso, Portugal's largest and respected weekly newspaper, and 50 per cent of Exame, the leading business magazine, among other publications. SIC includes several other Portuguese newspaper and magazine publishers, and it has established links with TV Globo of Brazil which supplies the bulk of popular Brazilian soap operas screened on Portuguese state television. The franchise for the fourth channel has gone to Televisao Independente (TVI), a group whose main shareholders are Radio Renascenca - the Church-sponsored national radio station - various religious organisations and publishers Editorial Verbo.</p>

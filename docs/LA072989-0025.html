			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A REDESIGNED MONK BY MAGRUDER'S MONKTET  </P> <P> The setting was perfect. The Sculpture Garden of the Long Beach Museum of Art  has to be one of the most pleasant places to hear jazz on a summer night. With  the lights of the Queen Mary sparkling in the distance and the setting sun  glowing through a rainbow of colors . . . who could ask for anything more?  </P> <P> Great. But how was the music, you say? Ah, well, Wednesday night it seemed to  have possibilities. Composer John Magruder's Monktet was on stage with a  nine-piece band all primed to play new arrangements of the music of Thelonious  Monk. Not a particularly new idea, but an interesting one, nonetheless. The  opening piece, "Well, You Needn't," raised a few questions, however, the most  obvious of which was, "What would Monk make of this?" Magruder had somehow  managed to reduce all the disjunct accents and quirky rhythms to the smooth and  well-rounded dimensions of what was once called "West Coast jazz."  </P> <P> "52nd St. Theme" and "Ruby, My Dear" suffered similar fates. Magruder's  variations on these classic pieces were extremely well-crafted; the ensemble  played them with nearly flawless technique. Yet the net results had little to  do with the music of Monk because they failed to acknowledge the importance of  melodic shaping in his lines, the significance of his very specific harmonic  voicings, and the singular way in which he used a single accent or two to make  a phrase come to life.  </P> <P> On a few of the pieces -- notably "Bemsha Swing" and "Epistrophy" -- Magruder  was more successful, largely because he stayed with both the interiors as well  as the exteriors of the Monk pieces. But the Monktet's best outings came on a  number of Magruder originals. Clearly, his own loose and easy lines provided  the most appropriate vehicles for Magruder's arranging style.  </P> <P> Of the soloists, only alto saxophonist Ron Singer and, to a somewhat lesser  extent, pianist Alan Steinberger, seemed to clearly understand the special  demands of the Monk pieces. Guitarist Mack Dougherty, working quietly in the  background, constantly found ways to sneak in appropriately dissonant fragments  of sound. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Best US shot for Boris:  Yeltsin leaves Vancouver facing a daunting agenda. Clinton departs to plaudits / Assessing the summit Summits, like wars, have variable shelf lives. There is no way of predicting with certainty whether Vancouver constitutes a new dawn or a futile gesture or just a middling step along a rocky road for Russian-American relations. Mr Bill Clinton's presidency may not rise or fall on it in the longer term, but, as a first foreign exercise for a man just 10 weeks in office and supposedly innocent in the ways of the world, it was an important early test, in which he may be graded positively or negatively. The former case, on balance now the stronger, is as follows. He contrived to present a substantial and substantive bilateral assistance package to Russia that, far from increasing America's domestic overdraft, inventively taps only existing resources, while holding out to the US private sector at least the prospect of lucrative new business. He thoroughly asserted his leadership over the other leading industrialised nations in the common effort to stop Russia slipping back into the hostile abyss, cajoling Japan, consulting Europe and exerting discreet pressure on the international financial institutions. He artfully co - opted a carping Congress into the co - operative effort by persuading the bipartisan leadership of the House of Representatives to go for a personal tour of inspection to Russia. He laid the ground for his domestic salesmanship with a very well constructed pre-summit speech squarely placing Russian reform in the US vital interest. And, on top of all this, he seems to have impressed Boris Yeltsin, both with his mastery of the complex issues on the table and with his almost feline deference to Russian sensibilities. He adopted a conciliatory stance regarding the recent collision in the Barents Sea between Russian and American submarines. He allowed the legitimacy of Russian complaints that some restrictive cold war legislation still on the US statute books ought no longer to be applied to a post-communist nation embarked, however haltingly, on the road to democratic and market-oriented reform: and he offered, above all, not charity but partnership. Obviously, the post-cold war rules of international relationships are still sketchy. But Mr Clinton's commitment to, and fascination with, change, so evident at home, are clearly going to be applied overseas. It is inconceivable that either of his predecessors - Ronald Reagan, sticking to his lines and his core beliefs, and George Bush, revelling in the camaraderie of the international leadership club for its own sake but faithful to it to a fault - could have displayed such inventiveness and intellectual grasp. Yet, like them, he has secured a commitment from Moscow to co-operate as far as possible across the foreign policy board. On this scorecard, Vancouver may be seen as a triumph. Even allowing for his preference for substance over form, he managed also to appear thoroughly presidential. This may have come as less of a surprise to those who have observed him closely over the past two months, but it certainly impressed the legions of Russian and foreign correspondents who descended on Vancouver. There were many favourable contrasts with the relative paucity of current European and Japanese leadership. The critical case turns most of the above arguments upside down, with twists. The fundamental objection is that, no matter what distinctions he draws between Mr Yeltsin the man and the reform process in general, Mr Clinton is betting too much on the Russian president. They had seemed an unlikely pair, the southern meritocrat fascinated with policy intricacies and the Russian strongman of the thumping fists. But if they struck a genuine personal rapport, as they said they did, two poor boys from humble backgrounds with strong populist traits, then the loss of Mr Yeltsin might even be more grievous for the US president. He has said, after all, that he wants to depersonalise international policies: to him Saddam Hussein of Iraq is not the villain he was to George Bush. But the American psyche, very much manifest in this thoroughly modern president, does personalise relations and Mr Clinton is proud of his ability to relate to people. Whether he likes it or not, and almost regardless of his policies, the loss of Mr Yeltsin would, in the US perspective, hurt Mr Clinton, whereas he would get less credit for helping to 'save' him. It could also undermine the credibility of his attempts to cut the US budget deficit, in good part dependent on taking a large bite out of defence. The second indictment is that he underestimates the intractability of Russia's economic problems. Mr Clinton is a natural born interventionist, but his laboratories so far have been familiar and domestic. Talking about the need for a responsible Russian monetary policy is far easier than bringing the central bank to heel. The reservations, so evident in Japan, that trying to aid Russia is pouring money down a drain have powerful adherents in the US. Thirdly, all presidential protestations to the contrary, there is just the hint of financial and political legerdemain about the US assistance package, which is suddenly larger than had been expected. Switching food credits around assorted agricultural programmes may help US farm exports but it looks slick at a time when fiscal responsibility is supposed to be the domestic rule. Holding out the promise of more from Congress, and getting it to repeal those trade restrictions Russia finds objectionable, may be easier said than done, especially when the domestic constituency for bailing out foreigners is so weak. The promise of many of the micro-programmes, such as student exchanges and energy efficiency assistance, will not be redeemed in a hurry. The final question is whether Mr Clinton can keep the G7 and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in line, let alone additionally tap the Saudi pocket. For there is this nagging problem, which he freely concedes, about the imperative of appropriate Russian policies being put in place. Without them, not only the Japanese may baulk. The president keeps saying that only the Russians can 'save' Russian democracy. But at least in Vancouver he gave it his own, very distinctive, best shot.</p>

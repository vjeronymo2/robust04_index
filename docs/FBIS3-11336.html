			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazil today reached an agreement with the Creditor  Banks Committee even without the IMF's participation. The  announcement was made today by Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso in New York.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received from the Brazilian  representative at the World Bank, Marcos Caramuru, information  on the decision just made by the creditor banks. Cardoso then  talked with reporters.    [Cardoso] We are, therefore, in a condition to say that by  15  April, which is the deadline, the foreign debt issue will  definitely be a closed issue.    [Amorim] In other words, after 11 years Brazil finally has a  final agreement with the creditor banks.    [Cardoso] That is right, after 11 years. I believe the banks  committee decision conveys to the financial community that  Brazil is now solvent, that it is even with its foreign debt.    [Amorim] Now that this problem has been solved, does your  candidacy for the presidency become more or less feasible?    [Cardoso] No, that makes Brazilian growth more feasible, the  economic program more feasible; I believe in a short time it  will allow the so-called risk interest rate to fall because  there will be no reasons for that, because we will no longer  have any problems with the international financial community.  Any candidacy based on an economic program of the type we  proposed, but not necessarily mine, will be stronger.    [Amorim] Nothing resembles the program of Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso more than Fernando Henrique Cardoso.    [Cardoso] Certainly, the program is really close if not  identical to my beliefs. I say it is not perhaps identical  because the program is not mine alone; it is also the country's.  But I believe this program is an important program. I believe  the acceptance made in the foreign debt negotiations is a vote  of confidence. Even when we did not yet have the final and  necessary guarantees for an agreement, we already had obtained  from the international financial community a very clear signal  that Brazil has all the necessary conditions for growth. And I  believe anyone who bets on that will bet on Brazil, and betting  on Brazil means he will have a chance to win for the benefit of  Brazil. I repeat, it is not necessary that I be the one, but  someone like me. [end recording]    The Banks Committee has suggested that the Brazilian  creditor  banks grant a waiver [preceding word in English], that is, a  pardon for the Brazilian Government, to close the foreign debt  negotiations even without an agreement with the IMF. The banks  have until 24 March to reply. The pardon will only be possible  if it is approved by two-thirds of the creditors.</p>

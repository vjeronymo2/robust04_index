			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu in FM62m loss for first eight months OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, made a FM62m (Dollars 13.2m) loss in the first eight months, reflecting lower-than-expected metal prices and a weak dollar. The result was considerably better than the FM255m loss recorded in the same period last year, but the recovery has been slower than expected because of reduced investment activity in the group's European and US markets. In the first four months, the group made a FM3m profit. Sales in the last eight months rose 1.5 per cent to FM8.147bn from FM8.029bn. Outokumpu said profitability had improved considerably compared with last year. It highlighted the November 1991 devaluation of the markka, growth in stainless steel sales, and the implementation of efficiency measures as positive factors. The group said both its copper products and technology divisions continued to make losses, while stainless steel and base metals recorded positive results. Outokumpu said Finland's decision last month to float the markka would worsen its 1992 result by FM50m, assuming a 15 per cent devaluation. It also said its decision to close down Outokumpu Copper Kenosha's drawn products line in the US would lead to FM130m in write-offs and expenses. However, the company says its 1992 result is expected to 'improve significantly' on last year's FM768m loss, although it will stay in the red. AMER, the Finnish consumer products group, reported a first-half pre-tax profit of FM40m (Dollars 8.52m), compared with a break-even result in the same period last year. The improvement for the six months to August 31 came despite a 5 per cent fall in net sales to FM3.33bn. The group blamed the drop on a continued decline in the Finnish car market and reduced demand for wholesale paper deliveries.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF, GEC move towards sonar pact Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, said yesterday it had taken the first step toward creating an alliance with GEC of the UK in the field of sonars, Reuter reports from Paris. It said it and GEC had agreed in principle with the liquidators of UK electronics group Ferranti International that the two companies each take half of the capital of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems. The acquisition of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems was a first step in a larger alliance between the French company and GEC in the sonar business, Thomson-CSF said. The alliance will involve putting each company's sonar activities under the control of a single international holding company, and will require setting up joint ventures between GEC-Marconi and Thomson-CSF in Britain, France and other countries. Under the acquisition agreement, which is being put to regulators, GEC-Marconi will take 50 per cent of the capital of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems held by Ferranti International. The rest of the capital is held by Thomson-CSF. Thomson-CSF's indirect holding in SGS-Thomson Microelectronics will fall to around 20 per cent from 23.81 per cent when the Franco-Italian semiconductor group lists its shares in New York and Paris in December. Thomson-CSF said the profit from the operation would be booked in the current year. From 1995, net profits of SGS-Thomson will be reported in Thomson-CSF's accounts based on its 20 per cent stake.</p>

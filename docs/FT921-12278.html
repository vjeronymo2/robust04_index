			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: ABB buys 10% stake in Elektrim ABB, the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group, has bought a 10 per cent share in Elektrim, a recently-privatised Polish foreign trade company specialising in power generation. Elektrim, whose principal markets are Czechoslovakia, Germany, Turkey and Austria, reported a profit of Zl 188.1bn (Dollars 16.3m) on turnover of Zl 3,425bn in the first half of last year. The privatisation valued Elektrim at Zl 210bn, with the government retaining 18 per cent of the company's 3m shares, of which 60 per cent were sold to individual inves tors and foreign companies. ABB made its purchases through two of its subsidiaries in Poland, with ABB Zamech and ABB Dolmel buying 5 per cent each at a total cost of Zl 21bn. ABB, which exported around Dollars 65m worth of goods to Poland last year, now has five joint ventures in the country. These include ABB Zamech, established in April 1990, which produces maritime equipment and gas turbines, and ABB Dolmel, as well as Dolmel Drives, which specialises in generating equipment and machine drives and was established in July 1990. ABB has also recently set up two small-scale enterprises. One is between Poland's ZWUS with ABB's railway signal producing subsidiary in Stockholm and the other a joint venture between Lamina, a Polish factory producing lamps, and Infocom, an ABB-owned company in Switzerland. Further plans for more ambitious investments by ABB in Poland have been held up by Polish fears that the Swedish-Swiss company would soon come to play a dominant role in the country's power generating equipment and related sectors.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Long View: Markets on a tightrope SO FAR, it is going more or less according to plan. At the beginning of the year, I suggested that the stock market would soon hit a high but would then struggle, and that it would be hard to make money except in second-liners and recovery stocks. But I wonder if the stock market will get a bit more volatile later in the year. The first half-year was dull indeed. The high was reached on March 8; since then, the Footsie index of 100 leaders has tracked sideways relentlessly. It was. however, a very different story in small company stocks, with the SmallCap index forging ahead steadily and showing a gain of 21 per cent after six months. With evidence of economic recovery accumulating, it was particularly agonising to be in recession-proof growth stocks (with Glaxo off more than a quarter, for instance). This mediocre performance in UK equities is quite odd in one respect because the bond market has been consistently strong. Long-dated gilt-edged yields have fallen from 9 per cent in mid-January to 8.1 per cent at the end of June, which represents the unsung success story of the financial markets in 1993 so far. The pessimists who expected gilt yields to climb towards 10 per cent are looking a little embarrassed. Inflationary pressures have subsided more rapidly than most people expected and sterling has recovered its balance, encouraging foreigners to re-appear as major gilt-edged investors. But the margin of safety remains slim, as the narrow cover of only 1.1 times showed at this week's Pounds 3.25bn gilt auction of 10-year bonds. Falling gilt yields normally would have encouraged price strength in equities, but dismal dividend prospects have prevented that. Not only are underlying dividend payments showing no growth but the company tax changes in the March Budget clobbered tax exempt investors by cutting their tax relief, so that pension funds have suffered a 6 per cent fall in their gross dividend income from UK equities compared with a year ago. In the meantime companies, by burying the market in new paper, have been signalling clearly their belief that shares are overpriced. Equity issues have totalled almost Pounds 7bn so far this year, and this month's first instalment for the BT3 issue will absorb another Pounds 1.9bn or so. Normal institutional cash flow of around Pounds 35bn a year is nowhere near enough to cope with this flood of equities on top of the torrent of gilts. Fortunately, there has been some help from a leap in unit trust net sales. These have risen from under Pounds 1bn to possibly near Pounds 4.5bn in the first six months as small savers have bailed out of low-interest deposit accounts. An influx of US pension fund money has helped, too. Where do we go from here? In a sense, the UK market has been following the pattern set last year on Wall Street when a slow recovery and low interest rates caused the stock market to be trapped interminably between hope and payoff. Because American share prices have continued to track broadly sideways in 1993 so far - the FT-Actuaries US index is up just 3.5 per cent in dollar terms - there is a strong precedent for continued narrow ranging in London. But this would be a remarkable balancing act, and it is unlikely that stability will be so persistent. Interest rates hold the key. In the US, short-term rates have been held steady at 3 per cent for 12 months now. There is much nervousness about the circumstances in which they might go up. A huge volume of US government paper has been absorbed by the banking system, with handsome profit margins created by the steepness of the yield curve (which goes up to 6.7 per cent for the long bond). A double threat is posed to the US equity market by these circumstances. If the American economy strengthens convincingly and short-term rates are raised, there could be a very nasty shake-out in bonds because of the contraction or elimination of the yield differentials, and higher interest rates would undermine stocks, too. On the other hand, if the economy remains disappointingly sluggish and the bond market crisis is avoided, corporate earnings will fail to achieve the demanding recovery targets expected by investors. It seems unlikely that the US economy will continue to be just strong enough for the markets to balance on their present tightrope. In the UK, by contrast, the immediate question is whether short-term rates have further to fall. Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, apparently does not want to cut (at least before he can tighten fiscal policy in his autumn Budget), but he might well be forced to respond to a DM crisis during the summer. The Bundesbank threw down a modest gauntlet on Thursday, cutting its discount rate by half a point to 6 3/4 per cent. A further drop in sterling deposit rates, triggering an accelerated flight into unit trusts and equities, just might lead to a final surge in the already highly-priced UK equity market. The negative response to the Bundesbank's rate cut this week did not, however, exactly indicate bottled-up strength. My inclination would be to sell into any strength, and prepare for a buffeting later in the year if Wall Street takes a tumble. There is a 3.5 per cent inflation-proofed yield available on index-linked gilts, offering tough competition for equities where the yield is just 3.9 per cent with poor dividend growth prospects for the next year or two. As for fixed interest gilts, the ratio of the long gilt yield to the equity yield is 2.1, significantly higher than it was while the UK was in the European exchange rate mechanism (it fell to about 1.8) and too high for comfort unless inflation starts to look threatening again. In fact, London's markets are positioned to cope with an inflationary dash for growth by Clarke. The downside risk for equities, therefore, is that he will play a waiting game.</p>

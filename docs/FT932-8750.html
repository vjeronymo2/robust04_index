			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: German government to cover DM 2.2bn in defaulted payments The German Finance Ministry has confirmed a newspaper report that the government was forced to cover DM2.2bn (Pounds 890m) in defaulted payments on export credits made to the former Soviet Union, Iraq and Brazil in 1992, Reuter reports from Bonn. A spokesman said the Commonwealth of Independent States defaulted on credits totalling DM955m. He added that Brazil also defaulted on Hermes export credits totalling DM747m and Iraq defaulted on DM312m. The figures were contained in a Finance Ministry report to parliament's budget committee. Because of the high rate of defaulted loans and uncertainty about future solvency, Bonn has warned German companies against conducting business in the former Soviet Union.</p>

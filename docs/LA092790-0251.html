Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> INJURY MAY DOOM BOGGS' QUEST  </P> <P> Wade Boggs' faint hopes for an eighth consecutive 200-hit season have faded  even further because of back trouble.  </P> <P> Boggs was scratched from Boston's lineup for a game with Cleveland on Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> Manager Joe Morgan also announced that Boggs would not make the trip for  tonight's game in Detroit.  </P> <P> Boggs, a five-time American League batting champion, had to leave Tuesday  night's game in the eighth inning because of back spasms.  </P> <P> He went 0-3 against the Indians' Greg Swindell, extending his slump to 0-12 and  1-20 and dropping his average to .304.  </P> <P> Boggs is 19 hits shy of joining Wee Willie Keeler as the only major league  players to get 200 eight years in a row.  </P></p>

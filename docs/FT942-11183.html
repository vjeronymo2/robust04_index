			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Brazil's biggest airline cuts costs Varig, Brazil's largest airline, yesterday announced a series of cost cutting measures in the face of continuing financial difficulties. Varig hopes the measures, the latest of its restructuring moves, will lead to monthly savings of up to Dollars 6m. The company, which has not made a profit since 1989, said that it would seek to reduce its 24,000 workforce by up to 10 per cent. Staff numbers have already been cut from 29,000 under previous restructurings. Varig also intends to reduce its regional network in Brazil. In March, the company suspended lease payments on 50 aircraft for two months in order to renegotiate its leases, which it thought too expensive. Varig said the payment suspension, due to expire later this month, had the backing of its main Brazilian lending banks. The banks wanted to see a reduction in the company's annual lease costs of Dollars 500m, negotiated before the downturn in the airline industry. Varig, which is privately owned, made losses of Dollars 97m in the year to December 31. The company's main problems remain the still-depressed Brazilian market and a stubbornly high cost base. Other recent attempts to reduce costs have included a reduction in fleet size and efforts to lift operational efficiency, which the company said could lead to annual savings of Dollars 30m.</p>

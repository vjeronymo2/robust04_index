			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "SHICHANG BAO Carries Article on Ways To Prevent </F> the Haphazard Rush of Surplus Rural Labor to the Cities"; first  three paragraphs are RENMIN RIBAO editor's note]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO) -- On 18 December  last year, this paper carried, across the top of the front page,  a report on the "program for coordinating employment in urban  and rural areas" tabled by the Labor Ministry to solve the  problem of "migrant workers." Today we have reprinted a  commentary on the problem published by SHICHANG BAO [MARKET  DAILY] in the hope of calling public attention to the matter.    The "rush of peasants job hunters to the cities" stems from  the imbalance in social economic development and also shows that  rural labor is moving toward the market. The present problem,  however, is that the spontaneous rush of surplus rural labor to  the cities has been very haphazard and has brought great  pressure to bear upon the departments responsible for  transportation and urban management, causing much inconvenience  for those peasants who are going to work in urban areas and  causing a waste of labor in circulation. The departments  concerned must do a good job in diverting and protecting the  rush of surplus rural labor to the cities.    The plan for organizing an orderly transregional migration  of  rural labor put forward by the Labor Ministry sets the principal  requirements as follows: "The transfer of labor to other  regions should be well organized; labor that is transferred from  other regions should be well managed; labor circulation services  should be provided; and the circulation of labor should be  properly regulated and controlled." This plan, which tackles  the problem head-on, is a positive measure for solving the  haphazard flow of surplus rural labor. The departments  concerned should do their utmost to coordinate their efforts and  make a success of their organizational and propaganda work so as  to effect an orderly transfer of surplus rural labor.    SHICHANG BAO published today carried a reporter's commentary  entitled "When Will There No Longer Be a Haphazard Flow of  Surplus Rural Labor?" The commentary analyzed the present state  of migrant workers and stressed the need to channel the  increasing "rush of peasant job hunters to the cities" onto a  normal course -- specifically, to promote and achieve a rational  and orderly flow of surplus rural labor.    According to the commentary, recently a large number of  peasants have been gathering around Chongwenmen in Beijing every  day, resulting in the formation of a spontaneous "labor market,"  where employers can choose the laborers they need. Many  peasants, however, failed to find a job in half a month. A  survey has shown that migrant workers currently number 20  million nationwide. They primarily are rushing to the  economically developed regions, including the Zhujiang Delta,  the Changjiang Delta, Beijing, and Tianjin from Sichuan, Hunan,  Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, and other inland provinces. Surplus  rural labor is currently estimated at 130 million. This reveals  a serious level of insufficient employment in rural areas.  Because "many peasants spend three months doing farm work, one  month celebrating the New Year, and eight months idling about"  -- which is a saying that truly portrays the plight of many  peasants -- they are choosing to work in the cities. But some  peasants fail to get a job because they do not have quick access  to information or are up against keen competition. Making a  futile journey and then failing to find a job causes them  economic losses and mental anguish. In the meantime, the  practically simultaneous rush of a large number of peasants to a  few cities puts extremely great pressure on transportation and  other basic industries, which are already considerably burdened,  and also makes urban administration and construction more  difficult.    The commentary pointed out: Allowing for the transregional  flow of the comparatively surplus rural labor is an effective  way to develop and tap labor resources in rural areas and to  give jobs to peasants as well as an important method of  transferring surplus labor. Broadly speaking, this practice is  in line with the law governing economic development. What  matters is that the rush of job seekers must be rationally  guided and controlled so as to promote what is beneficial and  what is harmful. Some experts predicted that there will be more  than 10 million migrant workers in the period around the Spring  Festival, because the underlying factors that have caused the  rush will still be there. Guangdong has formulated a set of  effective measures to alleviate the desperate situation. In  1992, Guangdong established transprovincial (transregional)  labor coordination relations with nine provinces (autonomous  regions) including Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi to organize  transprovincial (transregional) labor transfer in an orderly  way. This has enabled them to gradually effect an orderly  migration of this huge population. In 1993, the number of new  migrant workers coming to Guangdong only accounted for 5 percent  of the total migrant workers in Guangdong and represented a 70  percent decrease over the 1992 figure.    The commentary stressed: To put the increasing "rush of job  seekers" onto a normal course and to promote a rational and  orderly flow of surplus rural labor, it is necessary to  formulate fundamental rules and regulations and to form an  information system and a service network which are suited to the  market economy to facilitate transregional labor flows. From a  long-term point of view, the basic ways to standardize  transregional labor migration and eliminate the negative effect  of the rush of peasants seeking jobs, are to promote the  development of rural labor and create more job positions in  rural areas by developing the range and quality of agricultural  production, developing township enterprises, stepping up the  construction of small towns, and developing tertiary industry in  townships and towns.</p>

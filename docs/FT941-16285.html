			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK retailing Signet - the jewellery retailer which may always be better known as Ratners  -is the latest high street group to lift the veil on Christmas trading. The apparently patchy performance of stores' groups is partly due to the unreliability of year on year comparisons. Dixons disappointed last week because it had a barnstorming run with video games in 1992, but a miserable time with the same product in 1993. Projecting retail spending trends from the habits of a few million teenage telly addicts is clearly a dangerous game. Jewellery has similarly peculiar problems. Signet's sales in 1992 were much lower because the company had abandoned the disastrous discounting of 1991. Not surprisingly then, last Christmas's turnover was usefully higher than 1992, but the increase may well reflect the company's own recovery as much as an improvement in the economy. Significantly, sales at the stricken Ratners chain failed to improve. Throughout 1993, reasonably buoyant retail sales statistics contrasted strongly with the cries of pain from most retailers. The conclusion may be that turnover was frequently bought at the expense of margins. Those with strong brands and franchises have managed to profit, even under such tough conditions, while those in a weaker position had to put up with spasmodic discounting to move stocks. Since low inflation exposes price increases and poor value, and supposing that consumers remain cost conscious, pressures on high street margins seem likely to remain intense.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amer advances 76% to FM81m Amer, the Finnish consumer group, saw pre-tax profits rise by 76 per cent to FM81m (Dollars 14.7m) in the first four months, in spite of a worse performance from its Wilson sports unit and lower sales, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Sales fell 5 per cent to FM2.57bn, reflecting a stronger markka, divestments and a 6 per cent drop in Wilson's sales.</p>

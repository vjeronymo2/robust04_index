			<p>BFN     [Text] Stockholm, April 18 (AFP) -- Fourteen Swedish  organizations opposed to joining the European Union [EU] have  formed an umbrella organization to campaign against EU  membership in a referendum scheduled for November 13.    Organizers said the new body, which does not yet have a  name,  intends to provide every Swedish household with anti-EU  information in the run-up to the vote.    Included in the organization are the anti-EU factions of the  Social Democrat, Center and Christian Democrats as well as the  Left Party and Green Party.    The umbrella organization has demanded at least 98 million  kronor (12.5 million dollars) in state campaign funds.    Sweden concluded its membership negotiations in March and is  scheduled for entry into the EU on January 1, 1995 along with  Finland, Austria, and Norway.    But Swedish opposition to the union is strong.    According to the most recent poll published in the  GOETEBORGS  POSTEN daily on Sunday [16 April], 42 percent of Swedes are  opposed to membership, while 33 percent are in favour and 25  percent are undecided.</p>

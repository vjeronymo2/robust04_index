			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Political Spring party chairman Andonios Samaras  stressed in a statement today: The government must clearly tell  the Americans that a possible recognition of Skopje would be  regarded by the Greek people as an action against them, it would  make Kiro Gligorov brash, and would make the heavy Balkan  climate even more charged.    Mr. Samaras also maintained that, within the same framework,  any military intervention in Bosnia would be a tragic mistake  and added: It would be an even more tragic mistake if Greek  forces in any way participated in these actions and the same  goes for the participation of any Balkan country, including  Turkey, in such actions.    KKE [Greek Communist Party] political bureau member Orestis  Kolozov said: The KKE opposes any military intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that if this road opens, there  is great danger for the Balkans to become engaged in such a way  that nobody knows how they would get out. Kolozov concluded:  The Greek Government should remain firm in the position that  was decided upon at the meeting between the four party leaders  and the president on the noninvolvement of our country if the  tension escalates. It should also withdraw Greek troops, whether  they are members of the AWACS crews or a Greek ship so that no  support can be given to these operations.    Coalition of the Left and of Progress issued a statement  which, among other things, stressed: Resorting to air bombings  in Bosnia would complicate the vicious circle of blood and throw  oil on the fire with danger for a broader conflagration in the  Balkans. The statement added: The Greek Government, from its  position as European Union president, must firmly and  categorically oppose the option of military intervention that is  being promoted. At the same time, the Coalition of the Left  proposes that the siege of Sarajevo and the embargo on Serbia be  postponed for one month so as to make easier the achievement of  a peaceful settlement through diplomatic means.</p>

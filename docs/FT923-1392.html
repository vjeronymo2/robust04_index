			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Brussels considers blank tapes levy THE European Commission is examining the possibility of a Europe-wide levy on blank cassette tapes and audio and video equipment. But UK officials believe that, after yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers, the Commission will not go ahead with tabling a formal proposal. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner responsible for the single market, asked ministers at the meeting how they might react to a levy. A number of countries are said to favour harmonisation. Germany, France and the Netherlands already have levies, which are supposed to help compensate performers for the widespread illegal taping of pre-recorded cassettes. But other countries, including Britain and Italy, voiced objections. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, is strongly opposed to a levy which it thinks would be superfluous and impossible to administer. A Commission official said Mr Bangemann was aware of the sensitivity of such plans, but added: 'We just want to keep in touch with member states' opinions.' The scope of existing levies varies in different member states. The Commission wants to avoid distortion in cross-border trade after internal EC barriers come down on January 1 1993. Separately, ministers waved through directives which will harmonise national legislation on homoeopathic medicines.</p>

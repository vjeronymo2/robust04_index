			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Banks face tough rules on capital adequacy British banks will have to hold additional capital to cushion them against market movements, such as rising interest rates, under proposed rules intended to bring the UK into line with a new European directive. The proposals, drawn up by the Bank of England and due to take effect in January 1996, will set tougher standards than those required by Brussels in some areas to ensure that banks remain solvent under adverse trading conditions. The move is a strong rebuff to the banks which have warned they risk losing business to French and German competitors, whose regulators may not take such a tough stand. Yesterday the British Bankers Association expressed concern about the proposals, released in a consultative document, saying the 'superequivalent' demand could leave them at a competitive disadvantage. However, Bank officials made clear that they would not weaken their plans simply in response to concerns about competition. 'We are certainly not in a Dutch auction on capital requirements,' one official said. The Bank stressed that many institutions would have an unchanged capital requirement overall, and some may even have lower requirements. This is because the European directive relaxes capital requirements for certain types of bank investment. One of the key rules would set much higher requirements than sought by the directive for UK banks holding equities issued by companies outside the European Union or Group of Ten leading industrial countries. Thus, UK banks with portfolios of say, emerging markets equities, or of Australian equities, could be hit harder than their Continental counterparts. Bank officials signalled that Brussels might modify its directive if it emerged that similar capital adequacy guidelines from the Basle committee on banking supervision currently under discussion were 'superior'. The proposed rules will allow banks to 'net' their exposures so an institution which both lends to and borrows from a counterparty will only need to hold capital against the difference. The consultation period will end early in the new year and a final version of the rules will be issued by next spring. Banks' risk assessment under scrutiny, Page 8</p>

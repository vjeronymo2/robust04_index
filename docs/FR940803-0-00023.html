			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Small credit unions that are not automated present a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> picture entirely. Because of the many dividend rate, annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage yield, and annual percentage yield earned calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by TISA, and the prohibition of the prevalent rollback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method of calculating dividends, nonautomated credit unions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much more needful of adequate resources and time to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful Truth in Savings compliance. To this end, the NCUA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board adopted a program to place retired NCUA computers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonautomated credit unions with $2 million or less in assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the length of the federal procurement process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining new NCUA computers, however, no computers will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to distribute until sometime in 1995. The Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understands that many nonautomated credit unions with assets of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $2 million or less have relied upon previous estimates of earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery dates of retired NCUA computers. Therefore, the Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has decided to expand the extension for all credit unions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for retired NCUA computers until January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only a small number of credit unions are affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension. NCUA has determined that there are 1,248 credit unions under $2 million in assets that have no or grossly inadequate computers or data processing capability. Of these credit unions, approximately 1,096 have less than $1 million in assets and approximately 152 have between $1&hyph;2 million in assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance date remains January 1, 1995, for all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit unions (automated credit unions under $2 million in assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and all credit unions having over $2 million or more in assets).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCUA encourages early Truth in Savings compliance by all credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions as soon as they are able in order to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional intent of universal Truth in Savings coverage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer held accounts in financial institutions. Each credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> union receiving this extension is encouraged to begin to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with TISA and part 707 as soon as its board of directors believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the credit union is ready.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NCUA Board is well aware that most credit unions start  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small, and historically, the fostering of small credit unions has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthened the entire credit union movement. The Board has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported and instituted several small credit union initiatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue the development of small credit unions. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance, in NCUA's Region V, a ``big brother'' partnership program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has teamed smaller credit unions with larger credit unions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proving that the smallest credit unions can be preserved if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examiners, other credit unions, and trade associations work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together cooperatively in the spirit of the credit union movement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to help those in need. Over 331 small credit unions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefiting from participation in various Region V small credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> union programs. NCUA has implemented the ``big brother'' program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all other NCUA Regions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NCUA Board recently established an Office of Community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development Credit Unions to help implement NCUA's commitment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small, low-income, and community credit unions. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board recently adopted new chartering and field of membership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies designed to encourage the creation of new credit unions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and facilitate credit union services in financially depressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities (Final Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;1, 59 FR 29066, June 3, 1994). Moreover, the agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liberalized its rules governing receipt of nonmember deposits by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income credit unions (Final Rule, 59 FR 26101, May 19, 1994),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has previously extended the Truth in Savings compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline for small credit unions (Final Rule, 59 FR 13435, March  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22, 1994). A commitment has been made by the Board to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some nonautomated, small credit unions access to laptop computers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by credit union examiners as this equipment is replaced with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newer technology. Credit unions that are not automated and under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $2 million in assets, and that have not already done so, should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact either their appropriate state credit union supervisor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCUA Regional Director no later than October 1, 1994, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in participating in the laptop computer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By these, and other, initiatives and programs, the Board seeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure all credit unions that the NCUA Board values small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit unions and will work to preserve them. Larger credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions and the trade groups are urged to assist their colleagues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the smallest credit unions. The Board believes that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selfless giving lies at the heart of the cooperative philosophy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and history of the credit union movement. Healthy, small credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions are an absolutely essential part of a bright future for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all credit unions. With this background, when the Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovered that the extensions previously granted to small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonautomated credit unions would not be sufficient to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the Board's objectives, the Board decided to grant an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been shown to the satisfaction of the NCUA Board that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small, nonautomated credit unions need more time to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the complex, technical requirements of Truth in Savings than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other, larger, more automated credit unions. An extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance date for affected credit unions will enable NCUA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other interested parties to complete the extensive training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation that is necessary to ensure that these credit unions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with part 707 by the extended compliance dates. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is taken to preserve, educate, and possibly automate (by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing retired NCUA computers and by fostering the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of minimal cost computer hardware, software and services by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties) many of these small credit unions; ensure compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Truth in Savings at the earliest possible date; assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative convenience; reduce the risk of potential losses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; and to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time for coordination of this effort among NCUA, affected credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions, data processors and other interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated previously, NCUA intends to use the December 31, 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCUA Form 5300 report to determine the requisite nonautomation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status and asset size for those credit unions filing Form 5300  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports that are eligible for the extensions in required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. Credit unions which do not file Form 5300 reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be permitted to prove nonautomation status and asset size by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other means. NCUA will consider verified self-certifications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications by appropriate state supervisory authorities, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other equivalent forms of proof as sufficient for eligibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extension by non-federally insured credit unions. Indeed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the assistance of the affected credit unions, trade groups,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the NCUA regional and central office staffs, NCUA is well on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its way to having identified credit unions in need of Truth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Savings compliance assistance, and in providing various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational and other assistance to the affected small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonautomated credit unions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Administrative Procedure Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The extension made to this part is not subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act (the ``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 551  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The extension relates to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few credit unions that need more time and assistance in complying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with part 707. No major changes are contemplated, or made, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this extension. Therefore, the NCUA Board has determined that, in this case, the APA notice and comment procedures for this extension is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 553(b)(3)(B).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the National Credit Union Administration Board on July 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Becky Baker,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18718 Filed 8&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7535&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

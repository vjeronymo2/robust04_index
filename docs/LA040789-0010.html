			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'AMERICA'S CUP DECISION'  </P> <P> While I agree with the thrust of your editorial, you're too tough on Fay in  suggesting that he shared the guilt of not honoring the spirit of friendly  competition.  </P> <P> Fay offered the San Diego Yacht Club more time to build a boat (after members  wasted three months dithering over his challenge) and an elimination series for  challengers. Both were turned down.  </P> <P> The point that is being missed is that the San Diego club offered Fay Hobson's  choice -- Judge Ciparick's court or nothing.  </P> <P> DAVID LACKEY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

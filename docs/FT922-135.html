			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dow Corning to sell medical devices unit DOW CORNING, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, the glassware company, hopes to sell most of the assets of its medical devices business, except for assets related to its discontinued production of silicone breast implants, by the end of the year. Dow Corning expects its revenues - which come mainly from the manufacture of artificial knees, hips and other metal orthopedic devices - to be about Dollars 100m in 1992. A buyer will be asked to take on 525 Dow Corning employees in Arlington, Tennessee. The production of breast implants, which was at the centre of a controversy over safety earlier this year, was discontinued in January during a review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dow Corning withdrew completely from the breast implant business in March. Dow Corning said the decision to sell its medical devices business was 'part of our ongoing strategic review.' The company said it primary expertise had come from materials innovation rather than fabrication and distribution. Last year, Dow Corning made a net profit of Dollars 152.9m on turnover of Dollars 1.8bn.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: McCaw turns in Dollars 82m deficit MCCAW Cellular Communications, the wireless telecommunications group, yesterday announced fourth quarter operating income of Dollars 178.8m, up from Dollars 125.3m a year earlier. The company recorded a Dollars 82.5m net loss for the quarter, however, because McCaw's rapid growth over the past few years has left it with a heavy debt burden, consistently putting the company in the red. For the year, operating income was Dollars 644.5m, up from Dollars 460.6m in 1991. But after debt payments, there was a net loss of Dollars 364.7m in 1992. Net revenues in the fourth quarter attributable to McCaw's cellular interests jumped 37 per cent to Dollars 363.4m. Lin Broadcasting, a cellular company in which McCaw has a 52 per cent stake, had a net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 15.4m, or 30 cents a share, down from 1991's Dollars 27.4m deficit.</p>

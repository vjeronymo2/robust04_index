			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: France Nervousness surrounding the franc has left the French stock market delicately poised. Having shed the strong gains of early this year, share prices are oscillating in a narrow range and equity strategists are groping for a convincing story. Without some resolution of the currency uncertainty, it may be a while before the CAC 40 Index makes a decisive break. The bull argument suggests that, although the French economy is quickly cooling, it remains among the soundest in Europe and that the market is fundamentally cheap. The current CAC rating is only 14 times next year's forecast earnings - which may anyway be pushed higher by possible cuts in interest rates. The unspoken hope is that the strains within the exchange rate mechanism may yet force a devaluation. That would boost the market, as in the UK, Sweden and, more latterly, Norway. Such upward pressures, however, are offset by a stream of gloomy news from the corporate sector and a slippage in earnings forecasts for individual stocks. It does not help that the Parisian property market seems to have become caught up in problems similar to London's. As long as the franc fort remains inviolable, the Bundesbank's intransigence will delay interest rate cuts hastening a downward market slide. Even if the currency tension was resolved, however, the market would then be looking forward to the government elections next March. Historically, the CAC has often proved strong in the first half of the year, only to tail away as the year progressed. Unless there is a devaluation, it could reverse the pattern next year.</p>

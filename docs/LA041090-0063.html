			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAY OPENS IN SUN, ENDS IN CHILL;  </P> <P> BROOKS' HOMER BRINGS MCKEON SECOND GUESS  </P> <P> Padre Manager Jack McKeon, engulfed by a sea of note pads, microphones and  cameras, kept looking around the room Monday afternoon, just waiting for  someone to break the silence.  </P> <P> Finally, he pleaded for someone to ask that first question. At least make a  comment. Heck, even a cough would do.  </P> <P> At last, The Question, the one on everyone's minds, slowly began tumbling  forth: "Uh, Jack, uh, do you think, maybe you left Bruce Hurst in the game, uh,  a bit too long?"  </P> <P> While reporters ducked for cover, McKeon sat back in his office chair and  laughed, nodding to pitching coach Pat Dobson, as if to say, "I told you so."  </P> <P> Sure, there were plenty of culprits in the Padres' 4-2 season-opening defeat to  the Dodgers in front of 48,686 fans at Dodger Stadium, but McKeon was the one  left fending off the questions.  </P> <P> It didn't seem to matter that the top five batters in the Padre lineup -- Bip  Roberts, Roberto Alomar, Tony Gwynn, Jack Clark and Joe Carter -- went one for  20 with six strikeouts.  </P> <P> "We just didn't do our jobs, and we didn't even get on base," Gwynn said. "I'm  not going to sit here and place the blame on somebody else."  </P> <P> It didn't seem to matter that the middle of the order -- Gwynn, Clark and  Carter -- came to the plate just once with a runner on base, and failed to even  move him over.  </P> <P> "That just can't happen night after night if we're going to win," Carter said.  </P> <P> It didn't even seem to matter that Hurst was the one who left the forkball  hanging over the plate in the eighth inning, yielding a two-out, three-run home  run to Hubie Brooks, that erased a 2-1 Padre lead and resulted in their sixth  consecutive opening-day defeat.  </P> <P> "I'm the one who threw the pitch," Hurst said, "I'm the one who's responsible,  you can't blame anybody else. And that's the way it should me."  </P> <P> But no matter who was accepting the blame, it was McKeon who decided to leave  Hurst in the game, and it was McKeon who sat in his office for almost an hour  afterward, explaining why.  </P> <P> "We didn't even think about taking him out," McKeon said. "The way he was  pitching, and with his stuff, the last thing on our minds was that he'd hit a  three-run homer.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what, the way he was pitching, I'd take my chances again every  time. It's not too often you're going to see something like that happen with  Hurst on the mound."  </P> <P> Hurst, indeed, was just nine outs away from joining Bob Feller as the only  pitchers in major-league history to throw no-hitters on opening day. He had  retired 16 of the past 17 batters he faced, allowing just two fly balls into  the outfield, when he took the mound in the seventh.  </P> <P> "The way he was pitching," McKeon said, "I really thought he had a chance."  </P> <P> Brooks, just setting the stage for the ruination of Hurst's day, broke up the  no-hitter with a leadoff single to center field. Eddie Murray followed with  another single to left, and within seconds, Greg Harris and Mark Grant were  warming up in the Padre bullpen.  </P> <P> They never were needed. Kal Daniels sacrificed the runners over, and Hurst  induced ground outs to Jeff Hamilton and Mike Scioscia, resulting in just one  run.  </P> <P> When Hurst took the mound in the eighth, he still had made only 76 pitches, no  more than 13 pitches in any inning after the first. Really, Hurst said, he felt  as good now as he did when he opened the game.  </P> <P> "I hope nobody's second-guessing Jack," Hurst said, "because I felt OK. I  wasn't tired at all."  </P> <P> McKeon, playing it cautious, had Craig Lefferts and Calvin Schiraldi warming up  in the bullpen when Hurst opened the eighth. Alfredo Griffin, the Dodgers' No.  8 hitter, led off the inning with a single to left field. He moved over to  second on Jose Gonzalez's sacrifice bunt, and went to third on Juan Samuel's  fly ball to right field. But with two outs, Hurst walked Willie Randolph on  five pitches.  </P> <P> "That really didn't bother me, though, because Randolph has hurt me in the  past," said Hurst, who knew better than anyone else that Randolph had a career  .393 batting average (33 for 84) against him. "I just didn't want to make a  mistake to him."  </P> <P> As Brooks strode to the plate, Dobson went to the mound to chat with Hurst.  Dobson asked Hurst how he felt. He told him not to forget about Randolph at  second. And he pleaded with him not to leave a ball up in the strike zone to  Brooks.  </P> <P> Dobson walked to the dugout. Hurst was left standing on the mound.  </P> <P> "I thought they were taking him out," Griffin said. "He was hanging a couple of  pitches to me that he wasn't doing in the beginning.  </P> <P> "I knew when they left him in, we had a good chance, because he wasn't pitching  the same."  </P> <P> Dobson barely had sat down on the bench when Hurst let go of a forkball that  stayed high in the strike zone. Brooks swung. The ball landed 400 feet away  over the wall.  </P> <P> "I knew it was gone just when I heard that crack," said Gwynn, playing in right  field. "When you hear a sound like that, you know it's gone."  </P> <P> Said Brooks: "I was just hoping I'd get a single and tie it up, but it didn't  work out that way."  </P> <P> Hurst finished out the inning by retiring Eddie Murray on a ground out to third  base, but it was too late. The damage was done. And three outs later, when the  Padres failed to score against reliever Don Aase -- recording just his fifth  save in four seasons -- the second-guessing commenced.  </P> <P> "What can you say, he made a bad pitch to the wrong guy," Dobson said. "If he  had thrown that same pitch to Alfredo Griffin, it's probably a fly ball to left  field.  </P> <P> "But there was no talk of taking him out, whatsoever. He deserved the chance to  win or lose that game. I guarantee if we give him that same chance 15 more  times this year, he gets out of it 13 or 14 times."  </P> <P> There, of course, was speculation that the Padres' decision might have been  different if they still had Mark Davis in the bullpen. You remember the guy? He  saved 44 games and won the Cy Young award last season, but took off for Kansas  City and their four-year, $13 million offer.  </P> <P> So what about it, if Davis was around, would he indeed have been in the game?  </P> <P> "If we had Mark Davis, we would have done the exact same thing," Dobson said.  "Maybe if he (Hurst) had finished that inning, we might have gone to the  bullpen, but not there. It wouldn't have mattered who was in the bullpen."  </P> <P> Said catcher Benito Santiago, who went three for three and was hit by a pitch  in his four plate appearances: It might have made a tough decision, but we  don't have Mark Davis any more, so we can't even think of that."  </P> <P> The Padres instead were left thinking about the 161 remaining games on their  schedule, laughing at the notion that opening day was more important than any  other.  </P> <P> OK, sure, so maybe outfielder Darrin Jackson wouldn't be in full-uniform by  9:25 in the morning any other day. It's doubtful Clark will be shaking hands  with all of his teammates before another regular-season game, telling them to  have fun. And third baseman Bip Roberts is unlikely to have butterflies before  any other game before mid-September.  </P> <P> But it still counts the same. Just one of 162.  </P> <P> If there needed to be a reminder of the relative insignificance of a  season-opener, one only needed to talk with Jackson on Monday morning. Jackson,  who battled testicular cancer in 1987, was reading a front-page article in the  morning paper about Ryan White, the 18-year-old from Indiana who died Sunday  after a five-year bout with AIDS.  </P> <P> "That changes your perspective of things in a hurry, doesn't it," Jackson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Fred Lynn, who never before had faced Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, homered in  the second inning on the second pitch he had ever seen from Hershiser. When  asked what his teammates told him of Hershiser before the game, he said, "They  told me I'd probably be going zero for four." . . . Dodger fans let Padre first  baseman Jack Clark know they still have a good memory Monday, booing him loudly  during the pre-game introductions. Clark, in case you forgot, hit the home run  in the 1985 playoffs off Dodger pitcher Tom Niedenfuer, vaulting the St. Louis  Cardinals into the World Series. . . . Tony Gwynn was asked by ESPN announcer  Chris Berman which nickname he preferred: Tony Gwynn One for the Gipper; Tony  the Mighty Gwynn; or Tony Gwynn, Lose or Draw. Gwynn chose the first; his  brother, outfielder Chris Gwynn of the Dodgers, was left with the second  nickname. . . . This was the first of four home-openers the Padres will be  participating in over the next eight weeks. The Padres, who will have their  home-opener at 7:05 tonight at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, also will be in  the San Francisco Giants' home-opener Friday, and the Cincinnati Reds'  home-opener April 17. . . . The crowd of 48,686 at the game Monday was 12,572  more than the Padres played in front of during their combined 14  spring-training games. . . . Former Padre pitcher Dave Dravecky, who retired  from baseball last season because of a bout with cancer, will throw out the  opening pitch tonight in the Padres' opener against the Dodgers. There also  will be presentations of 1989 Gold Glove awards before the game to Gwynn and  Benito Santiago. Gwynn also will receive his fourth Silver Slugger award.  </P></p>

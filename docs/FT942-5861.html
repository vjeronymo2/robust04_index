			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Aberdeen Trust ahead to Pounds 3.5m An expanding range of investment trusts and substantially improved margins lay behind an impressive first-half performance from Aberdeen Trust. Turnover at the fund management and accountancy services group improved by 25 per cent during the six months to March 31 - from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 8.96m - but pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 3.51m, a figure that compared with Pounds 981,000 last time and exceeded the outcome of Pounds 3.15m achieved in the group's last full year. The advance was attributed to increased income growth and reduced fixed overheads resulting from the rationalisation programme implemented last year. Directors said that a further Pounds 74m had been committed by investors in 1994 following the launch of Abtrust High Income Trust and capital issues from Abtrust New Dawn Investment Trust and Abtrust Scotland Investment. Total funds under management at the period-end amounted to Pounds 2.33bn, a rise of 22 per cent. The group has used the sizeable gain in operating cash flow to reduce borrowings; gearing was 32 per cent at end-March, down from 45 per cent at the September year-end and 67 per cent at the same stage of 1993. The interim dividend rises 20 per cent to 0.6p, payable from earnings of 2.92p (0.81p).</p>

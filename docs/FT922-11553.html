			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Rise in orders points to mild US recovery A RISE in orders for durable goods and a fall in claims for unemployment insurance were seen yesterday as further evidence that a mild US recovery is under way. The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 1.6 per cent last month, slightly more than expected in financial markets. In early April, weekly claims for unemployment insurance fell to just above 400,000, their lowest level since October. Figures released by the International Monetary Fund this week indicate that a hesitant US economic recovery is under way, partly as a result of a loosening of fiscal policy by the Bush administration. The increase in durable goods orders last month followed a flat report for February and a 2.4 per cent gain in January. Orders are running 9 per cent higher than in March last year. The increase last month, however, mainly reflected a surge in orders for aircraft, which tend to be volatile. Excluding transportation, orders rose only 0.1 per cent. The rise in orders follows other signs of a gradual upturn in manufacturing, including sluggish growth of industrial production last month and a rebound in the Purchasing Managers' Index. The Labour Department said claims for unemployment insurance fell to 404,000 in the week to April 11, the third consecutive weekly decline and the lowest level since last October. The steady decline points to a slight improvement in employment prospects this month. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook expects measures such as an acceleration of federal spending and a cut in personal tax withholding rates to contribute to a net fiscal stimulus this year equivalent to about 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product. This is a larger stimulus than assumed by most private sector analysts and follows a mildly contractionary fiscal policy last year. The IMF, however, believes the loosening of fiscal policy will undermine growth in the longer term, partly by inhibiting a decline in long bond yields. The outlook says a US recovery is under way after a setback last autumn. However, officials describe the upturn as 'hesitant' and 'modest'. The IMF expects US gross domestic product to register annual growth of 1.6 per cent this year, rising to 3.5 per cent next year. This would be well below the pace of most previous recoveries.

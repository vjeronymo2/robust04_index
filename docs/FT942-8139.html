			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Skiing: Japan is no holiday Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker aim to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition, which has now reached Japan. After almost a week of grey skies and two days of torrential rain, we have seen little of Japan's sun - rising or otherwise, writes Arnie Wilson. The only time we have managed to keep dry has been while skiing indoors. Less than an hour from Tokyo there are two indoor slopes with artificial snow, including the recently-completed Ski Dome at Funabashi, the largest in the world, with runs a third of a mile long, served by two high-speed quad chairlifts. The exterior, resembling a huge grey lunar base, is equally impressive. In nearby Tsudanuma, there is a smaller, older and friendlier version with a more sedate escalator. Japan is the only country where we have no transport of our own. Getting around by Shinkansen (bullet train) and taxi (much slower, especially in the rush hour) is exhausting and expensive. Although we have dumped eight of our 14 bags - to be retrieved later - in Wyoming, Colorado, Austria, France and even here in Japan, changing trains and walking along Japan's long platforms with a double ski bag and five other heavy bags is wearisome. There are no trolleys and taxi drivers do not like trying to manoeuvre 207cm skis in a ski bag, still dirty and dusty from Delhi, across their immaculate upholstery. So after a day's outing to a far-flung ski area, we do not hail a cab to take us from Tokyo station to our hotel a quarter of a mile away. If it is raining you cannot get a cab anyway. You just walk. And get drenched. Who said this was one long holiday?</p>

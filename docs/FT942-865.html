			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (1):  Russians will decide their own future  -No one can say which of three possible courses Russia will take as it struggles to transform itself / there are far too many imponderables.  The west can do little to influence the outcome Looking at Russia today can be done through three possible prisms. Through one, we would see economic and political improvement, albeit springing from  -and to an extent dragging with it - considerable chaos. Through another, we would see a further and perhaps even more damaging confrontation between political powers and or economic collapse - albeit not leading back to a reassertion of a communist regime. The final one is muddling through - albeit with a question mark over how far 'through' gets you, and to where. Let us take the first, and most pleasant point. After the elections of last December which produced such a strong showing for the right-and-left nationalist groupings, the trimming of the radical reformers from the cabinet did not result in an abandonment of economic reform. On the contrary: in many ways the government under Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, squeezed more tightly on credit and inflation, to keep the latter under 10 per cent a month - good by recent Russian standards. In March, Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, went to Moscow to agree a loan of Dollars 1.5bn as the second part of a systemic transformation facility - a soft loan to Russia which assisted in generating further lending from the World Bank and greater international business interest and confidence. At the same time, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier in charge of privatisation, has completed his great task of giving away Russian state industry to the population in exchange for vouchers. The next phase, in which the remaining shares will be bought for money and when, it is hoped - and there are some signs that the hope is realistic - Russian and foreign investment begins to restructure these companies, should now begin. In part, this has been made possible by a political truce which contrasts extremely favourably with the fevered and inimical relations which existed between President Boris Yeltsin and his government on the one hand and the former Supreme Soviet on the other for most of 1992-93. The leaders of the two parliamentary houses are a presidential ally - such as Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, speaker of the Federation Council or Upper House - and a potential opponent turned ally, such as Mr Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma or lower house. Although an early vote by the Duma released the ringleaders of the parliamentary revolt of October last year, a more recent one, in June, confirmed a tight budget on a second reading in spite of intense pressure from the military and industrial lobbies. The constitution which was voted in on a referendum in December 1993 unambiguously confers most power on the president, greatly moderating the struggle for primacy between the legislative and executive branches. The armed forces - including the military, the Interior Ministry and the re-vamped security force, the former KGB - are directly subordinated to the president and so far continue to show loyalty of the kind which brought them in on his side, if belatedly, in the confrontation with the Supreme Soviet last October. Under this general peace, entrepreneurship thrives. Especially in Moscow and St Petersburg, the effects of this become more and more obvious, as shops begin to transform themselves from mere distribution points to much more attractive sales venues, as a wider range of goods become available, and as competition begins between companies for customers. Russian banks and financial companies, though many are still weak, now begin to produce larger and more powerful entities which are beginning to shape up to foreign competition and are training staff in the skills to make that possible. Let us take the second prism. Through it, one sees a political and economic climate which is not peaceful, but static with ominous movements below the surface. The tight budget has been passed by parliament, but most economists and politicians believe it will be impossible to meet, and that it will buckle before the military and other demands - sparking high inflation, perhaps hyperinflation, by the end of the year. Privatisation, though its first stage is formally accomplished, has mainly made quasi-private monopolies of what were previous state monopolies - that is, less under any kind of control which might have moderated their predatory and uncompetitive behaviour. The parliamentary lull is also temporary, on this view. It is the period in which the opposition forces - especially the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the communists and others - are extending their organisation and support, ready for an assault on the presidency and the government later in the year when the economic situation worsens. The constitution is not really accepted by many of the political parties, and may not prove robust enough to withstand any serious challenge. President Yeltsin, though apparently recovered from a shaky period at the beginning of the year which saw him disappear from view for weeks on end, is still detached from government and is given to governing by decree through a closed inner circle of advisers. In the states surrounding Russia, conditions are mostly worse - the Baltic states, especially Estonia and Latvia, are an exception. In particular, Ukraine continues to plunge downwards economically and to produce political stasis - a state of affairs which impacts directly on Russia, since the Ukrainian region of Crimea is seeking closer ties with Russia and eastern Ukraine also supports a pro-Russian policy in contrast to the still-radical nationalism of the west of the country. The Caucasian states, though no threat, are extremely unstable, as is Tajikistan. The other Central Asian states are stable enough, but desperately poor. Crime is now an epidemic, from corruption to highly-organised Mafia-style criminality. Official corruption means an assumption of bad and dishonest government on the part of most of the public: the organised crime instils fear, most of all in those trying to start or maintain businesses. The last year has seen violent deaths of a number of bankers and prominent businessmen: their fellows now huddle in heavily-protected offices behind security guards. At a more mundane - but perhaps as damaging - level, widespread tax evasion deprives the state of huge amounts of tax revenue and contributes to its weakening as well as to the decay of the infrastructure. A last turn of the prism. Muddling through - which might describe much of the policy this year - has the attractiveness to the governing elite and to many others of implying no radical change. Inflation may go up, but may again be corrected. Politics will be at times unstable, but no one powerful enough has enough stake in violent change to attempt to institute it. Privatisation does not produce much improvement in enterprise behaviour initially but, bit-by-bit, the better managers and companies find it in their interest to modernise and restructure - leaving the bad to decay and die, even if preserved long after effective extinction to maintain employment. The nationalists and the communists continue to exercise a malign influence on policy, especially foreign policy - but not so much as to turn the country back into autarky or outright hostility to the west, or to any other group of states - Russia is too weak for that kind of adventure. Mr Yeltsin does not innovate but is not toppled: parliament does not bring in the necessary legislation but does not make another grab for power: the government does not fully control the economy but is not so weak as to lose power entirely. Through all of this, the tender shoots of private enterprise continue to grow as best they can - sometimes failing, sometimes partially succeeding, but generally increasing. No one can say which of these courses will be closest to the one which Russia takes: there are far too many imponderables. The west can assist Russia to avoid the worst and can contribute at the margins by helping Russians to help themselves wherever the goals are clear and achievable. But ultimately, as always, the fate of Russia depends on the Russians themselves.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Very Realist Retreat--The Greens </F> Preparing To Be in Opposition in Bonn"]    [Text] Rudolf Scharping's greatest admirers are found among  his political opponents: "He mercilessly backs the center," says  CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  Parliamentary Caucus Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble respectfully,  "the smartest thing he can do."    The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for  chancellor, on the other hand, represents the greatest  disappointment to the Greens: "He is continuing," says Spokesman  for the Executive Committee Ludger Volmer furiously, "where  Helmut Schmidt dropped off--back in the seventies." The Greens  are frustrated.    Never before had the alternative party believed themselves  so  close to governmental power as prior to election year 1994. What  had played through with mixed reviews in several laender and  municipalities appeared for the first time to be a realistic  model for Bonn: a red-green government.    But the awaited signal from the candidate for chancellor  failed to appear. While the Greens tirelessly continue promoting  their social-ecological reform alliance, Scharping is making  every effort to provide for conservative security demands.    For some time the irritated, ecologically minded peaceniks  placated themselves with the idea that the SPD chairman was  pursuing a well-planned strategy to increase the combined number  of votes: Rather than getting in the way of the Greens and their  agenda, so goes the benevolent interpretation, Scharping would  prefer to try to take voters away from the union.    Since then, however, the mood has changed dramatically.  Suspicion is growing that Scharping is turning into a true  descendant of Helmut Schmidt. For him red-green is not a serious  option, but "an accident," as Professor of Political Science  Joachim Raschke pointedly put it last week at the presentation  of a book on the SPD candidate. "Center-right," suspects  Raschke, is apparently "nothing more than a tactic."    Scharping has already become all too involved with the  union,  almost as if he intends to document its indistinguishability  from the SPD. This "idiotic self-imposed moderation," grumbles  Hesse Environmental Minister Joschka Fischer, is "a fatal  signal."    Apparently nothing frightens the SPD chairman more than the  role of a reformer. True, in the "1994 Governmental Policy  Program" a "social and ecological society" created "by a  reversal of the economy" was heralded. The policy also speaks of  a new energy and transportation policy. But most of it remains  vague or safeguarded by clauses, particularly symbolic issues  such as the speed limit or a higher mineral oils tax.    Rather than writing "time for a change" on his banners,  complains Greens Politician Hubert Kleinert, Scharping is  contributing "to the onerous atmosphere." How he, as a copy of  Kohl, expects to win SPD sympathizers, "to reach 37 or 38  percent" (Raschke), continues to puzzle many.    "We are not available as personal reinforcement for a policy  of austerity and emergency government," says former civil rights  campaigner Werner Schulz, who is currently secretary of the  Alliance 90/Greens Bundestag parliamentary group.    Of course the ecos have long been aware that no atmosphere  of  departure reigns in the country, that there is not much left to  distribute. And the term market economy is no longer a stimulus  for them. At their party conference in February they joined in  the economic debate with moderate proposals.    The demand initiated during the founding years that society  be turned inside-out starting at the bottom has become passe. A  number of unrealistic resolutions--withdrawal from NATO,  immediate ban on the use of nuclear energy, abolishment of the  Bundeswehr--are debatable even for members of the Left, like  Volmer. What is important, qualifies the spokesman for the  Fundamentalist faction, "is that action be initiated."    Realist faction leader Fischer has established himself  firmly  in politics. If he had first "taken his thrashing," as he puts  it, in the party over his project of establishing the Greens as  an "FDP [Free Democratic Party] substitute" in the political  spectrum, even the party left would now admit that he was right.    At one appearance before the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry  and Commerce Fischer was received with distrust and was bid  goodbye with ovations.    And still, gulfs remain.    The Greens are under the impression that Scharping, with his  dislike for the red-green project, is allowing himself to be  guided by his experiences as minister president. In  Rhineland-Palatinate he declined a coalition with an  unpredictable Greens group and put his money on the Free  Democrats instead.    The conflict between economy and ecology that has become  more  critical during the crisis has been worked out, as the Greens  were forced to realize, in the older, established parties--and  not in their favor.    To people who are losing ground socially and as a result of  modernization, the SPD again appears as "protector of the little  people," in keeping with the Social Democratic formula. From  this angle, the desires of the Greens seem like post-industrial  luxuries.    This also explains setbacks in the red-green models, which  appeared to be well established all over the country. "These  experiences have, on the whole, had a sobering effect," assesses  Volmer.    Partly under pressure from the SPD labor union wing, and  partly because of their empty coffers, land governments have  been forced to very realistically halt plans to reorganize  industry and the great transition scenarios for transportation  and energy. This has also been the case in Fischer's Hesse home  coalition.    The Wiesbaden coalition agreement of 1991--like the Hannover  agreement--had already robbed the Greens of any illusions. The  agreement provides for only "rearrangements" in the land budget  for new policy estimates. It goes on to say, "the financial  elbow-room, which has been decreased by German unity," will  force "the clear establishment of priorities."    Even firmly established projects quickly began to slip. The  ban on ecologically harmful PVC [polyvinyl chloride] materials  in public buildings and dwellings was lifted. As former SPD  Social Minister Armin Clauss explained, "In times of recession"  his party could not share in such a "destruction of jobs."    Transportation policy is almost always a matter of conflict  of the highest order. After the SPD's heavy losses in the 1993  municipal elections in Hesse, the party was no longer ready to  ban automobile drivers from downtown areas. Allowances for  industry and for automobile enthusiasts interfered with the  planned change.    In Frankfurt, where Greens member Tom Koenigs watches over  the finances, the automobile-free city has become stuck in the  planning stages, along with the "bicycle-friendly city." SPD  head of the Planning Department Martin Wentz is fighting against  the green-belt project: "We must decide whether we want to build  homes or not."    Banning the use of nuclear energy remains a distant  objective. At the land level Fischer has been able only to  express "severe safety concerns." Still, he succeeded in  bringing the old installation used to process plutonium in Hanau  to a standstill and in harassing managers at the power plant in  Biblis with taxes.    Seldom has coalition harmony been completely untroubled. The  SPD differs from the Greens, according to a paper published by  the left-leaning Hesse-South SPD district, "in that when  planning for the necessary ecological restructuring of the  industrial society it takes into account the social situation of  workers who will be affected."    The fact that even mutual support does not protect the  Greens  from disappointments has become apparent in Lower Saxony, where  Minister President Gerhard Schroeder can now govern with an  absolute majority following the March elections.    It was a partnership of affection. Contact with the state  chancellery was brief: "Come on over sometime."    From the very beginning, however, the Social Democrat had  adhered to a proeconomic policy, in order to appease the  traditional working clientele. Again and again Schroeder tested  the ability of the Greens to withstand suffering--for example  with his weakness for weapons exports or in the removal of the  basic right to asylum, in the construction of a testing strip  for Mercedes-Benz in swampland or with a pipeline through the  mud flats. Not one of the Lower-Saxony nuclear power plants was  dropped from the network.    After these types of experiences, departing Greens Bundesrat  Minister Juergen Trittin doubts that a reform alliance with the  SPD in Bonn is a possibility: "What is needed there first is  crisis management."    Schroeder's neighboring colleague, Klaus Wedemeier, SPD  mayor  of Bremen, also has little positive support to contribute. In  his stoplight coalition the Greens are gaining prestige, as they  are in Hesse, to the detriment of the SPD.    In the stoplight coalition with the FDP, the Greens were  hoping for "a modernization alliance." Instead,  "reappropriations and reductions" were agreed upon. Social and  cultural projects had to be cut--everything, according to Greens  Senator Ralf Fuecks, "is a compromise with reality."    It is the same everywhere that is marked by an overstrained  fiscal policy: "We muddled through," according to Volmer; "there  is no influence in that."    After all these frustrations some Greens have rediscovered a  desire to be in the opposition. In Lower Saxony, where they will  no longer be needed in the government, "many are breathing  freely," as the former Minister of Women's Affairs Waltraud  Schoppe observed: "Now they can say everything they have been  wanting to say all along."    In Bonn, too, believes the former Bundestag spokesperson,  who  hopes to return there in the fall, "we in the opposition can  wait until a braver man than Scharping arrives on the scene."    That could be quite some time.</p>

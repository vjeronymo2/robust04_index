			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / New airbag plant for Europe TRW, the US car components, defence and space group, is to invest Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) to build a new airbag inflator plant in Europe. Earlier this month the group opened a new airbag assembly plant in Italy. It said it had launched a Europe-wide search for a site for the inflator plant. Driver and passenger airbags are one of the fastest growing sectors of the world car components industry, and TRW is seeking to increase rapidly its production capacity in Europe. The US group has invested more than Dollars 750m to develop its airbag operations in North America and Europe with its main European airbag engineering and manufacturing operations at Altdorf, Germany. It has also established a facility for sewing airbags at Czestochowa, Poland. TRW said that it was planning to produce 1m airbag modules next year at its new plant at Bricherasio, near Turin, from which it will initially supply Fiat, the Italian carmaker.</p>

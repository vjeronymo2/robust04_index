			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Rabin's gambit dishes the Israeli right: The opposition has little chance of defeating the peace moves ISRAEL'S right-wing political parties and hardline Zionists appear unable to block the Palestinian peace plan and seem increasingly marginalised by the government's gambit. Although the right-wing retains considerable support in Israel and an ability to mount unruly protests, the way the peace plan has been framed - granting minimal concessions to Palestinians - has ensured its broad acceptance. Furthermore, the threat of violent resistance to the agreement from a minority is, so far, not being taken seriously in a country which prides itself on its democratic traditions and its abhorrence of intra-Jewish violence. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said yesterday: 'Israel is a democratic country. None of us is afraid in the slightest of people who do not respect the democratic system.' For the moment, the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, retains a comfortable majority both in the parliament and in the nation. He has successfully argued that, by leaving the 120,000 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories untouched, by maintaining Israel's control of occupied Arab east Jerusalem and by guaranteeing no let-up on security, the peace plan costs Israel little. So far the Israeli public has endorsed the plan. The only poll conducted has shown 53 per cent in favour. Once again Mr Rabin, a general-turned-politician, has dished the opposition. He has always argued that Israel could only negotiate from strength and that the Israeli public would only swallow a peace agreement if they were certain their government would protect their security. Since he was elected last June the 71-year-old prime minister has stolen the security issue from the right-wing opposition Likud party and won considerable respect from Israelis for acting tough. Last December he deported 400 Islamic fundamentalists. In March he sealed off the occupied territories after a wave of stabbings by Palestinians and in July he mounted a devastating seven-day bombardment against Lebanese civilians in retaliation for attacks by Arab guerrillas from Lebanon. Since the peace agreement emerged, the right-wing, led by Likud, has restrained itself to inflammatory accusations of betrayal by Mr Rabin and calls for fresh elections but they look more like spoilers in a sideshow than a real force of opposition. Mr Rabin has flatly ruled out any new poll saying his election victory last June gave him a sufficient popular mandate for peace. The prime minister has received support from unlikely sources such as the right-wing Jerusalem Post. The Israeli right fears a strengthening of the PLO, long branded a terrorist organisation bent on the destruction of the Jewish state; the use of a Palestinian entity as a springboard for attacks against Israel and a civil war among Palestinians. Most Israelis share these concerns but seem ready to take a risk for peace. In the Knesset debate on the agreement, Mr Peres accused the opposition of being 'yesterday's men' and said: 'The world has changed completely and only you haven't realised it.' Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader, has recognised the problem the right is facing in its battle to defeat the plan. Although he has raised the prospect of the agreement leading to war with Palestinian militants he said: 'We will work within all legitimate means of the opposition to stop this harmful process to the future of Israel. We will do it in the Knesset and we will do it in the street.' Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, has also threatened to lead the nation 'against the breaking up of our country. The government will not have a single quiet day until this treacherous plan is cancelled,' he said. But so far the nation has not risen up with the right. A demonstration on Monday night attracted a couple of thousand protesters. In another opinion poll of Jewish settlers, only 2 per cent said they would consider violent resistance to the peace agreement. Inside the cabinet the peace plan was passed by 16 votes to two. Although Mr Rabin is facing a coalition crisis following charges of fraud brought against two members of the ultra-religious Shas party, most Labour MPs believe that even if the two ministers resign, Shas will stay in the coalition or, at the very least, continue to support the government from the back benches. Inside parliament, Mr Rabin can count on a 67-53 peace majority composed of Labour (44), the left-wing Meretz bloc (12), Shas (6) and Arab MPs (5). The prime minister, however, sensitive to Jewish concerns about a peace deal dependent on the votes of Arabs and left-wingers, is trying to broaden his support. Intense negotiations are under way with Agudat Yisrael, an ultra-orthodox party, which has three MPs. Many observers believe Agudat Yisrael will support the agreement but will not join a coalition which includes the left-wing Meretz bloc. If so Mr Rabin's parliamentary majority will increase to 70-50.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Thornton to purchase Aetna unit trust arm THORNTON, the fund management group owned by Dresdner Bank, plans to acquire Aetna UK's unit trust business in a move which signals further consolidation in the retail investment fund industry. The group, which is chaired by Lord Peter Walker, the former Cabinet minister, is expected to announce a deal under which it will pay Pounds 13m for Aetna UK's unit trust operations which have Pounds 240m of funds under management. The deal, which is expected to be announced once due diligence investigations are completed, will lift Thornton's total funds under management to above the Pounds 1bn mark. Negotiations are understood to have been completed, however Lord Walker, who was brought in by Dresdner two years ago to restructure and expand the business, said yesterday he could not divulge details until the due-diligence process was complete. The deal would be Thornton's biggest purchase since it was acquired by Dresdner in 1988 and another important step towards its goal of becoming a leading investment group. If confirmed, the Pounds 13m price tag on the deal represents about 5.4 per cent of funds under management. This compares with the Pounds 2.5m paid by Edinburgh Fund Managers when it acquired the 10 unit trusts of Target Life Assurance Company in January - equivalent to just 2.25 per cent of the Pounds 110m in unit trust funds under management.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VETOES FAMILY LEAVE BILL  </P> <P> I heard on the news that President Bush thinks it is bad for big business to  grant 12 weeks unpaid family leave to parents. I can't believe that a man with  the family he has, and the grandchildren he has and the beliefs that he says he  has, would allow this to happen.  </P> <P> It is bad enough to have "unpaid" leave, but to not grant any leave at all, how  can he do this?  </P> <P> I believe that President Bush needs a few lessons in compassion and  understanding, something we were led to believe he had when he was running for  office, but then again, we never do ever really know the person running for  office until it is too late.  </P> <P> I think we should take a good look at future candidates and ask questions about  him that are for the good of the people and not just big business. This world  is getting smaller and smaller, and if we don't come together as a unit, we  aren't going to be much good to anyone in the long-run.  </P> <P> TONI JACOBSON  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Pension schemes planned by unions Five of the biggest trade unions plan to make new industry-wide pension schemes available for their members. Money-purchase schemes, similar to schemes pioneered in Australia, are being established in sectors where few employers traditionally offer company schemes. The first, negotiated by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, is expected to be tried out in January. One covering the voluntary sector should begin by April. Its administrators said it was supported by the MSF technical union, the TGWU general union and the Unison public services union. The GMB general union is exploring the idea in sectors including retailing, where it has about 40,000 members working for Asda, the supermarket chain. The union said it did not envisage being involved in a scheme before 1995. Mr Bill Day, the union's national pensions officer, said: 'We are involved in construction, engineering, oil rigs and the clothing sector and we are keen on developing schemes in all those areas.' The schemes are being co-ordinated by Jacques Martin Unity, a joint-venture company formed by Unity Trust Bank and Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society, the Australian insurance company. Mr Greg McTaggart, Jacques Martin Unity's chief executive, said the schemes would cover whole industry sectors and companies would be asked to contribute for employees. He said: 'We have talked to a number of small employees who think it's the best thing since sliced bread. The big unknown question at the moment is, will employers pay?' The more employers who took part, he said, the more potential the schemes would have for portability across a sector.</p>

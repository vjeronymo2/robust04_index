			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> STORM-DRAIN LOAN OKD  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday tentatively approved a $710,000-loan  from the county general fund to pay for improvements to a storm-drain system  designed to prevent another devastating landslide on Big Rock Mesa.  </P> <P> The board declared its intention to forward the money to the account of a  special drainage district whose bills must be paid by the owners of 331 homes  and lots on the mesa. A hearing and final vote were set for June 22.  </P> <P> Several mesa homeowners said in March that they were furious with the county,  which oversees the drainage project, for approving in concept the large-scale  expansion without estimating its cost. The $710,000 is expected to pay for part  of the expanded system.  </P> <P> The property owners must repay nearly $4.1 million that the county has spent  since a 1983 landslide damaged or destroyed 250 homes on the mesa.  </P> <P> County officials said they have had no reliable cost figures for the expanded  project because the area's shifting geology has redefined the problem in recent  months. But a figure should be available for a community meeting tentatively  set for June 12, said Roger Burger, deputy director of public works.  </P> <P> The meeting is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. at Smothers Theater at  Pepperdine University.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUP LEADERS LEFT NORIEGA WITH PHONE, WEBSTER SAYS  </P> <P> CIA Director William H. Webster said Friday that last month's abortive attempt  to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega failed because its leaders,  thinking that they could have "an old-fashioned coup where people don't have to  be hurt," left Noriega alone in a bedroom where he telephoned his mistress and  other supporters to rescue him.  </P> <P> "You could say . . . maybe that's what went wrong," he said. "They planned to  do it themselves. They wanted a Panamanian solution. It was kind of an  idealistic approach to their problems where people don't have to get hurt,  where you go in and take over the headquarters. They did not want anything to  happen to Noriega. They wanted him to be able to retire in dignity."  </P> <P> In an interview with journalists at the Washington Post on Friday, Webster said  there had been no "intelligence failure that would have affected (President  Bush) or denied him something that he needed to know" before the Oct. 3 coup  attempt by dissident officers of the Panama Defense Forces.  </P> <P> The plotters gave U.S. officials 24 hours' notice of their intentions, he said,  although there initially was some doubt among U.S. policy-makers about whether  the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, could be trusted. Giroldi, who was killed  after Noriega's rescue by loyalists, had been instrumental in foiling a 1988  attempt to depose the Panamanian strongman.  </P> <P> "Noriega's very crafty, and (U.S. officials) thought they might be getting set  up for some kind of embarrassment, and they wanted to proceed very slowly,"  Webster recalled. "So there's naturally some anxiety about who we are dealing  with."  </P> <P> However, Webster continued, the CIA's people in Panama reported to Washington  that they believed Giroldi "was sincere and that he had a less than even chance  of succeeding because his plan wasn't very well thought out."  </P> <P> As described by Webster, Giroldi's plan essentially involved seizing Noriega at  the defense forces headquarters and forcing him and other senior officers to  accept retirement. Noriega's retirement would have been retroactive to August,  1988, the date he had completed 25 years of service in the defense forces.  </P> <P> Webster said the plotters were so determined to give Noriega a safe and  honorable exit from power that they rebuffed a U.S. request that he stand trial  in this country where Florida grand juries have indicted him on  drug-trafficking charges. According to Webster, U.S. Army officials who met  with two Giroldi emissaries "asked whether they would turn Noriega over, and  they said no."  </P> <P> "(Giroldi) wanted to treat them as retired people, and I gather he sent Noriega  into the bedroom where there was a nice telephone, and Noriega called his  mistress and asked her to place a call or two, and he placed a few calls  himself, and they were very good calls," Webster said in succinct description  of how Noriega summoned units loyal to him to put the headquarters under siege  and reverse the coup.  </P> <P> "It was a four-hour event," Webster said. He added that by noon when two of  Giroldi's fellow plotters went to the U.S. Army headquarters to inform American  officials of the coup's apparent success "the thing was flipping. . . . They  were losing, but the two officers didn't know that . . . Then he went back home  and got executed. The other one placed a phone call and got the wrong guy on  the phone. . . . He decided he would not go back under those circumstances. So  he escaped."  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Euclidian unveils Pounds 20m placing Euclidian, one of the latest batch of corporate vehicles planning to invest in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, yesterday announced details of its proposed Pounds 20m stock market placing. It hopes to attract investors with its high gearing and by participating in a wide spread of syndicates in 1995. Impact day has been set for November 15. Euclidian has agreed a gearing and risk-sharing agreement with Centre Re, the Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary of Zurich Insurance. Under the deal, Centre Re will make available Pounds 28m in funds at Lloyd's. That will allow Euclidian to underwrite insurance policies paying premiums of Pounds 80m, four times the gross capital raised. Centre Re will buy 5 per cent of Euclidian's ordinary shares. Euclidian plans to place funds with up to 65 Lloyd's syndicates, selected by Indemnity Insurance Services, the broker and Lloyd's adviser. Mr James Truscott and Mr James Stuart, joint managing directors of IIS, are directors of Euclidian. Efforts by Lloyd's to inject corporate capital into the insurance market have not proved easy this year: shares in most of the 12 quoted corporate investment companies underwriting this year are trading below the level at listing. Wellington Underwriting, another planned Lloyd's corporate investor, has rescheduled its placing pending Lloyd's regulatory board approval of proposals to allow existing corporate vehicles to invest in others. Impact day, originally scheduled for this week, is now November 11 with dealings starting on November 17.</p>

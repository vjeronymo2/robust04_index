			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Observer: Double trouble To match the two memorial services being held for him today, Australia's late mining magnate Lang Hancock had two big slices of luck. First, his sheep farm turned out to hold iron ore for which the CRA mining group pays Pounds 5.2m yearly. He spent it on quirky schemes - like sterilisation for Aborigines - that got him branded a crackpot. The week since he died has brought nastiness, starting with police swooping on his Perth mansion, saying they'd heard he had been poisoned. And his doctor's delay in certifying his death has not deterred squabbling between his third wife Rose and his daughter by an earlier marriage, Gina Rinehart. Each sent a hearse to collect his body from the mortuary, which refused to release it to either. The widow finally prevailed, but the rivalry continues in the holding of separate memorial services. The estate should be less contentious. It is to be divided equally between the two, with the proviso that neither must contest the will, on pain of disinheritance. To add to the rancour, Mrs Hancock's daughter by a previous marriage showed off the magnate's death room to a less than respectful TV programme, with the result that the widow plans to go on the box today to defend her good name. Hancock's second slice of luck?. He's not there to see his family's behaviour.</p>

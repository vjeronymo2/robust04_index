			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Oriental Press earnings slip 15% in first half Oriental Press Group, Hong Kong's biggest newspaper publisher, suffered a 15 per cent fall in first-half earnings to HKDollars 216.6m (USDollars 28m) from HKDollars 307.5m a year earlier, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Turnover rose 13.5 per cent to HKDollars 815.6m from HKDollars 717.5m. An unchanged interim dividend of 10 cents a share is declared. The company said all its businesses had put in a good first half, suggesting most of the problems came from its new English-language daily, Eastern Express, which continued to suffer large losses. Mr Ma Ching Kwan, Oriental's chairman, hoped break-even would soon be reached and that 'the paper will become a channel for the group to enter into the competitive international media market'.</p>

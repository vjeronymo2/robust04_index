			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin said in a written statement today that Russia  would always have a role in resolving major international  issues, and that no one should ever attempt to discriminate  against Russia.    The statement was published in leaflets handed out by  Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov here today,  ITAR-TASS reported.    Following Russia's diplomatic success in persuading Serb  forces to pull back their big guns from around Sarajevo, NATO  officials and some senior Western diplomats made various  statements which seemed to express some "feeling of  disappointment", the statement said.    This sentiment reflects the position that NATO desired to  "restore order" itself, and did not appreciate the role played  by Russia, the statement said. Some people apparently wished to  stifle Russia's bid to settle the conflict through diplomatic  means, it added.    As a result, some have the impression that NATO still clings  to the old Cold War ideology, and that psychologically it is  difficult for NATO to adapt to political realities in Russia,  which have undergone drastic changes in recent years, the  statement continued.    Russia opposes ultimatums and prefers mediation, the  statement said, adding that any attempt to restore the Cold War  mentality, distrust, and spy wars run counter to the spirit of  partnership for peace.    The Russian president said in his statement that he believes  there are more reasons for peace than for war in Europe. He  again called on Western leaders to sit down at the negotiating  table to work out a final settlement of the Bosnian conflict.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister of the Zionist  regime, has announced that his regime has no intention of a  military withdrawal from the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region for  at least another three months. This announcement of the stance  of the Zionist regime has once again contradicted Yasir  'Arafat's optimism.    'Arafat had hoped that after the Zionist regime's violation  of its earlier promise to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, he  would be able to be in charge of the internal affairs of the  Gaza-Jericho autonomous region within the next month and a half.  Mockingly, Rabin said that one should congratulate an  optimistic person such as Yasir 'Arafat.    The prime minister of the Zionist regime has indirectly  admitted that there is a feeling of disappointment and despair  among the Palestinians regarding the process of the compromise.  However, the disappointment and despair of the Palestinians is  a double-edged sword, one side of which is turned towards  'Arafat and the other is aimed against the Zionist regime.    When 'Arafat signed the autonomy accord, he portrayed a  false  picture of it for the Palestinians who were under the oppression  of the Zionist regime. He tried to give rise to this false hope  that after decades of struggle there would be a Palestinian  state, at least within the limited area of the Gaza Strip and  the West Bank, and that the noble Qods [Jerusalem] would be the  capital of the Palestinian state. In addition to that, with the  creation of a Palestinian state, the Palestinian refugees would  be able to return to their land and all Palestinians prisoners  would be set free.    However, now, four months after the signing of the accord  and  after the shattering of the veils of deception and the crushing  of the weak foundations of the hope built upon 'Arafat's false  promises, all that is left of the accord is despair and  despondency among the Palestinians. This has led to an  escalation of the Islamic intifadah of the Palestinians.    'Arafat has lost most of his popular and administrative  support, as well as his political and revolutionary legitimacy,  without having in practice gained anything from Israel. In the  same way, Israel has lost many of its winning cards without  being able to ensure the security of the occupiers and without  harming the intifadah whose flames she has tried very hard to  extinguish. In fact, Israel's strongest card, which has now  been used and has been made worthless, is 'Arafat himself.    Now it has been made clear to the Palestinians that,  contrary  to the false hopes that 'Arafat had aroused, there will be no  Palestinian state or government as the result of the autonomy  accord. Israel, which has used the size of the Jericho region  as an excuse for the nonimplementation of the accord, will never  give up other occupied territories including the West Bank and  noble Qods. Furthermore, Zionist settlements will remain in the  autonomous regions as the military outposts of the occupying  regime and as bases for ensuring the continued military and  political presence of that regime. Communications between the  autonomous region and the outside world will also continue to be  under the control and supervision of the Zionist regime.    As regards 'Arafat's occasional statements about Jerusalem  being the capital of the Palestinian state, it is sufficient to  refer to Rabin's warnings and his arrogant telling off of  'Arafat during the talks in Cairo to make it clear that it has  been nothing but a propaganda ploy by 'Arafat.    The fact that on the basis of the accord the return of many  millions of Palestinian refugees who left the occupied  territories in 1948 is out of the question, and that the return  of the refugees who left in 1967 is also conditional,  demonstrates that the Gaza- Jericho Accord was indeed signed  against the interests of several million Palestinian refugees.    Now, there is only 'Arafat, Israel, and many dashed hopes.  Israel is trying to ensure the security of the occupiers at the  expense of all those dashed hopes. Consequently, she refrains  from withdrawing by resorting to various excuses. However, this  has further inflamed the rage of the Palestinians and has  further intensified the intifadah, as a result of which the  prospects for the security of the occupying regime have also  become much dimmer.    The approach of the Palestinian strugglers has even  encouraged the members of 'Arafat's Fatah movement to gradually  separate their paths from that of 'Arafat and to turn toward the  successful experiment of the Islamic intifadah.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Next steps in Ulster The news from Sinn Fein is, as ever, dire. The political wing of the Irish Republican Army announced, after lengthy deliberations on Sunday, that sections of the joint Irish-British peace declaration of December 1993 were 'negative and contradictory'. It could not, it said, accept what it called the 'Unionist veto' on a united Ireland. It declined to promise that IRA terrorism would cease, so that points of difference could be debated at the conference table. Clearly the IRA/Sinn Fein is fixated on the idea that, since it cannot persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to accept the governance of the Republic of Ireland, it must persist in its attempts to bomb them into submission. This strategy of the 'armed struggle' has failed for 25 years. It will fail even if it continues for another quarter of a century. There will not be peace until the IRA understands this. Sinn Fein leaders are adept propagandists. They talk misleadingly of a 'new phase in the peace process' while they simultaneously decline to call an end to violence. They are not, however, shrewd judges of the British character. The public is horrified at the long run of atrocities perpetrated by the IRA and, in recent years, the 'loyalist' paramilitaries. This does not mean that a policy of cut and run would be tolerated. The contrary is true. Any British government, of whatever colour, that left the people of Ulster in a state of chaos and civil war would be held in deep contempt. Its survival in office would be in doubt. Democratic basis The search for a political solution must therefore continue. The joint declaration provides a democratic basis for such a solution. Its cardinal principle is self-determination. Any party that wants a united Ireland must persuade a majority of the people of Ulster, as of the republic, to accept it. It is this principle that sticks in Sinn Fein's throat. So be it. The British and Irish governments should move quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. The other participants in this process are Northern Ireland parties that have renounced violence and are willing to attend talks. In essence this excludes the Unionist party led by the Reverend Ian Paisley as well as Sinn Fein. Progress towards a 'framework agreement' has been delayed for too long while waiting for the IRA to renounce violence and the Paisleyites to join the negotiations. Mr John Major could make this clear to Mr Paisley today. What is required now is a willingness on the part of all those who are in the talks to take risks. Each party to the process knows the leap of faith that is required; none has yet demonstrated a willingness to make the jump. The Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux would assist if they entertained proposals for cross-border co-operation. Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party should abandon the illusion that it can influence Sinn Fein. The details of Mr Hume's agreement with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, should be published. It might expose the emptiness of the latter's protestations. Clear statement The British government could assist by presenting a draft amendment of the Government of Ireland Act. That would have to include a clear statement of intent to transfer sovereignty over Ulster should its people wish it. Such a statement would constitute a guarantee that Britain means what it says about self-determination. In return, the Irish government would be asked to bring forward counterpart amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, so that the aspiration for a united Ireland contained in them would be tempered by phraseology to the effect that Ulster is recognised to be part of the United Kingdom unless its people decide otherwise. This last leap forward may be the most difficult for any of the parties concerned. All Irish political parties save Sinn Fein accept the Irish-British joint declaration. So does an overwhelming majority of the Irish people. Singling out the proposition that Ulster can decide on its own is, however, risky. Putting it to a referendum might backfire. People in the republic are uneasy when accused of leaving their northern cousins in the lurch. Yet if the peace process is to be accelerated, someone has to make the first move. If not the taoiseach, who?</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2239 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly-scheduled  "News 2001" program, carries a 28-minute interview with Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, and head of Sakigake  (Harbinger Party). The live interview, conducted in an Asahi  Television studio in Tokyo, and moderated by newscasters Yuji  Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, is joined from time to time by  regular guest commentators Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and  Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor at Keio University.    Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Takemura to comment  on  the view that the Prime Minister's Office and coalition leaders,  such as Ichiro Ozawa, worked in harmony for the first time in a  long time to have the political reform bills approved. Takemura  says: "The five representatives of the ruling parties,  including Ozawa, were in charge of contacting the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP). In a different sense, the Prime  Minister's Office, or the government, was also in contact with  the LDP. Rather than saying we acted in concert, I should say  the LDP's responses to us changed significantly. Both sides  were feeling good about the situation. There were almost no  differences of opinion within the ruling parties, and the only  thing we had in mind was to reach an agreement with the LDP.  Because of this, everything went well."    Asked to explain when the political reform compromise  package  will be enacted, Takemura answers: "The preamble of the  memorandum states that the revised bills will be approved before  we start deliberations on the original fiscal 1994 budget at the  next ordinary Diet session, which will start tomorrow (31  January). They will probably be approved before the end of  February. An enforcement date will be decided at that time."    Regarding the contents of the package, and particularly  corporate contributions of political funds, Takemura explains  the significance of the agreement is that a politician will  designate a single fund-raising organization to which donations  can be paid, and the maximum amount of a corporate contribution  will be reduced to 500,000 yen per annum.    Pointing out that the recent agreement is just the first  step  toward political reform, Kobayashi asks Takemura if he is  already thinking about the next step. In response, Takemura  says: "The task we have to buckle down to is upper house  reform. Reform of the local electoral systems is another task."    Matsuyama asks if the gap between the Social Democratic  Party  of Japan (SDPJ) and other coalition parties has widened.  Takemura answers: "The SDPJ made bold decisions one after  another to support the Hosokawa administration. I think the  Hosokawa administration survived the past six months and was  able to challenge several major tasks thanks to the SDPJ's  series of bold compromises. However, the bitter processes in  the decision-making within the SDPJ were reported vividly so it  appeared to the public as if the existence of the SDPJ itself in  the coalition was a problem."    As for the possibility of policy cooperation with the LDP in  the future, Takemura says: "We should make the recent agreement  an occasion to change the harsh relations of the past between  the ruling and opposition parties. The LDP members have said  from the beginning they would make the LDP a healthy opposition  party. We seriously listen to the opinions of the opposition  party." On the possibility of including the LDP in the  coalition, Takemura says: "We still have not talked about it at  all." Takemura also rules out the possibility of uniting all  political parties into two major parties. However, he admits  there is a movement among the ruling parties -- between Sakigake  and a SDPJ group led by former SDPJ Secretary General Akamatsu,  for example -- to hold joint study sessions.    On the possibility of uniting Sakigake with Prime Minister  Hosokawa's Japan New Party, Takemura says: "I think it is only  a matter of time."    After briefly discussing the contents of a book Takemura  wrote recently, moderator Matsuyama asks Takemura to explain  what he meant by describing Japan as a country that is small but  "shines." Takemura explains that, in the international  community, Japan is perceived by many to be small because it  does not make sufficient international contributions in  nonmilitary areas, including environmental protection and  fighting against drug trafficking, but it does stand out as a  country.    Returning to the issue of reorganizing the political world  under the new electoral system, Takemura says: "We cleared the  first hurdle yesterday. We need to make some amendments in the  future. However, we politicians are seriously thinking about how  we will win elections under the new system. It is an  instinctive reaction. This mean that serious discussions on  reorganization of the political world will start soon. I think  it is inevitable."    Asked when the new electoral system will become effective,  Takemura says: "Around this fall at the earliest, if the lower  house is dissolved. However, we still have three and half more  years before our term of office runs out."    On the possibility of reorganizing the political world  within  this year, Takemura answers: "I think we have a 100 percent  possibility of reorganizing the political world before the next  election."</p>

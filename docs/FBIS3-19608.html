			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement on first round of cantonal elections by Prime </F> Minister Edouard Balladur -- recorded]    [Text] The first round confirms the trust of the French in  the majority which they elected last year. It can even be said  that it is stronger than it was last year. This also indicates  that, despite the current difficulties, the French have the  feeling that the majority and the government are doing  everything they can to get the country on its feet again. It is  difficult, more difficult than you can imagine, but we are very  encouraged by this result. You all said that this would be a  test -- I did not, you did -- well the test is here and I have  the feeling that [the results have been] rather favorable for us.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGACHEV URGES CAUTION ON REFORMS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: MOSCOW'S LEADING CONSERVATIVE COUCHES HIS PLEA IN BLAND LANGUAGE.  BUT IT HIGHLIGHTS SHARP POLITICAL DIVISIONS.  </P> <P> Yegor K. Ligachev, the leading conservative within the Soviet Communist Party's  ruling Politburo, called Saturday for greater caution, more discretion and a  slower pace in implementing the country's political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> Ligachev's comments immediately put him at odds with President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, who reiterated his intention earlier last week to press for broader  and faster reforms.  </P> <P> "I do not think that there are any people who (are) satisfied with the pace and  extent of perestroika now," Ligachev said in an interview with Radio Moscow.  "But at the same time, I would call for more caution and discretion. . . .  </P> <P> "The wisdom of leadership is revealed not only in decision-making but also in  weighing the consequences of the decisions made. We are now mostly making  decisions that will guide us for decades to come, and this calls for much  responsibility."  </P> <P> Although couched in non-argumentative, non-confrontational, almost bland  language, Ligachev's comments highlighted the sharp political divisions in the  country at a crucial time when, according to most observers here, the fate of  the whole reform push will be decided.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, attempting to rekindle the fervent support that his reforms enjoyed  in their first years and to regain the momentum they have lost, called earlier  in the week for the acceleration of perestroika, or restructuring.  </P> <P> "We have now reached the point in the development of the current stage of  perestroika when we must put forward the question of speeding it up," he told a  student conference in a major policy address. "Perestroika must advance  consistently in all fields."  </P> <P> Ligachev, however, denied he had any serious differences with Gorbachev or  other Politburo members, the majority of whom now are more liberal than he and  take significantly different positions on major issues.  </P> <P> "There are no differences between us," Ligachev said on his relationship with  Gorbachev. "Claims to the contrary are no more than inventions motivated by  mistakes or a desire to drive a wedge between members of the leadership.  </P> <P> "I joined the Politburo together with Mikhail Gorbachev. We held the same views  then, and we hold the same views now. Naturally, however, we may have different  points of view on some particular matter, but in the end we come to a shared  point of view and one decision that we implement."  </P> <P> Ligachev intends to set out his position in a major speech to the Congress of  People's Deputies, the Soviet national assembly, after it opens next month, and  supporters are describing it in advance as an alternative platform to  Gorbachev's.  </P> <P> "With these new policies, get-rich-quick policies for a few, we are determined  to build a bourgeoisie to lead us into the future," Anatoly Salutsky, a  prominent writer on the conservative side of the political spectrum, said in an  interview. "Frankly, clearly, we have a better way, and we look to Yegor  Ligachev to reaffirm the verities of Marxism-Leninism and to articulate our  philosophy, our policies, our course."  </P> <P> According to Ligachev's supporters, far more numerous now than in the past two  years, Gorbachev has come to realize that he is the best protection that  perestroika has against attacks from the far right -- but that the price is  moderation of the leadership's overall policy.  </P> <P> "Ligachev is not a personal threat to Gorbachev the way that, say, (Prime  Minister Nikolai I.) Ryzhkov might be, because he knows he will never be No.  1," a source close to Ligachev said. "He and Gorbachev are close enough to be  hugging one another, and they do; Ryzhkov and Gorbachev aren't, and they  don't."  </P> <P> Ligachev, re-emerging as the spokesman for what his supporters prefer to call  the "traditional" rather than the conservative viewpoint, has carefully but  increasingly in recent months made clear his differences with Gorbachev on the  nature and course of the reforms.  </P> <P> Gorbachev sees himself and other reformers holding to a middle position among  conservatives on the far right, radicals to his left and "extremists" who  advocate the abandonment of socialism in favor of capitalism. And, while  sharply criticizing the left, he usually moves against the right to consolidate  his own power.  </P> <P> Ligachev, in contrast, sees an "open power struggle" under way -- a struggle  that has clear "class roots" that separate those who have profited enormously  from perestroika and those who have seen little improvement in their daily  lives.  </P> <P> On one side, in Ligachev's view, are the party faithful, characterized by  "their faith in socialism, the people and the principles of internationalism,"  as he put it in a speech to the Communist Party Central Committee earlier, and  on the other are those who "play democratic games" but support capitalism and  nationalist causes.  </P> <P> As the Soviet Union moves deeper into its reforms -- an undertaking supported  by both leaders -- the future role and form of the Communist Party has emerged  as a fundamental issue, and one that divides them. While Gorbachev has  continued to uphold the party's constitutionally guaranteed "leading role," he  has waffled in question-and-answer sessions; Ligachev, in contrast, has urged  the party to reinforce its role, tighten discipline and take firm stands.  </P> <P> Ligachev had been effectively sidelined for much of this year by allegations  that he had taken bribes to prevent the prosecution of party officials in  Uzbekistan, in Soviet Central Asia, on charges of corruption. While the charges  were flimsy and were ultimately rejected as groundless by prosecutors, his  political position was undermined.  </P> <P> Although his probity had always been unquestioned and he had been known for the  stern ethical posture he assumed and imposed on his subordinates, Ligachev told  the Radio Moscow interviewer that he was ready to accept criticism of his  political stand and of his actions, but that the accusations of corruption were  "downright lies and slander."  </P> <P> He had received thousands of letters of support, Ligachev added, and this had  enabled him "to endure with courage all that some people of questionable  integrity and political careerists have to say."  </P> <P> "History is the best judge, and in the end the people will judge everyone  according to his true merit," Ligachev said. "I am an optimist."  </P> <P> After he was cleared by prosecutors and the Central Committee in September, he  has carefully repositioned himself politically through firm, conservatively  phrased but moderate speeches and interviews.  </P> <P> Now assigned to supervise agriculture, Ligachev acknowledged in the Radio  Moscow interview that it would be years before the Soviet Union would be able  to feed itself.  </P></p>

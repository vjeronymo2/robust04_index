			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ROSE'S LAWYERS GO FOR ANOTHER VICTORY IN COURT  </P> <P> Pete Rose's lawyers will file papers in Columbus, Ohio with a federal judge who  is deciding which court system will try Cincinnati Reds' manager case against  Major League baseball.  </P> <P> Rose's lawyers have until noon to file their brief with U.S. District Judge  John D. Holschuh, who will decide whether Rose's lawsuit against Commissioner  Bart Giamatti should be decided in a state or a federal court.  </P> <P> Holschuh's office said the judge will not decide by today.  </P> <P> Rose's lawyers want the case returned to Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge  Norbert A. Nadel, who granted Rose a temporary restraining order last month  that stopped Giamatti from holding a hearing with Rose on allegations and  evidence that the manager bet on his own team.  </P> <P> Nadel also barred Giamatti and the Reds from suspending Rose or taking any  other action against him.  </P></p>

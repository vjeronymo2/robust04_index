			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blue chip caution International conglomerate BAT Industries and Hanson failed to inspire the market with their respective trading statements and results. BAT, which has suffered heavily over US cigarette price war worries, was particularly hit as a cautious annual statement highlighted the sluggish world economy and the continuing US concerns. The shares weakened 24 to 844p. Hanson's half-year profits of Pounds 507m were at the top end of forecasts but the company said most of its markets remained gripped by recession and it would see little, if any, boost in 1993 from the tentative evidence of an upturn. Investors saw a chance to take profits and sold the shares down 5 1/4 to 237 3/4 p on hefty 10m turnover. Mr Paul Beaufrere of agency broker James Capel favours Hanson more than BAT but argues that both companies were now offering a solid yield above 6 per cent and should be bought by long term investors.</p>

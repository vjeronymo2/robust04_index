			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: French drugs group static ROUSSEL-UCLAF, the French pharmaceutical company owned by Hoechst of Germany, has reported 1991 net profits little changed at FFr598m (Dollars 106.78m). Originally Roussel, in which Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, retains a minority stake, had expected profits to fall by about 8 per cent. However, the final quarter was more buoyant than anticipated, and the group managed to produce a slight increase in profits from the FFr597m in 1990. Roussel's turnover rose 9.9 per cent to FFr14.3bn in 1991, from FFr13bn the previous year. The company benefited from the introduction of several 'winter' products - for flu and chest problems - towards the end of 1990. The fastest growing area of Roussel last year was the small chemicals division, which saw sales increase by 25 per cent. Pharmaceuticals mustered more modest growth of 9.2 per cent, and agri-veterinary products were ahead 7.1 per cent. Roussel made provisions of FFr150m during the year to pay for the restructuring of its operations. The group closed a number of production plants in Europe, and also consolidated part of its French interests on one site at Romainville in Seine-Saint-Denis.</p>

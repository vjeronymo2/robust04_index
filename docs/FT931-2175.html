			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Swiss are most satisfied employees in Europe SWISS employees are the most satisfied in Europe, followed closely by the Dutch, while UK employees are the least satisfied, according to the latest survey of employee attitudes in eight European countries by International Survey Research. ISR, which interviewed about 310,000 workers for the survey, asked people's reactions to 15 aspects of their work such as communications, pay, job security and company identification. It found that, except for the UK, north European workers are far more satisfied than southern European employees. After the Swiss and the Dutch come the Belgians and the Germans, then Spain, France and Italy, with the UK last. The Swiss have the most favourable attitudes in all but one of the 15 categories. That category is pay, where the Dutch come top. UK workers were in the top half of the eight countries in only two categories, management and benefits, and have the most negative attitudes of all towards the quality of their work and training and their companies' communications. They also score lowest on company identification and feel the most insecure in their jobs. An earlier survey in 1992, part of the same programme of research for a group of large companies, found Spanish workers the least satisfied, followed by Italians. The fact that they have now been overtaken by UK employees may reflect the severity and depth of recession in the UK. Spanish employees are still relatively negative about their management, pay and training but they identify strongly with their employing organisations. The French have the most unfavourable attitude of all towards pay, work organisation and working relationships. German employees feel they are efficient, have good working conditions and are satisfied with their jobs. But they are critical of the way they are organised, managed, communicated with and trained. They have the most negative attitudes of all to their immediate bosses. The categories attracting the highest average favourable response across the eight countries are job satisfaction, working relationships and operating efficiency. The least favourable responses came from pay, communications, benefits and performance and development. ISR International Survey Research Ltd, Albany House, Petty France, London SW1H 9EE.</p>

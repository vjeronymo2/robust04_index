(AMD), America's  fifth-largest maker of integrated circuits, has worked out a  comprehensive plant to open up the market and contribute  investment in China.    As a first step, AMD is organizing a series of seminars in  the country to foster its relationship with Chinese customers  and build up recognition, said Jerry Lynch, AMD's vice-president  of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region.    Seminars held in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou earlier  this  month focused on programmable logic devices. Next week,  exchanges on telecommunications products will be held in  Shanghai and Shenzhen.    To boost sales on the mainland, AMD has selected Nanco  Electronics Supply Ltd. as its new distributor. The company set  up its first China office in Beijing eight years ago and has  since expanded its regional distribution network, with an office  in Shanghai. It plans to open another office in Guangzhou this  year.    Though AMD is late to enter the Chinese market, indirect  sales of its products on the mainland are not small, said Lynch,  adding that AMD regards China as a big potential market.    AMD is also interested in establishing joint ventures in the  second half of this decade.    ``But, at present, we will try to learn what China needs in  the field,'' Lynch said.    While selling products, AMD intends to train Chinese  technicians to improve China-made electronic products, said  Angie Ko, AMD's regional marketing manager.    Set up in 1969, AMD specializes in microprocessors --  computer chips -- and related computer and telecommunications  equipment. The company has manufacturing plants in the US,  Europe and East Asia.</p>

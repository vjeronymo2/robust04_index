			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (12): Fears grow of softer line on Mafia - Christopher Matthews assesses signs of a change in government attitudes The Mafia's language is traditionally allusive. No self-respecting Mafioso will directly threaten you with death. Instead, he will graciously inquire after your health. This makes Mafia watching rather like old-style Kremlin watching - a question of interpreting subtle signs and signals. Similarly, any government's pronouncements or decisions on matters pertaining to the Mafia are immediately scrutinised and interpreted to gauge the current level of determination to fight organised crime. Clearly, Mafiology is no more an exact science than was Kremlinology. All the same, fears among Mafia watchers that the Berlusconi government is about to throw the two-year-old successful offensive into reverse gear could be justified. Some damage has already been done. If most of the top bosses of the Mafia, the Neapolitan Camorra and the Calabrian 'ndrangheta are today behind bars, and if police were last year able to sequester a record L1.5 trillion worth of Mafia property, that is largely due to the fact that, since 1992, more than 700 Mafiosi have been induced to come forward as government witnesses. This, in turn, is largely the consequence of legislation passed following the Palermo assassinations of Judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, which gave the mobsters a number of incentives to collaborate with justice. Yet a revision of that law was one of the first reforms suggested by Mr Alfredo Biondi, the new justice minister. Getting Mafiosi to step forward and grass on former associates was not enough, he argued. There should be built-in safeguards to ensure that they were telling the truth. Just what the minister had in mind was not spelt out in detail, though the idea seemed to be that new collaborators should be obliged to state from the outset exactly what information they had to 'sell' to avoid subsequent corrections or 'instalment plan' revelations. Another suggestion Mr Biondi made was that Mafia witnesses should be placed under the protection of a specialist agency to be created on the lines of the US marshals' service. Although Mr Biondi has since made clear that no new legislation is in the offing, the impression left is that: a) Mafia justice collaborators are to be considered a suspect category. b) Magistrates, who at present enjoy complete autonomy in 'controlling' Mafia informers, risk seeing their role restricted. According to Mr Pino Arlacchi, professor of sociology at Florence University and a leading expert on the Mafia: 'The debate on whether collaborators can be trusted or not is useless and counter-productive. Magistrates should be capable of telling the difference between lies and the truth without being told how to.' Whether or not they are, it is clear that breaking down the wall of omerta, the code of silence that for long kept the Mafia one of the world's most successful secret societies, depends largely on the personal alchemy that develops between individual magistrates and Mafiosi. It hinges, too, on whether the latter are satisfied that they and their families can be effectively protected. Mr Tommaso Buscetta, the first Mafia boss to turn informer, kept his mouth shut until he met Giovanni Falcone, though Brazilian police had torn out his toenails and threatened to throw him from a helicopter in which he was travelling. Prof Arlacchi, himself under sentence of death from the Mafia, says that the debate on the handling of informers represents a serious setback in the war on the mobsters. Many informers, he notes, have already begun to dry up. Equally damaging, he says, is the current controversy regarding the conditions under which Mafiosi are being detained. These have been dubbed 'inhumane' by the president of the Chamber of Deputies' permanent committee on justice. Until two years ago, many Mafia bosses served their jail terms in extremely permissive conditions. They had access to cellular telephones, with which they could impart orders to their henchmen outside the prison walls, virtually limitless visits, and deferential treatment from prison guards and authorities. Many, on the strength of medical certificates, enjoyed the comfort of private clinics. All that changed after the judges were assassinated. Tough regulations were introduced. The Mafiosi were all despatched to the island prisons of Pianosa and l'Asinara, to be cut off from the outside world. 'This proved a serious blow,' says Prof Arlacchi. 'The Mafia bosses saw their prestige crumble. The myth of their impunity was shattered. But now I see a serious threat to the very edifice that we've constructed against the Mafia over the last few years.' Investigators have repeatedly warned that the Mafia would try to find ways of discrediting their former colleagues-turned-informers, while Mr Toto Riina, the supreme Mafia boss, has spoken out against the jail conditions which he and his associates have endured. In other words, a hypothetical Mafia lobby might justifiably view today's controversies as a considerable success. Why is the debate about informers taking place at all? According to Prof Arlacchi, it is being orchestrated by corrupt politicians and members of the judiciary who have the most to fear from the informers' revelations. A somewhat different view comes from Mr Paolo Cabras, a former senator and member of the parliamentiary Anti-Mafia Commission. He says the Berlusconi government is seeking to redress the internal balance of power, which swung heavily in favour of the judiciary with the Tangentopoli investigation and the subsequent collapse of the traditional political parties. Moreover, he notes, several top ministers and aides are all former lawyers - such as Mr Biondi and Mr Cesare Previti, the defence minister. They are not necessarily well-disposed towards magistrates. At this point, it can only be a matter of conjecture whether or not Italy's new government is 'soft' on the Mafia. We will have to see what the cabinet does, as opposed to the often contradictory things it says. But the signs are not encouraging.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Heseltine tackles power deadlock MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, tried yesterday to break the deadlock between British Coal and electricity companies over contract terms by suggesting they negotiate a deal for one year rather than the five under discussion. He also gave the strongest indication yet that the energy review, due to be completed by the end of January, will result in substantial increases in the market for British coal. Mr Heseltine's remarks in a letter to Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, are likely to stimulate interest by the regional electricity companies in reaching agreements. But there are still obstacles and it remained unclear last night whether agreement would be reached before the energy review is completed. Completion is due by the end of next month. Some regions would be unwilling to buy electricity at the same price as was envisaged in five-year deals because a one-year deal could give no guarantee of subsequent price reductions. Agreement will also have to be reached on tonnages, with the possibility that British Coal will want to sell more than the 40m tonnes on offer in the five-year talks. One option is that present deals will be extended by a year with adjustments for prices and volumes. In his letter, published yesterday in response to a parliamentary question, Mr Heseltine tells Mr Clarke that any contracts should not prejudice the energy review's outcome. The review, he said, was launched amid widespread concern that there might be a market for substantially higher tonnages. Mr Heseltine hoped that 'against that background' negotiators could agree arrangements that will 'ensure a sound and stable basis for the British coal industry and the electricity supply industry to plan their businesses at least for 1993-94, and pending implementation of options identified in the light of the review of the prospects of the 21 pits'. The three-year coal contracts with the electricity companies terminate at the end of March.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Two down, none to go In October 1967, I acquired 400 shares in a company called Lees, Thomas &amp; Worsnop Ltd. In May 1971, an offer was made for these shares by the Aldgate Investment Co. Ltd but I declined. Do these companies still exist and are the shares of any value? The Aldgate Investment Co. Ltd was dissolved on December 31 1977 and Lees, Thomas &amp; Worsnop Ltd followed on December 31 1980. So, the shares would appear to be valueless. (Murray Johnstone Limited).

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Resignation raises tensions THERE WAS a small rise in tension inside the European exchange rate mechanism last night as Mr Poul Schluter's resignation as Danish prime minister raised concern that Denmark's krone might come under renewed selling pressure, writes James Blitz. Mr Schluter's resignation came at 5pm London time yesterday, well after the close of official ERM trading. Markets had little time for a considered reaction. After opening in London at DKr3.8615 to the D-Mark, the krone weakened in the European morning to around DKr3.8750. Following the resignation announcement, it was quoted at DKr3.8646 at lunchtime in the US, some way above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. The main concern of currency traders is that political tension in Copenhagen may create doubts about Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty in its second referendum on the issue this spring. Mr Schluter's call for Mr Henning Dyermose, the finance minister, to replace him raised suggestions that a big change in Danish politics was not imminent. However, Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said there was certain to be pressure on the currency in the next few days. 'In the very short term, the resignation is negative, because any uncertainty is not liked by the markets,' he commented. The Irish punt came under renewed pressure in the ERM last night, falling close to its floor against the Dutch guilder In recent days, the Irish authorities have reduced money market rates in an attempt to avert a threatened rise in commercial base rates which would further hurt the Irish economy. The central bank announced yesterday that it was dropping its overnight lending rate to 15 per cent from 30 per cent. However, in afternoon trading in the US, the punt was quoted at NFl 2.9599, not far above its ERM floor of NFl 2.9510. According to Mr John Hall, an international economist at Swiss Banking Corp in London, the progressive cuts in Irish interest rates have raised concern about the new government's willingness to defend the currency. 'They have taken every opportunity to cut rates this week,' he said. 'If they really wanted to defend the currency, they should have kept rates high.' Sterling fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, amid rumours that the UK government was planning to reduce base rates in conjunction with today's figures for the retail price index. Far from encouraging the belief that rates will be lowered, the UK authorities have been adamant that monetary policy is on hold for the time being. However, the pound dropped by 2.25 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at DM2.4900.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / SNP calls for vote blow to Tories A big vote for the Scottish National party would strike panic into the Conservative government and show the rest of Europe that Scotland was serious about becoming 'a full and equal member of the European family', the party said yesterday, James Buxton writes. Launching the SNP's manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Alex Salmond, the party leader, said Scotland was not getting the full benefit of the European Union because it had no direct vote in EU institutions. The SNP holds the only one of the eight Scottish seats in the European parliament not held by Labour - Highlands and Islands, represented by Mrs Winnie Ewing since 1979. But it believes it has a good chance of winning North-East Scotland, taken by Labour in 1989 from the Conservatives by Mr Henry McCubbin, who beat Mr Allan Macartney of the SNP by 2,615 votes. Both are standing on June 9. The SNP believes its strong performance in this month's regional council elections shows that its support is growing. It won 27 per cent of the Scottish vote in the regional elections, took control of Tayside and now controls Grampian in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The SNP manifesto says its MEPs would work for a fairer distribution of EU jobs and press for a leading European institution to be brought to Scotland. EU policy must be co-ordinated to create jobs and speed up Europe's move out of recession, it adds. The SNP argues that independence would transform Scotland from 'a powerless province in an unequal British union to a powerful partner in the new European Union of equal member states'. Mr Salmond said landlocked Luxembourg 'has more say about Scotland's fishing industry than we do'.</p>

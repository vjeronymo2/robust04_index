			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gencor to pay 5 cents interim dividend Gencor, the South African mining conglomerate in talks to buy Billiton from Royal Dutch Shell, has reported distributable profit of R254m (Dollars 73m) for the four months ended December, the first results since the group sold its industrial interests last year. Comparing the results with earlier figures is complicated by Gencor's disposals and a change in financial year-end from August to June. Pro forma distributable profit for the year ended August 1993 stood at R612m. Gencor is paying an interim dividend of 5 cents a share. Gencor's gold, ferro-alloy and mineral sands businesses performed strongly thanks largely to improved operating efficiencies and with little help from commodity prices. In contrast, investment income was weaker as spending on three large capital projects - the Alusaf smelter expansion, Columbus Stainless Steel joint venture, and Oryx gold mine - drained R1bn from cash resources. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said Gencor was two years from enjoying the strong cash-flow which Alusaf and Columbus would generate once the plants were commissioned. In the short term, with only a nervous recovery in some commodities markets, Gencor would do well to meet its forecast of 37.5 cents a share full-year earnings. 'Gencor is nevertheless poised for dramatic earnings growth when the commodity cycle turns, as one day it must,' Mr Gilbertson said. He added that negotiations over Billiton, which has important aluminium and nickel assets, were taking longer than expected to conclude. In buying Billiton, Gencor has the chance of putting together a low-cost integrated aluminium business which would propel the group to being one of the world's top five producers. Chances of a successful negotiation, although complicated by financing arrangements, were better than ever, the group said, but it was 'willing to walk away from the deal' if it was not sealed by June 30.</p>

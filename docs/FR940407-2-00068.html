RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill Criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of South Dakota applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA for jurisdiction over non-Indian lands for the former lands of the Yankton Sioux Reservation, Lake Traverse (Sisseton-Wahpeton) Reservation and parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservation lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application and has made a tentative determination that the South Dakota application is adequate for all lands,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> other than Indian Country as defined in 18 U.S.C. section 1151 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , located in the following areas: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Former lands of the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Former lands of the Yankton Sioux Reservation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Former lands of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Dakota's application for program adequacy determination and the Tribal comments received in regard to that application are available for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 29, 1993, South Dakota submitted an application for adequacy determination for the State's municipal solid waste landfill permit program. On October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52486), EPA determined that South Dakota's application for adequacy determination met all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, South Dakota was granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste landfill permit program. However, EPA's decision to approve the South Dakota MSWLF permitting program did not extend to ``Indian Country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, including the following ``existing or former'' Indian reservations in the State of South Dakota: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cheyenne River; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Crow Creek; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Flandreau; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Lower Brule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Pine Ridge;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Rosebud; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Sisseton;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Standing Rock; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Yankton. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before EPA would be able to approve the State of South Dakota MSWLF permit program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the State would have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order for a State (or Tribe) to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority either pursuant to explicit Congressional authorization or applicable principles of Federal Indian law to enforce its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any geographical area for which it seeks program approval. EPA had reason to believe that disagreement exists with regard to the State's jurisdiction over ``Indian Country,'' and EPA was not satisfied that South Dakota had, at that time, made the requisite showing of its authority with respect to such lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. State of South Dakota's Application Concerning Former Lands of the Yankton Sioux, Sisseton-Wahpeton and Parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 8, 1993, the State of South Dakota submitted an application amendment to EPA for approval of its solid waste permit program ``for regulation of solid waste activities on non-Indian lands for the former lands of the Yankton Sioux, Sisseton and parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservations.'' During a 30 day period, starting November 29, 1993, EPA requested comment on the State's application from certain affected parties. Cheyenne River Sioux, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, Yankton Sioux and Rosebud Sioux Tribes submitted written comments on the State's assertion of jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Nation responded to the application of the State of South Dakota, expressing concern regarding issuance of a permit to Roberts County (South Dakota) for a new sanitary landfill and gave notice of the Tribe's intent to develop its capacity to manage its natural resources and enforce its codes within the original 1867 boundaries of the Lake Traverse Reservation. All permits issued under a program determined by EPA to be adequate must meet minimum Federal standards, including a permit to Roberts County for a new sanitary landfill. The Tribe's intentions with regard to activities within the original boundaries of the Lake Traverse Reservation are duly noted, but the Tribe's authority to take such actions is not before EPA for decision at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On review of the arguments presented and following consultation with the Department of the Interior, EPA believes that the State of South Dakota has sufficiently demonstrated that the former Lake Traverse reservation was disestablished by Act of Congress (26 Stat. 1039), as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DeCoteau <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> District County Court <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 420 U.S. 425 (1975). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Yankton Sioux Tribe argued that the Act of August 15, 1894 (28 Stat. 286, 314) did not expressly disestablish the Yankton Sioux Reservation and that the Federal Court opinions relating to the issue are not controlling. On review of the arguments and consultation with the Department of the Interior, EPA believes that the State of South Dakota has sufficiently demonstrated that the Yankton Sioux Reservation was disestablished by the Act of 1894. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Weddell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Meierhenry <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 636 F.2d 211 (8th Cir. 1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Rosebud Sioux Tribe argued that the Tribal Constitution asserts jurisdiction over all ``territory within the original confines of the Rosebud Indian Reservation'' and that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rosebud Sioux Tribe <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kneip <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 430 U.S. 584 (1977) upheld tribal regulatory jurisdiction over all lands within Todd Country and on trust lands outside. The Agency does not today comment on the potential extent of tribal jurisdiction, but is only concerned with the extent of jurisdiction of the State of South Dakota. On review of the arguments and consultation with the Department of the Interior, EPA believes that the State of South Dakota has sufficiently demonstrated that the Rosebud Sioux Reservation was diminished by three Acts of Congress (33 Stat. 254; 34 Stat. 1230; and 36 Stat. 448) to exclude from the Reservation all lands  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> other than Indian Country <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rosebud Sioux Tribe <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kneip <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Agency is making a tentative determination that the South Dakota program is adequate under section 4005 of RCRA for the disestablished areas within the former boundaries of the Lake Traverse and Yankton Reservations and the diminished portions of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. This tentative determination of adequacy does not extend to Indian Country presently located within these disestablished and diminished areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on June 2, 1994, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, 523 East Capitol, Floyd Matthews Training Center, Pierre, South Dakota, 57501. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for State of South Dakota's program. EPA will make a final decision on whether or not to approve South Dakota's program and give notice of it in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE DEFENSE INDUSTRY LAYOFFS IN THE WORKS;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: GENERAL DYNAMICS WILL LET UP TO 2,000 WORKERS GO. IT ALSO PLANS TO  CONSOLIDATE UNITS IN POMONA AND RANCHO CUCAMONGA.  </P> <P> General Dynamics said Monday that it will lay off 1,500 to 2,000 workers in the  Los Angeles area by the end of 1991 and consolidate two divisions in Pomona and  Rancho Cucamonga.  </P> <P> The St. Louis-based defense giant blamed the cutbacks on declining defense  budgets and on the negative effects of a broad Pentagon procurement policy to  seek second production sources for weapons.  </P> <P> Ralph Hawes, the firm's executive vice president, said Monday that the company  may lay off 600 to 1,000 workers by the end of this year but has made no  decision about closing any of its missile plants.  </P> <P> The firm's Valley Systems division in Rancho Cucamonga employs 3,500, and its  Pomona division employs 5,700, including 1,600 out of state. Both divisions  produce tactical missiles. The Pomona division already has laid off 560 workers  this year and is down from a peak of 8,000 three years ago.  </P> <P> "It is very clear that there is going to be less business out there," Hawes  said in a telephone interview Monday. "It is really beginning to hit home."  </P> <P> The aerospace downturn overtaking General Dynamics is expected to last at least  through the mid-1990s, by which point the California economy would have lost an  estimated 110,000 direct defense jobs, according to economic forecasters  DRI-McGraw Hill.  </P> <P> In the past year, virtually every major prime contractor in Southern California  has been forced to cut back employment, either because of a drop in business or  because it wants to flee to lower-cost areas of the nation.  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft eliminated more than 9,000 jobs last year. Lockheed may cut as  many as 8,000 jobs over the next few years. McDonnell Douglas is slashing 8,000  jobs this year. Northrop is trimming 3,000 jobs this year. Only TRW and  Rockwell International have yet to order sizable layoffs.  </P> <P> General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defense contractor and has  103,000 employees at facilities stretching from a submarine shipyard in the  Boston area to a rocket plant in San Diego.  </P> <P> Even though Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga are among the firm's smaller  operations, they have accounted for about half of the corporation's layoffs  this year.  </P> <P> The reason for the disproportionate effect is that tactical missile programs  are being sharply cut back by the Pentagon, even as it seeks to preserve the  $62.8 billion B-2 Stealth bomber program and other higher cost weapons.  </P> <P> In addition, the General Dynamics operations have been severely hurt by a broad  Pentagon policy in recent years to seek second production sources for its  weapons. Every major program at the two divisions was slated for second  sourcing, Hawes noted.  </P> <P> The Navy selected Raytheon to compete on the Standard missile and General  Electric to compete on the Phalanx shipboard gun. The Army selected Raytheon to  compete on the Army Stinger missile.  </P> <P> Now, both Raytheon and General Electric are behind schedule in learning how to  build those systems and have yet to be "certified" for production, even though  the Pentagon is continuing to award contracts to the firms, Hawes charged.  </P> <P> "They are both substantially late in getting qualified," he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, even though the Pentagon has a new policy of curtailing second source  competitions, it can not terminate the General Dynamics competitions until the  second sources have been qualified so they can compete for a final buyout of  production, Hawes charged.  </P> <P> "From a business point of view, you have to question the sanity of it," Hawes  said.  </P> <P> As a result, Hawes said, General Dynamics is now attempting to cut its costs so  it can eventually win the future competitions, assuming the competition learns  how to build the products.  </P> <P> General Dynamics said about 600 of the 1,500 to 2,000 due to be eliminated will  come from reducing duplication once the divisions are combined.  </P> <P> When General Dynamics decided to open the Rancho Cucamonga operation in 1985 in  the heyday of the Reagan Administration defense buildup, it was to relieve the  growth at the Pomona operation.  </P> <P> But the Pentagon decision to seek second sources left General Dynamics with  excess factory capacity, since it would have to share production. In Phalanx  guns, for example, General Dynamics tooled up for production of 10 systems per  month, but under dual sourcing production is likely to be two or three per  month.  </P> <P> It is not clear how the company will eliminate surplus factory space. Though  Hawes expressed the sort of dissatisfaction with the California business  climate that is now commonplace in the industry, he ruled out a total closure  of the California facilities.  </P> <P> "I don't have any immediate plans for a wholesale move out of California, but I  would certainly have to say that the trend is to move out of California on a  long-term basis," Hawes said.  </P> <P> For one thing, the firm has invested tremendously in its Pomona plant over the  years. In addition, it is partly owned by the Navy, which helps lower costs.  The Rancho Cucamonga plant is owned by General Dynamics. The two divisions also  operate plants in Camden, Ark., and on a Navajo Indian Reservation. Hawes said  the company recently opened a small plant in the Imperial Valley, where wages  are lower, to see if it can continue to do business in California at all. So  far, 100 workers are located at the facility.  </P></p>

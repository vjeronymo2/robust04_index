			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: DO-AHEAD POTATO DISH IS NO-FUSS CHOICE FOR PARTIES  </P> <P> When you want to get everything ready ahead of time, such as before a weekend  party, my potato recipe is the perfect choice. These Make-Ahead Potatoes are  first baked, then scooped out of their shells and seasoned, stuffed back in,  wrapped and refrigerated until just before you need them. Simply allow them to  return to room temperature, unwrap and place under the broiler for a few  minutes, until they are hot and ready to serve.  </P> <P> MAKE-AHEAD POTATOES  </P> <P> 3 large baking potatoes  </P> <P> Canola oil  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1/3 cup non-fat milk  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Paprika, optional  </P> <P> Thoroughly scrub potatoes. Dry with paper towels. Rub skin of each potato with  canola oil.  </P> <P> Cut each potato in half lengthwise and evenly divide onion slices between 6  potato halves. Put each potato back together, enclosing onion slices between  halves and wrap tightly with aluminum foil. Place potatoes in baking dish or on  baking sheet, place in center of oven and bake at 400 degrees 1 hour.  </P> <P> Remove potatoes from oven and unwrap. Remove onions and place in large mixing  bowl. Scoop out cooked pulp from each potato half, being careful not to tear  skins, then add pulp to onion. Reserve 6 potato skins.  </P> <P> Add margarine to potatoes and onions. Combine milk with salt, pepper and liquid  smoke. Mix well and add to potato mixture.  </P> <P> Using electric mixer or potato masher, whip potato mixture until thoroughly  mixed and smooth in texture. Divide potato mixture evenly between 6 reserved  skins and, if making ahead, re-wrap in foil and refrigerate until 1 hour prior  to serving.  </P> <P> To serve, unwrap potatoes and sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese on top of  each potato half. Sprinkle with paprika. Place potato halves under broiler  until warm and lightly browned.Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P>  Each serving contains approximately 244 calories; 4 mg cholesterol; 6 gm fat;  454 mg sodium.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Foreign Minister and Deputy </F> Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by NHK Political News Department  correspondent Sobata on 22 April; place not given; from the  "News 7" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Sobata] Hata, you have been officially nominated  as the coalition's candidate for prime minister. In the two  weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement,  consultations among the coalition parties were tough. What are  your comments on the confusion during that period?    [Hata] In view of the reasons for Hosokawa's resignation,  members of my party have been discussing the need for a stable  administration. Since we once tried to invite a new group to  the coalition government with the approval of other parties, I  was personally surprised at the latest decision by the coalition.    [Sobata] The new administration is supposed to work on a  delayed compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget. Do you think the  lineup of the Hosokawa administration should be drastically  reshuffled?    [Hata] I am undetermined on that issue, but I personally  think cabinet ministers who provided the budget plan should take  the responsibility to pass the budget bill. Even if new cabinet  ministers are assigned, they would have no time to review and  analyze the budget bill. So, generally speaking, I personally  think the enactment of the budget bill had better be done by the  ministers currently in charge.    [Sobata] However, some members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] are calling for a full-scale cabinet reshuffle. What is  your comment?    [Hata] I want to spend more time before finalizing my stance  toward the issue.    [Sobata] It is often said the coalition government has been  led by the so-called Ichi-Ichi line of Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa  and Komeito's Yuichi Ichikawa, and this is the major cause of  friction among the coalition parties. Some members of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are saying that such a  tendency may be intensified under the premiership of the  Shinseito leader. What is your opinion?    [Hata] Many people criticize the Ichi-Ichi line. Recalling  the last eight months, it was one of the most difficult periods  in the history of Japanese politics. To manage the difficulties  with the multiparty government, somebody had to take the  leadership, otherwise the coalition government could not do  anything. While their roles were highlighted too much, I think  somebody had to do that. Ozawa has long been in the center of  the nation's politics, and he knows the heavy responsibilities  of political leaders. He had to take strong attitudes to set  the political trends straight. I felt sorry about that because  he is playing a thankless role for us.    [Sobata] I would like to ask you about policy issues.  Throughout the policy debates among the coalition parties, it  was difficult to obtain SDPJ approval to increase the  consumption tax. Under such circumstances, do you really think  you can carry out tax reform before the end of June?    [Hata] Instead of discussing whether or not we can do it, we  should think about what the revenue resources for income tax  reductions should be. We have to ask the public if the income  tax cut should be discontinued next year. The tax cut should be  continued, but Japan will soon become an aged society. To  manage future problems, can we keep depending on the income tax  imposed on young workers? This is the fundamental question.  The government relies on direct taxes from individuals by 70  percent, and indirect taxes are only 30 percent of the revenue.  I think most people agree that this imbalance should be  redressed somehow; even those coalition members who opposed the  tax reform plan think some sort of reform is needed. Anyway, we  have to determine through much discussion the direction of the  tax reform before the end of June and enact legislation this  year. This is an agreement of the coalition government, and I  think we can certainly reach an accord.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Still life doubles its estimate: Saleroom A STILL LIFE of flowers in a terracotta vase, painted by Jan van Huysum in about 1730, sold for Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.95m) at Sotheby's in New York at the weekend. It was an auction record for the Dutch artist. A New York dealer paid almost double the estimate for the work, which had spent most of its life in the Hope collection in England. The sale was the highlight of an important auction of Old Master paintings, which totalled Dollars 16.4m (Pounds 9.1m) with a reasonable 23 per cent unsold. The sale suggested that buyers are prepared to pay good prices for pictures that are fresh on the market. There was an important group of French paintings on offer. A still life of walnuts, peaches and pears by Chardin sold for Dollars 2.2m, at the bottom of its estimate. A pair of landscapes by Chardin's 18th century contemporary Vernet did well at Dollars 1.54m. There is renewed interest in early gold-ground paintings in spite of problems of attribution and condition. A very early work, attributed to the 'Master of 1310' and depicting scenes from the life of a female saint, perhaps Margaret of Antioch, sold above target at Dollars 814,000. Meanwhile a panel showing scenes from the life of King David by the late 15th century Italian artist Bernardo Rosselli made Dollars 473,000. The main disappointments were failure to find a buyer for 'Coaches on the Quai des Tuileries' by Boilly, and a work attributed to Rubens and his studio. A pair of paintings by Rubens, allegories of Prudence and Fortitude, were also unsold at the Christie's sale of Old Masters in New York on Thursday. This totalled Dollars 7.86m with 21 per cent unsold. A pair of 18th century French paintings of hunters, commissioned from Charles-Joseph Natoire by Louis XV to decorate Fontainebleau, sold for Dollars 737,000, way ahead of a modest Dollars 150,000 upper estimate. A coastal scene near Naples by Pietro Fabris also did well at Dollars 495,000, while a 17th century view of a Brazilian landscape by Frans Post was on target at Dollars 473,000.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Racal-Datacom in Asian moves Racal-Datacom, the voice and data communications arm of the UK's Racal Electronics, has signed an agreement with Singapore Telecom which it believes could be worth up to SDollars 10m (Pounds 4.1m) over the next three years, Andrew Adonis writes from London . Under the agreement Singapore Telecom's commercial arm will distribute Racal-Datacom's digital, analogue and network management products, and build networks for its customers based on them. Racal-Datacom also yesterday opened an office in China, underlining its determination to advance in Asia-Pacific. The region has the world's fastest growing telecommunications market and Singapore has one of its most advanced networks. The Singapore deal is modelled on a similar alliance with British Telecommunications, estimated to be worth Pounds 40m over three years. Racal-Datacom has other alliances with US carriers MCI, Bell South and US West.</p>

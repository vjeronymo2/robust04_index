			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata expressed concern Friday over the U.S. move to revive the  Super 301 trade weapon, calling it "unilateral."    Hata told a news conference that the move is "unilateral  procedural strengthening" and that he is "concerned about it."    U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday announced  reinstatement of the 1988 trade act's Super 301 portion, which  allows the president to retaliate against countries deemed to be  engaging in unfair trade practices.    Noting that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks  completed in December had agreed to prohibit unilateral steps,  Hata said Japan hopes the United States will act on the trade  authority carefully.    He also indicated Japan will not hesitate to bring its case  to the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, if the U.S. uses the weapon against Japan.    "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than  bilaterally," he said.    Admitting that Japan's unabated current account surplus  creates frustration in other countries, Hata also emphasized the  need for Japan to make "meaningful" efforts to cut the surplus.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Divided family set to vote on McCain's future Sparks are certain to fly at a shareholders' meeting, scheduled for today, of McCain Foods, at which members of New Brunswick's feuding McCain family are due to take important decisions on the future of the multinational frozen foods maker. Family members are expected to vote on a proposal to oust Mr Wallace McCain as joint chief executive, leaving his older brother Harrison as sole chief executive pending the appointment of an outsider to head the company. The two brothers would continue as non-executive chairman and deputy chairman. Wallace has strongly resisted the move. He has proposed that the McCain family should instead spin off part of the company to the public, and that he and Harrison should step down at the same time. Wallace yesterday asked a New Brunswick court to endorse his strategy. The outcome of the shareholders' meeting depends on these court proceedings. Although McCain is a private company, members of the family have increasingly vented their anger through public court documents, press releases and leaked letters. Wallace alleged in an affidavit submitted to yesterday's court hearing that none of the second-generation family members who comprise the board of McCain Foods holding company has 'the character, ability, business experience, judgment or acumen to direct and manage (its) affairs.' He alleged that McCain's extensive UK and European activities, which are under Harrison's control, are performing poorly, compared to the North American and Australasian operations, which are under his own control. According to the affidavit, the European businesses suffered a loss in July 'for the first time in many years'. One leaked document has revealed that McCain posted profits of CDollars 84.3m (USDollars 61.6m) last year on worldwide sales of CDollars 2.7bn. But Mr Harrison McCain said in a memo to employees last week that 'all the shareholders, except Wallace's family, think that Wallace and I . . . should make way for a new, independent CEO who will run the company professionally.' Wallace, Harrison and their respective families each own one third of McCain Foods, with the remaining third split between the children of their two deceased brothers. One issue that has arisen in the search for an outside chief executive is whether the newcomer will be willing to keep McCain's head office in the picturesque hamlet of Florenceville, New Brunswick, where Harrison and Wallace McCain built their first potato processing plant in 1956. Harrison McCain stressed the importance of finding the best candidates, 'not just the ones who agree with restrictions imposed on them beforehand'. He indicated that his opposition to taking the company public was partly based on a fear that control might eventually pass to faraway institutional shareholders with little interest in maintaining links with Florenceville.</p>

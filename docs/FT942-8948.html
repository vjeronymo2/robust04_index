			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Link relief to level of investment Sir, Venture capital trusts are intended to provide a much needed source of capital for unquoted companies trading in high-risk activities. However, your article (Management: 'Will the bait be tasty enough?', May 10) reminds us of the shameful waste that can result when the parameters defining the qualifying activity are drawn too tightly. In comparison, the legislation on Employee Share Ownership Trusts occupies 10 pages of the Finance Act 1989, but one can count the number of ESOTs set up on the fingers of one hand. Let us hope that this will not be the situation with VCTs. This is particularly so as tax relief for specific activities is a form of subsidy. This relief is given at the expense of taxpayers. It can be justified only where it effectively promotes a credible government policy. For VCTs the investment mix will be crucial. This could best be dealt with by introducing a tapering relief. A VCT would decide the percentage of funds it would invest in 'qualifying companies', subject to a collar of, say, 65 per cent. The greater the proportion of funds to be so invested, the greater the tax relief available to the VCT investors. A VCT prepared to invest more than, say, 90 per cent of its funds in qualifying companies would allow its investors' gains to be completely tax free. A VCT prepared to invest only 65 per cent of its funds in qualifying companies would allow its investors' gains to be taxed at, say, half the normal rate. Partnership with private industry is an efficient use of resources to promote government policy. Efficiency requires some flexibility. A tapering relief would provide this. It would be a shame if it was possible to count the number of VCTs on the fingers of one hand. Vishvas Kanji, Fox Williams, City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz </F> and Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman  with unidentified local and foreign reporters at the Foreign  Ministry in Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Text] [Paz] I am honored to introduce to you the ministers  seated at the main table. From left to right, they are  Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero; Salvadoran  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria; Belizean Foreign  Minister Dean Barrow; Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza  Ruiz de Vielman, spokesperson for the Central American foreign  ministers; Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo; and  Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez. I will now  pass the microphone to the Guatemalan foreign minister, who will  be the spokesperson for this meeting.    [Ruiz de Vielman] Good afternoon. As spokesperson for the  Central American foreign ministers, I welcome the members of the  media and thank you for your coverage of this event, which is  very important for the region.    We have held a special meeting in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to  discuss matters of interest for Central America. We have also  taken this opportunity to discuss subjects we will present  tomorrow when the Central American presidents meet with U.S.  Vice President Al Gore in Tegucigalpa.    We have discussed topics of special interest for all our  countries. Specifically, we have discussed an alliance for  sustainable development. This is a novel and very important  concept for the region because sustainable development can be  the axis around which the policies of the governments of the  region revolve so our countries and the Central American region  become a pilot plan for sustainable development.    We have also discussed trade issues in preparation for  tomorrow's presidential meeting. We reviewed the possibility of  receiving the same benefits Mexico receives from the United  States. This initiative has been discussed in our region, and  our ambassadors have also reviewed the subject in Washington.    Another important point on the agenda is the induction of  the  United States as an extraregional member of the Central American  Development Bank. The fourth subject was the international  conference for peace and development to be held in Tegucigalpa  in October.    Those are basically the points we discussed, and as always,  the discussion took place in the usual climate of cordiality and  cooperation, as is the case with all Central American meetings.    [Reporter] I would like to know if you have discussed  whether Central America will have a unified stand on Haiti.    [Ruiz de Vielman] The topic of Haiti was not addressed. We  did not consider it in our agenda because it is not a regional  topic. These are topics that would have to be addressed at the  bilateral level by each country.    [Reporter] Could you expand on the issue of commercial  relations with the United States? What will Honduras' position  be?    [Ruiz de Vielman] The Central American region's position is  one of requesting that the advantages we have under the  Caribbean Basin Initiative not be harmed in any way by NAFTA.  For some time, we have been asking the U.S. Government to give  us the same benefits that Mexico enjoys. This is an initiative  that has been promoted for some time. These efforts will take  several months, but we are confident that at some time, we, as a  region, will enjoy treatment equal to that of Mexico.    [Reporter] Do you have any specific data on this  U.S.-Central  American alliance?    [Ruiz de Vielman] Last November, the Central American  presidents proposed the Alliance for Sustainable Development  Initiative to President Clinton. We hope to discuss it tomorrow  with Vice President Gore, as he is well aware of this matter.  He is even the author of an important book on the subject.  Sustainable development is a very innovative concept which  allows governments to streamline their policies for fighting  poverty, undertake democratization, and deal with other state  issues within the general context of protecting the environment.    [Reporter] What will happen to Salvadorans in the United  States? There is some concern that the Trifinio Plan will  create difficult situations for Guatemala and Honduras, as the  over one million Salvadorans who have to return to the country  may be relocated there.    [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers' meeting held today  did not deal with bilateral problems or situations of particular  states. The Salvadoran immigrant problem is a bilateral issue  between the United States and El Salvador.    [Reporter] Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen has  [words indistinct] countries which help clean the air must  receive some benefit for this service to humankind. The  proposal basically states that countries like the United States  and Canada, which has pollution-producing companies, must  compensate countries that favor [words indistinct]. Will you  discuss this proposal tomorrow?    [Ruiz de Vielman] We believe that some aspects of  sustainable  development policy are technical. In this foreign ministers'  meeting, we have expressed our government's commitment to adopt  the philosophy of sustainable development as a guiding policy  principle. For the time being, we will not refer to specific  projects or cooperation accords.    [Reporter] What should Central America expect from Al Gore's  visit?    [Ruiz de Vielman] Central America should expect a [word  indistinct] dialogue, a dialogue within the framework of  cooperation and friendship.    [Reporter] Central Americans have great expectations for the  arrival of the U.S. vice president. [Words indistinct]  sustainable development, but these countries, with an enormous  foreign debt, earmark large portions of their budget for debt  payments. [Words indistinct] being taken to make sustainable  development a reality.    [Ruiz de Vielman] Given our limited time tomorrow, some  important points, such as the one you addressed, will be  deferred for discussion by technical groups. The issue is  important, but all our governments will deal with it bilaterally.    [Reporter] Will the foreign debt issue be raised with Mr.  Gore?    [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers have not yet reached  a decision on that. I do not know if the presidents will  discuss it later.    [Reporter] First, will there be any request for special  treatment for Central America regarding foreign debt payments  and negotiations with international credit organizations?  Second, how united is Central America in light of the fact that  Costa Rica has already begun bilateral negotiations with Mexico?    [Ruiz de Vielman] Regarding foreign debt negotiations, I  reiterate [words indistinct] thus far during this meeting, we  have not decided to discuss this topic. Regarding Central  American unity, we believe that following recent elections in  the area, Central America is being strengthened by new leaders  who favor regional integration and cooperation. We think  Central America is advancing along the path of integration and  full cooperation.    [Reporter] What about the foreign debt Central American  countries have with the United States? Would it be possible to  [words indistinct] with the U.S. vice president to reach a  solution? Could you tell us more about the peace and  development plans that will be discussed during the meeting  [words indistinct] in our country?    [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: The foreign debt is not on  the foreign ministers' agenda, but we will consider the many  questions that have been raised on the matter. As for the peace  and development meeting in Tegucigalpa, we think it is very  important because we will discuss topics of great interest to  everyone. All foreign ministers are making a special effort to  contribute ideas and work toward the conference.    [Reporter] Who prepared the agenda for this meeting with the  U.S. vice president? Considering Central America's huge foreign  debt problem, it is inconceivable that this issue was not  included.    [Ruiz de Vielman] The agenda was drafted by the Central  American technical groups, which arrived in Tegucigalpa two days  ago. These groups chose regional topics and outlined the agenda  while taking into account the limited time available on 24 May.    [Reporter] Will there be any proposals to reduce the size of  Central American armed forces since the area is no longer  plagued by war?    [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: That topic is not on the  agenda. We have tried to focus on regional topics excluding  those issues involving bilateral or individual interests.    [Reporter] Since the topics that interest us most are not on  the agenda, could you be more specific about the Central  American proposal to the U.S. vice president and sustainable  growth? What specifically is this proposal about, and what can  we expect from this meeting with the U.S. vice president?    [Ruiz de Vielman] The idea of this meeting is not to make  specific requests concerning the way issues are focused on. The  idea with regard to sustainable growth is to express to the U.S.  Government the willingness of the states, individually and as a  region, to accept the concept of sustainable growth as a  government objective, which will guide our policies in that  direction.    In addition, we want to tell the United States that we are  already organizing at the technical level the adequate  mechanisms that will lay the groundwork for advancing in that  direction as a region. That will be one of the topics we would  like to address in the Summit of the Americas at the end of the  year. For the time being, we want to express our political  willingness to direct our actions along this path. Above all,  we will also request parity for area countries within the  framework of the benefits the United States granted Mexico and,  at a given time, joining or becoming cosignatories of NAFTA.  Joining NAFTA would be our second initiative in the commercial  area.    [Reporter] Considering the U.S. vice president's  environmental background and [words indistinct] in the past  years of U.S. companies dumping toxic waste in Central America  or establishing industries that pollute the environment, will  this issue be discussed with the U.S. vice president?    [Ruiz de Vielman] Of course. The fact that Central America  is embracing a philosophy related to sustainable growth  necessitates a position that will not allow any other country to  bring polluting industries to the area. This is part of the  general concept we will discuss as the initiative and as the  guideline for government policies we will implement.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] total parity or only in a few  areas?    [Ruiz de Vielman] We do not know exactly what will be open  to  the region, but we believe it will be partial. We do not know  what eligibility criteria will be used for such a parity. We  only have general information, but tomorrow when we make the  request we are going to try to get the U.S. Government to define  more clearly the extent of the coverage and the eligibility  criteria.    [Announcer] The news conference held by the foreign  ministers  has just ended. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz  de Vielman has just finished speaking. She is also the  spokeswoman for this special foreign ministers' meeting.</p>

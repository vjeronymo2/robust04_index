			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers put in the picture Japanese electronics company NEC has developed a computer system that can identify famous pictures from rough sketches drawn on the screen. The Intellectual Image Search System uses pattern recognition technology to analyse the colour and composition of a sketch and matches it with the most appropriate image in its database. As well as innumerable multimedia uses in education, NEC predicts that the system could be used to catch criminals by matching rough sketches drawn by witnesses to images on a police database.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Fejfar, deputy chairman of the </F> parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Nada  Adamickova; place and date not given: "Almost Nothing Has  Changed in the Army Over the Past Three Years"]    [Text] [Adamickova] You have a reputation as an advocate  of a thorough cleansing of the Army of, as you say, the old  structures. With these views, you often fall out even with  [Defense] Minister Baudys, whom you certainly do not suspect of  an affiliation with these people....    [Fejfar] This is a two-tier question. It is true that, on  the one hand, I am known as a sharp critic of the situation in  the Army; on the other hand, my colleagues tell me that I am  father of the soldiers. On the one hand, I claim that we need a  smaller, strong Army, with which we would be acceptable to NATO,  and, on the other, I must say that almost nothing has changed in  the Army over the past three years, and therefore it must be  cleansed. Nonetheless, I am not so naive to imagine that such a  cleansing can be done from one day to the next. It is a  process, and, when I speak of cleansing, I certainly do not mean  the former communists. They represented 90 percent of the Army.    [Adamickova] So, whom do you have in mind?    [Fejfar] If I am interested in anyone at all, they are two  categories: There are the former members of military  counterespionage, several hundred of whom have remained in the  Army, which certainly is not right, and the other category is  the political instructors, albeit not all of them, but, above  all, the chief indoctrinators, the entire apparatus of the Main  Political Administration. After all, these people are still  hiding in the Army, where, I believe, they have no place. They  are very experienced and able and have their own information  channels, and that is extremely dangerous.    [Adamickova] It seems, however, that Minister Baudys does  not share your concern when he says that, under his charge, the  process in the Army started to move and that a lot has changed  in the command ranks....    [Fejfar] That is a very optimistic view. Of course, it  happened partially, and there is a certain success in the  extraordinary assessment of the professional soldiers.  Nevertheless, some damage caused by this assessment, which  unnecessarily disgusted normal soldiers, is greater than the  resulting effect. I believe that it could have been done  otherwise, but it is done.    [Adamickova] How otherwise?    [Fejfar] For example, the Army could have parted with these  people in some way other than by screening. On the other hand,  I must concede, in defense of the minister, that it is easy to  talk when we do not bear any responsibility. We are only  deputies and do not have any powers in this respect.    [Adamickova] You have repeatedly voiced a suspicion publicly  that KGB agents operate within the Czech Army....    [Fejfar] There are some facts, to which I have access, but  of which I cannot speak. It is a combination of factual  knowledge combined with a certain suspicion.    [Adamickova] It has not been long since Minister Ruml  reached an agreement with Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov  that the intelligence services would not work against each  other. After all, a similar "gentlemen's agreement" was signed  once by [then] Minister Langos. However, real life demonstrates  that, in this sphere, it rather is just wishful thinking. What  do you think?    [Fejfar] It would be naive to believe that foreign  intelligence services, including the Russian one, do not operate  here. The question is whether they work against us or only  monitor the situation, whether their interest has shifted to the  economic sphere. I believe that Russian intelligence  understands that today we are not its sphere of influence, that  it is not likely that 1968 will be repeated. Thus, its  orientation certainly must be changing. In my opinion, certain  cooperation links must exist, particularly in matters of  organized crime. I would not object there. The more the  intelligence services contact one another, the better relations  will be. In summary: The intelligence services certainly  operate here, but the question is whether their activities can  be confined within certain limits.    [Adamickova] How would you assess, as a person involved  primarily in the issues of defense and security policy, the work  of the Interior Ministry?    [Fejfar] I believe that it is far from being as tragic as it  seem at first sight. Frankly, to put in order such a pigsty as  the Interior Ministry was, is a tremendously complex task.  True, an occasional error turns up, but I am convinced that, in  this situation, it is very understandable. Just remember the  state of Minister Hradilek as he was leaving the Interior  Ministry: He was a person on the verge of collapse. Minister  Sokol approached it somewhat differently, with a smile and  almost with a tennis racquet in his hand. He trivialized some  problems and is very clever today and ready to advise what the  present interior minister is to do. Minister Ruml, as I know  him, is a truly honest person, and he wants to move things  forward. I believe that the reason for the occasional scandal  is the inexperience of some people at the Interior Ministry. If  I am certain of anything, it is that the Ministry should have  its peace. I do not mean either that no one is to control it or  that the papers are not to write about a wrongdoing if it  occurs. However, constant attacks against its leadership will  not help the issue.    [Adamickova] The Interior Ministry is becoming the target  of criticism, not only because of the scandals, but especially  because of the security situation, the solution to which people  consider the most pressing problem....    [Fejfar] I believe that sometimes it is overdone. The  hysteria present in society, the feeling that every citizen is  in danger, is completely unnecessary. If you ask someone  whether anything happened to him, he usually answers: Just read  the horrors in the papers. Therefore, I believe that a little  calming down would not harm.    [Adamickova] Of course, only a greater feeling of security  would help to calm things down....    [Fejfar] Certainly. The situation is being dealt with, as  we speak. We are stricter even in the legislation. The  pseudohumanistic period, when the inmates, for instance, lived  better than other people, is long past. You are well aware of  the much stricter regulations in several criminal laws.    [Adamickova] How do you feel about the expressed opinions  that the Interior Ministry is controlled by a group of friends  that has nothing professional about it?    [Fejfar] That is difficult. The same arguments can be  applied to our intelligence service. General Lorenc would  certainly make a very good chief of counterintelligence because  what I know about him indicates that he was a perfect  professional. A changeover took place here, however, new people  started, and they are learning the job. If you get in such a  situation, you have two possibilities--either you leave the old  tested professionals at the Ministry, which is certainly not  possible, or you depend on friends, whom you trust. If there are  various scandals at the Interior Ministry, then, I believe it is  because the new clashes there with the old. It is the same  problem as in the Army, where, however, no problems are  mentioned.    [Adamickova] Do you know of some?    [Fejfar] No, I do not, but I sense that they will begin as  soon as a radical change takes place there.    [Adamickova] At the beginning of February, you took part in  a meeting in Rome between your committee and its Italian  Parliament counterpart. Have you considered the possibility of  using some of their experience in our legal code?    [Fejfar] From my point of view, the most interesting part  was the talks with the Defense Commission and the methods they  use to monitor or are planning to monitor the Army budget. The  computer networks of the Defense Ministry and the parliament are  connected via satellites, and the monitoring is regular and  topical. This should be our effort and objective. In addition,  we brought back a lot of material that we will gradually utilize.</p>

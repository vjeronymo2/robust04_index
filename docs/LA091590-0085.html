			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA EDGES NEWBURY PARK, 21-20, ON 68-YARD PASS ON GAME'S FINAL PLAY  </P> <P> Newbury Park High controlled the clock, but Ventura dominated the highlight  film after beating the host Panthers, 21-20, on a last-second, 68-yard  desperation pass. All three of Ventura's scoring plays were of 53 yards or  more.  </P> <P> With six seconds remaining, Ventura quarterback Jeff Dietz lofted a long pass  to Tommy Ruelas, who caught the ball and was tackled as he fell over the goal  line. After a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was marched off against  the rejoicing Cougars, kicker Trevor Rumsey booted a 35-yard extra point that  hooked just inside the right upright as time expired.  </P> <P> The last-second heroics were set up by junior defensive tackle Chris Haynes,  who pounced on a Newbury Park fumble at the Ventura 42-yard line with 55  seconds left.  </P> <P> Newbury Park (0-2) had a three-to-one advantage in time of possession during  the first half, but Ventura (2-0) stayed close with a number of big plays.  Ventura running back Derek Swafford burst up the middle on a 70-yard scoring  run in the second quarter to give the Cougars a 7-3 lead. Dietz, from his  defensive back position, picked up a fumble and raced 53 yards for a score and  a 13-10 third-quarter lead.  </P> <P> Swafford finished with 119 yards in 11 carries.  </P> <P> Newbury Park running back Dave Roberts rushed for 126 yards and one touchdown  in 22 carries.

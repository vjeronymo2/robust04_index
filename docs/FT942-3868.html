			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: How to stay as safe and secure as you can - Tony Walker offers guidelines for a trip to China Travel in China these days is not a tea party, as late Chairman Mao Zedong said of the revolution. The crash last week near the historic city of Xian of a Russian-built Tupolev-154, killing all 160 passengers, did nothing for already shaky confidence in China's air safety. Visitors to China might follow some fairly basic guidelines to improve the odds of surviving their expedition. The first is to avoid Russian-built planes, which comprise about 10-15 per cent of China's domestic fleet of some 350 aircraft, spread among 30 or so airlines. Mr David Mahon of Mahon and Associates, a China business consultancy, says that in scheduling flights for clients he avoids Russian Antonovs, Ilyushins and Tupolevs. On the occasions when a passenger finds that a Russian-built aircraft has been substituted for a Boeing or an Airbus, Mr Mahon's advice is to walk away, await another flight or seek alternative means of travel. To prepare for last-minute changes of plan, travel light: in other words, try to restrict luggage to 'carry-on' items. Risks of travel in China, where more than 500 have died in some half dozen crashes since 1992, mean that help on the ground is virtually a necessity. Agents abroad might lack expertise in local conditions. Ticket confirmation is also difficult to arrange at a distance, given the chaotic Chinese aircraft booking systems. China consultants are also recommending these days that their clients travel first class, since escape may be easier from the less crowded forward compartment. In selecting regional airlines, choose carriers with established reputations, such as China Eastern from Shanghai and China Southern from Guangzhou. Airlines based in remote regions should be avoided where possible. Western aviation experts attribute China's bad air safety record to the increase in airlines: there are not enough experienced pilots and maintenance staff to go round. Air traffic guidance systems are also inadequate. In addition, many airports have not been designed to receive jets which require greater length of runway than propeller-drive aircraft. Pilots come into land hard and fast, as if they want to get the process over and done with. Travellers to China have a range of options other than air travel. But again arrangements are hard to make at a distance. Ferries are a reasonably pleasant and secure means of travel between coastal cities, such as Shanghai and Ningbo in the south, or Dalian to Tianjin or Qingdao in the north - provided you can secure first or second-class accommodation. 'Soft sleeper' or 'soft seat' - as opposed to 'hard' - rail travel is another method of getting around China, although the process is slow. Road travel is another option; but because of congested roads - there are few expressways - and anarchic driving, it can be nerve-wracking. Hotels will assist in choosing a car and driver. No means of Chinese travel these days is especially appealing, and is unlikely to be so for years to come. In China, business is not easy, and neither is getting from A to B.</p>

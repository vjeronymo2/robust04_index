			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHULLER'S PLEA  </P> <P> Regarding the May 24 Morning Report item on the Rev. Robert H. Schuller saying  he will end his "Hour of Power" TV ministry unless viewers send in $3.2 million  to cover debts: I am reminded of the boy who cried wolf.  </P> <P> I have been watching "Hour of Power" since 1974 and was a telephone counselor  for the ministry for five years.  </P> <P> This is at least the 20th time Schuller has conducted a five-week fund-raising  drive in which he has threatened to pull the plug. Maybe after 1,056 telecasts,  it's time that plug was pulled. Either that or let him sell commercial spots to  Chevrolet, etc.  </P> <P> Schuller wrote a book with his son on principles of money management. Why can't  he balance his own budget?  </P> <P> RICK ROFMAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

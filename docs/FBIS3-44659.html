"We are now seriously studying the invitation from the US  side," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press  briefing.    Washington wants to cut China's textile quota by 25 to 35  percent to compensate for what it says are illegal exports  trans-shipped through third countries.    An existing bilateral accord had been due to expire on  December 31, but U.S. officials in Washington agreed to extend  the deadline for imposing the quota cut to allow further talks  in Washington in January. However, China has so far given no  official confirmation that it will attend the talks.    "The officials of the two sides are now maintaining contacts  with each other as regards some specific arrangements of the  proposed visit," Wu said. "The Chinese side is always in favour  of settling the question of Chinese exported textiles to the  United States through negotiations," he added.    China exported 4.5 billion dollars' worth of textiles and  clothing to the United States last year, accounting for some  five percent of total exports. However U.S. officials have  estimated that a further two billion dollars' worth was  trans-shipped illegally.</p>

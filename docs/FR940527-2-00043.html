Comments were requested on the draft EA to be filed within 45 days. Per the applicant's request, the comment period was extended to November 15, 1993. All comments that were filed have been considered in the final EA. Comments on the draft EA did not warrant change to staff conclusions or recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final EA, the Commission staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project and has concluded that regardless of our recommended mitigative measures, construction and operation impacts of the Barberville Project would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the visual character of the area and would have an unavoidable adverse effect on the recreational experience of visitors to the area. Based on these unavoidable adverse effects and the marginal economic status of the proposed project, the staff recommends that the license be denied. Denial of the proposed project would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH: MY ACHING BACK;  </P> <P> COMMON BACK PAIN IS ONE AFFLICTION THAT NEEDN'T NECESSARILY BE TAKEN LYING DOWN  </P> <P> SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES is an untied shoelace. You bend over, and that's it -- a  shooting pain makes straightening up impossible. Are you doomed to lie on the  floor for three or four weeks? Not necessarily.  </P> <P> Just a few years ago, most doctors would tell patients with back pain to lie  absolutely flat on a firm surface for a couple of weeks and get up only for  meals and to use the bathroom. Uncomplicated back pain, caused by inflammation  of the muscles, is the most common kind of back ailment. Fortunately for those  so afflicted (and the people who have to wait on them), the recommended  treatment for this type of back pain has changed considerably.  </P> <P> Recent studies indicate that three or four days of bed rest are just as  effective as two to three weeks. And doctors today are likely to encourage  people recovering from back injuries to stand and take several short walks each  day to maintain muscle strength rather than just lie around. The most important  thing is to avoid sitting, which adds substantial stress to an injured back,  during and immediately following the period of rest.  </P> <P> Back problems are seemingly ubiquitous -- more than 75% of Americans will  injure their backs at least once. Expensive medical care (diagnostic tests,  doctors' fees and surgery) coupled with the cost of time lost from work make  back problems one of the most costly ailments in the nation; each year,  Americans spend about $16 billion on their back troubles.  </P> <P> Fortunately, most back injuries are not considered serious -- meaning that  there is little chance of damage to nerves or other vital structures. People  with back pain usually do not visit doctors; instead they treat their pain with  over-the-counter remedies such as aspirin or other pain relievers and apply  warm compresses to the sore area. According to Dr. Robert Swezy, author of  "Good News for Bad Backs," such treatment is quite reasonable. "Most people  will be out of pain and back in action within a month -- with or without  medical treatment."  </P> <P> There are times, however, when a person should see a doctor without delay.  Uncomplicated back pain usually stays in one location. Pain that radiates into  the legs or buttocks, numbness in the legs and disruption of bladder function  are signals that nerves in the back may be at risk of sustaining permanent  damage. Likewise, fever or chills, symptoms not usually associated with back  injury, may signal a kidney infection that is causing the back pain.  </P> <P> Mild pain that does not improve after several weeks may also indicate that it's  time to turn to a doctor, who can utilize a host of tests and medications.  X-rays and special scans are often used to diagnose different types of  ailments. Muscle relaxants, tranquilizers and painkillers are old standbys, and  recently, doctors have started offering other options.  </P> <P> A new electric device called a TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation)  unit is used with increasing frequency (although its effectiveness is  questionable). This instrument is attached to the back with small pads. Wires  leading to the pads deliver low-level electrical current to the injured area.  Although many doctors and patients say TENS provides relief, a recent study  found that it offered no more benefit than did a placebo. Of course, that  doesn't mean it won't work for some people.  </P> <P> Another alternative is chiropractic. Chiropractors are non-physicians trained  in the physical manipulation and realignment of the spine. In the past, doctors  have been quick to share stories about the ineffectiveness of chiropractors.  But several recent studies have found that when chiropractic was compared to  conventional medical treatment for uncomplicated back pain, the chiropractic  treatment produced better results -- people had a greater relief of pain, a  more rapid return to work and a smaller chance of reoccurrence over the  following two years.  </P> <P> When bed rest and medication or chiropractic treatment fail, the next step for  many suffers has been referral to a surgeon. Annually, 200,000 people in the  United States have back surgery. And although some serious conditions do  require surgery, patients should consider this option with reservation.  </P> <P> Nancy, a 38-year-old high school teacher, thought that surgery would end her  back pain. For nearly five years, she had suffered from periods of pain so  intense that she was forced to stay home from work. After treating her  condition with drugs and rest, she could bear it no more. She visited a  surgeon, who offered her an operation but neglected to tell her about the  possible downside: Researchers have discovered that as many as 30% of those who  undergo back surgery find no relief from the pain, and often it gets worse.  "For many people," says Dr. Robert Debois, a physician and private health  consultant, "back surgery is no panacea."  </P> <P> Several months after Nancy's surgery, her pain returned, and this time little  could be done; once the back has been operated on, scar tissue makes future  surgery in the same area is exceedingly difficult.  </P> <P> Debois stresses that, except for those with serious injury, people should  consider surgery only as a last resort. "You have one shot for effective back  surgery. If you use it for a mild disorder, then using it again, if the  condition worsens, becomes far more difficult."  </P> <P> Nancy was finally sent to a chiropractor. After many weeks of therapy and  numerous hours of exercise, she is playing tennis again, carefully.  </P> <P> So when your home treatment has failed and your back hurts and you feel you  should consult a physician, we suggest you see a general practitioner who is  aware of the recent changes in back-pain treatment. If she or he concludes that  a further workup is necessary, ask to be directed to a specialist who is also  familiar with current research. And if the advice is for surgery, always  consider obtaining a second opinion.  </P> <P> In spite of research advances, back pain continues to plague us. The best we  can do is to try to prevent it: Regularly stretch the back; lift with the legs,  rather than the back, and keep yourself, and your back, in good physical shape.  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES trading was severely upset yesterday by the effective failure of the Seaq electronic reporting network, writes Terry Byland. The inability of marketmakers to update price meant that screen quotations became indicative only, making it impossible to calculate the market indices on which so much futures trading depends. Expiry of the November Footsie Traded Option, due at 10.30, had to be postponed until 2.30, to the anger and dismay of traders who had to try to engineer their closing positions without knowing where the market was standing. 'An absolute mess. Fred Karno's circus,' commented one leading house. The December contract on the FT-SE Index had a similarly disruptive session, closing finally at 3,111, a premium of only about 3 points over cash and at a discount to the estimated Fair Value premium of 6 1/2 points. Volume was good, with nearly 12,000 contracts traded, although arbitrageurs had difficulty in completing trades.</p>

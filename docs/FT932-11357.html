			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Imports surge lifts Australian deficit AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit rose sharply to ADollars 2.13bn (Pounds 960m) on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, more than double the February deficit of ADollars 861m. Imports surged, mainly because of an increase in machinery imports and the payment for a natural gas tanker. The figures have dented market expectations of another drop in interest rates by the middle of this year. Favourable growth and inflation figures during the December quarter had allowed the government to cut interest rates by a half point last month. The government is taking comfort in the import figures, saying a rise in machinery imports in March indicates that business investment is steadily recovering. The tanker purchase will also help raise exports of natural gas, especially to Japan. Nevertheless, analysts now expect an extremely weak recovery.</p>

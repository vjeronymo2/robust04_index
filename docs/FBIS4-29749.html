			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The leadership of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan  -- SDPJ] decided Monday [20 June] night to seek a summit meeting  with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as early as Wednesday to  request his voluntary resignation, SDP officials said.    They said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and senior SDP  officials also decided to draw up a blueprint of a new  government, of which the nation's second-largest political party  would be part.    Earlier in the day, Murayama said his party will seek a  temporary alliance with the largest opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) to call for a snap poll if planned  realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail.    Murayama told a meeting of the party's former Diet members  that the SDP should join hands with the LDP to create a  temporary cabinet if talks with the minority coalition of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata break down and, consequently, Hata is  forced to resign after a no- confidence vote.    The LDP, ousted last year after 38 years in power, has  pledged to submit a no-confidence motion against the shaky Hata  cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected within a  week.    If the SDP supports the LDP move, that will clinch the no-  confidence vote, leaving Hata with a choice of resigning with  his ministers or dissolving the House of Representatives for  snap elections.    Hata has made clear that he will step down if a  no-confidence  vote passes the lower house.</p>

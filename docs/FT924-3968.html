			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Marking time The Bundesbank will doubtless feign indifference to yesterday's rash of gloomy economic data, but the currency markets may force its hand. True, the second consecutive quarter of falling gross domestic product places west Germany in recession on most definitions. Industrial production figures confirm - if any confirmation was needed after recent grim results from the likes of Daimler Benz - that manufacturing industry is suffering. But the service sector continues to grow and fuel the inflationary fire. The Bundesbank may hope to continue flexing its muscles until the budget is brought under control and the wage round is over. Yesterday's pay deal in steel was encouraging, but unions in that industry have a particularly weak case. Organised labour elsewhere could argue into the spring. Whether the French and Danish governments will wait that long for lower rates is another matter. Judging by the renewed strains in the ERM this week, the foreign exchange markets have their doubts. Moving the French franc into a narrow band might impress the currency markets for a while. But it will hardly resolve the basic underlying tensions. The Bundesbank's Mr Helmut Schlesinger has indicated he is tired of throwing public money at the market, and will only cut rates for domestic reasons. So it is hard to see why narrow bands should be credible. The alternative, a devaluation of the core ERM currencies against the D-Mark, would mean a serious loss of competitiveness for precisely those parts of German industry now feeling the most pain. Perhaps even the Bundesbank would be stirred to sympathy then.</p>

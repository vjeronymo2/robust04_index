			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. RTAP Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fiscal year 1995 RTAP allocations to the States totaling $4,612,500 are also displayed on Table 3. The funds are allocated to the States to undertake research, training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet the needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be used in conjunction with the States' administration of the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Elderly and Persons With Disabilities Program (Formerly Section 16) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of $59,152,156 is apportioned to the States for fiscal year 1995 under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program. Table 4 shows each State's apportionment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula for apportioning these funds uses 1990 Census  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population data for persons aged sixty-five and over and for persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses may include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of transportation services under a contract, lease, or other arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit organizations, public bodies that coordinate services for the elderly and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the State that non-profit organizations in the area are not readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These program funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement the Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area Formula capital funds during the last 90 days of the fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of $48,030,000 is appropriated for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program. Of that amount, $9,500,000 is earmarked for a substitute transit project in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The balance of $38,530,000 is appropriated for other transit projects which have been substituted for withdrawn interstate highway segments. The funds are apportioned by formula which reflects the remaining costs to complete each withdrawal area's substitute transit projects. After the one-half percent set-aside ($192,585), $38,337,415 of the $38,530,000 remains for projects. This completes the funding for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program for these withdrawal areas. Table 5 displays the apportionment of these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the funds directly appropriated for Interstate Substitute Transit projects, Substitute Highway funds apportioned to a withdrawal area may be transferred from FHWA to FTA to be used for transit projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Surface Transportation Program ``Flexible'' Funds Used for Transit Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Transfer Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Flexible'' DOT funds, such as Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds, or others, which are designated for use on transit projects, are transferred from the FHWA to FTA for project approval. Flexible funds programmed for transit projects must result from the local and state planning and programming process, and must be contained in an approved State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) before the funds can be transferred. In order to initiate the transfer process, the grantee must submit a completed application to the FTA Regional Office, and must notify the state highway/transportation agency that it has submitted an application which requires a transfer of funds. Once the state highway/transportation agency determines that the state has sufficient obligation authority, it must notify FHWA that the funds are to be used for transit purposes and request that they be obligated by FHWA as a transfer project to FTA. The flexible funds transferred to FTA will be placed in an urbanized area or state account under one of the three existing formula programs_Urbanized Area, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, or Nonurbanized Area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They are then treated as FTA formula funds, although they will retain a special identifying code. The flexible funds may be used for any non-operating purpose eligible under these FTA programs. All FTA requirements are applicable to transferred funds. Flexible funds should be combined with regular FTA formula funds in a single annual grant application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Matching Share for Flexible Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of Title 23, U.S.C. regarding the non-Federal share apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects. Thus, flexible funds transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that such funds would have if used for highway purposes and administered by the FHWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

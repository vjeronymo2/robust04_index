			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGED SPEED TRAP  </P> <P> I read with great disgust your article (March 31) regarding the attorney,  Ernest J. Franceshi Jr., wanting to sue my city because of an alleged speed  trap.  </P> <P> Poor guy! Eighty-five m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone; 75 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h.  zone; and 70 m.p.h. in a 50-m.p.h. zone. Next thing he'll want is that if he is  the cause of an accident going that fast, he'll be suing for not having an  officer there to stop him. It's a shame he doesn't use his legal talents for  something more productive.  </P> <P> GARY ARNESON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

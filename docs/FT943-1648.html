			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Output growth may weaken, CBI forecasts One of the first hints that the recent strong growth in UK manufacturing output might be levelling off emerged yesterday in a Confederation of British Industry survey. The survey, which covers about half of UK manufacturing employment and exports, showed that the proportion of companies which expect output to increase in the next four months fell in September. Thirty four per cent of companies questioned said they expected output to rise, while 11 per cent expected it to decline. The positive balance of 23 per cent was lower than in August's survey, when the positive balance was 30 per cent. The CBI said yesterday that August's balance was the highest figure for six years, and noted that this month's balance was still higher than last September's balance of 17 per cent, and on a par with figures seen earlier this year. But the hints that the recent surge in activity might be levelling off are unlikely to surprise the City, where many economists have been predicting that output growth would ease slightly towards the end of this year. The CBI said yesterday that more than 90 per cent of the survey was conducted before the latest interest rate rise. Some industry groups have warned that a rise in interest rates may damp economic growth further. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday sought to rebut these charges by insisting that a rate rise at this stage of the recovery seemed just as likely to encourage business confidence in the sustainability of the expansion and to encourage business investment as to damp them. He told a CBI dinner in Gateshead: 'It was too much to hope that the business community would actually welcome the move. By acting sooner rather than later we can keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace and avoid the need to bring it eventually to a grinding halt.' Meanwhile, in a trend that will provide some boost to the government's fight against inflation, the CBI survey showed that there was no increase in the proportion of companies expecting to increase prices. The proportion of companies which expect to increase prices in the next four months, compared with those which expect to reduce them, was a positive balance of 15 per cent, the same as in August, with two-thirds of companies expecting no price change. The survey showed that the proportion of companies reporting total order books and export order books above normal was unchanged on the month, suggesting that demand is stabilising. Meanwhile 17 per cent of companies said that stocks were more than adequate, compared with 6 per cent which said that they were less than adequate.</p>

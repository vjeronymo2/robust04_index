			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- The cabinet-level  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday [26 April] that it  would not send a group to mainland China to discuss the March 31  Qiandao Lake murders until the mainland supplies more  information about the crime.    The MAC statement represented an about-face from its earlier  call for a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation to visit  Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province later this week to learn more about  the mainland's investigation into the March 31 murders, in which  24 Taiwan tourists and 8 mainlanders were robbed and killed  while on a pleasure cruise.    SEF is Taiwan's non-official conduit for mainland-Taiwan  relations.    MAC asked the mainland to submit autopsy reports and details  of the crime scenes to SEF before the delegation, comprised of  SEF officials, retired police detectives and relatives of the  victims, leaves for Hangzhou.    However, mainland authorities have not responded to the  request. SEF wrote Monday to its mainland counterpart, the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to  request the information before it decides when to send the  delegation.    MAC official said that the request was made on behalf of the  relatives of the victims, who said their trip would be futile  without the proper information and would only endorse Beijing's  handling of the case.    The official said that the delegation's departure would  depend on ARATS' supplying such information.    MAC Deputy Director-General Su Chi said Tuesday that when  the  delegation leaves for the mainland, it would not only seek to  learn the truth behind the crime, it would also try to establish  a formula for handling future threats to the life and property  of Taiwan residents on the mainland.</p>

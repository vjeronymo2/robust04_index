			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Resentment grows over Spanish parkland Visitors to southern Spain tend to envy the people living on the edges of one of Europe's largest and best-known wetlands, home to flamingoes, eagles and lynxes. But in the eyes of the local inhabitants, the 77,260-hectare Coto Donana National Park is a job-stealer and a waste of natural resources. Rice and strawberry farmers are under pressure from conservation groups to reduce their irrigation and use of pesticides. Traditional occupations have been lost. And even ecotourism is almost impossible, as most non-scientists are barred from entering the park. However, a recent report by the European Commission, called A Strategy for the Sustainable Socio-economic Development of Coto Donana and its Surroundings, recommends that Pta50bn (Pounds 270m) of EC and Spanish government money be invested in the area over the next eight years, to help create jobs. Eduardo Crespo, deputy director of the state-run national park, says that the money would not go directly to the Coto Donana. 'This park has a sufficient budget, probably the highest budget of national parks in Europe (at Pta 1bn-1.5bn a year excluding salaries and overheads). The money is needed in the surroundings - in the seven or eight towns around Donana - to create different sorts of enterprises.' The investment, says Crespo, would be in infrastructure, such as roads and sewage works, to make the area more attractive to private investors, and in training and education programmes for the local population. In this way, he hopes that the villagers can be won over to the park. The task is a hard one: local anger flared into violence two years ago when conservationists protested at plans to build a Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) tourist development, called the Costa Donana, which would have provided construction and hotel jobs. Javier Hidalgo, who owns a sherry bodega in Sanlucar de Barrameda to the east of the park, says: 'For many years Donana was a private estate for the aristocracy to hunt in, with benefits for the local people of keeping cattle, fishing, egg-collecting, beekeeping, collecting sticks to support the vines, gamekeeping - the local people had jobs. Now the native population in Donana has disappeared.' Farmers, attempting to diversify out of olives or grapes into more profitable crops such as strawberries, rice or flowers, have been strongly criticised for using too much water and too many pesticides, endangering the wildlife. Six years ago more than 20,000 birds died in an outbreak of botulism related to pesticides. The report recommends retaining the rice farming, but says that the use of pesticides should be controlled by the regional government. It suggests that the Costa Donana development should not be built, but that more environment-friendly schemes could provide work. Andrea Gardiazabal of SEO, Spain's ornithological society, believes that the opposition to the park is fading. A recent symposium of local villagers to discuss the report showed less hostility to the recommendation that the Costa Donana resort should not be built. As Crespo says: 'It's a question of how long-range your thinking is: if you're only thinking of construction jobs for the next five years, you're against the report. If you're thinking of national use of resources over a period of 50 years, then you'll follow the report.'</p>

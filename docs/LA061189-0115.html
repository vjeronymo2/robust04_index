			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STEVE HOWE STILL THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER COMEBACK  </P> <P> Steve Howe, who hasn't thrown a pitch in the major leagues since a drinking  incident ended his comeback attempt with the Texas Rangers, will be spending  the coming weeks selling a new book.  </P> <P> Howe wrote "Between the Lines" with Jim Greenfield, a Philadelphia attorney and  former newsman, about his career, his cocaine addiction and recovery and the  strains it put on his marriage, which has survived.  </P> <P> Howe, 31, doesn't rule out another comeback attempt and said several teams have  shown interest in him, but would not name them.  </P> <P> "I'd love to be able to walk away from the game because I can't get anybody out  anymore," he said. But the left-handed reliever who was the National League  Rookie of the Year in 1980 and thrown out of baseball for cocaine and alcohol  abuse, won't accept any offers until next season.  </P> <P> "I made the commitment to stay out of baseball for one full year," Howe said.  "You have to understand that these commitments to myself are probably the most  important things that I can keep for my recovery."  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Howe was a reflective, humble man, far from the  self-centered young upstart who thought he could control cocaine.  </P> <P> Howe, while pitching for the Dodgers, checked into a drug rehabilitation clinic  in 1983 and was suspended from playing the 1984 season by then-commissioner  Bowie Kuhn.  </P> <P> Since then, he's played for the Minnesota Twins, the Texas Rangers, in the  minor leagues and, last summer, for a semipro club in Mexico. His last  major-league stint ended when the Rangers terminated his two-year $1.2 million  contract in January, 1988, for an incident involving alcohol during a three-day  minicamp.  </P> <P> At the start of his second season, in 1981, he said he was determined to prove  he did not have a sophomore jinx. He kept his cocaine consumption to two or  three grams a week, spending $3,000 in the four months between spring training  and the players' strike.  </P> <P> "My case is a victory. By the grace of God we overcame this and I'm still  alive. I still have my family. I still have so many things; I still have my  health. I have a chance Lenny Bias will never get," he said of the University  of Maryland basketball star whose death was linked to cocaine use.  </P> <P> Howe said his healing began in earnest when he embraced God last Christmas.  "The best treatment centers, the best help, the best psychologist in the world  didn't fix me," he said. "There's a side of my spiritual self that had to  totally believe in God to take it over."  </P></p>

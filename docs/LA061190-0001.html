			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Proposal Passes, 2-0: Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) got hitched last week in a  very, very private wedding. Conyers married Monica Ann Esters, 25, who was born  in 1964 -- the same year the youthful-looking, 61-year-old Conyers won his  first congressional election.  </P> <P> "Why would he have gotten married? What are people saying? What's the  scuttlebutt?" Julian Epstein, Conyers' chief of staff in Washington, asked when  queried about the wedding.  </P> <P> * Confrontation: Prison author Jack Henry Abbott confronted the widow of his  stabbing victim in court in New York Friday and demanded: "Does anything matter  to you except that Richard Adan died at my hands?" A teary-eyed Ricci Adan, 31,  said: "There has to be some restitution. Some kind of payback" for the loss of  her husband nine years ago. Abbott, author of "In the Belly of the Beast," won  early release in 1981 with the help of author Norman Mailer.  </P> <P> * What if It Was Refused?: An 1847 letter from Charlotte Bronte to the  publisher of her novel "Jane Eyre" sold Thursday at Christie's auction house  for $52,800. The letter tells how she was unable to pay for the mailing of the  manuscript. "If when you acknowledge the receipt of the (manuscript) you will  have the goodness to mention the amount charged on delivery, I will immediately  transmit it in postage stamps," she wrote.  </P> <P> * Another First: Houston Police Chief Elizabeth Watson, the nation's first  woman chief of a major city, once again made history when she announced she is  pregnant. Watson, 40, said last week she and her husband, Sgt. Robert Watson,  are expecting their third child. Watson was named chief in January. She will  appoint a temporary chief and commented: "I will be only a phone call away."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 11 April carries in its  regular 42-minute newscast the following reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation  in the area and says that "Buzim, Caute, and other villages in  the area have again been shelled in the course of the day.  According to as yet unconfirmed information, several civilians  were injured and some killed. The defense lines on Grabez, the  Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau, and on the Buzim front have been  under fire all day. In addition to relentless antiaircraft and  heavy machine gun fire, the forward defense lines were shelled  several times. The activity is becoming increasingly intense on  the defense lines on the Buzim front, and the enemy continues to  regroup and reinforce his positions on Ivanjski Put. Movements  of the [Serbian] aggressor were sighted today in the area of the  so-called Serbian autonomous province of Krajina, while reliable  sources speak of preparations for a new, joint offensive by the  Kladusa traitors [of Fikret Abdic] and the chetniks on the Bihac  commune, which should begin around 15 April. The main points of  attack would be Bugar and Trzacka Rastela, and the (?main  objective a consolidation) of forces on the Buzim part of the  front."    Mirudin Aldobasic, reporting on the situation in the 7th  South Operative Group's theater of operations, says that  "targeted by their [the Serbs'] weaponry were the residential  areas of the Doboj region -- Matuzici, Mravici, and [name  indistinct]. In the early afternoon, the aggressor on several  occasions directed fierce artillery fire at the defense lines of  the 110th Glorious Croatian Defense Council [HVO] Usora Brigade  and the 215th Glorious Motorized Doboj-Bosna Brigade. All  attacks were successfully repelled."    Correspondent Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "after  several fierce but unsuccessful attempts at tank and infantry  breakthroughs carried out on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line and  in the Vitanovici region, the enemy infiltrated several  reconnaissance-subversion groups. However, these well-equipped  Chetnik units fared no better in their attacks on our positions.  All their attempts were thwarted. It is estimated that 10  Chetniks were killed in the battles. The free Brcko territory  has been under fire all day with three people injured. The  shelling of civilian targets has escalated in the early evening,  and the Serbian aggressor is concentrating his manpower and  hardware in front of the defense lines of the 108th Motorized  Brigade, the 108th Infantry Brigade, and units of the 2d Corps.  The enemy is evidently preparing an extensive and lengthy  offensive."    Olovo correspondent Amira Salihodzic reports that "the  shelling that began in the early morning continued into the  afternoon. Howitzers, guns, tanks, and mortars were active from  almost all the Chetnik strongholds. Our defense lines in the  area of (?Batici) suffered a fierce artillery and infantry  attack."

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / European markets up as rate fears ease Stock markets in Europe advanced yesterday after significantly improved employment statistics from the US eased fears of upward pressures on global interest rates. In London, renewed buying of UK stocks from across the Atlantic drove the FT-SE 100 index ahead by 43 points to 3,446, and the FT-SE Mid 250, covering a broader range of shares, rose 63.5 to an all-time high of 3,912.5. As in the hectic trading during the run-up to Christmas, it was US buying of London stock index futures which ignited the share market. However, prices were often forced higher yesterday because the unwillingness of investors to sell shares has left marketmakers very short of stock. British government bonds were also sharply higher, gaining more than 3/4 of a point as interest rate fears subsided. However, south-east Asian markets tumbled for a second day as Kleinwort Benson, the British securities house, added its voice to those downgrading their view of Pacific Rim markets. Earlier in the week, Japan's Nomura cut its weightings on Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Manila, preferring Tokyo instead. Morgan Stanley took the view that equity markets had reached unsustainably optimistic levels and recommended a shift from shares to cash. Bangkok saw yesterday's biggest fall, plunging 5.5 per cent, while Kuala Lumpur fell 4.6 per cent. Manila fell 4.1 per cent and Taiwan 3.9 per cent. Hong Kong declined another 3.3 per cent in record turnover. London shares, Page 15; World stocks, Page 21; Lex, Page 26; Markets, Weekend, Page II</p>

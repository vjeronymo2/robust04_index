			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Defeat may sound Tory death knell It was a serious defeat. Bad now, and potentially more damaging in the future. No amount of shoulder shrugging or bluff confidence from the chancellor and his colleagues can disguise it. Losing a Budget measure is not the end of the world. Many Conservative voters will cheer the fact that valued added tax on domestic fuel will not rise from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. But there were plenty of Conservatives at Westminster last night wondering whether this is the beginning of the end. Ask a senior minister these days why anyone should believe this government is capable of winning a fifth term in office and invariably the answer is that it has time on its side. That means time before an election due by mid-1997 for economic recovery to erase memories of recession and of broken promises. And time for Mr Kenneth Clarke to stuff money into the voters' pockets with cuts in the basic rate of income tax. The strategy is imperilled. Last week's rebellion over Europe, the constant hum of speculation about Mr Major's leadership and the defeat over VAT on fuel should be taken together. The cumulative effect is to raise a serious question-mark over whether the Tory party will sustain this administration for a full parliamentary term. If the government cannot choose the election date it has lost a precious political asset. First, however, there is the short term. Mr Clarke responded instantly to the vote by stressing he would protect the Budget arithmetic. Other taxes had to rise, spending had to be cut or there had to be a combination of both to plug the Pounds 1bn hole left by the government's defeat. The chancellor will publish precise proposals within days. He could do nothing else. The financial markets, notably tolerant so far of these recurring shambles, may decide it is time to punish the government. A motley crew of Tory rebels has tilted the balance of argument in favour of any early rise in interest rates. Doubtless Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, will make the point in his monthly review of the outlook with Mr Clarke. By coincidence that meeting is today. Beyond that, the consequences for the prime minister are as awful as they are obvious. It was Mr Clarke who insisted on pushing ahead with the two-stage increase in VAT on domestic fuel first unveiled by his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont in March last year. Only a few days ago the chancellor was assuring colleagues that the rebellion could be faced down. Like a striker on a football pitch his Budget strategy was to create space - to put himself in a goal-scoring position before the general election. The second stage of VAT on fuel provided some of that space. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, had doubts. So too, by some accounts, did Mr Major. But most cabinet ministers believed to retreat without a fight after taking so much political flak would have been bad politics as well as questionable economics. It is Mr Major who will be caught in the political backlash. When a prime minister is as beleaguered as he is, then the full force of political defeats is felt inevitably by 10 Downing Street. Wisely, Mr Major keeps away from journalists these days. Most have tormented him ever since sterling's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism two years ago. So it is impossible to judge his mood at first hand. But close friends insist a hangdog demeanour in the Commons in recent weeks is not a signal that he is about to quit. Rather he is more determined than ever to prove the critics wrong. The next 12 months will tell whether determination is enough. The Conservatives' reputation in the 1980s as a tax-cutting party rested on a conjuring trick. Over a run of years the tax burden remained constant at best - even before the hefty post-1992 increases. But successive rises in the rate and the scope of VAT provided the room for election-winning income tax cuts. This administration has come to the end of that particular stretch of road. By rejecting higher VAT on fuel the Conservative party may have put a roadblock up against any further extension of the indirect tax base. If that is the case then the income tax trick will have lost its magic. Tuppence off the basic rate may be possible without a parallel widening of the VAT net. But a 20p basic rate looks well beyond reach either side of the next general election. There is something else. Last night provided another reminder of how strong the habit of rebellion has become on the Tory back benches. Running beneath the sporadic revolts on individual issues has been a dangerous growth of factionalism - almost a mirror image of the divisions which tore apart the Labour party in the early 1980s. For the Conservatives the future of the European Union has been the catalyst for the corrosion. Unless another truce is called over Europe and Tory sceptics are brought back into the fold somehow then Mr Major will be threatened at every turn. Even with them, the government can no longer be sure that it will get through its legislation in the present atmosphere. The long game on which ministers rest their hopes for political revival may no longer be possible. There are some senior Conservatives at Westminster who argue strongly that we have all become too excited about such arithmetic. The Thatcher administrations with their impregnable majorities were an aberration. Look instead, they say, at how Mr Harold Wilson in the late 1960s and Mr Edward Heath and Mr James Callaghan in the 1970s had to tack and trim to stay in power. That is true. But each of those prime ministers lost the succeeding general election.</p>

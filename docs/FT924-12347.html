			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Chrysler plans sales drive ALL future Chrysler vehicles will be engineered for right-hand-drive as well as left-hand-drive markets, the company said yesterday as it outlined plans for a big UK sales campaign next year. Its new UK importer, a subsidiary of the Inchcape-owned TKM vehicle distribution group, expects to sell 2,000 Chrysler Jeep and other models in the UK next year. It plans to raise that to at least 17,000 a year by the end of the decade, Mr Richard Mackay, managing director of Chrysler Jeep Imports UK, of Dover, said at the motor show. The first models are to go on sale in January through a network of 80 dealers. One will be a variant of the Cherokee four-wheel-drive leisure vehicle, built in Toledo, Ohio. That, Chrysler said yesterday, is the first right-hand-drive production vehicle to be built in North America by a US-owned volume carmaker for export to the UK. The other will be a right-hand-drive model of the smaller Wrangler, the latest version of the classic Jeep. Right-hand-drive models versions of those were first developed through Chrysler's joint venture in China. Mr Bernard Robertson, vice-president of jeep/truck engineering and operations, said right-hand-drive models would give the company potential access to 55 countries that drive on the left, accounting for 23 per cent of world vehicle sales. Chrysler's re-entry to the UK market, reversing its withdrawal in the 1970s, is part of a much wider drive to establish a sales and production presence in Europe. It sold 44,183 vehicles throughout Europe last year through a sales and service network that now totals 1,500 outlets.</p>

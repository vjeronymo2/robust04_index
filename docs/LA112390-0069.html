			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-EMPLOYER, ARMY NURSE SETTLE LAWSUIT  </P> <P> A settlement has been reached in the lawsuit filed by Army National Guard nurse  who claimed she was fired from her civilian job after being called to active  duty in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Steven D. Stern, a spokesman for the public relations firm of Sitrick and  Company Inc., announced in a terse statement that "an amicable agreement" had  been reached between Capt. Debra M. Simpson and her former employer, Care  Visions Corp. He declined further comment Thursday and details of the settlment  were not released.  </P> <P> Neither Simpson, of Santa Ana, nor her attorneys could be reached for comment  Thursday. Care Visions Corp. would not comment beyond the announcement.  </P> <P> Simpson's lawyers filed a civil suit on Nov. 15 in Orange County Superior Court  charging that Simpson had been fired illegally by Care Visions, which operates  a Santa Ana care center for chronically ill or disabled children called the  Kangaroo Kids Center for Fragile Children. Simpson was the health care  administrator at the facility when she was called to active duty in the Army  National Guard last August.  </P> <P> Simpson said she informed her superiors that she would be back from active duty  on Oct. 3. She said she went to work that day but was fired a few hours after  she arrived. Simpson said she was told by Julia Bell, Care Visions Corp.'s  chief executive officer, that she had "abandoned" her job and therefore was  being discharged.  </P> <P> Bell has declined to comment on the case, but a spokesman for Care Visions  Corp. last week charged that Simpson was two days late in reporting back to  work.  </P> <P> Simpson disputed that allegation, saying she gave Care Visions written notice  that she would return Oct. 3. Care Visions also accused Simpson of volunteering  for the call to active duty; Simpson maintained that it was a mandatory  call-up.  </P> <P> Maj. Bruce Roy, a spokesman for the California National Guard in Sacramento,  said last week that federal law prohibits companies from firing or demoting  persons called to duty, whether or not they volunteered.  </P> <P> One of Simpson's lawyer, Thomas L. Brown, had said he believed the Simpson case  was the first of its kind in the nation since President Bush's massive call-up  of reserves last August.  </P> <P> The lawsuit had sought an unspecified amount of money in actual and punitive  damages. She said she had been unable to find a job similar to the one from  which she had been fired.  </P></p>

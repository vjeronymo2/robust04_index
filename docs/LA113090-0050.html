			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The team of detectives investigating the Clairemont-University City serial  killings has sorted through roughly three-fourths of the leads in the case, San  Diego police said Thursday.  </P> <P> New leads continue to come in, adding to the 2,600 total leads, but at a slower  pace, Capt. Dick Toneck said during the group's weekly press briefing.  </P> <P> The department announced earlier this month that the 27 detectives  investigating the stabbing deaths of five women would return to normal duties  as they worked though the leads. One detective has since been reassigned.  </P> <P> The team was beefed up to 27 detectives in September in response to the huge  number of tips, Toneck said. As leads are reduced, the force will be gradually  cut, but the original five-person team will remain on the case, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Big Rock Mesa Landslides: Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. was sued by five  insurance companies seeking to recover the costs of defending lawsuits filed by  Malibu homeowners over the Big Rock Mesa landslides. The Los Angeles Superior  Court suit says Fireman's Fund and the plaintiff-insurers provided insurance to  some of the homeowners.  </P> <P> When the owners were cross-sued by several government entities, the suit says,  Fireman's Fund named a single law firm to defend them but refused to pay for  individual lawyers for each homeowner. To avoid potential conflicts, the five  plaintiffs paid for separate attorneys to defend the homeowners and now want  Fireman's Fund to reimburse them for the proportionate share of the costs. The  Big Rock Mesa litigation was settled for more than $100 million last year.  (Filed July 9, 1990. Case No. BC005297)  </P></p>

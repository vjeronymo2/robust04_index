			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whole Truth of Talks Has Come Out"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  announced the truth of the main issues discussed at the  Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral  arrangements. This was a necessary response made at the request  of members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's  [SAR] Preparatory Committee and people in different circles and  was also aimed at the British side's unilateral publication of  the White Paper last week, which distorts the contents of the  talks. The publication of the truth about the talks is good  for clarifying views and enables the facts to refute the British  side's slanders and attacks.    After reading the full text published by the Chinese side,  Hong Kong people will, naturally, understand that during the 17  rounds of talks in eight months last year, there was a strong  contrast between the two sides' stands and attitudes: The  Chinese side was sincere during consultations, took the overall  interests into account, repeatedly expressed its views with good  intentions, made flexible concessions, and showed extreme  forbearance. Whereas the British side acted obstinately and  shamelessly; was rude, unreasonable, and overbearing; raised  side issues; and deliberately undermined the talks. We can say  that the concessions the Chinese side made at the negotiating  table exceeded the expectations of many Hong Kong people; apart  from this, the Chinese side was ready to enter into further  consultations and seek further mutual understanding and mutual  accommodation but the British side finally took action which  caused a breakdown in the talks. Despite all this, the Chinese  side still maintained the tolerance of a large and proud  country, kept its former commitments, and did not publish the  British side's inglorious record at the talks. However, the  British side was the first to violate the understanding if  secrecy between the two sides, so that the Chinese side had no  alternative but to publish the main points which had been  distorted by the British side.    Reviewing the talks, their whole process seems to appear  before us. Of course, this makes it easier to see more clearly  that the British side was bent on confrontation and had no  sincerity on reaching an agreement with the Chinese side through  negotiations. Originally, both sides had agreed to proceed with  the talks on the basis of the "three conformities," namely  conformity with the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the Basic  Law, and Sino-British understandings. From the very beginning  of the talks, the British side resorted to the tactic of  confirming the "three conformities" principle in abstract and  negating it in reality. As a result, the talks were delayed and  could not proceed on a correct track. The White Paper published  by the British side last week mentions that the British side  evaded the principles confirmed by the Chinese side according to  the "three conformities." "Annex One" to the Chinese side's  full text published yesterday fully lists the contents of the  eight-point principles confirmed. Chinese and foreign  personalities can see that these principles are the original  meaning of the "three conformities." Why did the British side  say that it was difficult to confirm? It did this because it  wanted to persist in Chris Patten's "three violations" program,  having no sincerity at all in the talks!    The British side's White Paper uses the elections of  functional constituencies to attack the Chinese side, saying  that the elections of functional constituencies "can be  manipulated by others" and "may lead to corruption and  irregularities." As a matter of fact, the elections of  functional constituencies were invented by the British side and  they recommended them to the Chinese side. Long ago, both sides  had already reached an agreement and understanding on the nature  and electoral methods of functional constituencies. The problem  was that the British side wanted to break the agreement and  change the elections to disguised direct elections, therefore it  tried to play down the importance of functional constituencies'  elections at all costs. Unquestionably, functional  constituencies' elections have their limitations but, as a  transitional means under the principle of gradual and orderly  progress, they will play a positive role. What was published by  the Chinese side yesterday provides strict logical reasoning in  refuting the British side's slanders on functional  constituencies' elections and the participants. What was  published by the Chinese side points out: The British side's  accusation is utterly groundless and does not respect voters or  the incumbent legislative councilors elected by functional  constituencies.    The main topic of the 17th round of Sino-British talks was  on  Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements. However, from  the very beginning of the talks, the British side insisted on  talking about three issues purely within the category of Chinese  sovereignty, including the personnel arrangements for the Hong  Kong SAR's Preparatory Committee. What was published yesterday  clarifies the Chinese side's stand on these questions. Hong  Kong people also know that from the beginning of the talks, the  British side talked glibly about setting what it calls the  objective criteria for boarding the "through train." Logically  speaking, there must be convergence of rails before a through  train can pass. As Hong Kong people put it vividly: There must  be a "through train" before passengers can board it."  Furthermore, many Hong Kong people pointed out long ago that  the definition of qualifications for "boarding the through  train" completely falls within the category of Chinese  sovereignty and so does not require any consultations with the  British side at all. But the British side wanted to talk about  the so-called "criteria" for "boarding the through train." What  was published yesterday reveals that the Chinese side even made  major concessions on this and provided four-point explanations  but the British side did not accept and insisted that a pledging  method should be introduced to replace the appointment of  members for the SAR's Preparatory Committee. As a matter of  fact, it wants to completely deprive the Preparatory Committee  of its appointment right--a right which gives expression to  Chinese sovereignty.    The publication of the truth about the talks suggests to  Hong  Kong citizens and the entire Chinese people that these  colonialists who are moving toward their doomsday are  ferociously and constantly making harsh demands. If this can be  tolerated, what cannot?</p>

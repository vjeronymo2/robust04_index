			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PACOIMA DRIVE-BY SHOOTING HURTS 3  </P> <P> Three men who had just finished playing soccer on a school field in a Pacoima  area frequented by gang members were wounded in a drive-by shooting, Los  Angeles police said this morning.  </P> <P> Although the three Pacoima men are not gang members, their assailants  apparently believed that they were, Detective Jay St. John said. At about 9  p.m. Thursday, two or three men in a red car drove by the victims at the corner  of Pierce Street and Glenoaks Boulevard, shouted a gang challenge and then  opened fire, St. John said.  </P> <P> Injured were Guillermo Martinez, 21, who was struck in the chest; Carlos Lopez,  27, who was wounded in the face, and Benigno Gonzalez, 25, who was struck in  the legs. Martinez and Lopez were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission  Hills, where Martinez was in serious condition and Lopez was treated and  released. Gonzalez was taken to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley,  where he was treated and released.  </P> <P> No arrests were made. St. John said the victims had been playing soccer at  Maclay Junior High School, located at the same corner, until dark. They then  walked across the street to a service station to use a pay phone when the  shooting occurred.  </P> <P> St. John said the corner area is a place where gang members often meet or pass  through while traveling between housing projects in the area.  </P></p>

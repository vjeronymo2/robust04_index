			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / London Motor Conference: Ford to chase after-sales business FORD is encouraging its dealers to set up mobile units to service customers' cars at homes or offices as part of a strategy to regain more than Pounds 600m of after-sales and service business. The company calculates that this amount of business on Ford vehicles goes to rivals outside its dealer network. In some after-sales sectors, such as replacement tyres and exhausts, Ford outlets have 3 per cent or less of the business available, Mr Philip Cazaly, director of parts and service operations, told the conference. Ford, the UK car market leader, is setting up a national network of 'fast-fit' outlets to challenge independents such as Mr Tom Farmer's Kwik-Fit organisation. Mr Cazaly said its dealers would have 200 such outlets, trading under the name of Rapid Fit, in the UK by the end of this year.</p>

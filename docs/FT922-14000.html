			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Caribbean growth rate falters: The region has been hit by world recession CARIBBEAN economies recorded lower than expected growth last year mainly because of recession in North America and Europe, and will fare no better until the industrialised economies recover, according to the Caribbean Development Bank. Reporting on the economic performance of its 17 borrowing members, the Barbados-based bank said the Caribbean had been also affected by the Gulf war and by reluctance of some governments to implement economic adjustment policies. 'Most countries reported significant slowdown in the rate of economic growth while those reporting increases remained concerned about the need to attain sustainable levels of output growth,' said the CDB. In attempting to deal with the problems, several countries improved the management of their fiscal accounts, while using monetary and exchange rate policies to improve the competitiveness of their exports, the report added. Guyana and Jamaica completely liberalised their foreign exchange markets and there was a start or expansion of programmes to sell off state-owned enterprises in Barbados, Grenada, Guyana and Jamaica. However, the bank said this had not prevented increasing fiscal deficits which led some countries to rely more and more on domestic sources for financing the shortfalls, putting pressure on domestic interest rates. The recession in industrialised countries affected all major sectors of the region's economies. Tourism suffered, said the CDB, because of 'the continued slowdown in economic activity in the US, together with the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf which exacerbated fears about the safety of air travel.' Export trade outside the Caribbean Community (Caricom) was depressed by the recession in the major markets, and this was compounded by other developments such as the reduction of the region's sugar quota to the US. The bank said this was of major concern, and reported that a 35 per cent quota cut by the US last year would reduce the Caribbean's export earnings significantly as it will be forced to sell more sugar at world market prices which are lower than the preferential price paid by the US. Reduced production also troubled the regional sugar industry last year, said the CDB, with cumulative output falling by 3 per cent. The region's bauxite producers, Jamaica and Guyana, suffered from weak world prices and a loss of markets following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Despite an increase in production and exports by Jamaica last year the island's gross earnings declined, the CDB said, The region's banana output declined by almost 12 per cent last year, and there is growing uncertainty over the Caribbean's preferential market in Europe with the creation of a single market next year. The manufacturing and construction sectors also declined, the report said. The bank's forecast will bring little comfort to Caribbean governments. It said prospects for improvement in economic performance in 1992 were not encouraging. These prospects depended on the emergence of the long-awaited recovery in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Outhwaite action is stepped up NAMES ON Lloyd's troubled Outhwaite syndicate who missed out from February's Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement yesterday agreed to step up their own legal action to recover losses. Writs alleging negligence by the Outhwaite Underwriting Agency and 81 other members' agencies, were issued last week on behalf of 393 Names - the individuals who provide backing for the insurance market. Mr Eddie Kulukundis, yesterday elected chairman of the 1992 Outhwaite Names' Association, said the group would now aim to enlist as many as possible of the 627 non-litigants to the February action before serving the writs.</p>

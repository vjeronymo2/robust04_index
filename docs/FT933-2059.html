			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Iron triangle softens image: The Keidanren, or main business grouping, is adapting to changes in Japan Japan's six-week coalition government is proving fragile and fractious under the leadership of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. But one constant source of influence at the centre of power, even though the long-ruling Liberal Democratic party was ousted this summer, is the business leader who met Mr John Major on his visit to Tokyo yesterday. At the Akasaka Palace, the government's guest house, the British premier and a delegation of UK industrialists held talks with Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the 78-year-old chairman of the Keidanren, the country's main business grouping. They put the case for the further opening of Japanese markets, from whisky to fund management. Mr Hiraiwa was noncommittal. But one particular form of fund management, in which the Keidanren has for decades been involved, is unlikely to have been raised by Mr Major. Mr Hiraiwa last month said the organisation would no longer act as a conduit for business donations to Japanese political parties. The Keidanren, the Japan federation of economic organisations, helped found the Liberal Democratic party in 1955 and provided it with some Y13bn a year in funds from its 900-plus members. But less than a week into the life of the new seven-party administration, Mr Hiraiwa let it be known that this practice would cease. Ten days later Mr Hosokawa appointed him to head an advisory panel seeking ways to streamline Japan's administrative system. Not only were links with the new government cemented, but the appointment of Mr Hiraiwa to the panel allows the Keidanren to promote deregulation of the economy, which it has long sought and which Mr Hosokawa has made a main government priority along with political reform. The cut-off in funds illustrates the ability of the Keidanren, written off on several occasions as a relic which speaks for shipbuilders and steelmakers, to defy its slow-moving image and adapt to changed realities. Before it lost the election in July, the relationship between the LDP and Keidanren was a strong element in the bond uniting the interests of government, industry and the bureaucracy which delivered Japan much of its post-war economic success. This so-called 'iron triangle' became, however, so tarnished by corruption scandals that it was the main reason the LDP was ousted. The federation's money represented a tenth of the LDP's total income and influenced companies to give even more. Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, Keidanren managing director, maintains that this money was the most acceptable, because it went openly to LDP central funds rather than through a back door to individual Diet (parliament) members or factions. 'The basic character of the government has not changed,' says Mr Nukazawa. 'It equals the LDP minus corruption.' He adds that LDP politicians 'will have to live a frugal life. They will have to bring sandwiches to a lunch meeting. That is good for their health.' In spite of such stern prescriptions, the ever-careful business organisation has left itself a get-out clause in case the LDP regains power. Individual member companies can maintain any direct funding they wish, the Keidanren says, and a small number have indicated that they will do so. It may in the future give guidance on the party or parties on which its members might wish to bestow any largesse. 'Guidance' - a signal of what is acceptable, or indeed expected - from the Keidanren is taken no less seriously by industry than a similar nudge from a ministry. Japanese companies generally respect conformity and 'mutual emulation is very strong', says Prof Haruo Shimada of the school of economics at Keio University, Tokyo. This emulation applies, for a start, among the country's various business groupings themselves. Before acting on political funds, Mr Hiraiwa heard noises of discontent with the existing order. The complaints came from the more junior Nikkeiren employers' federation, which usually concerns itself with labour relations, and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents 1.5m mainly small companies. But they waited for a lead from the Keidanren before their members could stop payments. As Prof Shimada puts it, before Mr Hiraiwa spoke out on the issue, he 'pretended he was at the tail of this procession, then he decided he could say what should happen'. While doing this, Mr Hiraiwa was falling into step with the new government in other ways. Mr Hosokawa, in trying to stimulate depressed domestic demand, is making it clear that consumers rather than the LDP's long-cultivated producers should be the main beneficiaries from the favourable effect of the stronger yen on import prices. Through all the years in which the Keidanren proclaimed the LDP the party of free enterprise, its members benefited from the party's bias towards the producer. Only the farmers' lobby, in blocking rice imports while selling the populace its staple food for five times world prices, has carried clout comparable with the Keidanren. First to respond to Mr Hosokawa's message of putting the consumer first were the electric utilities, offering modest but trend-setting rebates on customer bills in acknowledgement of the benefits of cheaper imported energy. Although he played no overt role, Mr Hiraiwa is likely to have been active behind the scenes as the chairman of Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's and the world's largest private sector supplier of electricity. The Keidanren excels not so much at radical innovation as at hauling itself on to bandwagons and giving them momentum. The federation has long lobbied for privatisation and claims credit for the state asset sales of the LDP's last decade - these continue this month with the sell-off of the first part of the Japan Railways network. Mr Andrew Lawson, head of the east and south Asia department at the Confederation of British Industry, says that, while the Keidanren is good at putting together alliances to meet a sudden turn in events, such as a large bankruptcy, it often merely 'espouses fashionable virtues', such as the environment. The two main areas where resources within the organisation's 200-strong staff are being increased are environmental affairs, where it is seeking, for example, to help China control industrial effluents, and the harmonisation of competition policy with the west. Each can be viewed as ironic for a body which, with some success, spent much of the 1970s resisting legislation on pollution controls in Japan, and in the early 1980s acted to curb anti-monopoly requirements. As the Keidanren adjusts its image to fit Japan's more consumer-conscious government, LDP leaders are left checking the price of their sandwiches.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sweden faced with mixed economic signals - The aftermath of the flotation of the krona A FEW weeks ago, Sweden's decision to float the krona seemed to thrust a ray of light into the gloom enveloping the country's corporate sector. Since then, the mood has been tempered by the realisation that 1993 is still going to be an awful year for the Swedish economy, and that even in 1994 recovery may be a very slow business. The signals are nothing if not mixed. And the contrasting announcements recently from two of Sweden's leading industrial groups are a vivid illustration of this. The message from SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, was that worsening conditions in key European markets would reduce demand for its products in 1993, forcing a further 2,000 in staff cuts. In contrast, SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, headed by Mr Sverker Martin-Loff, upgraded its 1992 results forecast, thanks to currency factors and the benefits of cost-cutting. If nothing else, these announcements emphasise the schizophrenia that characterises corporate Sweden at present. For most of the big international groups, which dominate the country's business sector, exports and profits should rise quite sharply this year thanks to the benefits of a devaluation that has so far seen the Swedish krona fall by around 20 per cent. However, because demand is likely to be weak in many European countries, and particularly in Germany, Sweden's largest export market, the benefits will not be as great as they were in 1982, the last time Sweden devalued, when a strong international recovery was under way. At the same time, a weaker currency will do nothing to alleviate the plight of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that depend on the domestic economy, which in 1993 is likely to be as depressed as it was last year. Sweden is heading for its third consecutive year of negative GNP growth this year, with investment and private consumption set to fall further, and unemployment still heading upwards. Thus 1993 will be a year when the performance of exporters such as the car, engineering and forestry companies, will stand out sharply from other sectors of business, like banking and construction. Since devaluation, very few of Sweden's leading exporters are not competitive, because, in addition to the advantage of a weaker currency, they have also benefited from rationalisation, low wage increases, and cuts in employers' social security contributions. One estimate suggests that Swedish corporate competitiveness this year will improve by more than 15 per cent as a result. For pharmaceutical companies like Astra and Kabi Pharmacia (part of Procordia), which were faring well even before the krona was floated, the devaluation provides an extra boost. For other groups, such as the car companies Volvo and Saab, the steel groups SSAB and Avesta Sheffield, and the forestry companies Stora, MoDo and SCA, it means a return to competitiveness and in many cases a return to profit after the difficulties of the past two years, because they are all big net exporters from Sweden. For a third category, such as SKF and the big white goods manufacturer Electrolux, the benefits are not so positive because they are not such big exporters from Sweden and demand in many key markets remains weak. For a loss-making company like Volvo, prospects have been transformed by the combination of productivity improvements and currency movements. At its Torslanda car plant, it now takes 50 hours to produce a car compared with 75 hours last year. The company has estimated that a 13 per cent devaluation of the krona is worth some SKr2bn in the long term. In the pulp and paper sector, there has been a similar transformation. Both MoDo and Stora can expect to be more than SKr1bn (Dollars 137m) a year better off following the devaluation if the krona stays at its current level. These and other export-orientated companies have a big weighting on the Stockholm stock exchange, which is why Swedish share prices have risen by nearly 30 per cent since the krona floated. It also explains why Alfred Berg Fondkommission, the Stockholm-based securities house, calculated last month that total profits for the top 35 Swedish companies could return to 1991 levels of SKr36bn in 1993 before advancing further to SKr63bn in 1994, basing its forecast on a 15 per cent eventual devaluation and a rate of SKr7.50 to the dollar. The figures would represent a strong recovery from the 1992 level of SKr7.6bn, although even the 1994 figure only takes the companies back to where they were in 1989. By contrast, the outlook for the domestic economy is bleak, not least because of the crisis in the banking sector. Many commentators expect credit losses in the banking system to be higher in 1993 than in 1992, and no-one will have been encouraged by last month's announcement from SE Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, that it might need support from the state. Such difficulties could tighten the credit squeeze on the corporate sector considerably. Meanwhile, construction activity is set to fall further next year, prompting an increasing number of calls for major infrastructure investment programmes to help get revival under way. The best hope for the country's domestically-orientated companies is that interest rates will come down sharply in 1993. There has been some relaxation already, although the central bank is expected to keep a generally tight grip on monetary policy to hold down inflation. The hope is that a combination of lower interest rates and higher exports will bring about discernible signs of recovery next year - in time to boost the re-election hopes of the coalition partners who form the minority government. However, the longer term prospects for Sweden's recovery will depend on how quickly it can cut its rising budget deficit and reduce public expenditure as part of an overhaul that promotes an enterprise culture. It will also depend on whether it has learned from the mistakes of the past. In public, at least, few industrialists were calling openly for a devaluation before the event, precisely because they feared the long-term consequences would be negative. Mr Sten Westerberg, senior partner at Maizels Westerberg, says previous devaluations have proved wasted opportunities for Swedish industry, as eventual overheating and cost inflation have eroded the initial benefits. The same mistakes will not necessarily be repeated this time, as inflation pressures are much lower in a depressed international business climate. But there are many who still fear that they will recur and that Sweden will once again find it is uncompetitive later in the decade.</p>

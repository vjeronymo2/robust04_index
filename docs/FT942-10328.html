			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: Giordano's 'Fedora' - Opera At the first interval one man was overheard to remark dolefully, 'You realise this is costing us more than Pounds 1 per minute'. Giordano might have been amused, as his opera Fedora panders shamelessly to the desire to see the rich on stage, caught up in some futile story of love and revenge in a selection of the world's most luxurious locations. It is said that Jose Carreras wanted Fedora staged in London. Any request from one of the 'three tenors' is probably difficult to resist and the Royal Opera has responded by borrowing this existing production (by Lamberto Puggelli) from La Scala, Milan - a sensible move, given that the opera is unlikely to come back often. Caruso helped launch it and since then it has become the vehicle for a star tenor or soprano, or both. A poor man's Tosca would be a charitable description. Sardou (soon to provide Puccini with his 'shabby little shocker') prided himself on putting together historical melodramas from a stock handful of props and some exotic locations: this production of Fedora takes us on a charter trip from the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to an aristocratic salon in Paris and the mountains of Switzerland. If the composer had been Verdi, he might have focussed on some political or social issue. If Puccini, he would have invested the characters with deeper emotional psyches. Instead, as humble Giordano, he was content to put the music to a creaky outline of a period thriller. For an opera lasting barely 90 minutes Fedora remarkably manages to seem too long, forever stalling before making its next point. At the denouement, as the hero stands around helplessly, one wants to call out, 'It was her. Don't you see? She did it]' The music needs pace at all costs if it is to build up any feeling of anticipation, but Edward Downes was not in a hurry. The opening scenes do have some theatrical bustle written into them, but here the smaller parts had to work hard to make the business look busy. Jonathan Summers gets the main supporting role as the diplomat, De Siriex. Judith Howarth needed more fizz for her song on the delights of Veuve Clicquot (is this one of the earliest cases of 'product placement'?) Fedora herself is any diva's dream of a role - a Russian princess, who makes her entrance swathed in white fur, dripping in diamonds (cue audience applause). The role asks for an extravagant soprano who is unashamed at playing the Joan Collins of the verismo dynasty. Mirella Freni is not that kind of singer and her performance is more about being thrifty, using a few well-chosen gestures for the character and pressing her bright, contained voice to do duty for the lavish dramatic soprano it has never been. What she does offer is Italian style in abundance. Carreras sounded hard pressed in the tenor role. So long as he is able to sing loudly and get a grip on the consonants the music suits his present style well enough, but there is little in the way of phrased, legato singing. He hangs on to some of the top notes more by will-power than anything else. Ever since we first saw him nearly 20 years ago, Carreras has given body and soul to every role he has sung and he does so again here. It is not his fault that poor Loris fails to touch the heart. In the final scene Giordano lays on the agony: Loris's brother has been drowned in prison, his mother has died at the news, his lover has effectively killed off his family and betrayed him too. But do we care? Not for a minute. Real inspiration in an opera composer costs more than money can buy. Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Sponsored by Union Bank of Switzerland. Five further performances until May 27. Covent Garden Proms May 24 and 27. Live relay on big screen in piazza May 19</p>

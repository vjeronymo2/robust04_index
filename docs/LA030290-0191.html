Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JERRY HALL MAKES LONDON DEBUT  </P> <P> Jerry Hall made her London stage debut this week in a revival of "Bus Stop,"  playing singer Cherie, the role Marilyn Monroe made famous in the 1956 movie  version of the William Inge play. Hall's boyfriend, Mick Jagger, didn't make  the show because he's touring Japan with the Rolling Stones, but Jade Jagger,  the singer's daughter from his marriage to Bianca Jagger, was on hand. Hall  also played the Cherie role in a New Jersey theater and Jagger caught her act  there.  </P></p>

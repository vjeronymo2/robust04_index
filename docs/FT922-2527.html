			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Gulf Canada Resources shares tumble SHARES of Gulf Canada Resources, the energy group controlled by ailing property developer Olympia &amp; York, lost almost one-third of their value yesterday after the company reported poor results from an Indonesian natural gas well. Gulf's share price tumbled CDollars 3 1/8 in heavy trading yesterday to close at CDollars 6 3/4 . It reached a peak of CDollars 10.88 earlier this year. The company's shares drew a flurry of excitement earlier this year when initial tests on the Kuala Langsa well in North Sumatra raised hopes of a vast gas deposit. The well is close to the huge Arun gas field, which is a leading supplier of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Japanese National Petroleum has a 50 per cent stake in the Gulf Canada property. Gulf said yesterday that test results now pointed to an unexpectedly high proportion of carbon dioxide and a low level of hydrocarbons. A Gulf Canada spokesman said further tests would be conducted before a decision was taken whether to develop the Kuala Langsa field. O&amp;Y's problems have thrown a cloud over Gulf's future ownership. The developer, whose Canadian assets are under court protection, pledged its Gulf shares as partial security for a USDollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan which it negotiated with an international banking syndicate in 1989. In a move to conserve resources, Gulf withdrew earlier this year as a participant in the CDollars 5bn (USDollars 4.1bn) Hibernia oil project off Newfoundland. Other participants in the Hibernia venture, led by Mobil Oil Canada, are searching for a replacement. Local reports have suggested that Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, may be among those interested in taking Gulf's place in the Hibernia consortium.</p>

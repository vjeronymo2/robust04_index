			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 3 DIE IN COLORADO BANK EXPLOSION  </P> <P> The two-story brick Crested Butte State Bank building exploded shortly after  opening today, rocking the historic mining town, killing three people and  injuring at least a dozen more, authorities said.  </P> <P> Bob Gillen, a spokesman for the Gunnison County emergency response team, said  rescuers are searching for more possible victims in the rubble of the building.  </P> <P> "There's nothing left but the bank vault sitting in the rubble," said Michelle  English-Batchelor, a passer-by. "It just isn't there. It was a big building.  Now it's just an empty space."  </P> <P> The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. Officials said there was  no natural gas or propane service to the bank, but it was located in an area of  town known as "The Bench," where there are known underground deposits of  methane gas left over from old coal mines.  </P></p>

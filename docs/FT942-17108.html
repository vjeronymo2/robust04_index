			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Sharp rise in new mortgage lending The number of loans approved by Britain's mortgage lenders rose sharply in February, giving further evidence of renewed activity in the housing market. Another sign of recovery came in a further slight rise in house prices in the latest Halifax Building Society index. This showed prices in March 0.2 per cent higher than in February - the third monthly increase running. Monthly figures released by the Bank of England yesterday showed there were 88,000 loans approved in February, against 74,000 in January. The total value of loans amounted to Pounds 4.65bn, compared with Pounds 4.33bn in January. Loan approvals are an important indicator of the future strength of the housing market. The Bank's figures also show building societies gaining a higher share of the mortgage market than last year. Within total net lending of Pounds 1.53bn in February, societies lent Pounds 1.19bn, while banks lent Pounds 587m. Other specialist mortgage lenders continued to reduce their net exposure to the market. This resurgence by building societies is in line with a new forecast from stockbrokers UBS that societies' market share will rise to 65 per cent this year from 58 per cent in 1993. This would still be a lower market share than in any other year since 1988, when specialist centralised lenders were still active. The UBS forecast envisages a sharp drop in the banks' market share for 1994 to 30 per cent from 39 per cent. Banks' fixed-rate mortgages proved particularly popular last year. Abbey National has already said it expects its share of UK mortgages to drop from 19 per cent to a more typical level - it gained a 14 per cent share in each of the three years to 1992. Mr Peter Williams, head of research and external affairs at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that confidence in the market had begun to grow now that house prices were more stable. Provided there were 'no other shocks' beyond the tax rises and reduction in mortgage interest relief which took effect this week, a further strengthening in housing market activity could be expected, said Mr Williams. But Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, warned that the loan approval and house price figures could have been distorted by buyers' desire to seize attractive fixed-rate mortgages before they were withdrawn. Halifax and the CML, which represents banks, building societies and specialised lenders, believe the latest figures are consistent with a forecast 5 per cent rise in house prices this year.</p>

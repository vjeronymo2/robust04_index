			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Pet ideas on rabies leave Brits foaming DOGS may be man's best friend in the UK but continental ones should be kept at arm's length - or so the British believe. This has made rabies and the movement of pets across Europe one of the most emotive of the single-market issues. The notion that Europe is foaming with rabid wildlife and that only the channel stands in its way has led to turbulent ministerial negotiations. The UK is to be allowed to retain tough anti-rabies laws and European Commission plans to encourage free movement and substitute a Community-wide animal vaccination 'passport' in place of quarantine have been thwarted. Under the deal agreed between farm ministers in June, border controls involving domestic pets were left up to the member states, so pets coming into Britain with their owners will still have to undergo the expensive six months' quarantine, as they have for the past 25 years. Future legislation will have to involve controls at least as effective as the current ones. However, dogs and cats imported into member states by recognised dealers for sale will be able to enter without undergoing quarantine under strict conditions similar to those already imposed on farm livestock. These regulations come into force in Britain in January 1994. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said the ability to keep quarantine regulations in Britain once other customs barriers come down would lay to rest all fears of rabies spreading from the Continent.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gilts exert a fresh attraction - How to . . . invest in government bonds THE PRIVATE investor is being lured back into gilts. The attraction of these bonds, issued by the UK government, is their absolute security. Not only can the investor be certain that gilts will be repaid, he knows when and at what price. The returns available at the moment are between 9 and 9.7 per cent, higher than that available from some building society accounts and well above the rate of inflation. Some believe that the 1990s will be a period of low inflation and interest rates, in which case the present returns on gilts may, in retrospect, seem highly attractive. Of course, there are risks. It might seem foolish to buy gilts ahead of a general election which could result in a Labour victory and consequent falls in gilt prices. Even if the Conservatives win, the government's budget deficit is growing and it will have to issue many more gilts to finance that deficit. In addition, anyone buying gilts should be committed to holding them long-term. Those who are forced to sell their holdings in the short term may not get their capital back. Having considered the risks, though, how does the investor who still wants to buy gilts actually build a portfolio? These are the factors you have to consider. Interest rate All gilts have a 'coupon,' an interest rate which they will pay based on a percentage of the face (par) value. But, in practical terms, this coupon is unimportant to the investor since gilts rarely trade at exactly their face value. What actually matters is the yield, which is expressed in two ways. The running yield is the interest return which the investor will receive each year, expressed as a percentage of the price paid. So, an investor who buys a gilt with a coupon of 12 per cent at a price of 120 will get a running yield of 10 per cent. But since gilts have a par value of 100, someone who buys a gilt at 120 will face a capital loss. The expression for this is the gross redemption yield. If the gilt is trading above par value, the running yield will be higher than the gross redemption yield and vice versa. The Exchequer 12 1/4 per cent 1999, for example, was trading on Tuesday at 113 15/16 , on a running yield of 10.75 per cent and a gross redemption yield of 9.5 per cent. The 8 per cent 2009, priced at 90 15/32 , offered a running yield of 8.84 per cent and a gross redemption yield of 9.1 per cent. Price The par value of gilts is 100. Thus, an investor who buys a gilt priced below 100 can lock-in to a tax-free capital gain if he holds the stock until maturity. The snag is that very few gilts are trading below par value at the moment. Most of those which are have maturity dates of over 15 years. Buying a gilt which is trading above par value brings the investor a higher running yield, but at the expense of a capital loss. Take the 15 1/2 per cent 1998 gilt which, at Tuesday's close, was trading at 128 9/32 . The running yield was a very healthy 12.08 per cent, but the investor who held it to maturity would lose more than a fifth of his capital. By contrast, the 8 3/4 per cent 1997 gilt was trading at 97 21/32 , offering the prospect of a modest capital yield. But the running yield was a much lower 8.96 per cent. Maturity date Nearly all gilts have a set date on which they will be repaid. These so-called maturity dates range, on conventional gilts, from later this year to 2017. Selecting a gilt with a long maturity date means that the investor has locked-in his chosen interest rate for a longer period. The snag, however, is that the possible impact of inflation is much greater. If inflation averages 5 per cent a year, then the real value of a gilt which matures in 2007 will have halved by the time it is repaid. A gilt with a short maturity date is much less prone to inflation. However, when it is repaid, the investor is exposed to 're-investment risk.' He cannot know what rate he will receive when he re-invests the proceeds of the matured gilt. The consensus wisdom, therefore, is that it is best for investors to select a range of maturity dates. Tax Gilts are likely to be most suitable for those in the basic-rate tax bracket who want a secure income. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, and do not need income, then National Savings certificates are likely to offer better value; the equivalent gross return for a top-rate taxpayer on the 36th issue is 14.17 per cent. An alternative investment for a top-rate taxpayer is index-linked gilts, where much of the return comes in the form of tax-free capital gain. Peter Jones, of stockbroker Greenwell Montagu, has suggested a portfolio of gilts for those who want a monthly income (see table). Since they pay dividends twice a year, a minimum of six gilts is needed to achieve this aim. Jones has aimed for gilts which are trading at around par (based on prices prevailing earlier this week) and has concentrated on large marketable issues.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   PORTFOLIO FOR MONTHLY INCOME  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Date of         Stock       Approx   Approx cost payments                    price    incl expenses* Jan/Jul   Tr 9 1/2  % 1999  101 1/4     10,250 Feb/Aug   Tr 9 3/4  % 2002  103         10,400 Mar/Sep   Tr 8 3/4  % 1997   97 3/4      9,900 Apr/Oct  Conv 9 1/4 % 2004  101 1/2     10,250 May/Nov   Tr 9%       1994   99 1/4     10,050 Jun/Dec   Tr 105      1994  101 1/4     10,250 Total                                   61,100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Of pounds 10,000 nominal.

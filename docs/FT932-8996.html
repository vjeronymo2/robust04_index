			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Titon executives sell 1m shares - Directors' transactions BETWEEN FEBRUARY and June 1991, three directors of Titon Holdings, the building materials group, bought shares at prices between 48p and 66p. Since then, the price has risen steadily and is up more than 60 per cent relative to the FT All Share index over the past year. On the day the company announced its final results, along with a bullish statement about prospects, executive directors sold a total of 1.01m shares at 208p. According to the chairman, these sales were made to satisfy demand for the stock from institutions. Sir Harry Solomon, now a non-executive director of Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturing group, bought 250,000 shares at 80.5p in September last year, along with Sir John Nott, the chairman, and John Jackson, the deputy chairman. Sir Harry has now sold 1m at 161p to reduce his holding to about 4.3m. At the same time, Ray Mackie, the recently appointed finance director, bought 25,000 at 155p. JD Wetherspoon came to the market in October last year at 160p. Since then, the price has outperformed the market by 59 per cent and Anthony Lowrie, one of the company's non-executive directors, has sold 100,000 shares at 279p, reducing his holding to 991,054.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                  Sector      Shares     Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Bilton                   Prop         2,096        11        2 Cadbury Schweppes        FdMa        76,000       350        1* Computer People          Elns       260,000       267        2 Dencora                  Prop       150,000       153        1 Frogmore Estates         Prop        70,100       268        1* Hillsdown Holdings       FdMa     1,000,000     1,610        1 Huntleigh Techn'gy       Hlth         1,000        10        1 Iceland Frozen Food      FdRe        45,000       310        1 MAI                      OthF        13,500        25        1 ML Laboratories          Hlth       100,000       179        1* Psion                    Elns        13,217        15        1 RMC                      BdMa         3,500        24        1 Scholl                   Hlth        51,592       106        1* Titon Holdings           BdMa     1,010,000     2,101        6 Victaulic                EngG        30,000        96        1 Wetherspoon (JD)         Brew       100,000       279        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Eastern Electricity      Elcy         2,260        11        1 Hillsdown Holdings       FdMa        25,000        39        1 Moorgate Smaller Co      FdMa        26,741        34        3 Tesco                    FdRe        40,000        88        2 Tiphook                  Tran         5,000        12        1 Tomkins                  Cong         7,282        18        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

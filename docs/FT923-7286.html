			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Patten chases prize of compromise in divided Hong Kong: Simon Holberton on an administrative blueprint that might square a difficult circle for the colony's new governor WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, meets Mr Zhou Nan, Beijing's most senior official in the colony, tomorrow both are likely to shy away from the subject of domestic Hong Kong politics. There will no doubt be inconclusive exchanges about the airport, Mr Zhou's health  - he was unable to attend the governor's swearing-in six weeks ago because he was ill  - and possibly, the recent troubles in Shenzhen. But the meeting, which is being billed as a 'get to know you' session, will avoid anything that hints at negotiation or controversy. For China, the meeting will be the first opportunity to meet a man who, in less than two months, has taken Hong Kong by storm. Mr Patten has managed to redefine the role of governor as populist leader  - with his opinion poll ratings as high as Mr Zhou's are low. There is, however, no one in Hong Kong more aware than Mr Patten that his first weeks in office have been little more than a triumph of style over content. An early test of his fibre will come when he unveils his plans for political reform in the colony. These are likely to come in two stages. The first, which will coincide with his formal opening of the local legislature on October 7, will be his blueprint for the operation of Hong Kong's representative and executive branches of government  - the Legislative and Executive Councils respectively. The second will be arrangements for the colony's 1995 elections. These will probably not be decided quickly. However, he may use his October address to define the options and his preferred solution, and see where the ensuing public debate leads. To win Beijing over to his view, Mr Patten will have to show that his plans for the legislature and the executive are ones with which China can live. He has already made reassuring noises in Beijing's direction with his firmly stated position that his administration will be 'executive-led'. China wants a strong executive to keep the legislature in its place. Mr Patten's main concern is to have a government which works. After last September's partially democratic elections, his predecessor, Lord Wilson, sought a workable solution by inviting appointed conservative members of the legislature into his cabinet. He hoped this would secure him a majority in the legislature. The policy had mixed results, with the conservative group's support for the government less sure as it has increasingly looked towards its future role, post-1997. To secure that role it needs to look and act independently, rather than as a rubber stamp to a British colonial government. The Wilson solution also failed to accommodate the democrat-ically elected element within the legislature  - 12 of whom rally to Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats and six of whom broadly support the governor - which was excluded from the executive. Mr Patten is spending the Hong Kong summer thinking about the options. From what he has said, together with some well placed leaks to test local reaction, it is possible to see a line of thought which might just enable him to square a very difficult circle. Taken together, the elements of such a plan mark a change for the administration of Hong Kong, which may not win Mr Patten plaudits from many of the democrats in the colony. These elements include: The Executive Council. Mr Patten would accept the resignations of the 10 unofficial members that Baroness Dunn secured for him early last month. This would allow him to recast his cabinet into the advisory body he appears to want. The reconstructed cabinet would have a broad based membership, including businessmen, men and women of ability  - some of whom may have good links with Beijing  - and leading civic figures. But it might not include any member of the legislature. This latter omission may put some leading politicians' noses out of joint. But Mr Patten may well conclude that no cabinet that includes politicians will guarantee him a smooth ride through the legislature. Having split the executive from the legislature, Mr Patten would dissolve the Office of Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO). This would allow him to create a committee system for the legislature  - something which most members want, especially the Democrats. As in the US Congress, committee members could quiz government officials about policy and amend bills in committee before they pass to the legislature for ratification. The committees would also serve other ends. They would provide local politicians with a platform but one outside the government. They would also provide a forum for senior Hong Kong Chinese government officials to essay their political skills. Mr Patten is keen to appoint a local Hong Kong Chinese to the chief secretaryship when the incumbent, Sir David Ford, retires around 1994. The best official in the legislature may well be called upon to succeed Sir David. Bolstering the officials will be the governor himself. He will introduce a form of 'prime minister's questions'  - thereby making good his promise of 'open and accessible government'. He will also be assiduous in working the telephone to ensure he gets a majority for his policies. Could he sell such a package to China? Beijing fears change of any sort, so he will have to convince them that it is for the better. Such a package has elements which Beijing should like  - executive-led, some of their people in the cabinet and no Democrats. China would have to compromise on committees  -which their representatives in the legislature have opposed  - but that might not be too much to ask.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mirka Velinovska: "A Finger in the Hole in </F> the Dam Wall"]    [Text] Although official Athens impressively insists that  the "change in the attitude of the United States toward Greece  on a range of questions of great importance for Greek interests"  must not be correlated with the visit of [Greek Foreign Affairs]  Minister Karolos Papulias to Moscow, it was not difficult,  nevertheless, for analysts of Balkan politics to predict the  timing of the visit, even the meeting itself. Namely, over half  a year ago, Greece marked its reserve trump card with which it  "threatened" its European and U.S. partners in the political  poker game that it would start bargaining if it is left in the  lurch. Now Greece wants to decrease the supposed suspicion in  its intentions by emphasizing that the "relations with the  European Union and the United States are still of greater  priority compared to the relations with Russia," on the one  side, and that there is a "much greater space for enhancing its  relations with Moscow, which should not distress Washington," on  the other.    One of the points of approach has been the repeated thesis  of  the threat or "attack against Orthodoxy and Hellenism from  coordinated Turkish action through Skopje and Tirana, with some  unidentified non-Balkan forces" -- as Greek Prime Minister  Papandreou said. It is exactly in that light that we must  observe Greece's chairing of the European Union last month and  the expectations of the Athenian political circles that Russia,  through its cooperation with Greece, may, in the future,  contribute to the solution of some disputes in the southern  Balkans -- explicitly noting Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Albania, as well as that, in  future, a greater contribution from the Russian diplomacy is  expected in the dispute between Greece and Turkey. Of course,  this will be of special importance if it comes out as a serious  part of the Greek Prime Minister's statement that the "problem  with the name [of FYROM] will be ultimately left to the Security  Council." Nevertheless, I take the liberty of having certain  reserves regarding such an outcome. At least not in the form in  which the Security Council can agree to change the name of a  state with a resolution, particularly because two of its members  (Russia is the one) have recognized our country by its  constitutional name. The second matter on which we should have  reservations is the fact that the Security Council resolutions  are mainly not implemented and accepted by the country they are  dedicated to.    One would say that everything is in its place and in  conformity with Papandreou's policy, who obviously doubts the  promptness of Washington in meeting his wish -- in the dispute  with Macedonia -- and making him a national hero and a  diplomatic winner. Evidently, the formula of Clinton's policy  -- without winners or losers in Balkan disputes, is not a result  desired by the old Greek fox, and therefore he reaches for his  reserve card.    After the two controversial statements of the Greek prime  minister, one after the other, given in the course of only 24  hours, and related to the "Macedonian case," the current dispute  has hardly become more clear. Nevertheless, while we are  expecting [U.S. presidential envoy] Matthew Nimetz's visit to  Skopje and Athens, and the new round of [FYROM Foreign Minister]  Stevo Crvenkovski's discussions in New York, we are able to make  assumptions founded on the known information:    1. Papandreou's statements, repeated several times, that he  "will never recognize a state with the name of Macedonia," and  that the "dispute is practically on the eve of a solution," only  seem to be contradictory. We can suppose, for instance, that  Greece will accept the Irish formula for the solution of the  dispute, which will provide Papandreou and his government with  an alibi for the Greek domestic public -- that he really did not  accept a state with the name of Macedonia. In all this, the  rest of the world will be left aside.    2. If we talk about finesses, we should then examine the  tension in relations with Albania in that light. The sharp  turns and stresses of the Albanian-Greek political dispute in  the last two weeks can be interpreted in the light of the known  Serbian formula: Close a problem, open another with the aim of  distracting the attention of the people. Actually, following  the seasoned Greek formula for conducting a national policy,  this case is also being followed in meetings in Salonika, this  time against Albania. The people have been allotted a new  cut-off time, and Papandreu has been left with some breathing  space.    3. The situation with Albania was strained just after the  shock the north [FRY] and south [Greece] neighbors had after the  informal meeting between [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov and  [Albanian President Sali] Berisha in Podgradec [Albania] and  Ohrid [FYROM]. Therefore, the easing of relations with one  country causes tensions with those following the other plan,  particularly because strategies and practical political steps  founded on false theses have been abandoned. Moreover, if Sali  Berisha remains consistent in his claim that the Kosovo problem  will be solved pragmatically -- that is that the Albanian  president has accepted the existing borders with Serbia -- it  will be difficult for Greece to accept that relaxation in the  southern Balkans and rejoice in it openly.    4. Meanwhile, following the Greek political pulse and the  same timing, Serbia has also strained relations with Macedonia  in the past few weeks. We have already commented on the  statements of Serbian Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  regarding the recognition of Macedonia by Serbia and Montenegro,  which are continually becoming more radicalized. Now comes the  time for warnings from the Serbian army for the transfer of some  watchtowers on the Macedonian-Serbian border or.... The timing  has been set, and the threatening "or" will be enforced when the  census in our country begins.    It seems that, in a range of consequentially linked  reactions  in the Balkans (including the reinforced Bulgarian campaign for  proving the Bulgarian character of Macedonia, as well as of  those "realists" who accept the "existence of Macedonianness as  armor for the protection from alienation, but not the Macedonian  national recognition") the key position is occupied by the  census that has to begin in a few days. This event, always and  everywhere considered to be an ordinary and necessary  statistical operation, except in this region -- particularly in  Macedonia -- is becoming a primary event for many known and  often elaborated reasons.    [Text] That is why the state was expected to play a more  active role in this act. If a party is calling on the  Macedonian people to boycott the census and protest, if the  operation depends on "how the wolf will count the sheep," if the  editorial houses have received information that the political  parties in Western Macedonia are making propaganda and  pressuring the Macedonians to declare themselves as Serbs, if  large groups of retired and active Serbian officers have, just  now, chosen to come to our country for recreation and on  week-ends, it does not look too good and it should be succeeded  by a more serious process.    One must bear in mind the assessment of Defense Minister  Vlado Popovski, transmitted by REUTER, that the increased  activity on the Serbian-Macedonian border, and similar activity  that is also to be expected in the south, certainly toward  Albania, can be understood as open pressure and threats.  Nevertheless, it can also be taken as a danger sign, indicating  how the political leaderships of friendly Serbia and Greece view  the solution of problems in the southern Balkans. That is  exactly why it is necessary to follow the growing tensions with  the neighbors and the reverberations that will certainly be felt  in our domestic political life in the next two weeks.</p>

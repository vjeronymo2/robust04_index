			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television It is a good evening for 'pastime' programmes. At 8.00 BBC2 starts a new six-part series of The Edge looking at the history of Scottish mountaineering. At the same time C4 begins a repeat of Wildshots, a five-part series in which photographer Chris Packham gives hints on wildlife photography. That is followed by a new series of Screaming Reels, which is not about horror movies but fishing (8.30). At the same moment BBC2 begins another series of Top Gear, the highly successful series for motoring freaks. In its Brando season C4 shows the 1952 movie Viva Zapata] in which Marlon smoulders and snarls behind lots of face fungus. It is not a great film, but Kazan directed from Steinbeck's script, and Anthony Quinn won an Oscar in the role of Zapata's brother (10.00). Inside Story tells of the lives of twins June and Jennifer Gibbons. As children they spoke only to one another, though they seemed to have a love-hate relationship. Sent to Broadmoor after a series of arson attacks, they were released in 1993 whereupon Jennifer stopped living, though she took no active steps to end her life (10.00 BBC1).</p>

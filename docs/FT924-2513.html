			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Tyson; cautious activist who advocates hardball: Michael Prowse on Clinton appointees Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Robert Reich MS Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 45, a professor of economics and business at the University of California at Berkeley, is the first woman to be nominated head of the Council of Economic Advisers since the presidential advisory body was established in 1946. Educated at Smith College, she has a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has written extensively on trade and industrial policy, and on the economies of eastern Europe. Her most recent book, Who's Bashing Whom: Trade Conflict in High Technology Industries, was published last month by the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Within the economics profession, she has gained a reputation as one of most intelligent critics of the free market economic policies in vogue during the Reagan-Bush years. She describes herself as a 'cautious activist' and believes the federal government should intervene more aggressively than in the past to improve the performance of particular sectors. In her latest book, she calls for targeted subsidies for strategic, high valued added industries such as semiconductors and supercomputers, heavy federal investment in civilian research and development, and generous tax incentives for corporate research and development. On trade policy she believes the US should play hardball, demanding concessions from other countries when it opens markets. She says it should respond to foreign subsidies with 'countervailing subsidies' for US companies. Ms Tyson believes the federal government should develop 'an institutional capability for assessing competitive trends in high technology industries.' She was one of the few academics willing to defend the 1986 semiconductor trade deal between the US and Japan, which guaranteed foreign companies a fixed share of the Japanese market. Many economists believe such 'managed trade' agreements are a form of covert protection.</p>

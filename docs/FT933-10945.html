			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Fashion: The bronze age sun worshippers take cover - What's new under the sun? Avril Groom visits Cap Ferrat where the mahogany-tanned beach bunnies are going the way of the dinosaur and the golden girls are changing style EXTOLLING the virtues of a plain black swimsuit to the women around the pool at the Hotel Bel-Air in Cap Ferrat is likely to produce plain black looks. They take glamour in the sun seriously here and they know that, in the brilliant, bleaching light of the French Riviera, it is bright, or at least a bold monochrome, that looks right. Minimalist is not a term recognised in the discreetly indulgent atmosphere of this cliff-top spot at the tip of one of the Cote d'Azur's wealthiest peninsulas. And these practised sun goddesses have a point. In their exuberant swimsuits, fringed pareos, fat Alice bands and jewellery, many of them look marvellous. As John Betjeman believed, good taste can be ghastly. On holiday, when fun and glamour are priorities, it can make you invisible. The one way to ensure that a swimsuit oversteps the line that divides flamboyance from vulgarity is to wear it with a mahogany suntan. Below the Bel-Air's pool, in full sun on a windless terrace, the last of the topless beach bunnies anoint themselves with coconut oil and fry, storing up a future of health horrors and skin wrinkled like the dinosaurs which, in fashion terms, they have already become. Catching the breeze round the pool above are the wiser golden girls who take refuge under the forest of white parasols that sprout beside each beach lounger as the sun reaches its full height. The loose shirts and sarongs that high-glamour swim ranges such as Gottex, Gideon Oberson and La Perla have long provided as part of their co-ordinated beach style are worn not just for propriety during lunch but as a matter of course in the heat of the day. As many British stores seem to think that autumn arrives at the same time as the holiday season, finding such co-ordinates can be tricky if you wait, as many do, until just before your holiday. Harrods' swimwear department is there all year and has a full range of Gottex swimsuits and beach separates. Both Fenwick and Harvey Nichols have recently-arrived stock which has not formed part of their sale. Debenhams' reasonably-priced (from about Pounds 20) high summer range will last throughout August, Slix has just introduced its summer range and Issey Miyake's Splash collection of non-crease holiday pieces is also a new arrival. These collections reinforce the pursuit of glamour with nostalgic, 1950s-inspired style - draping, ruching, underwiring, lower leglines and even skirt effects all play their part. Fitness-conscious women on holiday take swimming as seriously as sunbathing and even ruched chiffon is now water-worthy. The most starrily-clad Bel-Air resident can safely entrust herself to Pierre Gruneberg, the swimming instructor whose way of teaching the water-shy by calmly and firmly making them put their heads under water and control their breathing has made him more famous than his glittering pupils. Women, he says, hate getting their hair wet but these days they have no excuses: floral bathing cap and turban are hot fashion items. Jewellery is also part of the glamour canon and gold is flattering to a golden skin. Jewellery, like the tan, is toned down this year, to a substantial but discreet chain or bracelet of the real thing to wear by pool or beach and a matt gilt costume-jewellery bangle to jangle at lunch. Mappin and Webb's Spirit of Gold British-designed collection is an interesting source of well-priced pieces. A paler shade of bronze may be fashionable but skin needs as much attention to keep it supple as in the days of darker tans. Apart from suncreams of a suitable protection factor, generous after-sun moisturising is essential, preferably an almost perfume-free one such as Decleor's Fraicheur Apres Soleil. This will blend successfully with the moisturising after-bath lotions that complement your favourite fragrance, with lighter eau de parfum most suitable for warm weather. Just launched is the bath range to go with last summer's successful scent - gardenia, hyacinth and fruit-based-Gio by Armani. Hair needs sun protection, too. Colourist Jo Hansford, who has just opened a London shop, says all hair dries and fades in the sun, with tinted hair affected most. She suggests a hat. Sun protection screens and conditioners such as Schwarzkopf's Bonacure range help. 'Bleached hair is already damaged because the pigment has been stripped,' she says. 'You don't want to exacerbate that effect. We sometimes have to re-tint highlighted hair that has had too much sun.' There are other traps which, if taken to extremes, could be disastrous. 'Lemon juice to help the sun lighten hair can turn dark hair orange,' she says. 'And too much chlorine turns it green.'</p>

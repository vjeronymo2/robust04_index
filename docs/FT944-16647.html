			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sharp fall in Europe's M&amp;A activity Merger and acquisition activity in Europe fell in the third quarter of this year to the lowest level this decade, although there was a sharp upturn in the US, according to Securities Data, a leading compiler of league tables of investment banks. The total value of transactions in Europe dropped to Dollars 21bn in the three months to September, representing a 35 per cent decline on the quarterly average in 1993. Outside the US, activity dipped to Dollars 35.5bn, the lowest since 1988. A stagnant corporate takeover market in Europe contrasts sharply with the US, where economic recovery pushed M&amp;A volume up 33 per cent to Dollars 236.6bn in the first three quarters of 1994. 'The feelgood factor that is in the US is not in Europe yet,' a US investment banker said. The figures show that M&amp;A activity has been slow to recover in spite of renewed economic growth in Europe. However, investment banks in London are adding staff in their corporate advisory departments in anticipation of a revival in activity. The league tables of activity and advisers cover completed deals, which can lag announcements by several months and initial approaches by even longer. Most investment banks report a healthy 'pipeline' of deals as companies which have weathered the recession look again at expansion. M&amp;A departments expect strategic deals in sectors such as health care, automotive components, telecommunications, financial services and chemicals. Another impetus could come from financial investors such as Glenisla, a takeover fund set up with backing from investors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which issued a profit warning last week after setbacks in bond and equity markets, headed the league table of advisers on European M&amp;A, as it did in Securities Data's 1993 report. Warburg advised on 43 deals worth Dollars 13.6bn in the first three quarters, giving it market share of 16.5 per cent. The UK house advised Banco Santander of Spain on its Dollars 2.4bn acquisition of Banesto and on the merger between Akzo, the Netherlands chemical company, and Nobel Industrie of Sweden. Warburg was placed behind two US investment banks in the most recent league table of advisers on European cross-border transactions drawn up by Acquisitions Monthly, the other big compiler of M&amp;A data. While the precise rankings vary depending on the criteria, Warburg and US investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs usually lead the pan-European tables.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------        VALUE OF COMPLETED MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS (DOLLARS BN)                        (FIRST THREE QUARTERS)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                      US     Non-US    Worldwide  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                               177.9     150.1      328.0 1994                               236.6     133.6      370.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

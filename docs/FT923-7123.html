			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities stage late fall awaiting Bush speech Wall Street US SHARE prices traded listlessly in a narrow range for most of the day yesterday until late selling of bank, housebuilding and airline stocks left leading indices notably lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 22.42 down at 3,307.06. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 3.15 to 418.19, while the Nasdaq composite receded 3.26 to 567.61. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 187m shares. Financial markets have been full of speculation this week that President Bush will announce some tax cuts during his acceptance speech as part of a bold attempt to regain the initiative from his Democratic rival, Governor Bill Clinton. Although the bond market would react negatively to such a move, analysts are unsure how equity investors would respond. On the one hand, tax cuts would have a positive effect on the economy, and on the President's chances of re-election, but on the other, they would harm efforts to reduce inflation and the federal budget deficit. Given such uncertainty, many investors have decided to keep out of the market until after tonight's speech. Banks were mostly lower, although analysts could not find an explanation for the sell-off in the sector. Citicorp fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 , BankAmerica Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 43 1/8 , Chemical Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 22 5/8 . Berlitz International moved ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 1/2 in turnover of 2.2m shares on news that Fukutake Publishing, of Japan, will buy 67 per cent of the company for cash, new stock and some proceeds of Maxwell Communication debts. Airline issues weakened after AMR, parent of American Airlines, retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 on a warning from the company that it would make a heavy loss in the third quarter. Commodore International plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 6 7/8 after the computer and electronic products group announced a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of 66 cents a share, a dismal performance compared with the 10 cents a share profit earned a year ago. Housebuilders were mostly lower in the wake of Tuesday's poor housing starts data. Kaufman &amp; Broad Homes dropped the furthest, by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 12 after warning that third-quarter earnings would come in some 20 to 30 per cent below the year-earlier figure. On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 on news that the stock will replace Wang Laboratories - which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week - on the S &amp; P 500 index today. Canada THE sudden late setback on Wall Street chopped a few points off the Toronto market but stocks ended no worse than mixed with help from stronger bank shares. A Goldman Sachs report by a New York analyst, recommending Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, pushed banks up. Royal Bank was ahead CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 24 3/4 , after a day's high of CDollars 25 1/8 , and Bank of Montreal ended CDollars  7/8 firmer at CDollars 46 1/4 . The TSE 300 index gained a net 7.7 at 3,385.5 in volume of 26m shares.</p>

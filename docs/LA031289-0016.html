			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: ARE PEPSI, MADONNA ON THE ROCKS?  </P> <P> Surely Pepsi knew Madonna wasn't a virgin.  </P> <P> The provocative religious symbolism of the pop starlet's "Like a Prayer" video  led to a storm of media attention after a small Catholic group protested its  showing on Italian TV. But PepsiCo is standing by its $5 million pitchwoman.  </P> <P> According to a Pepsi spokesman, the firm is editing the two-minute ad (which  initially ran Grammy night) into 30-and 60-second spots, which will air "when  the single is hot and everyone is humming the tune."  </P> <P> But Pepsi refused to address a long-standing topic of industry debate: Would a  corporate sponsor scrub a mega-buck endorsement deal simply because a pop  artist's work -- be it song lyrics or video images -- provokes a furor? Or  inflames religious fundamentalists? Or insults an ethnic minority?  </P> <P> In other words, should pop stars accept millions if they're obligated to make  their art fit corporate-imposed morality or fashion? Madonna's manager, Freddy  DeMann, refused to comment on Pepsi's agreement -- and any "freedom of artistic  expression" clauses it might contain.  </P> <P> But industry sources say other Pepsi superstar endorsement deals gave the firm  sweeping latitude to torpedo a deal as a result of public furor over an  artist's work or private indiscretions.  </P> <P> According to a contract Pepsi signed with Def Leppard for a Canadian tour  sponsorship deal last year: "The sponsor shall have the right to terminate the  agreement in the event that any members of (the band) are involved in any  publicity deemed to be sufficiently unfavorable in the opinion of the sponsor  as to degrade the sponsor's image or destroy or lessen the value of the  artist's name for the purposes contemplated by this agreement."  </P> <P> The message is clear: If Pepsi feels a band has somehow given its corporate  patron a black eye, the sponsor can choose to bail out.  </P> <P> "That's the kind of potential horror story that points out the dangers you can  have with these kind of corporate deals," said Geffen Records A&amp;R exec John  Kalodner. "Personally I've always been against my bands being involved in any  endorsement deals. The art and the music should come first -- free from any  neccessity of pleasing a corporation."  </P> <P> Def Leppard manager Cliff Burnstein insists the band's brief association with  Pepsi was trouble-free. "The key question in all this should be -- how badly do  you need the money?" he said. "For us it was a tiny Canadian deal that we did,  in part, just to see how we could handle the notion of being involved with a  corporation. Frankly, if you're worried about the money, then don't take it.  Because if you agree to play ball with them, then you have to play their game  -- or be able to walk away from it."  </P> <P> Other top managers also expressed concern that pop stars' growing involvement  with corporate dealmakers opens the door for a potential censorship skirmish.  </P> <P> "When you get art involved with commerce, it becomes very difficult to decide  where you draw the line," said Martin Kirkup, who manages Brian Ferry, Joe  Jackson and OMD. "I can't imagine Freddy would ever allow Pepsi to control what  Madonna does. But if you were to ever give up any control over your artist's  work -- no matter how many barrel-loads of cash you might get -- you'd be doing  a real disservice them."  </P> <P> Where does this leave Madonna? Some industry insiders see the whole Pepsi  juggernaut -- controversy or not -- as a shrewdly conceived media hype. "I'm  sure Madonna could use the $5 million, but the Pepsi deal gave her the  opportunity to make an event out of her new song," explained A&amp;M Records  vice president of publicity Wayne Isaak. "Call it amazing or call it weird, but  when you're an artist at Madonna's level, trying to get to that next career  plateau, you almost need something extraordinary like a huge corporate  endorsement to get that big media splash.  </P> <P> "At A&amp;M we don't do things like give Pepsi a song before you give it to  radio or TV. But by letting Pepsi debut the song, it did make the song an  event. And in a society so full of information overload, it's one of the few  ways left to guarantee that your event will stand out from all the other events  that week."  </P></p>

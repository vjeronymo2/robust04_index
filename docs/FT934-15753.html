			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Wanted - more trustees / Debbie Harrison explores the finer points of running a pension scheme FOLLOWING publication last week of the Goode committee's report on pensions law, the government is expected to call for more occupational scheme members to become trustees in order to improve the security of UK pension funds. A trust cannot exist without a trustee who, as legal owner of the fund, is obliged to look after the assets on behalf of the 'beneficiaries' - the present members, deferred members (ex-employees who have left behind their accrued rights), and retired employees drawing pensions. At present, an estimated 300,000 trustees act as guardians of combined UK pension fund assets worth Pounds 400bn. The Goode report recommended that, for final salary schemes where the employer promises to provide pensions linked to final pay, members should make up one-third of the trustee board. Under money purchase schemes, where the pension is determined by the investment returns of contributions, the report recommended two-thirds of trustees should be members. Most large schemes consider appointing trustees to be good practice even though it is not compulsory. Smaller companies, however, often draw most of their trustees from management, a situation that can lead to abuse. If the company is cash-poor but pensions-rich, it might be tempting for the management trustee to use the fund to bolster the flagging corporate finances. The first and most important point for prospective trustees is that their responsibility is to the beneficiaries, not the employers. Patrick Day was a member trustee for Tate &amp; Lyle's main UK pension scheme - a fund with Pounds 400m and 10,000 beneficiaries - for eight years before he retired. Since then, he has continued his role as a pensioner trustee. Day says: 'There is a great deal to learn. The most difficult decisions involved the discretionary benefits - for example, over who should receive the death or ill-health benefits in marginal cases. This is where the member trustees' knowledge of the work force really comes into play.' Tate &amp; Lyle's fund already has 50 per cent member trustees, who are elected by a committee. Day explains: 'The committee looks for someone with a lot of common sense who is prepared to make the necessary commitment to study the trust deed and rules and to keep up with legislation.' Ron Skelton is a member trustee and chairman of the trustee board for a subsidiary of Siemens, the electrical group. He says: 'It is easy to become over-awed when you are sitting around the table with the top management. You need to have the confidence that can come only from knowledge.' Day and Skelton have attended trustee training courses, and both have studied for (and passed) the Pensions Management Institute (PMI) Trustee Certificate of Basic Pensions Knowledge* - a relatively new course designed to cover the essential facts trustees must know. John Cunliffe, a partner with pensions solicitor McKenna and Co. and author of the National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) guide for trustees**, says: 'As a member trustee, you are not expected to be an expert, but you should be honest, competent and interested in your scheme. Your first job is to look at the trust deed and rules and, if these are too muddled, ask the pensions manager to provide a summary. It is also essential to understand the main scheme booklet.' The trust deed sets out, among other points, how the fund is to be invested and the winding-up procedure. Robin Ellison, a partner with pensions solicitor Ellison Westhorp, has written a guide for trustees*** which includes an explanation of the key clauses to examine in deeds. If the Goode proposals are taken up, trustees will be required to take greater responsibility for checking a scheme's solvency and for distributing any surplus funds on wind-up. Criminal sanctions may be imposed on trustees and their professional advisers if they neglect their duty, so it is crucial to be well briefed before signing up. *For details, contact the PMI on 071-247 1452. **A new edition of The Role of the Pension Fund Trustee will be available in January 1994.

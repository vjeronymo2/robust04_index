			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading In the absence of leads from both the London and New York cash markets, stock index futures traded narr-owly in thin volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 2,939, up five points. The discount to the cash market was nine points, or around 10 points under fair value. With the December contract expiring on Friday, dealers have begun to focus more fully on the March counter, which closed at 2,952  - 10 points below fair value. Dealers said business was thin even by recent standards. Allowing for spread trading into the March contract, the December contract notched little more than 9,000 lots. The morning session saw a smattering of medium-sized deals, with UBS in evidence, but nearly all of the business was intra-dealer trading. Retail investors were nowhere to be seen. The December contract traded within a 24-point arc. By contrast, the traded option market was relatively busy, volume jumping to 39,329 contracts, from 28,048 on Monday. Call deals had a slight edge over puts, while FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 23,000 lots. Fisons was the star performer among individual options, with just under 4,000 contracts traded. Guinness (1,187 lots) and Hanson (987) were also active.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW UP 4.83 AS INVESTOR JITTERS COOL OFF EARLY RALLY  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks closed with modest gains today as investor jitters ahead of  Friday's unemployment report took some of the steam out of an early rally  fueled by strength in bonds and the dollar.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 4.83 points at 2,295.54.  </P> <P> Advances led declines by almost four to three on the New York Stock Exchange.  Big Board volume totaled 167.62 million shares, against 172.50 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> Blue chips were up by over 20 points at midday, piercing the key 2,300 mark  amid strong bonds and a surging dollar. But the rally soon cooled as investors  took to the sidelines ahead of Friday's report on February U.S. unemployment,  which will shed light on the economy's current strength and its prospects for  future inflation.  </P> <P> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 10/32 at 98-4/32 when the NYSE  closed, dipping its yield to 9.06% from 9.09%. The dollar rose to 1.8630 West  German marks from 1.8535 and to 129.22 yen from 128.75 after chief White House  economist Michael Boskin said the Bush Administration was willing to discuss  raising taxes -- indicating a possible move toward reducing the federal budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Bond prices were down in early trading today as a listless market continued  awaiting the government's release of February unemployment figures on Friday.  </P> <P> "You don't really have any drivers," said Elliott Platt, research director at  DL&amp;J Securities Corp. "Everyone's really just looking for the next piece of  data."  </P> <P> Platt said there was little change in the dollar in overseas trading today and  no other factors that normally affect credit markets.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were off 1/32 to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3/32 point and  long-term issues were down as much as 7/32 point, according to Telerate Inc.,  the financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 0.89 to 1,122.80.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9 9/16%, up from 8 3/4% late Tuesday. Analysts attributed the sharp  rise to short-term factors such as snowy weather in New York and the Eastern  Airlines strike that affected the flow of funds in the banking system.  </P></p>

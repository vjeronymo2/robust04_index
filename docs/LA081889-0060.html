			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE JUSTICES UPHOLD LOCAL AIR REGULATIONS;  </P> <P> CONTROLS OF TOXIC NON-VEHICULAR EMISSIONS NEED NOT WAIT FOR STATE ACTION, COURT  RULES  </P> <P> Citing the need for prompt action to protect the environment, the state Supreme  Court on Thursday upheld the power of local air pollution districts to control  toxic emissions from factories and other stationary sources of contamination.  </P> <P> The justices, in a unanimous decision, struck down a state Court of Appeal  ruling that had barred a local district from identifying and controlling toxic  substances before the state Air Resources Board had done so.  </P> <P> Local authorities and health and environmental groups from throughout  California joined in urging the high court to overturn the appellate ruling,  warning that it could all but eliminate local efforts to combat non-vehicular  contaminants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only 9 Pollutants Acted On  </P> <P> In Thursday's decision, the justices noted that in six years the state board  had acted on only nine such pollutants -- while scores of other substances had  been recognized in the scientific community as potentially harmful.  </P> <P> Waiting for state action would "for all practical purposes eliminate  non-vehicular air pollution control regulation in this state," Justice David N.  Eagleson wrote for the court. "Many years, perhaps decades, may pass before the  board will be able to study, identify and regulate the hundreds of substances  discharged into the air."  </P> <P> The court pointed out that in Los Angeles County alone, industries released  nearly 30 million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the air in 1987.  </P> <P> It is "inconceivable" that the Legislature, in enacting air pollution statutes,  intended to alter the long-held authority of local districts to control  non-vehicular emissions, Eagleson said. He noted that the board itself had  urged the court to reaffirm the power of local authorities to curb new sources  of industrial pollution.  </P> <P> The decision represented a major victory for the Monterey Bay Unified Air  Pollution Control District, which had sought to implement a sweeping,  precedent-setting plan to control nearly 150 toxic air contaminants from new or  modified stationary facilities in the area.  </P> <P> Daniel P. Selmi, a Loyola Law School professor who represented the district,  welcomed Thursday's ruling, saying the Monterey plan now may "serve as a model"  for similarly expansive efforts by other local districts in California. "This  is an important reaffirmation of the ability of local districts to control  toxic contaminants," Selmi said.  </P> <P> Alan Ramo, legal director for Citizens for a Better Environment, one of the  groups supporting the district, called the ruling "a crucial decision for air  toxics regulation in California." Now, Ramo said, "local districts can regulate  the thousands of uncontrolled toxic chemicals in the air."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit by Oil Interests  </P> <P> Donna R. Black of Los Angeles, an attorney for the Western States Petroleum  Assn., a group of producers and refiners who had brought suit challenging the  Monterey regulations, expressed disappointment with the ruling and voiced  concern that it could result in inconsistent and conflicting regulations in the  state.  </P> <P> "We thought we had a good argument in this case," Black said. "We contended  such controls should be implemented uniformly, rather than on a piecemeal  basis. But that's about the only result that can come out of this ruling."  </P> <P> Lawyers in the case noted that while important, the ruling would not directly  affect the recently state-approved, 20-year plan by the South Coast Air Quality  Management District to improve air quality in the Los Angeles Basin. That plan  is being developed to bring the region into compliance with federal air  pollution standards.  </P> <P> At issue before the high court was a milestone state law known as the Tanner  Act that was adopted in 1983 out of growing concern over the potential risk of  cancer, birth defects and genetic abnormalities from air pollution. The act  established an elaborate process for the state Air Resources Board, working  with health officials, to identify non-vehicular, toxic pollutants and then  design rules to combat them.  </P> <P> Local districts were to adopt regulations at least as strict as those of the  board. As in the past, the board retained its responsibility for control of  vehicular pollution.  </P> <P> Monterey authorities, dissatisfied with the pace of board action, adopted their  own far-reaching plan to identify and control toxic emissions in 1986. To  obtain a permit to operate, emission-producing facilities were required to  install "reasonable" technology to control contaminants -- and if those  pollutants could cause cancer, the "best" technology was required.  </P> <P> The petroleum association filed suit to block the plan, arguing that under the  1983 act, local authorities could not implement regulations until the state  board identified the contaminants as toxic and issued minimum standards for  their control. Allowing any of the state's 41 local districts to adopt plans  could result in a conflicting patchwork of regulations throughout California,  the association warned.  </P> <P> A Monterey County Superior Court judge upheld the plan but last year an appeals  court in San Jose ruled the district exceeded its authority by moving against  the contaminants before they had been cited as toxic by the state.  </P> <P> In Thursday's ruling, the state high court reviewed the 1983 act and concluded  that there was no indication the Legislature meant to repeal the  long-established authority of local districts to control industrial pollution.  While the Monterey district was the first to adopt such a sweeping plan, other  districts in the state have long imposed similar conditions on new sources of  pollution under local permit systems, the court noted.  </P> <P> The additional fact that the Air Resources Board itself supported the local  district's contention must be given "great weight" in resolving the issue, the  court said.  </P> <P> If the association's contentions were upheld, "the practical result . . . would  be the absence in the foreseeable future of essentially all non-vehicular air  pollution control regulation in California," Eagleson wrote. "Non-vehicular  sources could emit, in the interim, unrestricted amounts of almost all known  substances, even those generally believed by the scientific community to pose  serious health risks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Sentence Upheld  </P> <P> In other action Thursday, the justices unanimously upheld the death sentence of  Constantino Carrera, now 27, convicted in the 1982 murders of a married couple  who managed a motel in Mojave. The victims, Jack and Carol Hayes, died from  dozens of stab wounds. The ruling marked the 59th time the court has affirmed  the death penalty in 83 capital rulings issued since the defeat of Chief  Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court members in the 1986 election.  </P> <P> The court, in a brief order, also refused to hear an appeal from an Oakland  parent contending that under the 1982 anti-crime initiative, school districts  may be held liable for failing to protect students from campus violence. A  state Court of Appeal ruled last spring that the "safe schools" provision of  Proposition 8, the Victims' Bill of Rights, provides only a "general" right to  safety and that any steps to enforce that right must be implemented by the  state Legislature.  </P> <P> In another action, the high court let stand an appellate ruling upholding the  involuntary manslaughter conviction of a Contra Costa County woman who failed  to seek medical help for a man who died from a heroin overdose suffered in her  home.  </P></p>

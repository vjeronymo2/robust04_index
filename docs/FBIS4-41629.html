			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 26 June (TASS) -- The development of relations  with Russia should have a priority importance, Leonid Kravchuk  said today after he cast his ballot at one of the Kiev polling  stations. "They just cannot be other than a priority for us," he  stressed.    Kravchuk expressed confidence that "no matter who will  become  president of Ukraine, he will have to proceed from the  assumption that relations with Russia should have a special  status, taking into consideration the past and the future of our  two countries. If we forget about it, we shall put in a  difficult situation both Ukraine and Russia."    "I shall be very glad if my words are met with understanding  by the Russian leaders. If we learn to speak about each other  in this way, to respect each other, I am sure 70 per cent of  problems we are facing today will be removed. This is the most  important, the central problem of our policy," he said.    "The problem of the Chernobyl power plant is extremely  important not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world.  This is why we welcome the decision of the summit session of  the council of the European Union to allocate 500 million ECU  on the implementation of plans of a complete shutdown of the  power plant, but the sum should be calculated once again,"  Kravchuk said, commenting on the decision of the EU council.    The Ukrainian leader told ITAR-TASS that "the first problem  to be resolved is that of the future of the city, of the people  who live there... We still do not know how much money is needed  for resolving the problem of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."</p>

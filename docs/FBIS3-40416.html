			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Science and Engineering Research </F> Council: "Half Million Pound Boost For Coal Research"]    [Text] An agreement between the Science and Engineering  Research Council (SERC) and the Department of Trade and Industry  (DTI) has been signed which provides an additional 500,000  pounds for coal research in UK universities.    An important part of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme,  managed by  the Coal Team of Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), will be  the contribution of more than 500,000 pounds towards a  collaborative programme on coal research. In addition, ETSU's  Coal Team will provide active monitoring of a portfolio of  coal-related research grants to ensure the full potential of the  research is realised and disseminated as widely as possible.    Further information can be obtained from: Dr Neil Pratt,  Process Engineering Committee, SERC, Polaris House, North Star  Avenue, Swindon SN2 1ET, Tel: 0793 411484, Fax 0793 411020; The  Coal Programme Manager, ETSU, Harwell, Oxfordshire, OX11 0RA;  Tel: 0235 432669, Fax 0235 432753  <H5>  Notes For Editors </H5>   1. DTI made a brief reference to the programme in press  release P/93/287 dated 27/5/93.    2. The programme will continue under EPSRC after 1 April  1994.    3. Funds and manpower made available from ETSU will enhance  the commitment SERC makes to coal and related research which  currently stands at around 1 million pounds per annum.    4. Since 1 April 1990, the Coal Team at ETSU have undertaken  programme management responsibility for the DTI's Coal R&amp;D  programme. This responsibility entails providing necessary  technical support in the preparation and development of  strategy, and the recruitment, assessment, contracting and  management of R&amp;D projects. The Coal Team comprises of  Project  Managers supported by administration, contracts, finance and  technology transfer personnel, all of whom report to the Coal  Programme Manager.    A significant aspect of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme is  the  support of fundamental research at Higher Education Institutes  [HEI] of relevance to the development of clean coal  technologies. Co-operation between HEIs, research institutes and  industry in this research area has increased considerably over  recent years, and the Coal R&amp;D programme seeks to encourage  this  trend. Closer interaction enables industry to become  increasingly aware of the capabilities of the HEIs and,  consequently, to identify centres of expertise that are best  suited to address specific research problems. In turn, HEIs are  able to recognise more clearly industrial requirements and focus  their research programmes accordingly.    Fundamental coal science research is an international  activity and it is important that UK research takes account of  international developments and wherever possible is  complementary in its approach. A priority for the Coal R&amp;D  programme is to continue to encourage UK coal researchers to  derive maximum benefit from participation in international  programmes.    Under the SERC/DTI Scheme, the responsibilities of the SERC  are:    -- to undertake peer review according to usual practice;    -- to award grants according to the standard SERC procedures  and subject to normal SERC terms and conditions, except where  modified to take account of the monitoring and dissemination  activities of ETSU;    -- to manage all financial aspects of supported projects.    The responsibilities of ETSU are:    -- to assess all coal-related applications to the SERC and  advise the appropriate SERC Committee of the DTI's priority for  funding (based on the relevance of each application to  identified priority areas of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme);    -- to monitor actively the progress of research supported  under the Scheme, through meetings between the Grant Holder and  the ETSU Project Manager (usually at the Grant Holder's  institution), typically held six-monthly;    -- to enhance dissemination of basic information and results  from each research project supported through the publication by  ETSU of Project Profiles, Project Summaries and/or Final Reports.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Raluy] </F>   [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The more than 100 Cuban  asylum seekers at the residence of the Belgian ambassador in  Havana announced they rejected any contact with Cuban  authorities and preferred "to set themselves on fire" at the  diplomatic mission than renounce their objective of leaving the  country. "Our well thought out decision is to set ourselves on  fire here," the group of approximately 120 of asylum seekers  stated. These persons, who made their way into the ambassador's  residence on Saturday, made that statement in one of the four  handwritten documents they managed to smuggle out of the  diplomatic mission and deliver to the foreign media despite  police surveillance. "It is better for us to die than to fall  into their hands (...) We have nothing left to lose... Our  country is a true hell on Earth," one of the documents affirmed.    When asked by the news media, Cuban official sources said  they were not aware of the statements and reiterated that  "entering an embassy is not the legal way to leave the country.  Those who are at the Belgian Embassy must leave the building  peacefully. Cuba is reiterating the guarantees given to Belgium  that it will not take reprisals, and besides Cuba takes pride  that it has not taken reprisals in previous cases."    Dated 29 May, or a day after the group entered the residence  of Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch, two statements are  addressed to Pope John Paul II, the ambassadors stationed in  Cuba, and human rights organizations. A third one is addressed  to leaders of the Cuban exile community in the United States,  Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the Cuban-American National  Foundation, and U.S. Representatives from Florida Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balabart.    "We are not in a condition to begin talks or reach any  agreement" with the Cuban authorities, one of the statements  indicated. It added that the takeover of the residence "was a  necessary demonstration of the desperate situation of Cubans,  whose only options are to live indefinitely in chaos and poverty  or risk their lives on rafts."    The second statement stressed the asylum seekers'  determination. They describe themselves as peaceful opponents of  the regime and human right defenders, of "staying here as long  as it takes until our departure from Cuba with full guarantees  is resolved by the Cuban Government in mutual accord with the  government of any other country."    The most recent statement, dated Tuesday, reported to the  foreign media the deterioration of the situation inside the  diplomatic residence owing "to the constants acts of  provocations" by the security forces. Among the complaints of  "acts of provocations," the document mentioned Sunday's entrance  into the residence "in a manner without explanation given the  strong surveillance of the place," of our individuals, one of  whom left on Monday. It also cited "threats" and demonstrations  of force during the night in the area around the diplomatic  mission that seek to "frighten the women and cause further  trauma to the children."    This latest document noted that the asylum seekers created  on  30 May an organization called Union of Cubans for Liberty [Union  de Cubanos por la Libertad], headed by one of the asylum  seekers, Sergio Aguilar Cruz.    Meanwhile, one of the statements indicated there are 124  asylum seekers in the embassy (68 men, 32 women, and 24  children). Others put that figure at 119. Until now, the  Belgian authorities have reported that 114 persons, including 24  children, entered the residence on Saturday.</p>

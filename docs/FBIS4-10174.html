			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The arrest of two suspects in a plot against the  Honduran president, the arrest of Commander Saul Alvarez'  murderer in Miami, and the drug problem in the country were  topics addressed by Commander Fernando Caldera, director of the  National Police. Police arrested two individuals suspected of  participating in the plot to assassinate Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina. Santiago Rivas Betancourt was arrested in  Esteli on 5 April, and Luis Rene Quintero was arrested in  Managua on 6 April.    [Begin Caldera recording] Because it is a sign of a serious  act, we are proceeding to arrest them. The law empowers us to  hold them for 72 hours; during that time, we are going to try to  determine the facts. [end recording]    Another Nicaraguan suspect in the case, which was made  public  in Honduras on 5 April, remains at large. Honduran authorities  have identified him as Roger Arguello. Caldera made these  statements when he announced Commander Saul Alvarez' murderer  was arrested in Miami last week. Javier or Manuel Velasquez  murdered Commander Alvarez on 21 September 1992 during a  transportation strike. The murderer illegally entered the United  States by going from Managua to Guatemala and Mexico, then to  the United States. The police worked in coordination with the  FBI and Dade County police to capture Velasquez.    [Begin Caldera recording] He is now under the jurisdiction  of  immigration authorities. The Nicaraguan Government -- it is no  longer up to the police -- will make every effort to bring him  to Nicaragua so he can be tried in Managua. [end recording]    Velasquez left the country 10 days after the shoot-out on  the  northern highway.    On another topic, Commander Caldera said he is unaware of  the  State Department report which indicated Nicaragua has reportedly  not achieved progress with its strategy against drug trafficking.    [Being Caldera recording] The Nicaraguan state has been  advancing in the antidrug struggle starting from zero. Drug  trafficking in Nicaragua is a relatively new crime. [end  recording]    He described the draft law against drugs as a modern law  that  will fight crime.</p>

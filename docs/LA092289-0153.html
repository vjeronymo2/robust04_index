			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIA DIRECTOR APPOINTED TO MORTGAGE PANEL  </P> <P> President Bush appointed Christine Diemer Reed, executive director of the  Orange County Building Industry Assn., to the board of the Federal National  Mortgage Assn.  </P> <P> Reed, 37, of Corona del Mar, was named to a seat traditionally filled by a  representative of the home-building industry. It is one of five seats filled by  presidential appointment on the 18-member board.  </P> <P> Reed said she was "pleasantly surprised" by the appointment and said she would  work to represent the building industry on the board of the private  corporation, which buys mortgages on the secondary mortgage market, infusing  new funds into the market.  </P> <P> Reed had been director of the California Department of Housing and Community  Development -- appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1987 -- before taking  over the powerful local builders' trade association in July. The builders'  group has 1,100 members.  </P> <P>  -- MICHAEL FLAGG  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chun-pom: "Scenario for the </F> Five-Stage Punishment for North Korea's Provocation"]    [Text] In answering a question at the National Assembly  National Defense Committee on 23 March, ROK Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae said: "The ROK Government has mapped out a strategic  concept in which if North Korea perpetrates a provocation in the  five northwestern islands or specific areas [tukchong chiyok],  the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces or the ROK Armed Forces alone will  offer powerful punitive retaliation [kangnyokhan ungjingbobok]  and link this to an opportunity to wage a war to achieve  reunification [tongiljonyok suhaengui kihoero yongyesikinda]  depending on the state of the provocation."    Minister Yi made these remarks to stress that the ROK and  the  United States are all prepared for any emergency and are  confident that they can meet any provocation of the North and to  give a powerful warning to North Korea.    This is the first declaration that even though the  government  adheres to the principle of peaceful reunification, it has a  plan not only to defend ourselves but to pursue even  reunification with armed forces [muryoktongilggaji mirobuchil]  depending on the state of the provocation.    This strategic concept stated by Minister Yi is based on a  strategy of punitive retaliation contained in the "ROK-U.S.  Combined Operations Plan (OP 5027). That is, this is a  five-stage strategic concept in which if North Korea launches a  preemptive attack, the government will not merely deter the  enemy but conquer Pyongyang, isolate the North Korean regime,  and enter into the stage of North-South reunification.    North Korea has deployed 8,400 long-range cannon and 2,400  multi- warheaded missiles within 100 km of the DMZ at present.    It reportedly has developed or is developing "Taepodong-1  and  -2" missiles, in addition to the Nodong-1 and -2 and the Scud  ground-to- ground missiles.    In particular, it has hidden in underground tunnels aircraft  for transporting commando units to infiltrate into the rear area  when it launches a southward invasion and has beefed up the  antiair batteries in Yongbyon, where there are nuclear reactors,  from five to 47.    In preparation against this, the United States has recently  deployed five of the latest radar tracking devices and put areas  north of the DMZ under comprehensive 24-hour surveillance and  even mapped out a plan to attack those batteries in an emergency.    The five-stage ROK-U.S. combined operations plan goes like  this: In the prewar stage (first stage), if the ROK and the  United States detect dangerous signs from North Korea, they will  immediately call in the rapid deterrent forces (FDO).    At that time, "Defcon (Defense condition) 3" will be issued,  and the Armed Forces will assume a combat ready posture [jontu  chunbi taese].    This is because Seoul is a mere 40 km away from the DMZ and  we have a mere 24- to 76-hour warning time for a North Korean  attack.    Then, North Korea will bomb frontline units in a  concentrated  manner and send commando units to harass the rear of Seoul. As  a result, major roads will be crowed with refugees, who will  serve as a decisive obstacle to the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces'  northward movements.    This is a second-stage situation. At that time, North Korea  will infiltrate ground forces deployed along the DMZ into the  South and attack Seoul in a concentrated manner by using Scud  and Nodong-1 and -2 missiles.    In response, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will attack the  central area of North Korea, advancing infantry units, and  fighter planes by using their superior air fire power and  Mistral, Hawk, and Nike missiles and intercept incoming missiles  by using Patriot missiles.    This means that the defensive strategic concept which had  been effective up until the mid-seventies and in which the ROK  would launch a counterattack after abandoning Seoul has been  replaced by a new concept in which the ROK would "repel North  Korea north of Seoul."    At around this time, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson  of the 7th U.S. Fleet will be deployed to the East Sea [Sea of  Japan] and strike the enemy's rear area in a concentrated manner.    At that time, AWACS early-warning planes and antisubmarine  patrol planes (P-3C) will fly over the skies over the Korean  peninsula, conduct aerial surveillance not only over North  Korea, but also over areas of Russia and China, detect  infiltrating aircraft and submarines in advance, and instruct  the ground on shooting them down.    In the third stage, the armed forces will annihilate the  major combat forces of North Korea, break through the DMZ,  conduct large- scale landing operations, and advance northward.    At that time, the ROK and the United States will expand the  frontline toward the Chongchon River, north of Pyongyang.    However, in this strategic concept, the ROK and the United  States left the issue of whether they will advance toward the  Yalu River at this stage for further deliberations depending on  the situation.    No decision has been made on whether the 400,000 U.S. troops  which will be reinforced with troops from the U.S. mainland will  participate in the northward advance. The next stage is one of  isolation. The forces will completely isolate Pyongyang from  the rest of North Korea and establish a military rule, which  includes civilian controls [chumintongjedung kunsatongchirul  silsihanda].    The final, fifth stage will be a postwar phase. At this  stage, the ROK will take the initiative to achieve reunification  on the Korean peninsula.</p>

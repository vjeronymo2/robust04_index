			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Mart Laar said today during the  Riigikogu information hour that beginning in March of last year  Estonian border guards began partially controlling the aircraft  landing at and taking off from Amari Airfield, which is under  Russian military control. Laar stated that the export of goods  and illegal border crossings via Amari are no longer possible  because Russian servicemen must first obtain permission from the  Estonian Defense Ministry for flights. He rejected claims that  criminal forces are using Amari to export cars. According to  information available to Laar, five Russian military transport  planes have landed and taken off at Amari during the first  months of the year, having been first cleared by the Estonian  border guards.

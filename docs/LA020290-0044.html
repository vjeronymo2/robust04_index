			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OLIVIER FAREWELL IN 'WAR REQUIEM'  </P> <P> Great Britain entered World War I with such widespread naive optimism and  experienced such terrible losses on such a personal level that it's the ideal  conflict with which to express anti-war protest.  </P> <P> In 1962, Benjamin Britten composed an oratorio, based on the poetry of World  War I soldier Wilfred Owen, to commemorate the new Coventry Cathedral, which  had been bombed beyond restoration during World War II. "War Requiem" has now  become a remarkably evocative and powerful film in which England's premier  experimentalist, Derek Jarman, has created a flow of images involving tableaux  and intercut with archival material to accompany the soaring, majestic  oratorio.  </P> <P> ("War Requiem" launches the Monica 4-Plex's new Monica Premiere Showcase  policy, which means that from now on one of the Santa Monica theater's four  screens will be devoted exclusively to limited engagements of specialized  films.)  </P> <P> "War Requiem" opens with a World War I veteran (Laurence Olivier, in an elegiac  and most fitting screen farewell after six decades on screen) being wheeled in  his chair outside a vast, boarded-up Victorian hospital complex. As his nurse  pins a row of medals to his sweater, the old soldier, with an expression of  infinite sadness, commences remembering long-ago battles. In essence, we're  seeing the film -- and therefore, World War I -- through Lord Olivier's haunted  eyes. (At the very beginning of the picture, we hear on the sound track Olivier  reciting Owen's "Strange Meeting.")  </P> <P> What follows are meticulously re-created glimpses of life in a training camp,  in the trenches and in a field hospital, all punctuated with clips of actual  wartime footage. What emerges is a collective portrait of the British people at  their most solicitous, selfless and quietly heroic. Gradually, three principal  figures emerge: the dark-haired, mustached Poet -- i.e., Owen -- (Nathaniel  Parker), the Unknown Soldier (ginger-haired Owen Teale) representative of the  dead soldiers celebrated in Owen's "Anthem for Doomed Youth," and the Nurse  (Tilda Swinton).  </P> <P> Gradually, too, Christian rituals evolve in which both the Poet -- Owen was  killed at age 25 one week before Armistice -- and the Unknown Soldier are  equated with the sacrifice of Christ. Parker and Teale serve largely as icons  of stalwart Britishers, but it falls to Swinton, in some superb moments of  silent acting, to express such capitalized emotions as Grief and Desire.  </P> <P> One of Jarman's most inspired touches was to move forward to the present in  depicting death in battle via film clips. In another context, these clips might  well be unbearable, so unsparing are they, but here they are presented with a  sense of discretion and dignity that give full force to Jarman's protest  against war. "War Requiem" and its predecessor, "The Last of England," an  apocalyptic, surreal vision of Britain after the fall of government, reflect a  deep love of country and its people on the part of Jarman. They also are  evidence of a new maturity in a one-time enfant terrible who once was more  likely to drive you up the wall -- or up the aisle -- than to move you with his  commanding sense of the visual.  </P></p>

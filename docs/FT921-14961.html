			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Software theft cases settled out of court LAWSUITS alleging computer software theft brought against Mirror Group Newspapers and the London Borough of Greenwich by leading US software suppliers are being settled out of court. Greenwich council, the first UK local authority to be accused of software theft, said on Friday it had agreed to destroy copies of illegal software programs, buy replacements from dealers and compensate the software suppliers for the illegal copies and their legal costs. A similar statement is expected today regarding Mirror Group Newspapers, where investigators from the Business Software Alliance - representing software suppliers - found that 670 of 800 software programs in use were illegal copies. Neither the BSA nor Greenwich would disclose the value of damages to be paid in compensation. It is expected that MGN will pay a six-figure sum, the largest yet paid by a UK organisation. The BSA and other organisations representing personal computer software suppliers, including the Federation Against Software Theft (Fast), have been conducting a worldwide campaign against suspected software thieves. They have secured court orders to search premises and taken companies to court where forged software has been found. Greenwich, which was sued by US software companies Lotus Development Corporation and XTree, said the council's policy was to use legal software. The council said its Housing Directory had broken policy on unauthorised copying. 'We have taken prompt steps to rectify this situation.' Later today Apple Computer, a leading US personal computer manufacturer, is expected to announce that it has joined the BSA. Fast provides a software audit program free to companies anxious to ensure compliance with the law. Fast can be contacted on 0628 660377.</p>

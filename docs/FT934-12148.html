			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US blocks international fair tax plan EFFORTS to impose multilateral discipline on governments which unfairly tax foreign companies are in jeopardy following a US decision to opt out of that part of the Uruguay Round package. Negotiators said yesterday other countries in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation might have no choice but to follow the US lead, leaving multinational companies vulnerable to tax discrimination wherever they are based. The issue has become sensitive over the past year, following threats by the US administration to boost taxes on foreign companies operating in the US. This is based on allegations that foreign companies engineer comparative advantage against local rivals by manipulating their accounts between different national jurisdictions to minimise tax exposure in the US. The US decision to press for an opt-out for that part of the proposed Uruguay Round services agreement which guarantees that foreign companies are in general terms treated in the same way as local companies comes after months of haggling over clauses which protect national independence on tax policy. Consensus was reached last week, with the single exception of the US. A negotiator said that after opting out, the US treasury would be able to discriminate as it liked in tax policy without facing the danger of a challenge through Gatt's dispute settlement system. 'They say they would not abuse their freedom, but other countries have got reason to be nervous,' he said. Critics of the US say such an opt-out would be illegal in other contexts. For example, no government would be allowed to levy value added tax at a higher rate on foreign companies than on local companies. 'We knew the US had problems, but didn't expect them to take such a radical position,' an EC negotiator said. Gatt officials say the new draft clause does nothing to curb national autonomy to treat foreign and local companies differently, so long as differences are not arbitrary or protectionism in disguise. Discrimination would be legitimate if it were intended to ensure 'equitable or effective' collection of taxes, to safeguard the tax base, or pre-empt tax evasion.</p>

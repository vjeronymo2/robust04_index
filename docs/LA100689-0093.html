			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: ORCHID LOVERS AND THEIR FLOWERS WILL BLOOM AT BOTANIC GARDEN SHOW  AND SALE.  </P> <P> Orchids are lovely, even exotic, flowers, favored above most other blossoms for  luxurious corsages.  </P> <P> But cultivating and collecting them can be downright pathological, according to  some orchid fanciers.  </P> <P> "It's a disease, orchiditis. It's symptoms are a lack of control when it comes  to orchids," says Michol Colgan, president of the 120-member South Bay Orchid  Society. Those afflicted fill their yards and homes with hundreds of orchids;  they devote hours a week to watering and repotting their plants; some spend  thousands of dollars to build back-yard greenhouses that are soon bursting with  the lavender, brown or yellow flowers that can resemble stars or butterflies  and produce a congruence of petals that look like slippers or little dolls.  </P> <P> Florence Jacobsen says she's devoted to the nearly 700 cymbidium orchids  growing in her yard. But, she says, some of her friends don't call it devotion.  "They say I'm demented."  </P> <P> Why this allegiance to a not-too-pretty plant that sometimes doesn't even have  the courtesy to bloom? It's a combination of variety -- there are more than  30,000 species -- and the aura of luxury that orchids acquired centuries ago.  </P> <P> This Saturday and Sunday, orchid society members will try to demonstrate the  allure of their favorite plant at their ninth annual show and sale at the South  Coast Botanic Garden on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> About 2,000 orchids will be on view. Show Chairman Jim Weiss said anyone who  has owned an orchid plant for at least 60 days may bring it in for judging,  which will take place Saturday morning. Ribbons will be awarded based on plant  structure and the number, shape and color of flowers.  </P> <P> Videos shown every two hours will present the history and care of orchids, and  society members will be there to field questions. The first 500 women will  receive complimentary floral sprays.  </P> <P> Collectors say orchids are popular simply because nature has produced so many  varieties. Although their primary habitat is the tropics, Colgan said they  "grow up to altitudes of 5,000 feet, in cool climates, in the desert and the  jungle."  </P> <P> Some are hearty enough to grow outdoors, rain or shine, while others need the  pampering of a greenhouse. Many can be bought for a few dollars, while some  one-of-a-kind hybrids can fetch a price of $20,000.  </P> <P> But Weiss said all orchids make some demands on their owners: "They can't just  be stuck in the ground. The majority grow in pots and they have to be cared  for. It's simply watering, but not over-watering, proper fertilization and  providing the proper light."  </P> <P> And, he said, they may never bloom -- something that adds to the excitement of  seeing a plant flower for the first time.  </P> <P> Orchids became associated with wealth during the days of European exploration,  when explorers brought them to England from the tropics. The privileged built  greenhouses for the plants, said Weiss.  </P> <P> Clark Day Jr., a retired commercial orchid grower, said orchids became serious  business in England. One plant drew 5,000 pounds at auction in an era when a  pound was worth $5. "People would try to find out where they were obtained, but  the explorers would conceal the locales," he said. "Some species were lost for  100 years before they were rediscovered."  </P> <P> Even though no one has to be rich to own orchids these days, the mystique  lingers. "There's the exotic bit," said Robert Streeter, who has been raising  orchids for 35 years. "You're growing something that has a reputation of being  the ultimate, plus being a beautiful, beautiful flower."  </P> <P> Botanic garden foundation Executive Director Norma Cantafio said the orchid  show draws one of the garden's biggest crowds every year -- perhaps that's  because coastal Southern California is ideal orchid country.  </P> <P> Hardy cymbidiums, with their tall spikes that may carry up to 25 blooms, are  the local favorites.  </P> <P> Streeter said that even some plants that would demand a greenhouse elsewhere  thrive outdoors here because it's close to the beach and there is no frost.  "I've moved plants out of my greenhouse and they've done better outdoors," he  said.  </P> <P> Last year's show left little doubt about the South Bay's devotion to orchids.  Weiss said a Santa Ana condition sent temperatures to 105 degrees, but 1,700  people showed up anyway. "We hope it's cooler this year and that we have even  more people."

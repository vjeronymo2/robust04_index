			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roselena Nicolau and Celson Franco: "Minas </F> Gerais Natives Rule PT and PSDB in Presidential Race"    [Text] The PT [Workers Party] and the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party] are going into the election battle  headed by two natives of Minas Gerais: Ruy Falcao and Pimenta da  Veiga. They share a reputation for being intransigent. Falcao,  the PT's new president, has distinguished himself in the party  as a guardian of ideological purity. PSDB members in Minas  Gerais say that centralized decisionmaking is a shortcoming on  the part of Pimenta, who will take over as the PSDB's president  next week.  <H5>  Pimenta da Veiga: Back After 1990 Defeat </H5>   Belo Horizonte -- The PSDB's new president, attorney Joao  Pimenta da Veiga, Jr., whose election is expected to be ratified  at the party convention next Saturday, is a stubborn man. He has  a strong personality, does not follow advice, and always has the  last word. At 46 years of age, Pimenta da Veiga has collected  electoral successes in his political career, but the ballot box  has also brought him disappointment. After being defeated in the  Minas Gerais gubernatorial race in 1990, he abandoned everything  and went to Brasilia to practice law.    Pimenta da Veiga began his political career in the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. He inherited the  electoral prestige of his father, attorney Joao Pimenta da  Veiga, who was a deputy. He served three terms in the Chamber of  Deputies, being elected in 1978, 1982, and 1986. He was  appointed leader of the PMDB by Tancredo Neves in the second of  those elections and was retained in that post by former  President Jose Sarney.    In 1988, he left the PMDB to establish the PSDB and was  elected mayor of Belo Horizonte. As mayor, Pimenta da Veiga  achieved a level of popularity convincing him that he could  reach greater heights. He left the city in the hands of Deputy  Mayor Eduardo Azeredo and began campaigning as an unbeatable  candidate. His intransigence led him to make fatal mistakes.    The campaign's coordinators felt that Pimenta should pay  more  attention to TV programs. To do so, he would have to do less  traveling. But the candidate felt that visits to the  municipalities were more important. He almost came to blows with  the then president of the Minas Gerais PSDB and candidate for  the Senate, Carlos Mosconi, who felt mistreated.    Concerned about the political exploitation of Pimenta's  personal life, advisers counseled him to maintain the greatest  discretion in his amorous relationship with young Ana Paola  Frade (with whom he is now married and has two children), since  his separation from his first wife was very recent. Pimenta da  Veiga did not agree, and Ana, who was his girlfriend at the  time, participated actively in his campaign.    There was general surprise when Pimenta lost the election in  the first round to Helio Garcia. Defeated, he turned his back on  Minas Gerais politics. He went to Brasilia with Ana and began  practicing law in the higher courts, keeping only the decorative  post of vice president of the PSDB. Pimenta has said that he  will assume the presidency of the party against his will. He  would prefer to act behind the scenes on behalf of Fernando  Henrique Cardoso's candidacy by "helping in the coordination."  Pimenta has supported the PSDB's alliance with the PFL [Liberal  Front Party] from the start. According to him, coalitions are  essential if the next president is to be able to govern.  "Without a political base, any president will be isolated," he  said.  <H5>  Falcao: Disciplined and Inflexible Organizer </H5>   Brasilia -- Ruy Falcao, the son of a Bahia family, was born  in Minas Gerais and raised in Sao Paulo. He lacks the charisma  of his predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, but exhibits a  characteristic that is praised by "comrades" and opponents: he  is disciplined and a hard worker. Considered one of the toughest  members of the PT leadership, he assumed the presidency of the  party last Sunday after helping Lula put together a more  realistic and moderate government program than the extreme Left  wanted. "I will be the president not of a faction but of the  party," he said as he took office, thus sending a clear message  to those PT members who, along with him, make up the Hour of  Truth group.    As a member of the leftist organization VAR [Revolutionary  Armed Vanguard]-Palmares, Falcao was arrested by the  dictatorship in 1970. He spent three years in a military prison  on Pedras Blancas Island in the Guaiba River. He left jail in  1973 and resumed his career as a journalist. He contributed to  the alternative newspapers MOVIMENTO and EM TEMPO and worked for  the magazine NOVA and Tupi TV until 1977, when he went to work  for the magazine EXAME. He left that job in 1988 to devote  himself exclusively to the PT. Never since then has he entered  an indoor soccer court. "Now I lead a sedentary life," he says.    Falcao's sedentary life invariably begins at 0500. He sleeps  only four hours or a maximum of five hours a night. In fact, he  sleeps little, eats little, speaks little, and laughs little. He  also spends little. Called a miser, he says he is a man who  leads a simple life. His opponents view him as a negotiator who  is tough and ordinarily intransigent and radical. He says no:  "I'm not tough; I am a person with firm convictions," says  Falcao, who even considers himself a moderate. He is skillful.  "I know how to negotiate; I am a very reasonable coordinator."    Falcao may be both. Journalists who knew him back when he  was  competing to head the Sao Paulo union say that he would not  budge an inch from his positions while working fiercely to  defeat his opponents. His enemies called him "the sinister  dwarf." Falcao is slightly over 1.60 meters tall. Someone who  worked with him at EXAME says he is a friendly colleague in  everyday dealings.    He was one of the chief opponents of the PT deputies who  wanted to decide for themselves whether to participate in  constitutional revision. Although accused of having "no play in  his belt," Falcao showed at the convention that he can act  according to circumstances--in this case, the presidential  election.    Falcao, who is a state deputy in Sao Paulo, is going to run  for reelection: "As president-elect of the republic, Lula will  be legally prevented from reassuming the presidency of the PT,"  he jokes, but he is serious.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Business Law: Need to rethink Russian reform One year after the failed Moscow coup, western attitudes towards reform in Russia under President Boris Yeltsin are changing. At first, emphasis was placed on 'shock' economic reforms advocated by the International Monetary Fund and on the efficiency of Korean, Taiwanese and German economic reform models, as if these models were relevant. The need for massive western aid was justified by suggesting that the fate of democracy in Russia (and other former Communist bloc countries) would ultimately be determined on the economic front. The advocates of the IMF approach - rapid introduction of mass privatisation and liberalisation of the entire economy - believed that it was necessary to push through unpopular economic measures. The Russian dissenters - parliamentarians and the old-line Soviet industrial elite - said that the IMF's prescriptions were too simplistic. They pointed out that it took centuries to develop the western capitalist economies. And their research showed that there were strong non-market elements such as subsidies and protectionist tariff barriers involved in growth in Korea and Taiwan, for example. They also argued that successful western (and Asian) economies are mixed and pluralistic. There are large public sectors, unions, pressure groups and so on that do not yet exist in Russia. The elite's criticisms were, to a large extent, valid, and since spring this year they have succeeded in slowing down the reforms pressed on President Yeltsin by the IMF. Convertibility of the rouble has been deferred; the industrial elite has returned to positions of ministerial power and to the Russian central bank; energy price liberalisation has been postponed; and new credits have been approved for Russian industry - increasing the budget deficit and aggravating inflationary pressures. There is even talk in Moscow of a change of government before the end of September. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations and the IMF are now reconsidering their approach to Russia. Their reported consideration of increased direct financial aid from western governments fails to take into account the emerging view that the success of economic reform in Russia (and elsewhere in eastern Europe) may depend on constitutional and political reform. Many Russians have concluded that Russia's economic reforms (and those of the other CIS republics) cannot succeed without strong government. This means strong governments in each of the republics and, more importantly, a strong co-ordinating central government in Moscow. Former President Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to put together an almost US-style federalism was correct. Perestroika - intended to strengthen Soviet central authority through elimination of inefficient Communist party political control and the introduction of local autonomy - was and is the only right answer to the realities of the ex-Soviet Union. Recent efforts to prepare the Soviet auto industry for privatisation support a federal approach. There are tens of car and truck plants spread across a number of republics and organised in a mutually dependent system. A car or truck cannot be assembled in Moscow without parts from other plants. Privatisation is impossible as long as plant managers do not work together. Furthermore, the auto industry is simply too big to be privatised right away. Yet, there is a great deal of modern equipment, a large and expanding internal market and good prospects for increased exports. In the auto industry - as in others - central governmental assistance to maintain the output of the principal plants, credit to permit acquisition of important spare parts and transitional tariff protection are necessary. This needs to be co-ordinated from the centre. Russia cannot move forwards on the basis of economic guidance alone. Yet, until now, the G7 nations have turned over the whole of the Russian problem to the IMF. This has been a mistake. The IMF has no answer to the present situation in Russia. The G7 countries need to provide another kind of advice - to move towards a form of 'political conditionality' in the Russian situation. This would mean encouraging strong government as a prerequisite to financial and other assistance. The west should not operate competing embassies and offices in each of the republics of the CIS - accepting as a fait accompli the complete collapse of the Soviet Union as a political entity. On the contrary it should be pressing Russia and the other republics to study and adapt relevant political models - ranging from the Swiss cantonal system through the Canadian and EC confederations to the US federal model. Without something like the US constitution's commerce clause - establishing federal supremacy in matters involving interstate commercial relations - the ex-Soviet Union's economy will suffer badly. It is a single economy and must be treated as such by the political system. If a 'commerce clause' approach is not adopted, economic chaos, civil war and eventual intervention by the military may be the result. Therefore, at this stage in Russia's transition from communism, political and constitutional reform should receive a higher priority than it has to date. What are the implications of all this for the west? First, the impulse to react by seeking to increase direct economic aid should be resisted by the G7. The problem in Russia (and elsewhere in eastern Europe) is not money. Investments and foreign assistance would largely be wasted under current conditions. Moreover, there is a danger that the present Russian government is placing too much confidence in foreign economic counsel. If the results are a failure - as is likely without necessary constitutional and political change  -Russia will be disillusioned and bitter. Already Russian leaders such as Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi have expressed a desire to go it alone. Western governments need to listen to these voices. Second, as President Yeltsin enters a period of maximum danger - not unlike that which preceded Mr Gorbachev's downfall - the G7 leadership should not be reluctant to support the creation of a strong federal government in Moscow, even at the risk of further deviation from the IMF's usual nostrums. The west should begin to give advice on possible legal and constitutional reforms before it is too late. Such advice should not be given through the IMF. A new forum needs to be created. The G7 should encourage the Russians themselves to recruit a small multinational group of pragmatic political advisers to work with the Russian presidency, the Russian Supreme Soviet and the leadership of other ex-Soviet republics to bring forward new possibilities for creation of a federal constitutional and legal system in the former Soviet Union.

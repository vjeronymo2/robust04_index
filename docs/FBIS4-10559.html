			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chico Otavio: "New Committee Will Examine Cuban </F> Vaccine"]    [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Representatives of five of our  country's scientific institutions will meet in Salvador next  week to begin studying the possibility of using the Cuban  vaccine against meningitis B and C and in immunization  campaigns. The task force was appointed by the Ministry of  Health in February for the purpose of ending the controversy  surrounding the quality of the vaccine. "The scientists have  carte blanche to conduct all possible investigations and  determine the product's real rate of coverage," says Gerson  Penna, president of the National Epidemiology Center.    The committee, which the ministry calls a task force,  consists of representatives of Unicamp [Campinas State  University], Rio de Janeiro State University, the Federal  Universities of Bahia and Minas Gerais, and the Evandro Chagas  Institute. Institutions involved in the controversy over the  vaccine, among them the National School of Public Health of the  Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), which advocates its use, were  excluded from the group. "In this work, there is no room for  anyone defending an impassioned position," Gerson Penna  explained.    The Brazilian ban on imports of the Cuban vaccine was the  subject of a debate held at Fiocruz yesterday with Brazilian and  Cuban health authorities in attendance. Epidemiologist Eduardo  Costa accused the Ministry of Health of deliberately delaying  purchase of the vaccine until Brazilian researchers could  discover a similar one.</p>

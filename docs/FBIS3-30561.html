			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, 6 February (TANJUG) -- The cochairmen of  the peace conference on former Yugoslavia, David Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg, held talks with republic of Srpska [RS]  President Radovan Karadzic in Zvornik this evening. The talks  were also attended by RS Vice President Nikola Koljevic and the  RS Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik. After the talks, held  behind closed doors, Stoltenberg said that the talks were part  of continued peace efforts and "especially of the efforts to  pull Sarajevo out of the current war situation." Asked to give  more details about the talks, Stoltenberg stressed that "Bosnian  Serbs have agreed to a separate peace for Sarajevo."    Stoltenberg stressed that it "cannot be said that the event  in Sarajevo market yesterday is the only reason, but it is one  more reason for attempting to establish peace in the area." He  said he believed that the events in Sarajevo could affect the  course of the Geneva negotiations "in that they are an  indication of how necessary it is to establish peace."    In reference to the Serb side's readiness to help to find  those responsible for the plight of the civilians in the  Sarajevo market, Lord Owen stressed that it was necessary to  find the offenders but that he was, as he put it, skeptical  about it. "Despite, or rather because of it, I think it is  necessary to bring about peace in that part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a step toward total peace," Owen said. He  went on to add that "at this juncture we must not forget Mostar  and the victims there."    In Owen's view, an agreement on UN control of Sarajevo  "could  mean a great deal." "The acceptance of UN administration over  Sarajevo would be the first step toward peace," he said. Owen  stressed that he expected "all three sides to understand that we  have to make a resolute step toward peace" at forthcoming  negotiations in Geneva.    RS President Radovan Karadzic said that the talks were very  useful and stressed that this was "perhaps the final stage of an  agreement on peace in Sarajevo." Karadzic said that the Serb  side had hoped that "the pacification of Sarajevo would be a  part of the overall solution but that it was ready to take part  in negotiations on Sarajevo even before the final political  solution was reached." He said that the talks on Sarajevo  represented "a logical step in our constant efforts to improve  the situation in Sarajevo."    Karadzic said that the Serb side demanded "a very strict  investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo by a joint  commission" and went on to say that this was not the first time  that this had happened. Karadzic said that those "who planned  such tragedies expected too much from them" but that despite  everything peace talks must be resumed. Asked about the  pacification of Sarajevo, Karadzic said that "all this should be  discussed during the work on an acceptable solution for  Sarajevo."    "The best thing would be for the citizens of Sarajevo to get  peace and for Sarajevo to become an open city. All conditions  will be discussed during the negotiations," Karadzic explained.</p>

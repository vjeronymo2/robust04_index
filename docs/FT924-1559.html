			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Distribution side takes Seeboard to Pounds 9.2m SEEBOARD, the distributor for the south-east of England, yesterday produced one of the strongest results of the electricity season with a 53 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and a 14 per cent dividend increase. Sir Keith Stuart, the newly-appointed chairman, described the results as 'excellent,' but stressed that Seeboard's domestic customers paid the lowest electricity prices in England and Wales, according to the industry regulator. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.2m in the six months to September 30, up from Pounds 6m. This was equivalent to earnings per share of 5.1p (3.5p). The interim dividend is increased from 5p to 5.7p. The progress was achieved despite a 1.8 per cent fall in the number of electricity units sold. This was due to a sharp decrease in industrial demand, mainly in the paper and cement industries. Adjusted for the weather, though, there was underlying growth in overall demand. Turnover increased 6 per cent to Pounds 524m (Pounds 495m). Group operating profit totalled Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 6.8m). Distribution contributed Pounds 37.3m, but the supply business lost Pounds 29.2m, because of the front-loading of costs in the first half. This was better than last year, however, and the full-year result is expected to be in the black. Other businesses earned Pounds 500,000. The retailing business incurred a small loss in a tough market. The contracting business was in profit, and Southern Gas, the new gas joint venture, is expected to make a profit in its first year. The bottom line was also helped by further cost reductions. Over the six months 180 jobs have been shed, against a long-term target of more than 500. Tighter control over cash flow has also reduced gearing to zero. COMMENT The market was unexcited by the large increases. If anything, they fell slightly short of expectations. But the results showed that there is plenty of scope for improvement in costs and balance sheet management. Both these areas must deliver the goods if overall electricity demand remains slack and next year's tariff increases are slim. There is a regulatory risk attached to large earnings and dividend increases. But this seems small in the case of Seeboard, which has high dividend cover and has been careful to share its good fortune with its customers through its current Pounds 20m rebate. The shares gained 7p to 440p, ending with a yield of 5.9 per cent, at the low end of the sector range.</p>

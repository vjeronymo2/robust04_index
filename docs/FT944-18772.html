			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Lunch with the FT: A house-trained polecat and a gentleman - Lucy Kellaway enjoys an old-fashioned English meal in the company of the 'Chingford skinhead' When I told people I was having lunch with Lord Tebbit, some commiserated; others forecast a stimulating occasion with a clever and amusing guest. The former Tory party chairman and loyal keeper of the Thatcher faith is a man no one feels neutral about. He has been called the Chingford skinhead (he was MP for Chingford), a rottweiler, a semi house-trained polecat. He is also known as a politician with the rare ability to speak directly to the mass of the British electorate. He had chosen to meet at Rules, in Covent Garden, central London, a restaurant that serves soup with lumps of Stilton in it and Yorkshire pudding the size of your plate. I arrived early and was just reflecting that this was the perfect place for a jingoistic Briton, when a thin bespectacled man slipped into the seat beside me, quietly apologising for being a moment or two late. Small and modest, this was not the person I thought I had asked to lunch at all. Eyeing him as he studied the menu carefully, I asked if he was a foodie. 'Yes I am,' he said. End of conversation. He then commented on how much he liked the menu's headings, 'Furred game', and 'Feathered game'. When I recoiled he said that there was nothing wrong with 'Bugs Bunny in the pot', and claimed he was happy to 'shoot, pluck and clean'. The waitress, who seemed not to know him from Adam, appeared to take our orders. True to form, he chose the Stilton soup, but followed it with salmon in a fancy shellfish sauce and chose half a bottle of Australian chardonnay of the sort you might associate more with Islington than Essex. I told him that his secretary reckons he is wined and dined too much - Claridge's one day and the Savoy the next. 'Yes I do eat out quite a lot,' he said. Persisting, I asked if he enjoyed all this high living. 'I think I just enjoy my life anyway. That's the key to it.' This was getting desperate. Each word was separated from its neighbour, delivered in a quiet monotone. Indeed, the volume was so low that had we not been almost the only diners in the place - he had requested lunch at 12 - it would have been hard to make out what he was saying at all. He explained that the reason for the early hour was that on Tuesday afternoons he recorded a TV chat show for Sky television with Austin Mitchell, the former Labour MP. I asked if he was happier asking the questions than answering them. 'I don't know really, they are both jobs,' he replied. Which did he think he is better at? 'It depends on the circumstances.' I am sure Lord Tebbit did not mean to be unhelpful with these staccato answers. Unlike many politicians, he evidently feels no need to project himself as anything other than a regular bloke, neither does he believe in talking for the sake of it. We started to discuss television more generally, and for the first time the flesh and blood Lord Tebbit started to resemble the mythical one. He deplored the quality of modern drama and comedy, saying that nothing comes close to The Two Ronnies of 20 years ago. I mentioned the Monty Python repeats, and he looked sour. 'They were the beginning of a culture that says if you use four-letter words everyone is meant to fall around laughing.' He then started on television violence. 'Kids learn how to behave the same way as dogs. They imitate the other ones in the pack. The pack they see most of is television.' From here it was a small step to the woes of the British educational system. He told me a story about meeting a woman when he had been on holiday in Barbados a few years ago. She had grown up in Britain, but had returned to her home country because she did not want her children educated in an inner London primary school. With my child just due to start at such a school, I said that perhaps things were not as bad as all that. He grudgingly agreed that some progress had been made 'over the - unfortunately not - dead bodies of the educational establishment'. He laughed a little at his remark. I laughed a great deal. Whatever you think of the views, the rottweiler delivery is terrific. He started to talk with pride about his grandchildren, who, he said, were being brought up just as he brought up his children. This appeared to have involved a good deal of discipline. Does he believe that children should be hit when they misbehave? I asked the question, confident of his reply, and he did not disappoint me. 'Yes,' he said. 'Yes I do.' 'I remember the last time I hit my younger son. He was about 16 at the time. After I had hit him, he looked at me, picked me up like a baby and said, 'there, there daddy'. I realised I had lost that particular battle.' The waitress brought the food and he started to eat, slowly and carefully, leaving the vegetables to one side. I asked how he was enjoying his new life as a non-executive director, journalist and politician rolled into one. 'It is like a badly chosen Chinese meal,' he said. 'Quite tasty but seems to lack a central theme.' This was not the standard response from a former cabinet minister. Most pretend that life on the sidelines is fun, but Tebbit does not go in for such face-saving nonsense. 'I would rather be taking decisions and implementing them than be part of a consensus-forming mechanism,' he says flatly. 'But that was a different life.' His present political role - which consists of attacking the government on Europe, Ireland, crime and anything else that gets up his nose - is apparently not to his liking. 'Politics is a thing I've tried to give up many times,' he says. But he seems constitutionally incapable of taking that step. 'I feel angry when I see things happening that are quite clearly going to happen, particularly when I had warned they would happen. Then I comfort myself by thinking: I may feel that way, but what on earth does the former prime minister feel.' I asked if he and Lady Thatcher get together frequently for mutual hand-wringing sessions. Politely, he put me right. 'She's not a hand-wringer. She's more likely to be a neck wringer. I'd join her there.' He declined a pudding on the grounds that he likes his main meal with his wife at night, before they settle down and watch News at Ten. I had had my eye on the dessert, floating islands, but decide not to indulge on my own. 'I've saved your virtue,' he said, without irony. In his world, ladies have virtue and gentlemen should defend it. So far Tebbit had said little to justify his skinhead image. I asked how he felt about being described as a 'semi house-trained pole cat'. As I said the words he beamed with pleasure. His plain speaking, he said, had been helpful in getting his views across. 'It happens to be in my nature anyway.' I tried to extract more plain speaking by asking him about the progress of the new Tory party chairman. He declined to take up the invitation, preferring to attack his party's lack of direction. 'The government has too many issues on which it is facing in two ways at once. We have a very tough line on crime, but the prime minister personally intervenes to get two girls out of jail in Thailand on a drugs charge. Kids whose behaviour is thoroughly anti-social get rewarded with lovely holidays, whereas kids whose behaviour is good and decent don't get rewards at all. 'On Europe we lean two ways at once: we want to be more closely integrated with Europe, but do we want a two-speed Europe or not? Are we an interventionist government in industry or not? Where do we stand on the union of Northern Ireland?' He starts to reminisce about his old job as party chairman, and tells me that he was the 'destroyers' screen that protects the captain's ship from attack'. Everything is quite different now, he said, pointing out that that particular role does not exist. 'The prime minister is a very modest man, and I'm not sure if he regards himself as a captain of the ship in that way.' This did not sound like a compliment, neither was it softened by his insistence that he has 'a good deal of affection' for John Major. The greyness of today's political figures is part of a wider problem, he explained. 'Huge mountain ranges never disappear in volcanic explosions. They get ground down by glaciers and wind.' 'What?' I asked, querying this departure from plain talk into grand prose. 'The Commons is in the process of being eroded because its power is going away,' he went on. 'Power has gone to the executive. It has gone outside to market forces, and now is going to Brussels.' There followed a long, committed speech about the nature of federal power in the middle of which he mentioned 'an American with the unfortunate name of Clint Bolick'. I smirked; he said it was 'not ladylike' to laugh. He told me that he had not always been an anti-federalist. As a pilot in the 1950s he had more in common with his international fellow pilots than with folk at home. He told a story about a night he and the lads got drunk and how he planned to swap places with a Scandinavian pilot who looked the same and who had the same number of children of the same ages. He glanced at his watch and said he must go. Apropos of nothing, he laid into Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as he went. 'He's not a foreign office secretary but a senior foreign office official,' he said, and started ranting about people who live in houses with long front drives. 'Those who have long front drives tend to be out of touch,' he said standing up to leave. I would be intrigued to meet his Scandinavian double. If he is out there, perhaps he would agree to have lunch with the FT one day.</p>

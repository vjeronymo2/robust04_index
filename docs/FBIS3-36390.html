The officer told INTERFAX the stocks of residual fuel oil in  the republic's capital Petrozavodsk and in Medvezhyegorsk would  only last three days, those in Belomorsk and Segezh for two  days. Coal supplies in Petrozavodsk would run out in a week,  those in Medvezhyegorsk in four days, he said.    Karelia is unable to pay the firms providing it with fuel  and  has asked the federal government for help, the officer said. A  commission has been set up in the republic to redistribute the  remaining fuel to keep the central heating systems and larger  factories going.    According to some sources, the Karelian government was due  to  meet on Saturday to discuss emergency measures.    The temperature in the republic, which lies in northwestern  Russia, has these days been staying at between minus 18 and 20  degrees Centigrade.</p>

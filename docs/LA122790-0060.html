			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST  </P> <P> A woman was arrested Wednesday after police found explosives and bomb-making  equipment in her East San Diego home, authorities said.  </P> <P> Alicia Villarreal, 23, was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of  possessing a destructive device and on a variety of other charges, including  outstanding warrants, said Sgt. Fred England.  </P> <P> Her bail was set at $10,250.  </P> <P> Last week, police responded to a disturbance call at Villarreal's home in the  4000 block of 45th Street and came across information that led them to suspect  there "might be dynamite and automatic weapons there," England said.  </P> <P> Shortly before serving the search warrant at 12:20 a.m., police arrested Mark  David Gorence, 23, for carrying a small bomb in his backpack, England said.  Police linked Gorence to Villarreal's home, prompting them to draw up the  warrant, England said.  </P> <P> Gorence was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of possessing a  destructive device, England said.  </P> <P> During the search, police found a vial of liquid mercury and bomb-making  equipment, England said. Officers also found a sawed-off shotgun and a sword  that looked like a cane when sheathed.  </P></p>

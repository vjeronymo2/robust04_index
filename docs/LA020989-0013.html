			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHNEOUR ON ABORTION  </P> <P> In response to "Life Doesn't Begin, It Continues," by Elie Shneour, Op-Ed Page,  Jan. 29:  </P> <P> Shneour's column is replete with faulty argumentation. I want to say that I  also support a woman's choice to have an abortion in the first trimester, but  my reasons for my position are, I hope, more compelling than those offered by  Shneour.  </P> <P> Within his eight paragraphs, he makes three egregious mistakes.  </P> <P> First, he argues that since a spermatozoon and an egg are both living cells,  then there are millions of abortions for every ejaculation. But no one that I  know of is going to hold that a spermatozoon or an egg is the beginning of  human life. And hence a dead spermatozoon does not a human abortion make. The  spermatozoon and the egg are indeed necessary conditions for human life, but  only the fertilized egg is a sufficient condition. Or at least this could be  plausibly argued.  </P> <P> Second, he reasons by analogy that since we would not consider a person who  burns a blueprint of a house an arsonist, we should not consider the  destruction of an embryo as being tantamount to murder. He fails to add that an  embryo is not merely a blueprint; it is also a house under construction. And we  do consider a person who burns a house under construction an arsonist. This  analogy could very well be used by anti-abortionists.  </P> <P> Third, he writes that it is uncertain when or if an embryo becomes human, for  during its evolution it looks like a fish, a reptile, and a bird. If it be the  case that we are simply aborting fishes, reptiles, and birds, then of course no  humans are being killed. Is abortion perhaps an animal rights' issue? Should a  woman see a zoologist for the early months of pregnancy?  </P> <P> Abortion is a very serious issue. There are good minds, and good hearts, on  both sides. And the problem is much more complex than Elie Shneour thinks it  is. Much more complex.  </P> <P> CHRIS M. JACKSON  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

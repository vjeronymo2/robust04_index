			<p>BFN     [Text] The pressure on Chechnya by Russia can seriously  aggravate the situation in the North Caucasus and result in  widescale armed clashes, believes Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev. "The policy pursued by Russia has absolutely no  prospects and can lead to a global military confrontation  between Russia and the Caucasus which can finally develop into a  new Russian-Caucasian war," Dudayev declared in his interview  with Interfax.    As Dudayev asserts, young people from other North Caucasian  republic who are concerned over the worsening situation around  Chechnya are coming to Groznyy. In Dudayev's words, they  express their wish to serve in the armed forces of the Chechen  republic.    Being interviewed by Interfax the day before, Sergey  Filatov,  head of the president's administration, accused Dudayev, who has  repeatedly voiced sharp anti-Russian statements, of actual  disruption of the negotiating process between Moscow and  Groznyy. Having recognized that Dudayev possesses the real power  in Chechnya, Filatov expressed his hope that the Russian-Chechen  dialogue would be resumed in the near term.</p>

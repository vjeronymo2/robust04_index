Such certificates shall be obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. The Cooperating Sponsor shall forward any narrative chronology or other commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims and shall prepare such a narrative in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00.

To the extent possible, the independent surveyor should observe discharge of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the container van occurred and arrange for surveying the contents as soon as possible after opening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office of all reports and documents pertaining to the discharge of commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for incurred costs upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. CCC shall not reimburse a Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation is justified to the satisfaction of CCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless CCC determines that the use of competitive bids would not be practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of conflicts of interest or lack of demonstrated capability to properly carry out surveying responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ocean carrier loss and damage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Notwithstanding transfer of title to the Cooperating Sponsor, the CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and retain the proceeds of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss and damage, including loss and damage occurring between the time of transfer of title and loading aboard a vessel.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperating Sponsors need not file a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the loss is between $100 and $300 and the Cooperating Sponsors determine that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the claim. Cooperating Sponsors shall transmit to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office information and documentation on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, Cooperating Sponsors need not file or collect claims for loss of, or damage to, commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Amounts collected by Cooperating Sponsors on claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained by the Cooperating Sponsor.

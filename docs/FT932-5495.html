			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis Pounds 2.83m back in profit STAKIS, the hotels and casinos group, continued its recovery in the first half and achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m. That compared with a Pounds 3.39m loss previously, restated in accordance with the FRS 3 accounting standard. It has restored payment of an interim dividend with 0.45p for the six months to April 4. Earnings per share were 0.84p against losses of 1.24p. Mr David Michels, chief executive, said the Glasgow-based company's improved performance was due largely to its own efforts at improving margins and controlling costs, rather than to increased demand. 'We've not seen any green shoots at all in hotels, though turnover in casinos is up slightly,' he said. Stakis, which was subject to a rescue led by Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, in 1991 after ill-judged expansion, recently sold its nursing homes division for Pounds 50m to a syndicate led by Electra, making an extraordinary loss of Pounds 47.7m. It also raised Pounds 28m in a rights issue. It now concentrates on hotels and casinos. The hotels division improved its operating profit by 35 per cent to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 6m) thanks mainly to better margins and higher occupancy levels. Casinos' operating profits increased from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 5.4m, due to improved trading following the group's decision to keep the activity as a core business. The Scottish casinos maintained the previous year's performance, while those in England improved. Turnover on continuing operations was Pounds 64.8m in the 27-week period (Pounds 62.3m in 26 weeks). Sir Lewis Robertson said: 'It's a recovery in the sense that there is no illness now, and there is more to come as the economy improves. It's been a team effort working on fundamentally good material.' COMMENT The arcane debate about whether Stakis is off the sick list ought now to be concluded in the affirmative. It is a much smaller company than it was, but the two divisions which remain are sound and the management gives a comforting impression that, unlike its predecessor, it is not likely to do anything stupid. The fact that it made yesterday's profits without seeing any green shoots is austerely encouraging, and they reflected only a few weeks of the reduced interest payments that followed the disposal and rights issue. What happens next depends partly on how provincial hotels perform this summer. The market is looking for full-year profits of about Pounds 9m for a p/e of 17. But potential profits of Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m in 1993-94 are not yet fully in the share price unchanged yesterday at 55p.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Amnesty urged for crowded jails PRISON governors proposed an amnesty for some prisoners when they met Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, for the first time yesterday. A delegation from the Prison Governors Association, led by national chairman Mr Brendan O'Friel, governor of Risley and former governor of Strangeways, also suggested that low-security prisoners could be left in the community on bail after being sentenced and called up only when there were cells available for them. Mr O'Friel said: 'There is a limit to how far we can go before we reach a point where it would be dangerous to overcrowd further and we signalled to the home secretary that we are not far off that point.' The governors also voiced fears that the power to punish and control rule-breaking and violent prisoners had been reduced 'too fast and too far'. After the meeting Mr Howard said he had ordered a thorough review of prison discipline. The prison population has risen sharply this year by about 500 a month to 46,000. The prison system in England and Wales is nearing its certified capacity. Amnesties were used in the 1980s to ease overcrowding. Two thousand prisoners were released on one day in June 1983 and another 1,000 petty criminals freed on one day in August 1987. Retailers are spending about Pounds 400m on combating crime each year and losing about Pounds 175m in burglaries, preliminary findings of the British Retail Consortium show.</p>

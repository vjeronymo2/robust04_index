			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Scandinavians relieved as Austrians vote Yes Austria's unequivocal vote to join the European Union brought a big sigh of relief above all among the leaders of fellow EU applicants Finland, Norway and Sweden. All three Nordic governments face deep scepticism or, in the case of Norway, outright hostility to the proposal to accompany Austria into the union from January 1 next year. Signs last week that opposition to membership was mounting in Austria had raised fears that a No vote would further entrench opposition in the north. But there was also a hope last night that the wide margin of the Austrian Yes vote would give a long-awaited lift to Nordic EU supporters, who have struggled to impart any momentum so far to their campaigns for similar referendums which are to be held in Finland in October and in Sweden and Norway in November. Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade minister, said the outcome could help push Finnish voters towards the Yes campaign. 'This piece of news is very positive and I am very happy about it. . . I'm a believer in the so-called domino theory.' Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, said the Austrian result was an 'important signal' for Sweden's referendum. He said the outcome showed that the argument he had made strongly - that Sweden must be inside the EU to exert any influence over the future political and economic development of Europe - was decisive. He was able to say with genuine conviction that 'country after country' now sought to participate in European co-operation. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister facing a No campaign with well over 50 per cent support in the opinion polls, made much the same point. She also said Austrian entry to the EU strengthened the opportunity to build bridges between western and eastern Europe. The Norwegian No campaign has argued that the EU will shut out poorer former eastern bloc countries. The Austrian yes vote comes just before three important party congresses on the EU issue in Finland, Norway and Sweden next weekend. In Finland, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, must overcome deep concern about the effect of membership on the country's heavily-subsidised farmers when he seeks the formal backing of his rurally-based Centre party for joining the EU. It should also stiffen the ranks of his coalition government in a difficult parliamentary no-confidence vote due on Wednesday. The Austrian result will reinforce, too, the leaderships of Mrs Brundtland's Labour party and the Swedish opposition Social Democratic party as they hold special conferences to fix party policy on the EU issue. Both are expected to win party support despite heavy internal opposition.</p>

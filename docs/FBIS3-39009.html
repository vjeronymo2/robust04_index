			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "jj": "Sarajevo: The West Must Not Give Up"] </F>   [Text] If it were not an English term, the Serbs could  have invented it: brinkmanship, the war of nerves at the brink  of the abyss. Every time the West has threatened force of arms,  the Serbs have given in -- of course only as long as the threat  was hovering over their heads. As soon as it disappeared, the  concessions and the consideration for the international  community also disappeared.    The first part of this insight also proved true on Wednesday  [9 February]. While NATO met in Brussels and more and more  indications of an agreement about an armed ultimatum leaked to  the public, the Bosnian Serbs and their sponsors in Belgrade  showed virtual compliance in advance. Already today, Thursday,  they want to withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo. And  even more: The cleared Serbian positions and the still  remaining artillery positions of the FRY Government troops are  to be put under the supervision of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force]. In addition, UN troops would take up positions in the  surroundings to be able to detect the source of potential  bombardments.    Of course, the second part of the old insight will probably  also prove true: As soon as the international community returns  to business as usual, the Serbs, too, will resume their old  goal. The threat of attack must be upheld -- even more: The  artillery and mortars of the government's troops must also be  removed. Sarajevo has shed enough blood while the West has  tolerated the Serbian game. If the West now once again relaxes  its muscles, the next grenade attack will not be far off.</p>

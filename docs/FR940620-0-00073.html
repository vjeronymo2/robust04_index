			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. We will revise our LPTV application acceptance standards and adopt a ``substantially complete'' test. We agree with the overwhelming majority of commenters that the strict acceptance standard is no longer necessary in light of the reduced number of LPTV applications being filed with the Commission and in light of the improved quality of those applications. We are persuaded by the comments and by our processing experience to favor the substantially complete standard over a mid-level standard. We do not believe that the substantially complete standard will lead to a lessening of the overall quality of LPTV application submissions, nor significantly delay the authorization of LPTV service. Conversely, this standard will enable the authorization of more stations for each filing window. We believe that this modification of our application acceptance standards will greatly benefit LPTV applicants, many of whom have limited resources. We note that while we will give applicants an opportunity to cure defects in otherwise substantially complete applications, the corrected application must adhere to the Commission's rules and policies. For instance, if an amendment to an application eliminates predicted interference to one station but at the same time introduces interference to another station, the amended application will not be accepted and will be returned. Similarly, an application that is not substantially complete, that is not submitted with the proper fee, or that is not timely filed cannot be cured via subsequent amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Commission has developed a body of case law over the years governing broadcast applications that were subject to the substantially complete standard. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  From these decisions, certain criteria were established, even though each case turned on the particular facts involved. In the cases where applications failed the test, it was found that many sections of the applications were deficient to a significant degree or were omitted entirely, so as to lack sufficient information regarding the adequacy of the proposals vis-a-vis the public interest. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Amendments were allowed to correct errors, unless the application, judged as a whole, was ``so patently violative of the rules as to make its processing a futile gesture.'' <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See generally, Miami STV, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  42 RR 2d 1056 (Broadcast Bureau 1978);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> KALE, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  56 FCC 2d 1033 (1975);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Trustees of Dartmouth College <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 29 RR 2d 59 (1973);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Central Florida Enterprises, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  22 FCC 2d 260 (1970).

Characterizing the omissions as ``glaring'' and ``numerous,'' the Commission stated that they impaired its ability to evaluate the applicant's qualifications under the public interest standard, and that conclusion was compelled by the cumulative impact of each uncompleted section.

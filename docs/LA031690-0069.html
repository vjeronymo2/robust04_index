			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> 5 PLEAD GUILTY TO COCAINE CHARGES  </P> <P> Five defendants, including a Clovis chiropractor, have pleaded guilty in  federal court in an outgrowth of a Porterville drug case authorities called the  biggest in San Joaquin Valley history.  </P> <P> The chiropractor, Thomas Joe Henrique, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, as did  Kenneth Spray and Donald Lujan Castro. Guilty pleas were also entered by Scott  Murphy to conspiracy charges and by David Harp to charges of possession and  aiding and abetting distribution of heroin. The federal grand jury in Fresno  indicted the defendants last April on charges of conspiring to distribute 1,300  pounds of cocaine. Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl Faller said those indictments grew  out of the seizure in 1988, of 480 pounds of cocaine in a mini-storage  warehouse.  </P></p>

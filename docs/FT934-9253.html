			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Diabetes drug raises US group'sprospects A DRUG produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drug companies, was found to reduce deaths from diabetes by 50 per cent. The study by the New England Journal of Medicine has important implications for diabetics, the company and health authorities anxious to keep down costs. The drug, Capoten, should increasingly be used to halt progression of the diabetes, reducing the need for expensive kidney dialysis and transplantation. The results are significant for Bristol-Myers Squibb because they will help the New Jersey-based group generate additional revenues from its top-selling product with sales last year of more than Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn). Capoten's US and German patents and run out in other markets in 1997. Analysts warned, however, that the trial, the largest of its kind, confirmed what had already been suspected. Mr Viren Mehta, analyst at New York brokers Mehta &amp; Isaly, said: 'I'm not sure there will be a dramatic increase in Capoten's sales. Many doctors are already using the medicine and other drugs in its class of ace-inhibitors to treat diabetics. But the ace-inhibitors will clearly become the drug of choice.' There are about 15m diabetes sufferers in the US, and 1m in the UK. Dialysis costs as much as Pounds 25,000 per patient a year, while transplants cost about Pounds 15,000 and require between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 5,000 a year to maintain the patient. Bristol-Myers Squibb believes appropriate use of Capoten, also known as captopril, could save Dollars 2.5bn in the US over 10 years. The three-year study involved 409 diabetic patients using insulin in 30 centres in the US and Canada. Of the 202 patients on placebo, 42 died. Among the 207 on Capoten only 23 died. The trial was organised by the US National Institutes of Health. The drug appears to improve circulation in the kidney, improving its ability to process impurities in the blood. The trial showed Capoten nearly halved the risk of high blood levels of creatine which results in reduced kidney function. Dr Marc Pohl, one of the principal investigators, said: 'This study provides a mandate for Capoten to be used for diabetics whether or not they are using insulin.'</p>

On  Circumstances of the Resignation of Armenia's State Security  Chief"]    [Text] Armenian political quarters continue to discuss the  reasons that made President Levon Ter-Petrosyan fire Eduard  Simonyants, chief of the State National Security Directorate  (SNSD). His duties were, quite unexpectedly for everyone,  temporarily transferred to David Shakhnazaryan, the president's  ambassador at large.    The need for a structural adjustment of this far from simple  organization has come to a head. Interestingly enough, that has  been started precisely now that the former SNSD chief seemed to  have been ready to get ahead with leisurely evolutionary changes  and to direct his staffers to fulfill the tasks of intelligence  and counterintelligence in the interests of national security  rather than to crack down on dissidents.    The opposition press has put forward various versions trying  to account for this reshuffle. In particular, left-wing radical  publications argue that the fired SNSD chief not only was part  of the elite of the virtually ruling party, the Armenian  Pan-national Movement (APM), and was one of the team of the  president's chief national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan,  who resigned last summer. It is this team of the "internal"  intellectual opposition that the powers that be allegedly fear  most of all, and the president's moves come precisely from the  desire to get rid of the stranger.    There is, however, yet another interpretation of the events.  Last December, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan tried  unsuccessfully to get parliamentarians to amend the law "On the  State Bank." He based his demand on the fact that only by  including the head of the State Bank in the government was it  possible to curb inflation and carry through reforms.  Parliament staunchly beat back the premier's attack. A new  idea then arose: to put in the state bank director's chair  "their own man" -- Bagrat Asatryan, chairman of one of the  parliamentary commissions and member of the APM board. That,  however, was opposed by some APM functionaries and  parliamentarians who argued that Mr. Asatryan, being an  economist, was not still a banking expert, whereas Mr. Isaakyan,  who held this office, was a professional. Judging from some  signs, the negotiations were not long: The party bosses  demanded, in exchange for support in parliament, that the last  "stranger" head of one of the "power" agency in Armenia be  removed.    The recent session of the Armenian parliament all the same  confirmed Bagrat Asatryan in the post of director of the State  Bank of Armenia. APM deputies honored the terms of the deal,  and the executive branch had no other option but to keep its  part of the bargain.    The opposition believes that the one to gain from this  resignation is, first and foremost, the "omnipotent" Internal  Affairs Minister Vano Siradegyan, whose agency at last has real  chances to turn into a "superministry" and to exercise even  greater control over many spheres of the republic's internal  life.    Local political observers nevertheless hope that David  Shakhnazaryan, who has proven himself to be a serious political  figure, will be able to keep his agency out of politics, and  that Armenia is not threatened with "witch-hunting."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third major issue of concern involves whether EPA can accurately verify individual baselines of foreign refiners and effectively enforce standards for foreign produced gasoline based on such individual baselines. EPA was concerned that it would not be able to effectively exercise authority to inspect foreign facilities and require the production of records or samples, or to require accurate auditing of the compliance of foreign operations. This includes, for example, EPA's ability to ensure the accuracy of an individual foreign refiner baseline, EPA's ability to clearly identify the refinery of origin for gasoline imported into the U.S. (the ``tracking'' issue), and EPA's ability to easily access foreign records, samples, and facilities for inspections and other compliance measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to tracking refinery of origin, EPA believes it must be able to establish with certainty which baseline attaches to each specific batch of gasoline imported into the U.S. The distribution of foreign produced gasoline is significantly distinct from domestic distribution patterns. As described in the preamble to the final rule, see 59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994), the association of a refinery-specific baseline with the gasoline produced at a domestic refinery is relatively uncomplicated, because compliance is determined at the refinery level before fungible mixing in the gasoline distribution system. The source refinery for gasoline is clear before the gasoline leaves the refinery. In the case of all imported gasoline, on the other hand, the gasoline will be transported from the refinery to the U.S. port of entry prior to the point at which the imported gasoline would have to be associated with a foreign refinery-specific baseline. This stage of transportation from the foreign refinery to the U.S. port of entry could be by fungible means for any imported gasoline, with the consequence that fungible mixing could obscure the identity of the source refinery for any batch of imported gasoline. For a discussion of these and other enforcement and compliance related issues, see the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7787 (February 16, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, it is important to place the role of individual baselines in their proper context for the reformulated and conventional gasoline programs. For conventional gasoline, the individual baseline of a refiner or importer establishes the applicable emissions standard for the conventional gasoline they produce or import. On average, a refiner's or importer's conventional gasoline has to meet an emissions performance standard measured by the performance of their individual baseline. If the refiner or importer is assigned the statutory baseline instead of an individual baseline, then performance is measured against the statutory baseline. This performance standard applies on an annual basis starting with 1995. The statutory basis for these requirements are found in section 211(k)(8) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The individual baseline plays a much more limited rule in the reformulated gasoline program. For the first three years of that program, three specific fuel qualities are capped at the level of a refiner's or importer's individual baseline. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Starting January 1, 1998, a refiner or importer's individual baseline has no relevance in the reformulated gasoline program. This short term requirement is part of the standards adopted by EPA and commonly called the simple model. The refiner and importer specific caps on the three parameters were based on EPA's understanding of the directional impacts of these parameters on emissions, the lack of adequate data to fully model the emissions impacts of these three gasoline parameters when EPA proposed the simple model, and the lead time needed before requiring use of a subsequent, more complex emissions performance model adopted by EPA in the final rule. Further discussion of this may be found in the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7720 (February 16, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The three parameters are sulfur, olefins, and T&hyph;90 or E300. See &sect;80.41(h)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule's requirements for individual baselines resolves these various concerns in a straightforward manner. EPA is seeking comment on whether this proposal addresses all of the above concern, in a manner that achieves the environmental goals intended for reformulated gasoline while at the same time addressing the equity concerns that previously have been raised, by placing clear limits and conditions on the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners. These limits and conditions would be designed to address the issues described above_concerns about skewing of air quality benefits in a negative direction by providing options in establishing individual baselines, concerns about the technical limits of the refinery modeling used to establish baselines, and finally concerns over the Agency's ability to adequately verify individual baselines for foreign refiners and adequately ensure compliance by imported gasoline with standards based on individual baselines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

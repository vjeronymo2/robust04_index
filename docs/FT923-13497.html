			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook plans cash repayment Profits of Etonbrook Properties amounted to Pounds 182,000 pre-tax for the year to March 31 after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 400,000 for property write-downs. The previous year's profits totalled Pounds 1.63m and included a development profit in excess of Pounds 2.5m and an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.45m. Earnings worked through at 1.3p (34.2p) and the dividend is a same-again 2.75p. With a view to reducing the discount between the year-end net asset value per share of 117p (118p) and the current 68p share price the directors are proposing a capital reorganisation in order to pay ordinary shareholders 25p cash per share. This will be achieved via the return of surplus proceeds from property sales. They are also proposing to repay the redeemable preference shares which is a pre-requisite of any capital repayment or payment of an ordinary dividend. Both proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting next month. In addition, the directors have formulated a strategy for the future development of the company which they say 'could include utilising Etonbrook's stock exchange listing by merging with a trading company so as to achieve a higher share rating'. Notice has been received from Multitrust, a 10.05 per cent shareholder in Etonbrook, that it intends to propose at the annual meeting resolutions for the appointment of Mr A. Perloff and Mr M. Block as directors and for the removal of Mr J. Harris and Mr W. Moss as directors.</p>

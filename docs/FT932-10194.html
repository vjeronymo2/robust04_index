			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Eurobonds: Brazilians go for funds at below domestic rates BRAZILIAN banks and companies are flocking to the Eurobond market, eager to take advantage of the relatively attractive interest rates at which they can borrow. So far this year, 22 Brazilian banks and companies have issued Eurobonds, raising more than Dollars 1.4bn. In a rush to take advantage of what may be a short-lived opportunity, many more issues are planned, provoking fears among some analysts that a new debt bubble is being created. Given that real interest rates fluctuate between 20 and 40 per cent per annum in Brazil, the attraction of the Eurobond market to Brazilian borrowers is understandable. Even though the Brazilians are paying the highest interest rates in the Eurobond market - with yield spreads at around 500 to 600 basis points over the relevant US Treasury bond - at least they are able to raise funds at well below domestic interest rates. For investors, it is a rare opportunity to earn 11 to 14 per cent per annum at a time when US interest rates are at an historic low. When Brazil returned to the international capital markets two years ago with an issue by Petrobras, the paper was soaked up mostly by holders of Latin American flight capital who were familiar with the companies and were looking for a return above that being earned on their Swiss bank accounts. Today, many of the buyers of Brazilian Eurobonds are institutional investors, devoting a small part of their portfolio to high-risk, high-return instruments. 'Increasingly we are seeing pension funds and insurance companies getting in on the act', says Mr Saulo Blauth, general manager of the international department of Banco do Brasil. Ironically, Brazil's success in establishing itself on the Euromarkets is directly linked to its failure to implement economic reform which has resulted in higher risks and hence higher return compared with other Latin American paper. For this, the Brazilians are paying a high price. During the first spate of issues in 1991-92, yield spreads fell from 700 basis points over US Treasury bonds to 300 basis points. However, the Collorgate scandal and impeachment of President Fernando Collor in the second half of last year - combined with general concern among international investors about the large number of issues being prepared by Latin American names - shook the market and ultimately brought new issues to a halt. This year, companies have been paying yield spreads of 700 basis points on bonds which generally carry a 2 1/2 -year maturity, although Banco do Brasil recently placed a Dollars 100m, five-year deal at a yield spread of around 540 basis points. According to Mr Blauth, 'good companies are starting to get a better spread. Through aggressive selling we got 490 basis points over the US Treasury for Petrobras in March, but small companies are still paying (yield spreads of) 700 to 800 basis points.' He adds: 'For top-notch companies like CVRD (the state mining company), it is absurd that they should be paying 400 to 500 basis points over the US Treasury, but for the company this is still very attractive compared with borrowing in Brazil.' Telebras, the telecommunications group, has bonds trading in the secondary market at around 460 to 480 basis points over Treasuries. Although spreads on Telebras bonds fell as low as 365 basis points last May, they subsequently widened again to over 500 basis points in the autumn before falling back to their current levels. Merrill Lynch is expected to launch a new five-year issue for the group soon, and the market will be watching closely to see where the launch spread is set. Unlike the first spate of issues, which were mostly by well-known Brazilian companies, the majority of recent issuers have been banks who can make hefty profits from on-lending the money to domestic customers who do not have the name or internal resources to launch Eurobond issues themselves. 'The main attraction for the banks is that they can borrow dollars at, say, 12 per cent, and then lend it on at 13 to 15 per cent,' according to one London-based Latin American analyst. Aside from public offers, there have also been some private placements, particularly by Brazilian subsidiaries of multinationals. Shell recently placed Dollars 200m in export notes, and Alcoa and IBM did export securitisation operations for Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m respectively. Mr Jose Luis Miranda, president of Banco InterAtlantico, comments: 'This may be good for the microeconomy, but on a macrolevel it is terrible. If I was governor of the central bank I would stop it.' He points out the central bank is having to pay 20 per cent annual interest on the cruzeiros it issues while receiving only 3 per cent on the dollars it receives, thus provoking mounting domestic debt. The risk of lending to such an unstable economy may be less than the 30 per cent monthly inflation rate suggests. Brazil has many world-class companies and its foreign exchange reserves are at an historic high of Dollars 23bn, making the chances of default minimal. Mr Georg Lipsztein, a director of Banco Nacional which has issued Dollars 200m in Eurobonds, says: 'Overseas investors know very well that with Brazil's level of reserves and top class companies their investment is sound. They are simply cashing in on the risk premium of Brazil.' Some analysts fear a problem may arise with lesser-known private companies if demand does not keep pace with expansion of productive capacity financed through Eurobonds. But Mr Miranda believes this is unlikely, pointing out 'most of this money is going to improve debt profile not for productive investments'. But the greatest risk lies with the mercurial character of President Itamar Franco and his dislike of financial markets. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the country's economic situation will improve. In the meantime there are more issues coming up including Banco Mercantil, Banco Itamaraty, Villares and Banespa. Mr Blauth says 'I think there is still space for a lot of issues but we need to take advantage of this window of opportunity because we don't know how long it will last.'</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOTH SIDES CLAIM WEST BANK VICTORY AS BARRICADES FALL  </P> <P> The army took down the barricades around this Palestinian town today, ending 42  days of seizing cars, furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott.  Jubilant residents took to the streets to shout victory.  </P> <P> But as hundreds of townspeople waved "V" signs and sang, military authorities  said they had succeeded in breaking the revolt, seizing the equivalent of more  than $1.5 million to make up for unpaid taxes.  </P> <P> "We are always collecting taxes. We have always collected taxes. We are the  authorities," said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military  government.  </P> <P> Hanan Banura, a 25-year-old mother of two whose husband is in jail for refusing  to pay taxes, said the town's defiance strengthened the 22-month-old  Palestinian uprising against occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "We won something here," she said. "We did what we wanted to do, not what they  wanted."  </P> <P> The bulldozers that pushed away the earthen mound blocking off the Christian  Arab town of 10,000 people ended Beit Sahur's unlikely role as a symbol of the  revolt against occupation.  </P></p>

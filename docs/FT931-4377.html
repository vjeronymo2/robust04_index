			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Lacklustre in the lucky country: Australia's low-key election campaign belies its importance to continued structural reform Australia's 11.3m voters go to the polls on Saturday facing an uninspiring choice between a Labor government that looks destined to lose and a conservative opposition that has failed to show that it deserves to win. Snug in their taxpayer-funded air force jets, the party leaders have spent nearly five weeks criss-crossing the continent's great brown spaces, frantically quarrying middle Australia for support. They might as well have stayed at home. Voting is compulsory - on pain of prosecution - but all the evidence is that, in Lord Whitelaw's famous phrase, the politicians have been going around the country stirring up apathy. Battered by slow economic growth and high unemployment, the electorate is sullen and suspicious. It is hard to find anyone outside the party machines who actively supports either Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, or Mr John Hewson, leader of the opposition Liberal-National party coalition. Only party officials believe Mr Keating's frequent claims that this is Australia's most important election ever. To most people it is, as The Age newspaper put it, merely the most important election since the last one. Much of the cynicism reflects the impact of the worst recession in 60 years, which has raised the total number of unemployed to more than 1m and raised the unemployment rate to 11 per cent. Beggars have appeared in the streets of Sydney and Melbourne - only a fraction of the numbers seen in London or New York, but still a visible reminder that the lucky country can no longer take the good life for granted. The election ought to provide an opportunity for the opposition to take the government to task over the recession. But it is failing to do so, because the campaign has been hijacked by a government attack on one element of the opposition's programme - the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), similar to European value-added tax. Labor's strategy has diverted attention from the recession to an interminable debate about the effect of the proposed GST on specific consumer goods and industries. The best part of two days, for example, was devoted to a row about the likely effects of the tax changes on the price of cakes in bakers' shops. (The answer depends on the kind of cake and whether the paper bag is included in the calculation.) The irony is that Australians will be deciding a serious issue on polling day, even if it is not being put to them openly. The question is simple: are voters still committed to radical structural economic change, or do they want a pause to catch their breath, as some Labor ministers have suggested? In a normal election, Labor would be trumpeting its record as the most successful reforming government in Australian history. Three times since 1983 Labor has won re-election by reminding the electorate that it was Mr Keating and Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, who began the job of dismantling the web of protection and regulation which had isolated Australia from the world economy for nearly 90 years. Between 1983 and 1990, Labor floated the currency, deregulated the financial system, reduced subsidies to industry and began the process of tariff reduction. It has also partly decentralised the labour market by encouraging a limited move from national wage negotiations to company-level bargaining, started privatising government businesses, encouraged greater Asian immigration, and switched the focus of trade and diplomatic efforts from Europe to Asia. But perhaps because this is not a normal election Labor's principal concern has been to avoid discussing its record. The party fears attracting attention to Mr Keating's mishandling of monetary policy between 1988 and 1991, which pushed the economy into recession. On the few occasions when the prime minister has been cornered on the economy, he has responded bluntly that Australia has emerged from the recession with the developed world's lowest inflation rate, at 0.3 per cent, and the strongest growth in gross domestic product - forecast by the Treasury at 2.4 per cent for the current financial year. Only once has the opposition come near to forcing him to admit that the Treasury's medium-term growth forecasts would mean an increase in unemployment over the next three years. With the exception of sugar tariffs, which have been frozen to protect growers in marginal east-coast seats, the government has resisted the temptation to court popularity by reversing or relaxing the reforms which have already been achieved. Mr Keating could probably win votes in Melbourne and Adelaide by slowing the reduction of tariff protection for the automotive and textile industries. He has not done so, in spite of losing a Melbourne by-election last year to an independent candidate who espoused a return to protectionism. But the government has produced no plans for further reforms, leaving the impression that it has exhausted its reforming zeal. A re-elected Labor government would probably privatise the remaining government holdings in banking and aviation, continue its pursuit of greater efficiency in service industries such as transport and the docks, and tinker further with the country's wage-bargaining system. But the campaign rhetoric suggests that the emphasis would shift back to Labor's traditional concerns with social justice and national identity, including Mr Keating's vague plans to remove Queen Elizabeth as head of state. Mr Hewson, by contrast, has gambled that the electorate is willing to accept a further dose of radical reform, which the coalition has set out in detail in its pugnaciously titled Fightback programme. Fightback is a free-market plan which aims to cut public spending sharply and increase the role of markets in almost every section of the economy. Tariff reform would be speeded up, the centralised wage system would be abolished, and there would be a move to greater reliance on private provision of social services such as health and education. The GST would provide funds for significant cuts in personal income taxes and the abolition of half a dozen indirect taxes, including payroll tax and wholesale sales tax. The Liberal-National coalition claims that the programme would cut business costs, create 2m jobs by the end of the decade, and increase the savings rate, which would help reduce Australia's high net foreign debt. Mr Hewson has performed well during the campaign, surprising observers who expected him to be crushed by the more aggressive and experienced prime minister. But the coalition has found it hard to counter the government's attack on the GST. In his frequent appearances on radio talk shows, Mr Hewson tries in vain to discuss unemployment, industrial relations or the beneficial impact of the GST on exports. But callers want an answer to the same question: how will the GST affect me? Often, the opposition leader is unable to answer. The odds remain against Labor, which has been steadily losing ground since 1983, and would lose office on a swing to the conservatives of just 0.9 per cent. That is less than the swing against the government in every election since 1966. Labor must also overcome a strong feeling that the time has arrived for a change of federal government, following the recent defeat of Labor administrations in three of the six states. But the GST debate has improved the government's standing since the beginning of the campaign, when it trailed the coalition by 6 to 12 percentage points in the opinion polls. The latest polls, published earlier this week, put the conservatives only 5 points or less ahead. The coalition is likely to get a boost today when official statistics are expected to show that the unemployment rate rose again in February. Nevertheless, it has lost the battle to explain its programme, and its failure is likely to translate into lost votes. Barring a surge to the conservatives in the last few days, the most likely outcome is a narrow coalition majority. But the opposition's inability to get its message across could yet hand Mr Keating Australia's biggest upset victory since the war.</p>

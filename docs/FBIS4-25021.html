			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--The Chinese authorities  wrapped an all-embracing security blanket around Beijing on  Friday [3 June] to avert any public incident on the eve of the  fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In a  clampdown unprecedented since martial law was imposed in 1989,  the government flooded the capital with People's Armed Police  (PAP) and plainclothes personnel, interrupted satellite  television broadcasts and prohibited even the most  innocuous-sounding gatherings.    Police roadblocks have been thrown up around the university  area in the northwest of Beijing, preventing foreigners from  approaching Beijing University -- one of the cradles of the 1989  pro-democracy movement that was brutally suppressed by Chinese  troops on June 4. The main entrance to Qinghua University was  guarded by about a dozen uniformed security personnel,  rigorously checking student identifications.    On Tiananmen Square itself, hundreds of plainclothes police  -- easily recognisable by their dark glasses and two-way radios  wrapped in copies of the People's Daily -- shadowed all  foreigners and quickly broke up any gathering of more than five  people. The square's Monument to the People's Heroes -- one of  the focal points of the 1989 demonstrations -- was roped off and  one Chinese who complained that he was not allowed to climb the  monument's steps was quickly moved on.    Three journalists from the US television network CBS, who  shot some film on the square Friday morning were detained by  police and questioned for two hours. All their videotape was  confiscated, one of the journalists said, adding that the police  had accused them of filming without authorisation and shooting  footage of the heavy security presence.    "I have never seen the security so tight for a Tiananmen  anniversary," a Western diplomat said. "It only needs troops on  the street and it would be like martial law in 1989," he said,  adding that widespread discontent over inflation and corruption  and a marked increase in dissident activity at the beginning of  the year had fueled the authorities' anxiety.    While the normal complement of Chinese sight-seers and  kite-flyers were in evidence on Tiananmen Square, others were  clearly intimidated by the police presence. "We haven't  received any order not to go to the square this evening, but I  still won't go," said one Beijing worker.    With the country's leading activists either in prison or  exiled to the provinces and abroad, the only open sign of  dissent was provided by university professor Ding Zilin who  began a two-day hunger strike Thursday to protest against the  heavy police surveillance of her home. Ding and her husband  Jiang Peikun began their hunger strike at 6:25 p.m., the time of  the birth of their son Jiang Jielun, who was shot dead by  Chinese troops on June 4, 1989.    Also Thursday, the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB)  ordered all the capital's major hotels to pull the plug on the  US Cable News Network (CNN) until further notice. "The PSB  declined to give any reason for their decision, but obviously  it's because of June 4," said the public relations manager at a  joint-venture hotel. CNN reception in the foreigners' compounds  housing Beijing-based diplomats and journalists was repeatedly  interrupted Friday whenever a China report was aired.    Under a PSB directive issued last week, any group wishing to  hold a meeting of more than 20 people in a Beijing hotel must  first get police permission. At least two business meetings in  the Kempinski Hotel -- a Sino-German-South Korean joint venture  -- had to be called off last week after failing to get approval  from the PSB.    Newspaper listings showed a marked lack of cultural events  on  what is normally a socially active Friday night and at least one  bar popular with foreigners and Chinese was pressured into  closing for the evening. A planned showing of the 1993 Cannes  Palme D'Or-winning Chinese film "Farewell to My Concubine" had  to be cancelled because of a "power failure" -- the same reason  given for the cancellation of a leaving party for a US  journalist last weekend.</p>

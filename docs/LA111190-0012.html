			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P>  1/2 Jasmine Guy, "Jasmine Guy," Warner Bros. While the "Different World"  star's debut album has its good points, it sounds as if it was recorded by  someone who won't need to depend on record sales for her success.  </P> <P> It has one exceptional track: "Try Me," an unflinching bit of funk produced by  Full Force. There's not an abundance of memorable songs here, but one that  qualifies is "Everybody Knows My Name," a Guy co-composition in which she  emphatically declares, "To be my man / You got to understand / I'm in demand."  A little attitude is acceptable, but a few more songs of the caliber of "Try  Me" would have been a lot more welcome. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

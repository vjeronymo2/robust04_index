			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POOL TOYS ENDANGER CHILDREN, EXPERTS SAY;  </P> <P> WATER SAFETY: INFLATABLE DEVICES, OFTEN SHAPED LIKE CARTOON CHARACTERS, CARRY  DROWNING RISK. MANY PUBLIC POOLS BAN THEM.  </P> <P> From all appearances, the shallow waters of the toddler wading pool posed  little danger to Tina Cocco, a boisterous 3-year-old. Seated securely inside a  brightly colored, puppy dog-shaped float toy she called "Snoopy," the  dark-haired child happily splashed around the pool under the watchful eyes of  her mother and a baby-sitter.  </P> <P> But in a matter of seconds, as the women lounged in the sun at the Nellie Gail  Ranch Swim Club in Laguna Hills, came near-disaster. Without warning, the  plastic inflatable raft overturned, trapping Tina's head and upper body  underwater as her legs kicked the air, entangling themselves in the leg holes  of the suddenly menacing toy.  </P> <P> Jill Cocco moved quickly and pulled her frightened, yet safe, daughter from the  water. Although the incident was but a momentary scare, experts say it points  to the dangers of children being left unsupervised in pools with inflatable  toys not designed to act as life preservers.  </P> <P> Last year, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission said 1,954 people,  including an estimated 600 children under the age of 14, were injured in  accidents involving flotation toys used in pools. Of those, about 100 were  hospitalized. And although the federal agency does not track deaths associated  with the toys, physicians say that some patients hospitalized in these cases  often suffer permanent brain damage, or die.  </P> <P> In Southern California, where a high percentage of backyard pools help make  drowning the No. 1 cause of death at home for young children, many communities  have banned flotation devices from public pools.  </P> <P> But lifeguards and other experts say that in many cases, the word simply hasn't  gotten out to parents that the flotation toys so popular with children can be  hazardous if used as a substitute for life preservers.  </P> <P> "They are very dangerous," said Sally Schneider, aquatics coordinator for the  American Red Cross in Long Beach. "Floating toys are the last thing you should  put your child in to play in the water."  </P> <P> Critics of the flotation devices charge that the colorful, often animal-shaped  toys can easily deflate while in the water and have an alarming tendency to tip  over. Toy manufacturers point out that their products are toys, not life  jackets, and note that all such inflatable toys carrying warning labels on  their packaging boxes.  </P> <P> Still, critics worry that too many parents fail to read the warning labels in  their rush to enjoy their backyard pools; they assume that because the toys  float and often are designed to fit a small child's body, they can be used as  life preservers.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, water-safety officials say that all too often the child  who uses the toys cannot swim.  </P> <P> "That's the real danger," said Milton Freeman, national YMCA aquatics director  based in Atlanta. "These toys give a sense of false security. Parents have a  tendency to strap them in and leave for a minute, and that's all it takes."  </P> <P> Toy makers insist they have gone to great lengths to warn parents that the  items are toys, not constructed to keep a child afloat, and are no substitute  for adult supervision.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine telling anyone that these toys are in any way baby-sitters,"  said Dave Fisher, director of product design at Intex Recreation Corp., a Long  Beach-based company with manufacturing plants in Taiwan and Singapore. "I don't  understand how people can go off to answer the phone and leave their kids in  the pool."  </P> <P> Intex is acknowledged by competitors as one of the leading flotation toy  manufacturers on the West Coast. Fisher said sales of the firm's line of  inflatable water toys reached $100 million last year.  </P> <P> "Safety is something we think about every day," he said. "We've never tipped  one over in all the hundreds of times we've tested these toys. But there are  some people who are going to misuse a product no matter how it's made."  </P> <P> The potential danger has been addressed by the Philadelphia-based American  Society for Testing and Materials, a nonprofit group that provides product  information. The organization has issued standards for flotation toys and  recommends warning labels on packaging. Most firms comply with the voluntary  standards, but experts worry that the general public may not be aware of the  potential problems.  </P> <P> "I've been waiting to talk" about the issue for years, said Cathy Ferguson  Brennan, a former Olympic swim champion who now supervises the swimming program  at the Nellie Gail Ranch pool.  </P> <P> Brennan, who also helps produce water-safety videos for the American Red Cross,  said she has been warning of the dangers of the toys "but nobody wants to  listen. I have spent my lifetime around kids and I have seen the attractive  nuisance these toys represent."  </P> <P> About 30 feet from the wading pool where Tina Cocco tipped over, Brennan  re-created the accident with the same model of inflatable toy used by the  3-year-old to illustrate how easily it could happen.  </P> <P> Placing Charlotte Martin, a 2-year-old of similar size to Tina, into a  bright-green floating toy shaped like a frog, Brennan stood waist-deep in a  pool next to the toy and asked the child to climb out.  </P> <P> Grunting determinedly, the slim, blonde girl leaned forward and managed to pull  most of her body out of the bobbing, plastic toy before it capsized.  </P> <P> With most of her body underwater, Charlotte tried to free herself but her legs  became tangled in the leg holes, momentarily trapping the youngster before  Brennan pulled her out of the water.  </P> <P> "A non-swimmer would have panicked and made it difficult to pull her out,"  Brennan said. "Left alone, the child would intake water and drowning would come  quickly and silently. Underwater, nobody can hear them yelling or screaming."  </P> <P> The demonstration, she said, showed that parents "should beware of flotation  devices. The pool should be a fun place for a child, but only under close  supervision."  </P> <P> Brennan and other water-safety experts worry because of the rash of drownings,  and near-drownings, involving children during the summer months.  </P> <P> In California alone, a UC Davis study released in March shows that children  under the age of 4 make up about 75% of the pool drownings statewide. Although  statistics do not indicate how many deaths are linked to the toys, national  drowning experts say accidents involving inflatables may be grossly  underreported.  </P> <P> Emergency response crews are too busy to notice anything besides the job at  hand and parents "are in such a state of trauma, exactly how it happened is not  of great concern to them," said Dollie Brill, president of the National  Drowning Prevention Network in Ft. Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> "There is no government agency that deals with it, and reporting of this kind  of accident is extremely limited," Brill said. "It's a hidden problem that  critically needs some attention."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County, which does not separate pool deaths from others, reported  120 drownings in 1989. Billie Weiss, a county epidemiologist, estimates that  80% of all water deaths in the county occur in a private pool.  </P> <P> "Drowning in a pool is the No. 1 cause of death to children under 5 in Los  Angeles County," she said.  </P> <P> In Orange County, which averages 12 to 14 water deaths each year for all ages,  five children under the age of 5 have drowned in local pools or hot tubs this  year.  </P> <P> Dr. Ralph Rucker, director of the pediatric pulmonary section of Children's  Hospital of Orange County, said he also is concerned about the relationship  between drownings and flotation devices.  </P> <P> "I'm extremely frustrated because when parents put toys in the pool for their  2-year-old, they make the pool a fun, loving place to be," he said. "But the  danger to children there is so severe, you've got to look at it like a knife or  a whirling fan. Pools are a lethal luxury in the back yard."  </P> <P> He added that many flotation devices are not designed for very young children.  </P> <P> "What they don't take into account is that a young child's head is very heavy  in proportion to the rest of its body," he said. "If you put small children in  one of those things, it is likely to tip over."  </P> <P> Lee Baxter, western regional director for the Consumer Product Safety  Commission in San Francisco, said flotation toys "are definitely not a good  idea for a young child who can't swim. The only device I'd be comfortable with  is one certified by the U.S. Coast Guard."  </P> <P> The agency's official policy on water toys is that consumers should use them  "with extreme care and caution," said Rosario Quintanilla, public affairs  officer for the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> After the Cocco family's experience, Tina's nanny, who declined to be  identified, said the youngster's "Snoopy" water toy was "cut into little pieces  and thrown away."  </P> <P> In recalling the incident, Jill Cocco said she was lucky that she had been  watching her daughter as she played in the pool.  </P> <P> "At night, I can still see it happen," she said. "I can close my eyes and still  see it unfold in front of me. Fortunately, I was only three feet away and saved  (Tina) before she became a victim. I feel so lucky. I also feel a need to warn  other parents."  </P></p>

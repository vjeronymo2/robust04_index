			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> UCLA SOCCER TEAM WILL TRY TO REBOUND IN NCAA REGIONALS  </P> <P> The UCLA men's soccer team, ranked 10th nationally after losing its last two  regular-season matches, will meet No. 18 San Diego State in the first round of  the NCAA Far West Regionals at 2 p.m. Sunday at El Camino College.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said the playoff "matches the two top Division I teams  in Southern California" for the third straight year. "It will be a tough,  physical and exciting game."  </P> <P> The Bruins dropped to 16-3-1 after losing to South Carolina, 3-2, and being  shut out for the first time this season by Howard, 2-0, in last week's South  Carolina/Met Life tournament. San Diego State is 14-4-3.  </P> <P> In last year's Far West first round, UCLA defeated the Aztecs, 2-1. In the 1987  NCAA quarterfinals, San Diego State edged the Bruins, 2-1. Sunday's match marks  the Bruins' seventh straight NCAA tournament appearance.  </P> <P> Against South Carolina, Bruin goals were scored by freshman Chris Henderson and  junior Kirk Ferguson.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica College men's basketball team, with only one part-time starter  and two reserves from last year's 32-4 squad, will open the season when it  plays host to Pasadena City College at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Corsair Gymnasium.  </P> <P> Last year Coach John McMullen's Corsairs advanced to the state tournament  quarterfinals for the second straight year, but the only players returning from  that team are 6-foot, 6-inch Mark Moton, a part-time starter at forward, and  6-6 Chris Cook and Marc Schrobilgin, front-court reserves.  </P> <P> "We have a young team," McMullen said, "but they're hard workers who believe  they can win and carry on the tradition established in the past few years."  </P> <P> Freshmen include former Crenshaw High School players Cornelius Banks (6-5),  Chico Langston (5-10), Donald Smith (6-2) and two named Marcus Williams, one  5-10 and the other 6-3. The taller Williams broke a foot bone in practice and  is expected to be sidelined for several weeks.  </P> <P> Other first-year players are 6-5 Emile Bigelow, 6-1 Jason Shea, 6-4 Earic  Peters, 6-5 Lincoln Hill, 6-6 Lamont Koonce, 6-5 Lamont Mitchell and 6-7 Jess  Odom.  </P> <P> McMullen expects his Corsairs to continue to play "aggressive, pressure defense  and a fast-break, up-tempo style offense." Pasadena is always strong under  Coach George Terzian, he added.  </P> <P> Coach Andy Banachowski and his UCLA women's volleyball team clinched their  second straight Pacific 10 Conference championship last week, their third  conference title in four years, by defeating No. 7 Stanford in three games and  No. 18 California in four.  </P> <P> The victories gave Banachowski 601 career wins, making him second nationally to  Coach Linda Dollar of Southwest Missouri State, who has 640.  </P> <P> The Bruins (21-1 overall, 15-0 in the Pac-10 as the week began) will play host  to Oregon State (11-13, 2-12) at 7 p.m. Friday and to No. 15 Oregon (19-6, 8-6)  at 7 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> UCLA freshman middle blocker Natalie Williams was named conference player of  the week. She had a career-high 25 kills against Cal and 14 against Stanford,  and she also had 13 blocks in the two matches.  </P> <P> The Pepperdine women's volleyball team (17-6 overall, 11-0 in the West Coast  Conference at the start of the week) has clinched its third straight conference  championship. The Waves will play Friday night (11-10) at Portland (14-12, 7-4)  and Saturday night (11-11) at Gonzaga (17-9, 7-4).  </P> <P> Last week the Waves defeated visiting Portland and Gonzaga, each in three  games. Against Gonzaga, sophomore outside hitter Cari Delson had 10 kills,  sophomore outside hitter Carolyn Hueth had nine, and freshman middle blocker  Debbie Merandi had nine kills and six service aces. Against Portland, senior  outside hitter Tami Seidenberg had 10 kills, and Merandi had nine kills and  three aces.  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Nina Matthies said, "At this point . . . we are playing for  the best seeding possible at the NCAA tournament. How we fare in our upcoming  matches against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Cal State Long Beach and San Diego  State will likely have a major effect on our seeding."  </P> <P> The No. 3 Pepperdine water polo team (22-4 overall, 8-0 in the Big West  Conference) will try to clinch the conference championship and earn an NCAA  tournament berth at No. 2 UC Irvine (21-5, 5-1) at noon Sunday. The Waves, who  have won 16 of their last 17 games, will play host to USC at 2 p.m. Saturday at  Raleigh Runnels Pool.  </P> <P> Last week the Waves defeated Fresno State, 13-6, and Pacific, 10-7, running  their winning streak to six.  </P> <P> Sophomore Geoffrey Clark leads Pepperdine with 76 goals, Sasa Poljak has 63 and  Rafael Gandarillas 43.  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder says five or six teams have a good chance of  winning the NCAA championship, "but I can almost guarantee the team that is  playing the best defense at the end of the season will win the national crown."  </P> <P> The Santa Monica College football team (4-4 overall, 3-4 in the Western State  Conference) will play host to Los Angeles Valley (4-4, 4-3) in a homecoming  game at 1 p.m. Saturday at Corsair Field.  </P> <P> Last week the Corsairs snapped a three-game losing streak by shutting out  Compton, 35-0. SMC tailback Charles McKinzie rushed for 173 yards on 21  carries, giving him 1,065 yards in his career and eighth place in the school  record book.  </P> <P> Valley's strong running attack is led by Donald Dozier and Cliff Robinson. The  Monarchs are coming off a 29-13 victory over Pierce.  </P> <P> The UCLA women's cross-country team will try to qualify for the NCAA  championships Saturday in the District 8 championships at Fresno. The Bruins,  who finished fifth in the Pac-10 championships, need to place first or second  Saturday to get to the NCAAs on Nov. 20 at Annapolis, Md.  </P> <P> Pepperdine sophomore Kim McElhinney, who won the West Coast Conference  individual title in cross-country, will compete Saturday at the District 8  championships at Fresno.  </P> <P> The UCLA women's swim team (2-0) will compete Friday and Saturday at the Texas  Invitational, while Pepperdine (0-1) will play host to Cal State Northridge and  UC San Diego at 11 a.m. Saturday at Raleigh Runnels Pool.  </P> <P> Eight members of the Pepperdine men's tennis team, led by freshmen Alejo  Mancisidor and Matt Holt, will compete today through Sunday at the  Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn./Rolex District 8 championships at UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> The Pepperdine women's basketball team will play host to the University of  British Columbia in an exhibition game at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Wave Coach Ron  Fortner's team is led by three senior starters: guards Dionne Burgess and  Sherri Murrell and forward Kristy Greenberg.  </P></p>

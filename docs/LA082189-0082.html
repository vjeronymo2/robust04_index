			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 7 MUSICIANS OFFERED POSTS WITH PACIFIC  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony has tentatively filled seven of its 14 open positions at  an audition call that drew about 200 applicants in the last two weeks to the  Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The musicians have been offered contracts but have not yet signed them,  according to orchestra officials. The seven are:  </P> <P>  -- Violinists Tamara Chang, 23, of North Hollywood, Ingrid Kuo, 23, of New  York City and Rachel Robinson, 21, Washington.  </P> <P>  -- Violists Andrew Pickin, 25, of Sherman Oaks and John Scanlon, 26, of Fort  Lauderdale, Fla.  </P> <P>  -- String bass Bruce Moyer, 37, of Pacifica in San Mateo County.  </P> <P>  -- Trombonist Michael Hoffman, 29, of Denver.  </P> <P> Their experience ranges from playing as substitutes to holding positions in  regional orchestras.  </P> <P> Pending signing their contracts, the seven will join the orchestra for the  Sept. 2 concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> The seven were selected by Pacific's music adviser, Kazimierz Kord, and several  committees made up of principal players of the orchestra. The musicians  performed behind a blind screen to ensure anonymity.  </P> <P> Kord and the committees decided not to award contracts to fill the positions of  assistant concertmaster, three additional first violinists, one violist and two  percussionists. Auditions for these positions will be held next season. CHRIS  PASLES  </P></p>

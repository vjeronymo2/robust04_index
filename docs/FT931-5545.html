			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Donizetti's 'L'assedio di Calais' - Opera Presumably it was the success of this rare Donizetti opera at the Wexford Festival the year before last which suggested it to the Guildhall School of Music as a suitable piece for its students. If so, it was a good idea, which has been well carried through. Audiences and students will have benefited alike. In choosing the story of the six burghers of Calais Donizetti was aware that he was taking on a serious opera which demanded a bold treatment of the drama. There is no prima donna here to run up and down scales and hit high notes to provide the focus of attention. In her place L'assedio di Calais is bravely true to its sober story and asks for the audience's sympathies to go out to a family and a whole community in suffering. The central act is one of the composer's finest efforts in serious opera. One by one the six burghers come forward to sign their names as sacrificial victims to save their city. No trite cabaletta or bouncy final chorus is allowed to disturb the sense of the enormity of what they are doing. The scene builds patiently to a spacious and dignified choral prayer, its sombre mood well sustained in Stephen Medcalf's production. There is another advantage in Donizetti's design, too. A music school does not have to ask one talented student to carry the whole show. Roles of equal importance can be found for a number of students. This was, for example, the most taxing role in which we have so far encountered the bass-baritone Nathan Berg and the imposing depth of his tone was most impressive, even if some passages stayed high in the voice for longer than he could manage. He also spoke the Italian text with fine, unforced eloquence; but then the standard in that department was pretty good all round. Helen Lothian and Elvia Sanchez, as husband and wife facing separation, made lovingly expressive music out of their touching scene together. Miss Lothian's mezzo was steady and strong at either extreme, if not so characterful as yet in the middle. The soprano was stylish and had the role well within her grasp. She might have made a good job out of the extra solo that Donizetti added for his soprano to bring the opera to a sparkling close, if it had been included. The Guildhall School production, conducted by Clive Timms, preferred to keep to the original 1836 version of the score. This can at least claim textual purity and also allowed students of the London Contemporary Dance School to present the seldom-heard ballet. The alliance is a worthwhile one (think of the other rare operas on which the schools could combine). But next time it would be preferable to keep off tasteless modern costumes and angular brutalist movements, if the rest of the production is heading in the opposite direction. Sponsored by the Donizetti Society. Further performances at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on March 5, 8 and 10 (071-638 8891)</p>

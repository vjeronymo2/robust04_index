			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Irregular regulation The Treasury's zeal in adopting the cause of orderly and transparent markets in London is indeed admirable. It would be all the more so if it had been much in evidence before the government had Pounds 5bn-worth of BT shares to unload. In that context, official protestations that attempts to limit short selling ahead of the BT3 issue are to defend the reputation of London as a capital-raising centre ring like a cracked champagne glass. Both the Treasury and the Stock Exchange say they are concerned to prevent a re-run of the substantial price drop ahead of the Wellcome float in the BT3 offer. If that is the case, they have had almost a year to consult and introduce general reforms which would have defined rules acceptable to all market participants. Instead the Treasury's special pleading is letting its naked self-interest show. The Stock Exchange's tattered credibility has been further damaged. It was minded to grant SG Warburg's request for a move to cash settlement until institutional pressure intervened. Now it is to monitor all large BT transactions over the next few weeks. Yet, if this was considered necessary, why was it not announced at the start of the flotation? The delay has made the Exchange appear in thrall to one of its large market makers - a prospect far more damaging to London's reputation than jiggery-pokery by institutions trying to buy cheap stock. Book-building and incentives techniques have run well ahead of the SIB's rules on stabilisation of new issues. Indeed, there is no consensus on what would constitute a false market in BT shares. The Stock Exchange is vague on what actions would be considered market manipulation ahead of such a large flotation. It is at least possible that the incentives offered by Warburg create a false impression of the value of BT shares under current conditions. The Treasury, the SIB and the Stock Exchange need to resolve such questions in a way which does not imply that they are making policy on the hoof. It would also help if they could do it under conditions where the conflicts of interest are not so glaring.</p>

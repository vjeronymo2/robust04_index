			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" station editorial by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] The activists of the U.S.-Cuba Friendship Caravan  arrive in Havana this afternoon, after having successfully  dodged more than a few difficulties during the caravan's  gigantic tour, from the time it began in Canada and several  different points in the United States until it crossed into  Mexico and loaded onto a ship the 140 tons of medicines,  foodstuffs, and other products valued at some $3 million. As we  have said on several occasions, this solidarity assistance does  not solve our problems; it is, however, a gesture of enormous  human value, which our people appreciate.    I think it only fair to point out that this time the U.S.  Customs authorities in Laredo did not give the caravan as hard a  time as they did last year; although one piece of equipment was  stopped, no particular desire to obstruct the passage of the  caravan was observed.    In the same way that we do not economize on words  criticizing  hostile actions against our country on the part of the profuse  [profusa] U.S. Administration, we point out this fact, which in  essence also constitutes a change from preceding years.    Other interpretations of this conduct on the part of Laredo  Customs could be made, without there being a direct  cause-and-effect relationship. It appears evident that as the  conviction that these are not times for blockades and that such  museum pieces of symbolism do no one any good gains ground in  U.S. political and business sectors, it has little by little  been turning into a de facto presence and a call to be realistic.    Nor can the fact that, for some time, not a few  administration officials have not been in favor of the embargo  -- as they call it in North America -- be (?omitted from) the  analysis.    This U.S-Cuba Friendship Caravan, whose activists arrive  this  afternoon and will later travel to several provinces to  symbolically present the shipment arriving next week, has also  contributed to the determination to open the blockade  progressively. It is obvious that such a political decision on  the part of the Clinton administration will not be adopted  tomorrow. However, the price -- also political -- of not taking  these factors into account could become significant.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Leading Article: City regulation TENSION IS rising in the retail investment industry over reform of the regulatory bodies responsible for marketing life assurance, pensions and unit trusts. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the top regulatory organisation, the Securities and Investments Board, has fired a shot across the bows of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulating body designed to absorb two existing regulators, Lautro and Fimbra. In the background is a critical, unpublished Office of Fair Trading report on life assurance marketing. The PIA, as so far outlined, certainly takes practitioner-based regulation beyond the limits of practicality. Its 30-member board, big enough to include all the warring factions within the investment industry, must be cut down by half and rebalanced in favour of public interest representatives, says Mr Large. There must be no rubber-stamp transfer of existing Fimbra members to the PIA. Nor can this be a cut-price regulator; it must be one able to deal with rising compensation claims and widespread concerns about the industry's marketing practices. The sting in the tail of the Mr Large's letter to Sir Gordon Downey, prospective PIA chairman, is the warning that the SIB has alternatives up its sleeve should the PIA collapse. This is plainly intended to strengthen Sir Gordon's hand in overcoming industry resistance to toughening the PIA's prospectus. The British Insurance Association, for instance, was quick to issue an angry response yesterday about 'moving the goalposts'. But it would be a pity if Mr Large's threats were dismissed as negotiator's bluff. It is time that the alternatives were spelt out more clearly. Some in the industry have already called for direct statutory regulation of the marketing of investment products. Alternatively, Fimbra could be absorbed within a strengthened Lautro, and independent financial advisers would have to become tied agents except where they could obtain authorisation through professional bodies. It is right that Mr Large should tackle the vested interests in investment retailing which the consensus-seeking SIB has treated far too leniently in the past. However, this is not a private debate, but one of wide public interest, and it is time that the issues were brought out into the open.</p>

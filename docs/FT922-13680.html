			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / With western help, a wing and a prayer: Efforts to restructure the former Soviet Union's civil aviation industry Aeroflot, the world's biggest but probably most inefficient airline, was already in deep trouble before the break-up of the Soviet Union. Not for nothing was it nicknamed Aeroflop. Its problems have now multiplied. Only months before the collapse of the Soviet Union, senior officials of the aviation ministry in Moscow approached British Airways with a proposal to reshape the airline into a competitive western-style international carrier. BA had started discussions with Moscow in 1987 on how best to develop the airline business in the former Soviet Union. Several ideas, including the total overhaul of Aeroflot, were assessed, and rejected as being beyond local management capabilities. Instead, BA agreed in October 1990 to invest Pounds 20m for a 31 per cent stake in a joint venture with Aeroflot and other Soviet partners to create an international airline called Air Russia and transform Moscow's decrepit Domodedovo airport into an international hub. The project has survived the political and economic upheavals that have shaken the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) during the past 12 months. Mr John Borkowski, BA's head of strategy, expects Air Russia to start flying with a fleet of seven Boeing 767 airliners in 1994. The idea continues to be to create what he calls a 'luxury airline' operating international services out of the Domodedovo hub. Such plans should probably be treated with scepticism. Aeroflot, like other CIS institutions, is in turmoil. Since the beginning of this year, the carrier's domestic operations have been dismembered among its republican and regional directorates. By the end of February, each of its 34 operational divisions had registered as a separate airline. International flights, for the time being at least, are still carried on in the Aeroflot name, under the aegis of an interstate aviation committee set up by CIS heads of government in December. The idea is to maintain a central civil air transport regulatory body to co-ordinate services during the industry's restructuring and redevelopment. 'For us nothing has changed,' says Mr Vladimir Potapov, director-general of Aeroflot's international air service department based at Sheremetievo, Moscow's main international airport. But he has also become increasingly worried by stirrings of independence among new CIS airlines on international markets. But elsewhere upheaval is commonplace. Many of the republics have already set about painting aircraft in their national colours. Former Aeroflot divisions are now called Ukrainian Airlines, Azerbaijan Airlines, Baikalavia, Sibavia or Lithuanian Airlines. They are all suffering from shortages of funds, fuel or spares. Their fleets of Soviet-built aircraft are worn out. About 40 per cent of all aircraft in the republics are grounded, making up what has become known as the 'iron row' of idle aircraft crowding airport tarmacs. Fares have trebled on internal flights and risen by as much as 30 times on international routes since prices were liberalised in January. This, in turn, has caused a fall in traffic. Rising costs and fewer passengers are expected to increase the number of closures of unprofitable domestic routes. As a result, regions which had depended on the old Aeroflot to link them to the rest of the country could be isolated. These risks are compounded by concerns about safety. With money in short supply, there is a danger of large cuts in maintenance budgets. Although accident rates for 1990 and 1991 are not available yet, safety standards appear to be declining. The most recent official records show there were 23 accidents in 1989, compared with 16 in 1988 and 13 in 1987. For all these reasons, the new airlines of the Commonwealth have been scrambling to forge co-operation links with western airlines to help them improve standards, fund new western aircraft acquisitions and overhaul operations. Apart from the Air Russia venture with BA, Lithuanian Airlines has just signed a marketing and sales agreement with American Airlines and has leased a Boeing 737 from GPA, the Irish leasing group. Aeroflot-St Petersburg agreed with Finnair in February to set up a joint airline based in St Petersburg. A joint venture with Lufthansa is planned to transform the old Sheremetievo domestic terminal into a new international one. And the international operations based there have approached the German carrier to co-operate on reviving an airline first established by Weimar Germany and the Bolshevik state in the 1920s. Whatever the republics' longings for their own national airlines as a status symbol, economic and political realities have compelled them to stick together when operating international services. None has sufficient hard currency to set up its own international offices, while international agreements inherited from the Soviet Union cannot be renegotiated overnight. The December interstate aviation agreement has assured continued international services, a significant source of foreign currency for the republics. For now, it has also reduced the risk that international air transport will join the list of growing problems facing the republics as they struggle to revive their economies. But if Aeroflot has so far survived as an international carrier, it is only a shadow of its former self. Internationally, it serves 135 cities in 102 countries with a fleet of slightly more than 100 jets. But more than 90 per cent of its traffic has traditionally been carried domestically to 3,600 towns and cities. Its domestic operations have employed the bulk of its 600,000 staff. The inevitable restructuring of the industry risks making as many as half Aeroflot's 57,000 pilots redundant, according to Mr Alfred Malinovsky, chairman of the pilots' union. Even on the international front, many of Aeroflot's newly independent regional branches and several start-up airlines are likely eventually to challenge its international division. But the difficulties are just as great for the new airlines emerging in the Commonwealth. Mr Borkowski of BA concedes that finding money to finance new operations with western aircraft based in Russia is a Herculean venture in the current circumstances. Aeroflot is still struggling to finance its first batch of Airbus A310 wide-body aircraft. The first of the five airliners was due to be delivered last November. It is now unlikely to arrive before June. But western aircraft manufacturers and airlines still continue to regard the CIS as offering promising long-term growth prospects. Rolls-Royce, for example, is expected to sign a deal soon to provide engines for a new Tupolev airliner while France's Aerospatiale is discussing co-operation with Russian manufacturers on a new 600-seater passenger jet. The short term, however, remains extremely uncertain. A British businessman's recent description of Moscow's Domodedovo airport summed up the scale of the reconstruction problem. 'It's a toilet,' he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS AVIATION: WILL IT FLY?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS Airline traffic forecasts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average annual growth rates (per cent)                    1970-   1991-   2000-  1991-                    1991    2000    2010   2010 Total              5.6      2.9    5.0     4.0 International      9.6      8.1    6.7     7.5 Domestic           5.4      2.3    4.8     3.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Shift work 'leads to health problems' Many shiftworkers suffer sleeping and eating problems, the British Psychological Society's occupational conference was told, Richard Donkin writes. A report by Mr Alexander Wedderburn of the department of business organisation at Heriot-Watt Business School, Edinburgh, found that only the hardiest of workers could easily tolerate shift work. The study also found that some groups of workers were reluctant to adopt eating and drinking habits that might improve their health. Shiftworkers, who comprise one in eight of the working population, suffer more digestive problems than day workers. Mr Wedderburn said there were insufficient guidelines to help with the problems.</p>

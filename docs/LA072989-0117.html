			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STEPPING INTO ANOTHER WORLD  </P> <P> Though only a stone's throw from the hurly-burly of the San Diego Freeway in  southern Orange County, Mission San Juan Capistrano is light years away in  terms of tranquillity.  </P> <P> Hordes of summer tourists visibly slow down, and even speak more softly, as  they enter the 213-year-old mission. Brian W. McInerey, director of tourism at  the mission, believes the Old World charm inside the mission makes the  difference.  </P> <P> "Out there, beyond the mission walls, there are lots of developments and noisy  progress," he said. "Inside these walls, one is transported back to another  era. It's calm and peaceful here."  </P> <P> Fountains sparkle in the sunlight, and water splashes melodically. Pigeons and  a few swallows gracefully fly above the adobe walls. In the gardens, mature  trees cast cool shade over visitors.  </P> <P> An ancient metal-producing furnace, the first ever built in the far West, shows  tourists how the California Indians learned that exacting trade more than 200  years ago. A chapel frequented by Father Junipero Serra invites tourists to  pause and meditate.  </P> <P> "This is a world-class historic site," said Nicholas M. Magalousis, a Chapman  College professor who is director of archeology at the mission. "It's known  around the world, and with good reason."  </P> <P> John Loomis, an architect who is working on plans to further protect and  stabilize the mission, said he always seems in another world while inside the  walls of its grounds. "It's like stepping back into time," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Noted political analyst Alain Duhamel  comments on the Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's successes in the  25 February Paris daily LIBERATION. Juppe's course has been "the  most spectacular and most convincing" in the government, he  contends. The conduct of the Geneva GATT negotiations, the  initiative that led to the Sarajevo ultimatum and his ability to  ensure the participation of a "refractory" United States, as  well as his success in re-mobilizing his ministry have all  furnished proof of his "brilliance" and his "energy" as a  negotiator. In addition, President Francois Mitterrand  appreciates the "limpidity of his analyses and expressions,"  Duhamel continues. A "formerly prickly and narcissistic" Juppe  is beginning to relax, he notes, adding that with an  "intellectual rapidity that quickly makes him impatient, and a  dominating temperament and self-confidence that do not  predispose him to tolerance," the foreign minister is not a  consensual politician. In Duhamel's view, Juppe's attributes  make him "the most promising of the forty-somethings," together  with Socialist Party (PS) luminary Laurent Fabius. Just like his  "sworn enemy" Philippe Seguin, president of the National  Assembly, Charles Pasqua, minister of interior, and a more  "seductive and politically inclined but less coherent" Francois  Leotard, the defense minister, Juppe can aspire to the prime  ministership, Duhamel contends. However, "there is a hitch," for  Juppe is secretary general of the Rally for the Republic (RPR),  a position which, in the opinion of some, makes for "one Juppe  too many." Not that the foreign minister lacks governmental  loyalty, Duhamel admits. However, Juppe must daily act on two  levels. While Prime Minister Edouard Balladur profits from his  minister's performance, Juppe's views as RPR "number two"  strengthen Jacques Chirac, notably when he insists that the  latter is the party's natural presidential candidate. This leads  Balladur to distance himself from Juppe and "carefully omit to  compliment him in public," for he does not want him to head a  single majority list in the European Parliament elections.    Juppe will soon hold "redoubtable" power, Duhamel comments,  for he, Charles Pasqua, and Philippe Seguin will be the "three  great RPR barons" to weigh in at the time of the choice between  Balladur and Chirac. Seguin is opposed to Balladur and Pasqua  has distanced himself from him. Whichever of the "two Juppe's"  triumphs over the other will be influential, but will also be  "mutilating himself," Duhamel concludes.</p>

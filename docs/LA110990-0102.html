			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KPFK TO BROADCAST SERIES OF MULTICULTURAL STAGE PLAYS  </P> <P> Six of Los Angeles' most recent cultural stage plays will be broadcast in radio  form over KPFK-FM (90.7) during the coming months.  </P> <P> As part of a special series, the North Hollywood public radio station has  brought in original cast members to perform before the microphone. Each play  represents a different faction of Los Angeles' multicultural population.  </P> <P> "The only problem was in selecting only six productions," said Sharon  Rosewoman, an independent radio producer who worked on the series for KPFK.  "There are many plays that are very good, but they are very visual and didn't  translate to the ear. What I selected was based on content. The plays needed to  be literate and have something important to say."  </P> <P> Among the first broadcasts will be Alan Drury's "The Man Himself," a one-man  production filled with the musings of a British working-class type. Ian Ruskin  will reprise his Stages Trilingual Theatre role, which Times' reviewer T.H.  McCulloh called "deliciously comic, heartbreakingly sympathetic."  </P> <P> Other plays that have been recorded for broadcast include:  </P> <P> * "Bricktop" -- the story of Prohibition jazz baby Ada Smith, a musical that  was at the Inner City Cultural Center in August and follows the life and times  of black entertainers of that era.  </P> <P> * "The Mission of Mother Jones" -- a one-woman drama, starring Deborah Marsh,  about the Irish woman who organized miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia at  the turn of the century.  </P> <P> * A 30-minute monologue by Manazar Gamboa from Daniel Martinez' "Ignore the  Dents," which he describes as a micro urban opera Times' music critic Martin  Bernheimer wrote that this "communal sociopolitico-musico-theatrical  extravaganza" suffered from "much noise, little harmony."  </P> <P> The KPFK series is also scheduled to include productions of Luis Valdez'  "Soldado Razo," which was at the Japan America Theater last summer, and Dan  Seymour's Burbage Theater production of "A-Bomb Beauties," based on the true  story of 25 Japanese women who were disfigured by the bombing of Hiroshima and  later brought to the United States by a group of philanthropists to undergo  reconstructive surgery.  </P> <P> Some of the plays were slightly rewritten for radio. The project was funded by  a Los Angeles Cultural Affairs grant.  </P></p>

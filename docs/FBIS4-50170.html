			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Healy in London and Danny Gittings] </F>   [Text] A British trade official has launched an outspoken  attack on Governor Chris Patten, ahead of his visit to London  later this week. An official in the Department of Trade and  Industry, which handles London's trade relations with Beijing,  said Mr Patten would be told his political reform policies no  longer had the unanimous support of the British Government.    Mr Patten leaves this Friday [20 May] on a 10-day trip which  will include meeting ministers and Foreign Office officials.  The meetings are expected to focus on whether the Government  will accept recommendations in the House of Commons Foreign  Affairs Committee's (FAC) report -- especially its call for a  human rights commission.    The trade official said Mr Patten was "just too expensive a  luxury for Hong Kong in terms of our China trade". It is the  first public attack by a serving British civil servant on Mr  Patten's policies. Previously, such criticism has only come  from retired officials, such as former foreign affairs adviser  Sir Percy Cradock.    The official said that, while opinion polls continued to  show  popular support for Mr Patten: "At the end of the day it's the  pound or the dollar in the pocket that counts".    "We don't have the same agenda as Mr Patten. We want to see  trade with China burgeoning, and we see a lot of it going  through Hong Kong. We think this is the strongest base for  freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "We're at a dead end. We know  that, Patten knows that and the Chinese know it too. We've got  to break the deadlock."    Foreign Office and Downing Street officials have insisted  the  British Government continued to unanimously back Mr Patten. In  Hong Kong, Government House spokesman Mike Hanson rejected the  trade official's attack. "His statements do not reflect the  British Government's position on Hong Kong," he said. "There is  an important place for integrity, as well as commercial  interests, in foreign affairs."    Mr Patten is expected to come under further fire from  British  business interests in a House of Lords debate this Wednesday,  sponsored by former Hong Kong minister Lord Glenarthur.  Previous such debates have seen stringent criticism of the  Governor's political reform policies.    The visit has already sparked suggestions in the British  press that Mr Patten is bored of the governorship, since his  last trip to London was only six weeks ago. However Mr Patten  has defended this pattern of visits, saying it was similar to  that followed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson.    In meeting ministers and officials, he will hammer out the  British Government's response to the FAC report, which must be  delivered to the all-party body by the end of June. The ethnic  minorities campaign for British passports, which was backed by  the FAC, is also expected to be discussed.</p>

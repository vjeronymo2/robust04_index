			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / A word in your ear . . .: A look at the the role of parliamentary lobbyists in the UK When MPs return to Westminster next week, a top-level House of Commons inquiry into MPs' outside interests will get fully under way. The incident that triggered the inquiry by the privileges committee, which is composed of senior MPs, was July's disclosure in a Sunday newspaper that two Conservative MPs had been willing to accept payment of Pounds 1,000 for tabling parliamentary questions from journalists posing as businessmen. But the subjects investigated will be more widespread than that. One subject is expected to be the nature of the ties, such as directorships and consultancies, that link some MPs with professional lobbying and public relations companies. A leading lobbyist said earlier this year that he thought the inquiry would 'inevitably' scrutinise such links. The profession has acquired a reputation for being obscure and patchily regulated. The public pictures lobbyists in smoky Westminster bars, exchanging dubious favours on behalf of their clients with MPs on the make. This is a jaundiced view. Nevertheless, pressure is mounting for a comprehensive regulatory framework. Most lobbyists favour statutory measures, in part to help root out unscrupulous practitioners, although the industry is split over what the restrictions should be. The pressure for stricter regulation comes partly as a result of the industry's success. Professional lobbying in the UK has expanded from next to nothing 20 years ago to an industry with an annual turnover estimated at Pounds 20m. Its influence can be detected in almost all government decision-making processes. The task of the lobbyist is to maximise clients' knowledge about - and, if possible, influence over - political decisions. This applies whether the lobbyist works exclusively for a company or trade body, such as the Brick Development Association, or for a specialist firm that could deal with a wide range of clients. Part of the trick is to ensure that clients' views are presented as early as possible in the decision-making process. Lobbyists keep a close eye on Whitehall's voluminous piles of paper, alerting clients when they spot developments of interest and arranging meetings with the decision-makers. There are plenty of ways for lobbyists to try to change ministers' minds. Perhaps the commonest - especially at times when the government's majority is slender, as at present - is for lobbyists' clients to convince a few backbenchers of the merit of their case. Letters are often sent to MPs who have shown an interest in the subject. MPs may be invited to meet the client, often over lunch. Pains will be taken to ensure the decor and provender are appropriate. If the client is a food company, for example, a good lobbyist would ensure no rival group's brand was on the table. Ingenuity is used to show MPs that issues affecting the client are of interest to constituents. One campaign mounted last year by the specialist lobbying firm Ian Greer Associates, against the closure of London's Royal Marsden Hospital, analysed the hospital's referral lists. Letters were drafted to MPs with seats well outside the capital pointing out how many of their constituents were treated there. Advisers to Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, during its fight with Lloyds Bank to take over Midland Bank in 1992, unearthed 28 constituencies with towns that had only one Lloyds and one Midland outlet, which therefore faced a 'prospective monopoly' of bank branches. Once backbenchers have been won over, they generally need little prompting to put pressure on the government by tabling awkward questions, demanding meetings with ministers and signing early day motions - which are rarely voted on but are printed on the Commons order paper. Letter-writing remains a successful campaign tactic. One of the largest Westminster mailbags was generated by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters last year, which wanted to derail government plans to encourage people to have pensions and benefits paid direct to a bank. The avalanche of mail produced was the talk of the members' tea room for weeks. Increasingly, lobbyists are targeting the House of Lords. Unlike in the Commons, where the government can usually mobilise its MPs to avoid a defeat, a vote in the Lords is more easily influenced. For all their success, lobbyists have not been able to tackle their own image problem. The industry has taken steps to regulate itself more effectively, but it is divided over what further measures should be taken. The various trade bodies representing the industry have their own codes of conduct and plans for registers of lobbyists. But they disagree over whether MPs should be allowed to act as directors or consultants to public relations and lobbying firms. The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Institute of Public Relations believe such links should continue, arguing that it is not for a trade body to tell members who should be on their boards. The Association of Professional Political Consultants, a specialist lobbyists' group, has banned them because of the risk of conflict of interest. The industry has repeatedly pleaded with parliament to put a statutory framework in place. As long as lobbyists do not abide by common standards, unscrupulous operators who do not belong to an association can continue to give the industry a bad name. Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader, has said that in his view 'a voluntary code would be better'. Industry insiders, however, say respectable lobbyists have nothing to fear from tighter regulation. The test will be whether the industry's annual increase in turnover, put by one Labour MP at up to 25 per cent, can be maintained. Mr Ian Greer, chairman of Ian Greer Associates, is confident it can: 'There is no sign whatsoever of the industry putting on less business than it has done over the last five years,' he says. 'It is a growth industry.'</p>

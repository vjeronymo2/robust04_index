			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets TOKYO Trading is expected to remain light with many investors cautious ahead of the Hosokawa-Clinton meeting in Washington on Friday. Although the Nikkei index managed to remain above the psychologically important 20,000 level on Friday, in spite of delays in the announcement of the government's long-awaited economic stimulus package, some market participants fear the effects on share prices if the government scales down its tax cuts from the originally planned Y6,000bn. Chinese New Year holidays on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will restrict trading in Asian markets. PARIS Private investors have until Thursday to buy shares, or confirm existing orders, in Elf Aquitaine, the largest company to be privatised so far in the French government's programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. Corporate announcements due this week include figures from UAP, the insurer and privatisation candidate, which Hoare Govett expects to post a recovery in net profit to FFr1.9bn. The market expects a strong recovery at Matra Hachette while some analysts also expect improved results from Total on Wednesday, in contrast with the sharp drop recorded at Elf. MILAN Shares in Instituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial services group which was heavily oversubscribed when it was privatised last week, begin trading on Wednesday. The stock was quoted at L12,600-L12,900 on the grey market last Friday, compared with the the issue price of L10,900. STOCKHOLM Full-year figures come from Ericsson on Thursday. UBS, which expects a 130 per cent rise in net profits, recalls that the group disappointed the market with its third-quarter results. However, the bank believes that some expectations are too optimistic. It says investors should remember the volatility of the shares as US investors sold after the last report. Stora, Europe's largest forest products group, reports finals tomorrow. OSLO Hafslund Nycomed, due to report 1993 results on Friday, is expected to post higher sales but little changed earnings. Full-year figures are due on Thursday from Bergesen, the bulk shipping group.</p>

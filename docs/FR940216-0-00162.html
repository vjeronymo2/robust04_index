			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oxygenate blenders are not required to demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping standards because the blending of oxygenate has only a positive effect on the quality of gasoline or blendstock with which oxygenate is blended with regard to the properties or emission products regulated under anti-dumping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under 40 CFR 80.2(ll), an oxygenate blending facility is ``any facility (including a truck) at which oxygenate is added to gasoline or blendstock, and at which the quality or quantity of gasoline is not altered in any other manner except for the addition of deposit control additives.'' Under 40 CFR 80.2(mm), an oxygenate blender is ``any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises an oxygenate blending facility, or who owns or controls the blendstock or gasoline used or the gasoline produced at an oxygenate blending facility.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oxygenate blenders are regulated under the anti-dumping provisions,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  to the extent the oxygenate they blend is used in the compliance calculations of the refiner or importer who produces or imports the base gasoline used by the oxygenate blender. In this situation, the oxygenate blender is required, with regard to this oxygenate blending, to maintain records and to allow EPA inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oxygenate that is blended at a refinery or import facility would be included in compliance calculations as a matter of course because the oxygen (along with all other gasoline constituents) would be reflected in the batch analyses conducted of the gasoline using samples collected before the gasoline left the refinery or import facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements that must be met in order for refiners and importers to be allowed to claim oxygenates which are blended downstream are similar to the requirements relating to reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) in the reformulated gasoline program. The thrust of these requirements is that the refiner or importer must show that the oxygenate claimed was in fact added to the refiner's or importer's gasoline. This could be shown if the refiner or importer is able to demonstrate that it blended the oxygenate while the gasoline (or gasoline blendstock) is still owned by the refiner or importer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the downstream blending is carried out by a person other than the refiner or importer, in order to include the oxygenate in its compliance calculations the refiner or importer must have a contract with the downstream blender which mandates procedures that are necessary for proper blending. In addition, the refiner or importer must monitor the downstream blending operation in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure the oxygenate use claimed by the refiner or importer is accurate. Such monitoring must include audits, inspections, and sampling and testing of gasoline produced by the downstream blender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions that must be included in the contract with the oxygenate blender are those which the refiner or importer believes are necessary to ensure the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer is in fact added. At a minimum, the contract should provide for the inspections, sampling and testing, and audits by the refiner or importer over the oxygenate blending operation, as well as any quality assurance measures the refiner or importer feels the oxygenate blender should carry out. The contract also could specify the technical manner in which oxygenate is blended, if necessary to support the refiner's or importer's oxygenate use claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inspections and periodic sampling and testing oversight requirement is intended to ensure any oxygenate-use claims by a refiner or importer are supported by the actual oxygenate blending that occurs. The sampling and testing must be of the gasoline that is produced at the oxygenate blending operation, using base gasoline that was produced or imported by the refiner or importer. If the volume percent oxygenate found through sampling and testing is inconsistent with the refiner's or importer's claimed oxygenate volume, the refiner or importer must resolve the inconsistency in order to include the oxygenate in its compliance calculations. EPA believes the sampling and testing should be unannounced, should occur at different times during the portion of the averaging period when oxygenate is blended, and that the overall frequency is dependent on the situation. The sampling and testing should increase in frequency as the oxygenate volume increases, with oxygenate blenders who are less sophisticated, or where the refiner has any reason to question the oxygenate blending operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspections by refiners and importers should be calculated to determine if the oxygenate blender is complying with the procedures included in the contract with the oxygenate blender, such as quality assurance by the blender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that audits must occur at least annually, and more frequently if there is any reason for the refiner or importer to question the oxygenate blending operation. EPA further believes that audits must include, at a minimum, review of records that reflect the types and volumes of oxygenate purchased and used by the downstream blender to ensure they are consistent with the refiner's or importer's claims. In a case where the oxygenate blender is using base gasoline that is produced or imported by more than one refiner or importer, the audit must distinguish the oxygenate blended with the different refiner's or importer's base gasoline. In a case where the base gasoline is fungibly mixed with gasolines from other refiners or importers prior to its receipt by the downstream blender, the audit must account for the portion of the fungible mixture that is the gasoline produced by the refiner or imported by the importer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the complexities inherent in tracking gasoline through the fungible distribution system, EPA believes in most cases it will be impracticable for refiners or importers to effectively monitor downstream oxygenate blending with gasoline that is shipped fungibly, and as a result the refiner or importer normally would be precluded from including the oxygenate in compliance calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case where the downstream oxygenate use claims by a refiner or importer are not supported by the inspections, sampling and testing, or audits, or where EPA is able to establish that the oxygenate use claims by the refiner or importer are incorrect, the refiner or importer would not be allowed to include the oxygenate in compliance calculations. If the error is discovered subsequent to the conclusion of an averaging period, moreover, the refiner or importer would be required to recalculate its compliance calculations for the averaging period  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ab initio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  without including the oxygenate, even if this recalculation results in the refiner or importer being out of compliance with the anti-dumping standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has announced that  Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan will call the  major powers' ambassadors in Lebanon tomorrow. He will discuss  Lebanon's request for a Security Council meeting to debate the  Lebanese complaint against Israel in the abduction of Lebanese  citizen Mustafa al-Dirani. He said Lebanon expects the United  States to use its veto power, but the Security Council must live  up to its responsibilities. He expressed his belief that the  United Nations could restore its credibility by taking  appropriate action. [passage omitted] Answering journalists'  questions, Foreign Minister Buwayz said:    [Begin Buwayz recording] Of course the wavering in dealing  with Israel by the Security Council, the United Nations, and  several influential and major powers is no longer a secret. We  are at a stage where numerous Israeli aggressions are  overlooked. Hence, we believe that the United Nations should  regain its credibility by taking an appropriate decision on this  issue.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (PL) -- The government took an  important step toward normalizing relations with immigrants and  strengthening its national identity by calling a meeting with  representatives of the Cuban community abroad.    The conference will be held during the last week of April in  Havana and will include an exchange of opinions on a wide  variety of topics, including the prospective participation of  Cubans abroad in the country's public and economic spheres, the  weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL has just announced.    Observers and political analysts of the Cuban situation  cannot but notice the importance of an event of this nature if  they take into account the large number of Cuban immigrants  residing in other countries due to economic, family-related, and  other reasons.    This sector of the Cuban population has traditionally seen  their relations with the island hindered because of the U.S.  Government's permanent hostility toward Havana as well as  because of the direct, and many times violent, actions carried  out by several anti-Cuban organizations that are against any  kind of dialogue.    Cuba's call, which was initially outlined by Foreign  Minister  Roberto Robaina during his recent visit to the United Nations,  was received with interest by many immigrant sectors, especially  in the United States. However, the sectors who oppose the talks  excluded themselves when they tried to impose conditions to  obstruct the dialogue.    The significance of the Cuban Government's call is even  greater considering that the meeting will take place in the same  year that the island's administration picked to implement a long  line of measures geared to stabilize and reinvigorate its  economy.    The attempts to get closer to Cubans abroad have precedents  in the process of the Cuban revolution's history. In 1978  efforts of this nature resulted in an increase in the family  reunification movement, mainly between Miami and Havana.    On that occasion, and as evidence of good will, the local  government initially released approximately 3,000  counterrevolutionary prisoners and allowed them to join their  relatives abroad.    In the more recent past, Havana made it possible to multiply  the air ties between the United States and Cuba and, much to the  displeasure of the sworn enemies of the revolution, the number  of visits to Cuba by U.S. residents increased significantly.    Despite the obstacles to any type of exchange by the  existence and intensification of the U.S. blockade, more members  of the Cuban community in the United States are increasingly  rejecting this measure and disregarding regulations that  negatively affect their relations with their place of origin.    Now, the meeting called has a wide horizon and those who  come  to Havana will be able to give their opinions and discuss  something of great importance: How to consolidate the sense of  an independent country that Cubans have traditionally defended  and the future of their ties with their country of origin.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology: Feel the force - Apple will today unveil Newton, an electronic gadget which it claims will help you take control of your life Is your desk a mess? Do you have a hard time keeping track of notes from meetings and phone calls? Have you ever missed an appointment because you forgot to write it in your diary after a business trip? What you need, according to Apple Computer, is 'Newton', a pocket-sized electronic gadget that will help you to 'take control of your life and get organised'. John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive, will provide the first public demonstration of prototype Newton technology at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago today. 'This is the beginning of the biggest thing Apple has ever done. Our goal is to be the Johnny Appleseed of this new market for highly personalised devices that you can carry around in your pocket.' Apple plans to start selling the devices early next year. The prototype is just the beginning, Apple executives stress. Even so, it has an obvious appeal. A little black box, about seven inches by four-and-a-half inches, at first glance Newton looks like a Sony Diskman, with curved surfaces and rounded edges; a 'soft friendly shape' that invites you to hold it, as Apple's marketers put it. A flip-up lid reveals a five-by-three-inch grey screen with black 'icons' printed on it. There are no buttons to press, except the on/off switch. A pen-like stylus slots into the side of the unit. You use Newton like a note pad, jotting down lists of things to do, sketching diagrams, recording appointments as you talk on the phone or taking notes in a meeting. Automatically, the machine will file the information, putting appointments in the electronic calendar, recording phone numbers and addresses, or storing away notes that can be retrieved easily. Newton's biggest advantage over paper and pen, even for the most well-organised of people, is its ability to communicate via facsimile, telephone or computer networks. You could, for example, scribble a 'Happy Birthday' note to be sent tomorrow. Newton will make sure you don't forget, and send the message automatically. Or perhaps you are going to Paris. A phone call will supply Newton with such information as a map of the Paris Metro, along with a built-in phrase book and perhaps a guide to the Louvre. Point to a spot on the map and it will tell you how to get there. Write what you need to say and it will translate. The extent to which Newton can call upon outside help, such as the Paris guide, will depend upon the development of third-party software and information services. Establishing new distribution channels for Newton is also an important step in Apple's strategy to play a leading role in what Sculley predicts will become Dollars 3.5 trillion (million million) market by the turn of the century for a new class of consumer products that blend computer and communications technologies with entertainment and information services. Apple aims to sell Newton to people who have little interest in technology, and even those who are averse to high-tech gadgets, so the company's promotions will not stress technical details. However, some sophisticated computer hardware and software will be hidden inside Newton's little black box. The unit will be powered by a Risc processor designed by Advanced Risc Machines of Cambridge, England, which engineers say was chosen for its high performance and low power consumption. To provide strong data storage capacity, Apple will make use of 'flash memory cards' that can store up to 20 MBytes of data on a card not much bigger than a credit card. Early models of Newton will incorporate infra-red communications to exchange data with computers over short distances. Ultimately, however, Apple aims to give Newton the ability to operate across longer distances by using radio communications. Yet Apple's strength, in what is expected to become a highly competitive market, lies in its software. The handwriting recognition programs demonstrated by Apple are winning acclaim among industry experts. Unique to Newton is its ability to recognise and to make symmetrical rough sketches of shapes. A user, for example, may scrawl a circle and it will automatically be rounded and centred. Future Newton products will also incorporate speech recognition. Perhaps Apple's greatest advantage as it approaches this emerging market is imagination. Numerous companies have introduced 'pen computers', but none has so far aimed them at the mass consumer market. Others, such as Hewlett-Packard, Poqet Computer and Psion offer pocket-sized computers, but none is as simple to use as Newton. There are also plenty of 'electronic organisers' on the market, but these appeal only to high-tech gadget fans. None the less, Apple faces some significant challenges. The company's reluctance to detail features of its first Newton appears to reflect the difficulty it faces in compromising between performance and price. The data storage capacity of the first Newton model may, for example, determine whether it will sell for about Dollars 500 or for more than Dollars 700. Breaking with its past practice of jealously guarding proprietary technology, Apple is looking for technology partners who will license its Newton technology to create compatible products that may also compete with Apple's Newton. Royalties from licensees will make up a significant portion of Apple's Newton revenues within a few years, the company predicts. The first such Apple Newton partner is Sharp Electronics of Japan, which will manufacture Newton products for Apple as well as making its own versions for the Japanese market. Apple is also expected to face stiff competition. Casting a shadow over today's demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago was the announcement yesterday that Tandy, a force in the US consumer electronics market, is to collaborate with Casio, one of Japan's leading consumer electronics manufacturers, to develop, manufacture and market a line of personal information devices based on 'open standards' that will compete directly with Apple's Newton.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Lower M4 signals fragile recovery DEMAND FOR new credit is weak, according to money-supply data issued yesterday which indicate the upturn will be fragile. The M4 measure of the money supply, which takes in bank and building society deposits and notes and coins in circulation, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in June - its biggest monthly decrease since the Bank of England started records in 1982. After the fall in M4, the measure was 3.3 per cent higher than a year previously. This compares with a 3.8 per cent rise in the 12 months to May. Bank and building society lending to the private sector last month totalled Pounds 700m, after Pounds 1.9bn in May. The muted demand for lending was mainly due to companies requiring little finance from banks as they issued new shares to fund operations and pay off debts. The Bank said the M4 figure was distorted partly by the system for seasonal adjustments, which tends to depress money-supply numbers in the third month of every quarter when lending institutions charge interest. Another factor pushing down M4 was high sales of gilt-edged securities in June. The Bank gained about Pounds 2bn more in gilt sales than it needed to cover the public sector borrowing requirement, so draining cash from the private sector. The message that borrowing by companies and individuals has yet to see any big jump was underscored by figures from the British Bankers' Association, covering lending by the UK's nine biggest commercial banks. These banks lent a net, seasonally adjusted Pounds 800m in June, after Pounds 1.15bn in May. On an unadjusted basis manufacturers repaid Pounds 776m in bank loans during the month as many companies raised large sums from rights issues. Construction companies repaid Pounds 117m while building societies and securities dealers took on new loans worth a net Pounds 515m and Pounds 303m respectively. The number of people who think economic conditions will worsen has increased over the past month, a survey by Gallup, the market-research organisation, shows. A third of the 1,996 adults polled this month were pessimistic about the economy, compared with 28 per cent who were hopeful. That gives a negative balance of 5 percentage points. In a similar survey in June, a balance of 1 point thought economic conditions were turning down. This came after a survey in May in which a balance of 21 percentage points thought the economy was improving. Lex, Page 18</p>

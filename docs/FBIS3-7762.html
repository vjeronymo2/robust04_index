			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, Feb 28 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Chief of  Staff General Manojlo Milovanovic says that the Serb side  resents the unilateral and rash decisions of the U.N.  peacekeepers' commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael  Rose, to change the regimen of the movement of humanitarian  convoys and reopen a bridge in Sarajevo.    Commenting on Gen. Rose's decision that humanitarian convoys  as of Monday move through that war-shattered former Yugoslav  republic with armed escort and without the prior consent of the  warring parties, Gen. Milovanovic said that nothing had changed  as far as the Serbs are concerned and that aid and other convoys  would in the future continue to need Serb consent to pass  through Bosnian Serb territory. "Otherwise, we shall prevent  their movement, at arms if necessary," Milovanovic told TANJUG  late on Sunday.    Bosnian Serbs will not permit humanitarian convoys to move  through their territory without their permission and control,  because the Bosnian Serb army had on several occasions found the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to be smuggling arms and  ammunition for the Moslems.    Milovanovic said also that, if necessary, the Serb side  would  use force to prevent the reopening of Sarajevo's bridge,  announced for noon on Monday. He explained that the bridge  could be reopened only in consultations between the Serbs and  Moslems with the mediation of U.N. special envoy to former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi.    Milovanovic said that all convoys, especially aid convoys,  had always been safe only in Serb territory.    By contrast, those travelling through Moslem and Croat  territories have frequently been attacked, with dozens of relief  aid workers killed and wounded.    Incidents of this kind have never been recorded in Serb  territory.    However, the announced change in the regimen of the movement  of humanitarian convoys puts an equation mark between the Serbs  and the other two warring nations.    The attitude of the Moslem and Croat sides to humanitarian  convoys is evident from countless incidents, such as the downing  of an Italian transporter over Jablanica, the murder of a Danish  driver at Travnik, the murder of a British aid worker and the  wounding of two others at Zenica, etc.    More recently, an UNPROFOR inquiry has showed that Moslem  forces wounded five Swedish peacekeepers near Kakanj on Tuesday,  an incident that was originally blamed on the Serbs, in the  absence of all proof, with the former UNPROFOR Chief of Staff in  Bosnia-Herzegovina General Angus Ramsay going so far as to call  for NATO air strikes against the Serbs.    A day later, British U.N. troops said they had bombed out  two  Croat bunkers at Gornji Vakuf, which had been used to attack two  U.N. aid convoys.</p>

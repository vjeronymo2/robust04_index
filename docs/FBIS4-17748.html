			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- The Russian Intelligence  Service must be one of the leading think tanks working to  stabilise the situation in the world and avert threats to the  national security of the country, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said at a meeting with foreign intelligence leaders in  Moscow on Wednesday.    The president said special attention should be paid to  forecasting problems which Russia may face in the near future  and in a long-term perspective.    Although the period of global confrontation is over and the  vector of the world's development is on the whole favourable for  Russia "we must remember that its direction may change," Yeltsin  noted. He believes that "the world is standing at a crossroads,  largely because Russia, one of the great powers, is going  through the transition period."    "You should know that there are forces abroad which would  like to keep Russia in the state of uncontrolled paralysis,"  Yeltsin continued. He stressed that "only a strong, democratic  and prosperous Russian state can become a factor which will  bring the world a new perspective. It is our common task to  make this goal a reality."    "The ultimate objective of foreign intelligence is to serve  the state interests of Russia. We will strengthen it and  promote the authority of those who work in it. This is not only  the president's opinion, this is my policy," he said.    In conditions when the military budget is shrinking, the  role  of intelligence grows considerably and information it supplies  becomes a major guarantee of the country's security, the  president noted.    Yeltsin pointed out that the foreign intelligence service  has  a high reputation in Russia's system of power. "I hope that your  prompt information, analytical conclusions and recommendations  will receive only the highest marks," he said.</p>

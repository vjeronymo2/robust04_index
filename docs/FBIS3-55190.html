The Government Has Raised $500  Million To Build Another White House"]    [Text] Yesterday a deputies commission on accommodating  the State Duma once again unanimously confirmed its previous  decision: The building of the former Comecon is unsuitable for  the work of the lower parliament chamber. The deputies refused  to be convinced otherwise by Pavel Borodin, chief of the Main  Socio-Production Directorate of the presidential administration,  and his deputy Andrey Voykov, who were present at the commission  session. Both of them, however, reaffirmed: The White House  will not be ceded to the Federal Assembly. Instead Mr. Borodin  promised an early construction of a special parliament building  next to the former House of Soviets (presumably in the place of  the Krasnaya Presnya stadium). At the end of January bidding is  to be held among a number of foreign construction companies and  as of 1 February the erection of the future compound for the  Federal Assembly will begin, planned to be completed by 1  January 1995. The compound includes an administrative building  (360,000 square meters) and a hotel for the deputies (700  suites, mostly of three and four rooms). Some $500 million is  earmarked for this. As one of the deputies noted, precisely  this sum is required to implement a conversion program in the  military industrial complex. A source in the Russia's Choice  parliamentary faction told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent  that his impression is that everything is being done to make the  Duma monolithic in its opposition to the executive branch, since  Russia's Choice also favored the Duma's presence in the White  House. The former Comecon building itself is being hectically  prepared for the deputies' arrival. True, its present lessees  -- for the most part commercial (and fairly well known)  structures -- have not yet moved out. As people from the  presidential administration have promised, this will probably  happen by the end of the month and by 1 March the refurbishing  of the building will be completed. At present it lacks  telephones, service areas, furniture, and various technical  equipment. With respect to the latter NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  confidential source commented tersely: It has been stolen,  although judging by the documents, everything is in perfect  order.    It can therefore be assumed that after its first session the  Duma will have to interrupt its work for one to one and a half  months. Incidentally, chances are that there will be no joint  session of both chambers on 11 January since Boris Yeltsin is  not planning to address it. On one hand, this is not provided  for under the new constitution; on the other, he apparently does  not want to let the deputies into the Kremlin and report  anything to them. According to sources in the president's  administration, there are plans for the president to address an  assembly of deputies who will be invited to the Kremlin as a  group of citizens.    Many questions are scheduled for the first session's agenda:  the election of the Duma chairman and his deputies, the  approval of the number of committees and their leadership, and  the adoption of interim rules of procedure. This agenda can  apparently be fulfilled only if consensus is reached at the  ongoing preliminary consultations between factions. At present,  however, it has been achieved on only one issue -- the rejection  of the premises assigned to the Duma. The candidacy of the  speaker has not been determined yet, and it is not even clear  according to which principle he will be elected. Russia's  Choice, although it continues talks on the chairman candidacy  with the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian Federation  Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is  still committed to the idea of electing him from among  representatives of small factions. As one Russia's Choice  deputy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, these factions  include primarily Yabloko and Women of Russia, and their  candidates, Vladimir Lukin, Anatoliy Adamishin, and Alevtina  Fedulova, although the last two figures arouse objections: the  first within his own faction, the second from the negotiating  partners. With respect to electing four deputy speakers on a  party principle (this idea is a kind of compromise between large  and small factions) with the speaker representing some  non-influential group, Russia's Choice is fairly well disposed,  hoping that it will manage to uphold the concept of a weak Duma  leadership. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in the  words of its chairman, is ready to swap "its" deputy for three  committees, although in the general interfactional bargaining it  is laying claim to the international affairs committee, whereas  the Russian Federation Communist Party wants the defense and  security committee, and the Agrarian Party wants the agrarian  committee and the constitutional and judicial reform committee.  Russia's Choice is claiming chairmanship in all financial and  economic committees, of which there will be two or three.    At present, however, the communists and the agrarians have  decided to abandon the idea of proportional formation of the  Duma bodies and of a weak speaker, which would perpetuate the  situation as it emerged prior to the elections where no one  gained any advantage. They are slowly gathering a majority  coalition and want it to receive leading posts and also to form  a certain omnipotent Duma Council -- something like the  presidium in the former Supreme Soviet. This was reported to  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent by a source from the  Russia's Choice faction.</p>

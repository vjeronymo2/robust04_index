			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: The cost of fear - Putting a price on risk is not an easy task, but it may help to save lives 'RISK IS about fear, and fear is a shapeless and emotional fact about the human condition,' surmises John Rimington, director general of Britain's Health and Safety Executive, the industrial safety regulator. Putting figures on everyday risks in a formal, scientific way to help judge whether fear is justified, and how much should be spent to avoid it, is the target of a five-day conference in London this week, organised by the HSE. The conference comes at an appropriate moment. The Schipol airport tragedy, splashed over the front of newspapers on the opening day, was a blatant reminder not just of the possibility of disaster but also of the cost of alternatives, such as relocating airports outside cities. But risk is everywhere, not just in obviously hazardous activities such as flying or running an oil platform or chemical refinery. On a wider front, risk assessment deserves attention because of the tangle in which some environmentalists are thrashing. It is now clear that the costs of cleaning up the environment can be extremely high. Many companies and governments are starting to question whether every last strand of the 'green' legislation passed so enthusiastically by the EC and US in the past decade justifies that cost. The concern about EC water directives voiced recently by Ofwat, the UK water industry regulator, which is worried about customers' bills soaring, is a case in point. So 'cost-benefit analysis' has become the buzzword in Brussels and in many think-tanks. But if the costs of cleaning up are obvious, the benefits to human life and health from spending a little bit more are often far from clear. Answers do not come easily. Risk assessment is a sober, technical subject, combining the mathematics of probability with detailed projections of failure in many interlocking pieces of equipment. The HSE has complimented itself on having produced a 'straightforward account for the general public' of the risks of nuclear power in its report* this week. But the method of weighing up risk is straightforward, if the details are not, and can be set out in three main steps. First, the probability of an unwanted 'event' needs to be judged. An event can be either a disaster such as an industrial explosion, or a continuous process such as pesticide contamination of drinking water. One of the virtues of the HSE's report on nuclear power is that it is not shy of including human error in the models - such as the mistaken decision of the operators of the Three Mile Island plant to shut off its water sprinklers - although this makes the conclusions less precise. Biological predictions often pose more problems than engineering ones. Judging the connection between exposure to toxic substances and cancer later in life pushes at the limits of the underlying science. The next step is to put a value on the damage caused if the event happens. It is highly controversial because it usually means putting a value on human life. Almost everyone would say that their lives are beyond price. Nor do they find it much easier to put a price on other people's lives if asked, for example, how many lives the construction of the Channel Tunnel is worth. Or - one of many weaknesses in Ofwat's claim that it will consult water customers about desired standards - how many deaths are justified by Pounds 50 a year off the water bill. However, if the question makes no sense to the individual, it does at governmental level. For years the accepted method in cost-benefit analysis was to put the value of a life at the estimated loss of earnings, plus a notional sum for the grief of bereaved relatives. Instead, recent studies have looked at what people pay to avoid danger - sturdier cars, safer airline, women taking taxis home after dark - and have tried to extrapolate from that. On that basis, a 1987 Department of Transport study put a minimum value for preventing a death of Pounds 660,000 in today's prices. The HSE has adopted this in its nuclear power study, although it stresses that this is a minimum. The last step is at least as debateable as the value of life: deciding on the level of risk that is tolerable. The route adopted by the HSE is to compare unfamiliar risks with other more familiar ones that people seem to find acceptable. It points out that the risk of being killed in a traffic accident is one person in 10,000 a year, and the risk of a woman dying in childbirth is one in 13,000. It comments too that people are willing to accept higher risks for something they have control over, such as driving or horse riding, but want far lower levels of risk in those they do not control, such as water quality or nuclear power. Sometimes, where the public's judgment of a risk is not the same as the scientists', more information can help reassure. However, there are some hazards that people do not want to face at all, even if the likelihood is tiny. Many seem to rate death by radiation as much worse than death by traffic accident. It would be wrong to dismiss these preferences as 'irrational' says the HSE, and there may be little that education could do to change them. The enormous public sensitivity over water standards may fall in this category. One of the HSE's conclusions is that safety standards in any future nuclear power stations should be set at a level where the risk to the public is at least 10 times less than that of a traffic accident. It points out that this is a much higher standard than used for many non-nuclear plants. An HSE study of the risk of the installations at Canvey Island on the Thames several years ago, now accepted as model procedure by risk analysts, concluded that after safety improvements, the risks had reduced to a chance of one in 5,000 of a serious accident which might produce more than 1,500 casualties. The choice of the tolerable level of risk is a matter for voters and politicians. But in putting figures on the reasons for fear, from a position beyond the heat of environmental debate, the formal assessment of risk does at least start to make the choices intelligible. *The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations, HSE, HMSO, Pounds 12.00.</p>

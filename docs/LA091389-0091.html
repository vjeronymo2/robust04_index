			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WIDENSIN 2ND QUARTER  </P> <P> The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. trade widened to $30.99 billion  from April through June as the country suffered its first shortfall in the  category covering overseas investment earnings in three decades, the government  reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the current account deficit rose by 2 percent over  the January-March imbalance of $30.39 billion. It marked the second consecutive  quarterly setback and provided fresh evidence, economists said, of how  entrenched America's trade problems are.  </P> <P> The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most  important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but  also trade in services.  </P> <P> The deficit in merchandise trade actually narrowed during the spring, falling  by 2.3 percent to $27.7 billion, the smallest imbalance in merchandise trade in  more than four years.  </P> <P> However, this improvement was offset by the first deficit in the services  category since 1958.  </P> <P> That category, which primarily reflects investment earnings between countries,  registered a deficit of $176 million in the second quarter, compared with a  surplus of $1.5 billion in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Analysts called the services deficit an ominous sign as foreigners begin to  earn more and more on their U.S. investments, making it even more difficult for  the country to close its trade gap.  </P> <P> "The negative services payment is a distressing omen. We are now paying more to  foreigners on their U.S. investments than we are earning on our assets in  foreign countries and that is worrisome," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for  the Boston Co.  </P> <P> While the spring services deficit was small and could well be revised away in  coming reports, analysts said the trend is clear: The United States will be  forced to transfer more and more wealth overseas to service the growing level  of foreign holdings in the United States.  </P> <P> John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, an economic consulting  company, said he expected the services trade category would be in deficit  throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the United States is the world's  largest debtor country.  </P> <P> Simply put, that means foreigners own more in U.S. assets than Americans own  overseas. America's net debtor position stood at $532.5 billion at the end of  last year and is expected to worsen by another $120 billion this year.  </P> <P> Many economists predict that U.S. living standards will begin declining because  financing the growing foreign debt burden will make less funds available in  this country.  </P> <P> "We are a half-trillion dollars in debt to the rest of the world and debtors  must eventually pay the piper," Hagens said.  </P> <P> In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of the current  account deficit, U.S. foreign aid payments and pensions to Americans living  overseas, fell by 11.4 percent to $3.1 billion in the spring.  </P> <P> The current account deficit reflects the sum of the deficits in services,  merchandise trade and so-called unilateral transfers.  </P> <P> For the first six months of the year, the current account deficit ran at an  annual rate of $122.76 billion, down only slightly from the 1988 deficit of  $126.55 billion.  </P></p>

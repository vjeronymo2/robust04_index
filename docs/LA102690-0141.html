			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE PROMPTS CALL FOR INCREASED SECURITY AT INGLEWOOD SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Inglewood residents called on school board members during an emotionally  charged meeting Wednesday night to beef up campus security to insulate students  and employees from street violence.  </P> <P> The outcry was prompted by the deaths of three high school students in two  off-campus shooting incidents earlier this month and a previously undisclosed  holdup of cafeteria workers on a junior high school campus last week.  </P> <P> Board members agreed to revive an anti-gang task force made up of community  members and to participate in a march Saturday morning protesting the recent  incidents of violence.  </P> <P> Board members said budget constraints make the hiring of more security officers  difficult, but parents and employees insisted that something must be done.  </P> <P> "We need more security," said Leah Stephens, president of the PTA at Inglewood  High School. "How would you feel if you had to fight gang members to get to  your office? How would you feel if when you left at 5:30 in the evening, you  had to fight gang members up and down the street? This is what our children  have to deal with on a daily basis."  </P> <P> School employees described an incident in which a masked man armed with a  shotgun held up 15 Monroe cafeteria workers shortly before 6:30 a.m. Oct. 16.  The man pointed his gun at the women, who were preparing meals for the day, and  demanded their purses.  </P> <P> Cafeteria manager Susie Martin said she distracted the gunman, allowing the  other workers to run to the back of the kitchen. As the workers fled, the man  fired a shot into the ceiling, then ran out of the cafeteria without taking any  valuables. There were no injuries.  </P> <P> "I don't feel safe," Martin told the board. " . . . I'm not here for sympathy.  I'm here for security."  </P> <P> Johnnie Thomas, the district's security chief, said school police officers  patrolled the Monroe campus on the morning of the holdup as they usually do.  The gunman arrived on campus after an officer had made his early-morning check  of the school.  </P> <P> Thomas said that his department is understaffed but that the answer to the gang  problem must begin in Inglewood's homes.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem is getting someone at home who cares," he said. "If the  parents don't teach them, the streets will teach them."  </P> <P> Thomas said parents must prevent their children from adopting the skewed value  system of the street.  </P> <P> "When a kid goes to juvenile hall, he comes back to the 'hood beefed up from  pumping iron, and his friends respect him even more," Thomas said.  </P> <P> Deputy Inglewood Police Chief James Butts told board members that the upswing  in gang violence is a countywide phenomenon and that officers are working to  bring it under control.  </P> <P> Board President Lois Hill-Hale invited the community to a meeting at 9 a.m.  today to revive a communitywide anti-gang task force that was first formed in  1987. A march planned for 8 a.m. Saturday to commemorate Red Ribbon Week, a  national anti-drug program, will also protest street violence, Hill-Hale said.  Both events will take place at the district's headquarters at 401 S. Inglewood  Ave.  </P> <P> Hill-Hale said the school officials ought to work more closely with the city  and its Police Department to provide alternatives to gangs.  </P> <P> In an interview Thursday, Mayor Edward Vincent said he would revive an  intergovernmental relations committee of city and school officials to work out  problems jointly. Vincent, who is facing four challengers in his reelection  attempt, said that after next month's election, he plans a major offensive  against gangs.  </P> <P> "We're going to take care of the gang situation," he said. "You can quote me on  that."  </P> <P> Eleanor Owen, an English teacher at Inglewood High, was skeptical that the  board went far enough in addressing the problem.  </P> <P> "I don't think a candlelight vigil or memorial service is going to cut it," she  told the board.  </P> <P> "Every day, I tell students, gang members who are in my classes, to pull up  their pants, remove their belts and take out their shoelaces," Owen said in an  interview later, referring to gang attire. "You ask the class how many have  been affected by gang violence and everyone raises their hands."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- In the current controversy over  the distribution of larger tax burdens as of 1995 by means of a  solidarity surcharge or a supplementary tax, FRG Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) is  already aiming at the reduction of the top tax rates as of 1996.  In order to promote economic development, the top income and  corporate tax rates are to be standardized and brought below 45  percent in a three-stage tax reform. This is urgently necessary  in international competition, the minister told DPA on Wednesday  [30 March]. Moreover, those taxes that are independent of yield,  such as the trade capital tax and the property tax, have to be  reduced. The Social Democratic Party of Germany, however,  confirmed its intention to increasingly burden "major property"  by a land tax, a property tax, and an inheritance tax.    In 1993 the top income and corporate tax rates were further  split. They are currently 45 percent for corporations, such as  stock corporations, and 47 percent for trade or business income  from partnerships, while the tax on private income, which also  includes income from leasing and renting, is still 53 percent.  According to Rexrodt, the planned tax cuts still have to be  coordinated within the FDP and the coalition. However, "from  the economic minister's point of view, 1996 is the date when the  top rates have to be cut," including the taxation of private  income.    However, the financial situation has to be taken into  account. Therefore, a reform in several stages as in the 1980's  is required. This also includes increasing the fiscal  subsistence minimum, for which the Constitutional Court has  called. The question of when the solidarity surcharge can be  removed also depends on the financial situation and the economic  development in eastern Germany, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tace faces fresh clash over choice of chairman INSTITUTIONAL investors are today expected to reopen a campaign to place their own choice of chairman on the board of Tace, the environmental control group whose founder, Mr Jock Mackenzie, they ousted last year. The moves came as shares in the stock rose 12p to 162p in active trading amid speculation that Mr Bob Morton, the City financier, may be stalking Tace through Southwind which holds a 4.4 per cent stake. The institutions, led by Framlington - with a 16 per cent stake - and Norwich Union - with 5 per cent - are understood to remain deeply unsatisfied with Sir David Nicolson, who replaced Mr Mackenzie as chairman. They had favoured Mr Michael Beckett, who joined the board as a director but quit without explanation last week on the same day that Hoare Govett resigned as the company's brokers. The institutions are anxious that a financial restructuring that was hurriedly announced last Friday should not take place before a full independent audit into the company's activities and management has been carried out. Mr Beckett was also understood to be pushing for the audit. His departure is thought to have triggered Hoare Govett's after only three weeks as the company's broker. It was not clear whether the institutions would be demanding that Mr Beckett be installed as chairman. Before his resignation he was accused of working too closely with the institutions and with trying to install his own people. Sir David said that if he was going to be chairman he would have to be allowed to run the company without constant interference. The revolt appears to demonstrate an increasing willingness by institutions to flex muscles in what they see as cases of poor corporate governance. The Tace move comes only a day after the removal of Mr John Fletcher, the chairman of Budgens, following pressure from Electra, IEP and Gartmore. The proposed capital reorganisation involves Tace buying the 49 per cent of Goring Kerr, the process control equipment affiliate, which it currently does not control. It would also involve a rights issue. Tace said the restructuring would cut overheads and lead to significant tax savings and improved synergy between the two companies. Mr Steve Walton, the Tace company secretary, said yesterday that there had been no discussions with Mr Morton and that there was no sign that Southwind was behind yesterday's active share dealing.</p>

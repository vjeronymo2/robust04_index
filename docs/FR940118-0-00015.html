			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to the elimination of a minimum 10 percent evaluation following treatment of cancer under diagnostic code 7528. One commenter stated that malignancies of this kind result in a ``permanent mental fixation.'' Another commenter stated that there may be residual damage to the genitourinary system from radiation treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VA acknowledges that disability often follows cancer treatment, and residual impairment of the genitourinary system will accordingly be rated as either voiding or renal dysfunction. Although any residual warranting compensation would be ascertainable on VA examination, the existence of such residuals cannot be presumed in every case. Psychiatric or any other complications are subject to service connection under 38 CFR 3.310(a) of this chapter. The recurrence of cancer at any time would warrant restoration of the 100 percent evaluation. Rating the actual residuals will in our judgment allow assignment of an evaluation reflecting the true severity of the individual disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that because the proposed amendments included reductions in certain percentage evaluations, VA was exceeding the GAO mandate to review the rating schedule for the purpose of updating medical terminology and evaluation criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VA does not concur. VA's mandate to review the rating schedule derives from the statutory authority which Congress has granted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt a schedule of ratings, including the authority to establish percentage evaluations (38 U.S.C. 1155). Although GAO may recommend that the Secretary review the schedule from a particular perspective, it has no authority to limit the scope of any review which the Secretary subsequently conducts under that statutory authority. The GAO recommendations resulted from a study finding that the rating schedule uses outdated medical terminology, contains ambiguous rating criteria, and does not reflect recent medical advances. If it is to conduct a good faith review, particularly when considering medical advances, VA cannot preclude the possibility that some evaluations may be changed. Congress, in fact, specifically foresaw such a possibility when it enacted legislation to amend 38 U.S.C. 1155 in order to protect the level of evaluations assigned under superseded rating criteria. (See 137 Cong. Rec. H5928 (daily ed. July 29, 1991) (statement of Rep. Montgomery).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

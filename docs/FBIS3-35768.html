Laar and Klaus discussed fostering economic cooperation  between the two countries. They decided a memorandum on a  free-trade agreement needs to be drawn up, and preparations for  signing an agreement before the end of the year must be started.    The two premiers noted that both Estonia and the Czech  Republic have chosen a course of radical reforms which, however,  seems to be the only resultful policy. Due to the similarity of  the two countries' economic policies, their positions coincide  almost fully even without prior coordination.    The meeting also touched on security issues, particularly  security guarantees for Central and East European countries.    Laar and Klaus agreed that the Czech Government head will  visit Estonia this spring. The visit will probably take place  in May.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Procordia On the surface, Volvo's agreement with the Swedish government to carve up their joint interest in Procordia looks a rare example of a deal that pleases all sides. The Swedish government comes away with a focused pharmaceutical company which will be easier to privatise than Procordia's existing ragbag of businesses. Thanks to its Italian acquisitions the new Procordia will have critical mass in world drug markets. Volvo, meanwhile, acquires the cash-flow of Procordia's consumer products division and an earnings stream which will satisfy Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar's - albeit questionable - ambition to offset the cyclical nature of his automotive business. Still, the government seems to have come off best. Volvo has given up any aspiration to own a majority stake in the new Procordia. There is no longer a risk of other shareholders becoming an abused minority after privatisation. Volvo's right to restore its stake to 35 per cent may instead provide additional support for the shares. The new Procordia would have more appeal if Volvo were to exit the drug business completely, but Swedish business remains too nationalist for that. The initial hurdle for Volvo is the cost - of some SKr3.5bn on the basis of yesterday's valuation - of buying out minority shareholders in Procordia's consumer products business. Volvo may consider the resolution of the Procordia uncertainty strengthens its hand in merger negotiations with Renault, but that deal hardly seems imminent. While they wait, Volvo shareholders might ponder why they should increase their interest in mineral water, beer, matches and hotels, if Procordia has become more marketable without them.</p>

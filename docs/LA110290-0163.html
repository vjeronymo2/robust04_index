			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> PETITIONERS WANT HELIPAD REMOVED  </P> <P> Tired of helicopter noise, Leisure World residents this week presented  petitions to local, state and federal officials calling for Rockwell  International to move its helicopter landing pad.  </P> <P> More than 600 people signed the petition that asks Rockwell to relocate the  helipad so it will not face apartments for seniors along Westminster Avenue.  </P> <P> The apartments were built in 1963 and a permit was issued for the helipad in  1967, when officials estimated there would be about four flights daily. But as  the Rockwell facility has grown over the years, the flight level has increased  to about 10 daily, company officials estimate.  </P> <P> Leisure World residents say helicopter noise levels exceed city standards. Tom  Lyon, a Leisure World leader, said the helicopter noise level has reached  almost 80 decibels. City noise standards call for 55 decibels, with higher  levels acceptable depending on their duration, said city Planning Director Lee  Whittenberg.  </P> <P> Rockwell has also surveyed helicopter noise, and preliminary findings show that  the helipad does not exceed the city's noise limits, Rockwell spokeswoman B.J.  Snyder said.  </P> <P> The company has considered moving the helipad to the other side of the  facility, but noise there would affect existing homes and a proposed housing  development, Snyder said. The Mola Development Corp. has been seeking approval  to build 335 houses on the Hellman Ranch property that would border the  Rockwell property.  </P> <P> The city will not take action on the petitions until Rockwell's helicopter  noise reports are received and studied, Whittenberg said.  </P> <P> The Leisure World residents also petitioned the state Coastal Commission and  the Federal Aviation Administration, saying the agencies circumvented state  environmental regulations by not requiring an environmental study or holding a  public hearing before approving the helipad.

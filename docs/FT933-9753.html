			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Top of the class, for now - The Bottom Line IF THE stock market were a school class, banks' traditional seat would be at the back. But after a couple of decades of flicking paper pellets and creating trouble, the banks have pushed themselves to the front. A year of exceptional study has left teachers amazed at their transformation. Amazed, but still watchful over whether the new star pupils are about to relapse into their old ways. This might be the appropriate attitude for the investor looking at bank shares. The FT-A bank sector has outperformed the FT-A All Share by 30 per cent over the past year. It is time to take stock. There are three possibilities: banks will continue to outperform because of improved earnings and the ability to raise dividends; they will drop back as the traditional rally out of recession subsides; or their shares will start to perform differently as their performance diverges. The interim earnings figures announced this week provide some clues as to what to expect. The straightforward profit figures appeared very good, with both Midland Bank - now a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings ' and Barclays raising pre-tax profits sixfold on the first six months of last year. But profits are not a good guide, for two reasons. One is that banks are rebounding from poor pre-tax figures - in Barclays' case a full-year loss in 1992 ' largely caused by debt provisions. National Westminster's provisions fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 641m as the recovery took hold. The second is that clearing banks are such large, complicated businesses that their total profits are a mixture of elements. The core franchise of branch-based lending can contribute less than other parts, such as the investment bank arms or the sale of other retail financial products. Three elements of the results were notable: Banks made strong profits in foreign exchange and capital markets, both because of currency volatility and because it has been a good time for securities houses handling bond and equity issues. These earnings are vulnerable in the second half of the year, although conditions remain favourable. Banking business in the UK came under pressure. There was flat and even falling demand for loans, and the fall in base rates cut income on deposits, narrowing the 'spread' between interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities. The only bright part was growth in mortgages. Signs started to emerge of banks becoming over-capitalised. This is a departure, since banks' capital has been depleted in the past two years by their inability to make enough money to retain earnings after paying dividends. Barclays retained earnings of Pounds 84m, its first such earnings in two years. Lloyds Bank has achieved more consistent earnings, adding Pounds 171m to capital this half-year. It already has a strong ratio of capital to assets and Brian Pitman, its chief executive, was driven to muse this week about returning its spare cash to shareholders in some form. Beyond the figures, there is the sense that bank management is better than it was. Bank executives were emphasising this week that their traditional competition just to be bigger is over. Instead, they are now concentrating on return on equity, and are prepared to ditch poor businesses. What does all this mean for shares? Slippage against outperformance depends above all on whether the star pupils really have changed their ways. The rise of banks of the past year has been based both on the expectation of recovery, and confidence in management. The earnings recovery element of outperformance was largely thought to have discounted six months ago. But Barclays and NatWest, both bought on recovery prospects, have performed well since. The possibility of more growth for such banks - and probably for the sector - depends on earnings. This week's results sent mixed messages. Although the very strong securities earnings pushed up NatWest and HSBC, the underlying slackness of loan demand raised questions over banks' core profitability. Worries over banking earnings may mean sector outperformance will not continue. The competence of management will be watched closely. Barclays has provoked debate by promising to find a new chief executive role, and this week unveiled a surprise Pounds 285m US loss. Further accidents could undermine the improved reputation of managements and affect sentiment. The sense that banks' outperformance may have peaked means that analysts are advising investors to switch among bank shares. Playing safe would imply concentrating on dividend yields. This may involve switching toward well-capitalised banks, such as Lloyds or TSB, that may hand back cash. The riskier play would be to stick with the market's faith in the recovery potential of banks such as Barclays and NatWest. This means not only believing that earnings will continue to stay strong, but that poor pupils have mended their ways. Teachers get paid for faith; investors may be, or they may not.  -------------------------------------------------- UK BANK INTERIM PRE-TAX PROFITS  --------------------------------------------------                        1993        1992                         Pds         Pds Abbey Nat.             301m        270m Barclays               335m       (293m) Lloyds                 498m        369m Midland                385m         60m NatWest                421m        211m  --------------------------------------------------</p>

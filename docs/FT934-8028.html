			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: JC Penney sets record but Dayton Hudson slips JC PENNEY, the fourth-largest US retailer, maintained its strong sales and earnings momentum in the third quarter but Dayton Hudson continued to suffer from its heavy exposure to the sluggish Californian economy. Penney, with nearly 1,300 department stores in 50 states and an extensive catalogue-sales business, said net income, before an extraordinary item, set a quarterly record at Dollars 221m, or 83 cents a share, against Dollars 186m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. In the three months to the end of October, the company took a one-time charge of Dollars 36m to cover early retirement of debt, plus a Dollars 14m provision to adjust deferred taxes. With both items included, net income was Dollars 185m or 69 cents. The earnings improvement was struck on sales up 9.1 per cent to Dollars 4.76bn. Sales in stores open for at least a year were 9 per cent ahead and mail-order sales climbed 15.2 per cent. By contrast, Dayton Hudson's results underscored the group's continuing difficulties in the discount sector. The retailer said a poor performance by Mervyn's, a clothing chain with a strong west coast presence, had contributed to a 24 per cent decline in net income to Dollars 43m, or 53 a share, from Dollars 57m, or 70 cents. Revenues showed a 7 per cent increase to Dollars 4.63bn. However, on a same-store basis, a more reliable measure of retailing strength, sales were up by only 1 per cent. Mervyn's operating profits were down significantly, while same-store sales dropped by 7 per cent.</p>

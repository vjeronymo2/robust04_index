			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to repay to the applicant a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the Bank and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available for additional AHP projects.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: Learning to bake the bread of heaven - All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some of IF YOU have always wanted to make your own bread, but have lacked even the basic skills required, a couple of days in Wales may be just what you need. At the Ty Mawr Country Hotel, in Brechfa, Dyfed, weekend sessions introduce course members to the use of yeast in cooking and the use of flavourings to create savoury and sweet breads including a Welsh favourite, bara brith. Hotel proprietor Beryl Tudhope runs the courses and numbers are limited. All the ingredients are natural, with no additives. Local stone ground flour is used from the 18th century water-powered Melin Maesdulais. Emphasis is on participation, enjoyment and personal attention. Partners are welcome and, if watching dough rise is not your scene, there are plenty of other activities to enjoy in the area. The cost for the next course from June 12-14 is Pounds 150 per person including accommodation, meals and ingredients. For non-participating partners the inclusive cost is Pounds 55. Additional nights may be booked at Pounds 30 per person including dinner, bed and breakfast. A further course is planned for November and others will be organised depending on demand.

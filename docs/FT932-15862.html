			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Swissair leads airline merger negotiations SWISSAIR yesterday claimed to be leading the negotiations among four medium-sized European airlines that could result in their merger. 'The initiative is on our side, even if we are more reserved than some others,' Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said at the Swiss airline group's annual press conference. The airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Austrian Airlines and Swissair, announced in January that they were studying ways of intensifying co-operation to improve their competitiveness. The other airlines have speculated on the talks, but Swissair has said nothing. The negotiations were very complex and decisions could not be reached quickly, Mr Loepfe said yesterday. Mr Hannes Goetz, chairman, said Swissair's objective in the negotiations was to increase the 'mutual commitment' of the partners to each other. A merger was possible, but it would take a long time and would threaten traffic rights. 'We would like to look for a form of company which could be established without the need for any change in national airline legislation or any loss of traffic rights,' Mr Goetz said. He added that the discussions were focusing on a decentralised model for operations, and that Swissair intended to maintain its global identity. Its existing co-operation agreements with Delta Air Lines of the US and Singapore Airlines were vital to this strategy, he added. Mr Loepfe predicted that many long-established airlines would disappear in the near future 'at least in their present form', but Swissair would not be one of them. He said that if a co-operation plan among the four European airlines went ahead, then the four would decide which was the best US partner. Mr Loepfe said Swissair was confident that it would make a profit this year.</p>

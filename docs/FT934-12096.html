			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Technology: Charting a new course - Claire Gooding looks at the benefits of an innovative geographical information system, in a series on getting the most out of software / Software at Work Computers are about to start sweeping away the hidebound world of dusty files, ledgers and deed boxes. This digital clean-out is being led by Sheffield City Council to simplify the often frustrating and time-consuming business of conveyancing in which the title deeds and boundaries of a property under purchase are researched. In November, Sheffield's ambitious mapping project goes live. But the system, known as a geographical information system (GIS), holds far more than maps. It represents a cross-departmental approach to problems that many UK councils, authorities, utilities and commercial organisations currently approach piecemeal. Almost any inquiry or process involving a physical location will eventually come within the scope of Sheffield's system. This includes highways and the buying, selling and development of assets. Plans, maps, references, histories of specific properties and the way they will be affected by future developments will all be brought into one geographical database. The system should end the long hours spent burrowing through old documents to make sense of disparate, often outdated, information from different documents and departments. The system is already used to simplify many jobs, mostly inside the UK council's offices. Since September, it has proved its worth to the highways and maps department. But this is after a long incubation period which held more obstacles than expected when Sheffield started looking at GIS in 1988. The need to deliver quantifiable benefits has brought about the Land Charges application. One of four current GIS projects, this saves time and money, accelerating every property purchase or sale made by the council. It will also provide the council with an income from external users, such as solicitors involved in house purchases. It was part of Sheffield's plan that GIS would be of outside interest. The vision of Malcolm Newman, the city treasurer, has brought about a system relevant to different departments outside his own spheres of finance, information technology, property and purchasing. 'Everything we do is about community-based services,' says Newman. 'Improving the services we give to Sheffield people is at the core of what we're doing. We spend a great deal of time putting pins in maps, for the targeting of resources such as playgrounds, libraries and so on, in education, recreation, housing and almost every area of operation. 'What's exciting is that we're now able to take 'flat' service information and present it. Members, for example, can see the ward profile. Suddenly people start seeing the city as one large map on which all the issues are linked. The real impact of decisions on communities can be understood.' Sheffield has taken an incremental 'building block' approach and early benefits of the system are in the saving of administration costs. The four projects are a land and property register known as Properties Terrier, a cartography facility for the preparation and maintenance of maps, a highways system recording streets, boundaries and adopted roads, and the Land Charges system, the first to be built in-house by council IT staff. This alone should accelerate the process of buying and selling, as well as generating income worth Pounds 200,000 from external users. 'Disposals are incredibly important to the council. We rely on selling land and buildings to balance our books,' explains Newman. He willingly talks not only about the scale of the project and the financial realities underpinning it, but also about the difficulties and delays in implementation. Newman's range of duties gave him a cross-departmental view of what was required and he persuaded different departments to contribute part of their budget to the project. The shared approach also meant the system had to be 'owned' by its users, not by the finance or IT departments. The appointment of chartered surveyor Jill Bungay, a senior manager in property services, as programme director for the first two phases of development ensured a user-based approach. Sheffield has looked at geographical information systems since 1988. A cross-disciplinary working party decided integration with existing IT resources was vital. It decided on an extra layer of software and hardware, using an Oracle database on Unix-based equipment, as proposed by Unisys, the US-based computer group. Unisys was contracted to supply the system and write the initial applications. The cost to Sheffield reflects a 'partnership' deal in which the city provides a prototype and a GIS show site for Unisys, which hopes to sell the system to other authorities. 'We had to be able to integrate with the GIS the information in systems we use in our day-to-day business, on housing, repairs, rent, revenue, council tax collection, benefit payments and planning applications, not just for operational use but to provide analysis,' explains Wendy Miller, head of IT. 'The idea is that the system will be productive in targeting finite resources such as siting a new school or an old people's home.' Development of the geographical system was spurred by the legal requirement on councils to have an accurate capital asset register in place by April 1994. Many of the council's duties and services rely on references to maps and plans. But maps are of different sizes, scales, ages and reliability. The area for which Sheffield is responsible is represented by 860 separate Ordnance Survey maps. None matches exactly and while Alan Platt, the IT project manager, took a 'warts and all' approach to data capture, the data was not easy to dovetail, being variable and sometimes inaccurate. In 1991, Pinpoint Analysis, a company which provides mapping information of postcodes based on grid references, was commissioned to provide a national grid OS reference for every postal address in the area for inclusion in the GIS system. The task of digitalising the city's geographical information went to QC, the Irish-based data capture company. This was a complex undertaking in view of the age of the printed maps; interpreting their content took time and effort. 'One of the problems was that, with this being a bespoke development, Unisys and ourselves were both on a large learning curve,' says Miller. The system is now able to show, on one screen, whatever view is requested of it. Ownership - by recreation, education, highways or housing committees - is shown in different colours. The lines on the screen and the 'zoom view' make it possible to take a historical view of a plot of land. This is vital for Bungay's staff, who are responsible for 5,000 properties with an annual rent-roll of Pounds 4m. 'People ringing in with inquiries or complaints - perhaps about grass-cutting - expect the local authority to either own everything, or know who does. It's time-consuming and tedious, especially when the answer might be 'no' at the end of a day's search. We can now give an answer in 30 seconds,' says Bungay. Newman is enthusiastic about the long-term potential and spin-off benefits to other parties such as health, police, water authorities and telecommunications.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esther Waugh] </F>   [Text] The post-election political diary is filling up with  decisions to be taken by the new government of national unity.  It is understood that the seven Transitional Executive Council  subcouncils are also developing recommendations for the new  government.    These recommendations, which can lead to new legislation or  amendments of existing legislation, are to be included in a  report which will be presented to the new government. However,  the Interim Constitution details a series of decisions to be  taken by the government.    Key among these steps is the appointment of the 27-member  multiparty cabinet and the allocation of portfolios. The  president, after consultation with the two deputy presidents and  the leaders of parties with more than 20 seats in the national  assembly, will appoint cabinet members.    The president is to appoint a commission on provincial  government within 30 days and a financial and fiscal commission  within 60 days.    The interim Constitution stipulates that a chairman and  deputy chairman be elected for the constitutional assembly at  its first sitting. The president is to appoint judges for the  constitutional court. A council of traditional leaders is to be  established within six months of the Constitution coming into  operation. The president is to appoint a human rights  commission within two months of the first sitting of the senate.</p>

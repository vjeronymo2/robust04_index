			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / As they say in Europe: A curious insularity 'THE PRESIDENT took us out on the terrace overlooking the south lawn and told us that we really had to promote growth in our own economies.' In Washington last Sunday this story was told by the Italian finance minister to the correspondent of Il Sole 14 Ore, among others. But Guido Carli is 75 and the incident he related took place in 1962 - the President was John F. Kennedy. The same thing happened when the Group of Seven finance ministers met in Washington last Sunday; this time it was President Bush who told the assembled ministers and central bank governors that they ought to be cutting interest rates - to promote economic recovery. So for Guido Carli little had changed. He takes a long view because he is the one man still around at this level who was actually at Bretton Woods in 1945 for the famous conference that established the post-war international monetary system. Others, however, go back little further than the Gulf War. It was Klaus Engelen in Handelsblatt of Frankfurt who observed: 'America can't lead everything,' adding 'after the Gulf War, the interest rate war. The question is now whether we go back to the experience of the crash of 1987.' That was when interest rates got out of line and there was a crisis of confidence in international co-operation. So, asked Dr Engelen, did Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, want to get another bloody nose from the Bundesbank? 'The whole interest rate campaign came after Washington realised that the Gulf War would not lift business activity . . . But a sober expression of this meeting is that leadership in war doesn't mean that on the battle fields of interest rates and inflation, America can lead the world as well.' Fortunately, Germany had found a sound ally in fighting against American monetary excesses. Norman Lamont, UK Chancellor, had come to the support of 'the embattled finance minister, Theo Waigel', Engelen said So Lamont is the second in the line of British ministers who have become minor stars in the German firmament - Chris Patten on the liberal left, Norman Lamont among the Bavarian conservatives. But Waigel relies heavily on the votes of highly of subsidised farmers for his political strength. Lamont spent a long time at the various IMF finance ministers' meetings lecturing his audience on the iniquities of the Community's Common Agricultural Policy. It may have been the support of Britain that led Roel Janssen in NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam to remark: 'The Germans stole the show - they got out of it morally strengthened.' For the French there was more than just a Euro-American row at stake. There was also clear evidence that France was caught out because it had very little to say on the row in question. And it could hardly in its present circumstances side with the Germanic and Tory puritans. Nor could it support the the US against its partners. So the only solution was to make it clear that everybody else was making a bit of a mess of things. Le Quotidien de Paris headlined its story: 'Germany Imposes Unemployment.' In La Tribune, Isabelle Croizard and Dominique Thiebaut asked whether in view of the discord, the Group of Seven had not become the Group of Nought. The outcome of all the arguing about interest rates was that the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by half a percentage point. The IMF's powerful Interim Committee had just stated that nobody should do that unless inflation and budget deficits were under control, which they are not in the US. But there was no word of criticism from anyone. They were all too glad to see the dollar fall. The meetings at the IMF which normally take place here twice a year reflect a curious fact about the US. I have quoted only a tiny part of the wealth of comment that appeared in the European press about the doings of the finance ministers. In the American press, there is little or nothing. The Washington Post has a bit about all these things, and the New York Times devotes some of its business section to these matters. But in, say, the Baltimore Sun, published a mere 45 miles away, there is less about vital matters of international finance than in the provincial Swiss press, and it is harder to get more provincial than that. So I have a proposal. Largely for the sake of the thousands of foreign reporters who flock here at such times, Washington should be moved east. Not physically, but by time zone. Harrassed Europeans anxiously watch deadlines pass as they miss their last editions at home because the news arrives too late in Washington. Bored Americans take no notice when the news does arrive. The peculiar thing is that in Europe the local news is enhanced if lots of foreign dignitaries are present. In the US any foreign presence reduces the importance of the story. Thus the only speeches Ronald Reagan made that did not appear live on that ultimate arbiter of news, CNN, were those before the annual World Bank-IMF meeting here. Yet there is perhaps another side to this insularity. Let me start by saying I have not looked at comparative coverage of the disasters that have afflicted the Kurds, largely because the views on their peculiar tragedy have been unusually uniform. Everybody has said more or less the same thing. But I saw that the widely syndicated American columnist, Leslie H. Gelb, was able to seize on this uniform and wide coverage to make a uniquely American domestic political point. 'Our movers and shakers - in the Federal Government and the media - know and care more about foreign than domestic affairs.' He added: 'America's elites can rattle off the names of the top three Kurdish leaders and skip into intricate arguments about what can be done to re-establish Iraq as the garden of Eden. But ask them about what's involved in Medicaid or Federal aid to education, and most will return a guilty smile - and guide the conversation back to Gorbachev or the Kurds.'

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: De Keersmaeker's 'Toccata' - Dance In 1988 the American choreographer, Mark Morris, moved to Belgium where he and his dance group were to spend three predictably-controversial years in residence at Brussels' Theatre Royal de la Monnaie. Now, his successor at the Monnaie, Flemish dancemaker, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, appears to be in the throes of a similar creative high. Her latest work, Toccata, presented at the QEH as part of The Turning World festival, is more solidly authoritative and eloquent than anything she has shown previously in Britain over the past decade. Performed by Rosas, the ensemble which takes its name from one of De Keersmaeker's earliest works, Toccata is a pellucid marriage of music and dance in which each form reveals and accentuates essential qualities of the other. While music has always been the driving force behind her choreography, De Keersmaeker assiduously spurns any easy relationship between aural and physical action. Her signature piece, Rosas Danst Rosas, was a trenchant exercise in mathematically-layered gesture which slashed against the music of Thierry De Mey and Peter Vermeersh. And in its repetitive sequences, pared-down motifs and stylistic rigour, it proved a blueprint for much of her subsequent work. De Keersmaeker's ability to take absolute control of the way in which she wants music and dance to interact has led to a reputation for cold formalism. But Toccata shows her buoyed by a series of contrasting piano pieces by JS Bach; she quietly engages with, rather than answers, each of these scores in movement terms. The work opens with pianist, Jos van Immerseel, playing the toccata (BWV914) of the title. Behind him, a raised, angular platform slopes down to one side. On this huge catwalk the five performers (one man, four women) absorb the music and respond to it in carefully-measured phrases. We watch a woman lifting her arms and shaping them into a perfect oval. And through this single action, soberly academic yet dazzling and poignant in effect, De Keersmaeker invokes an atmosphere of hushed concentration, giving us the first in a stream of images which cleanse the mind and sharpen the eye. In the central section, a lighter mood prevails as a two-women, one-man team play with the French Suite's allemande, gavotte and sarabande. Nothing in De Keersmaeker's writing is gratuitous, excessive or hackneyed. Likewise, her dancers address the business of rhythm, locomotion and sculpture without selling-out to the emotive qualities of Bach's music. The Turning World festival at the QEH continues with Wim Vandekeybus today and tomorrow (Box office: 071-928-8800)</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Stet could be sold off this autumn, says Iri boss Stet, the Italian state telecommunications holding company, could be privatised as soon as this autumn, Mr Michele Tedeschi, the former managing director, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome. 'I hope that the programme to start Stet's privatisation this autumn can be respected,' said Mr Tedeschi, who took over yesterday as chairman of Iri, the state holding company and Stet's parent. He said the sale would take place after the launch of Telecom Italia, the company that will be formed from the merger of Italy's five domestic telecoms groups, this month. Analysts value Stet at L27,000bn-L30,000bn (Dollars 16.8bn-Dollars 18.7bn). Meanwhile, Stet said it expected group income this year to rise about 9 per cent from last year's level of L29,800bn. It said the operating result this year would be more than 19 per cent of its 1994 income. Stet only gave percentage increases. However, they would work out to L32,480bn for turnover and an operating result of L6,170bn up from L5,250bn for the same period last year. The group forecast net debt would fall to under L20,000bn in 1994 from L22,000bn last year. As a result, the group's debt ratio would fall to 43 per cent at the end of this year, from 51 per cent at the of the previous year. Stet said that by 1997, income would amount to about L40,000bn with investments amounting to about L30,000bn. Cashflow would help bring about a further cut in net financial debt to L14,4000bn with the total debt ratio dropping to 30 per cent. Stet said the ratio between net financial debt and con-solidated income would fall to 36 per cent from 74 per cent at the end of the previous year.</p>

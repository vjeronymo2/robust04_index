			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt by </F> Thomas Neuschwander in Bonn; date not given: "`We Will No  Longer Be Able To Achieve Full Employment in the Classic Sense'"]    [Text] [Neuschwander] Four million people are unemployed.  That is the highest number since the war, and another half a  million people will lose their jobs in 1994. What are Germany's  weaknesses as a center for business?    [Rexrodt] One problem is that we have lost our "monopoly" in  technology and training. Second, we can no longer keep up with  costs. Third, we have far too many regulations and too much  bureaucracy. Fourth, we must find new markets, and that should  be viewed as finding new opportunities and not just as a risk.  We know what has to be done. The point now is to translate  that into practice.    [Neuschwander] When you took office a year ago, you said  that German companies had become complacent. Now, when you  presented the annual economic report, you gave the impression  that the crisis was over.    [Rexrodt] Companies had become complacent, and incidentally,  that was also true of the public sector. Adjustments are being  made in the economy, and that is why average unemployment in  1994 will be higher than in 1993. However, I expect things to  ease in 1995, even if only moderately. Germany will come out of  this adjustment crisis strengthened.    [Neuschwander] You have called for intensive research and  development work, but while you have been in office this budget  has not risen and has in fact declined in real terms.    [Rexrodt] I too am hardly delighted that funds for research  have been frozen. This is counterproductive. However, I would  warn against linking research and innovation in Germany solely  to growth in the federal budget. Industry faces a challenge,  and it must once again place more emphasis on high technology  and translating the results of scientific research into practice.    [Neuschwander] How can one motivate companies?    [Rexrodt] I cannot dictate anything, I can only see to it  that there is an appropriate framework. The economy must be  given clear signals for the future with regard to subsidies for  research and the areas on which there will be emphasis, in, for  example, defense. As far as the technical standards for  products and investment in future technologies are concerned,  the economy will have to find the appropriate resources by  itself.    [Neuschwander] New jobs can be created in the industries of  the future above all. What industries are those?    [Rexrodt] That is something that industry itself must know.  I do not want to decide on its behalf. However, they  undoubtedly include the aerospace sector and microelectronics.  We also have to maintain our top position in chemicals and  recover that position in genetic technology. We should not  abandon engineering but exploit our traditional strengths in  this field. In the good years, industry failed to make the  appropriate decisions -- that was the case in one or two areas  though not overall.    [Neuschwander] In the past, the industries that were  subsidized were above all the old industries, mainly steel and  coal. Has the subsidizing of key technologies been neglected?    [Rexrodt] We have put billions into key technologies. If  more is said about coal and steel that is because of the public  debate, which is very much inclined to focus on the social  problems experienced by the people working in those sectors.    [Neuschwander] Japan above all has scored successes with its  industrial strategies. Can Germany learn anything from Japan in  this respect?    [Rexrodt] The Japanese Economics Ministry is in the process  of abandoning its previous industrial policies and adopting the  kind of approach that we use. It is a mistake to pretend that  the state can decide what kind of research should or should not  be pursued. It can do that in its basic research institutions  and universities, but not in industry. The end result is like  the Kalkar plant, a disaster. Billions have gone into  microelectronics in Germany! We possess first-rate technology,  and Germany can produce microchips of the most advanced kind!  As for research in our institutes, universities, and many  companies, we are among the world leaders.    Our problem is turning research into products: Frequently,  we cannot produce in a quantity and with a cost structure that  would make us competitive internationally. This is an area in  which we have to catch up.    [Neuschwander] Statistics on patents show that we are not  even leaders in basic research. Between 1987 and 1992, there  were 216 German patents in the microelectronics field compared  to 12,688 Japanese ones.    [Rexrodt] Statistics on patents are only an indication and  not proof of the technological maturity of an economy. We  register patents differently than in other countries. In the  United States and especially Japan, every second- and third-rate  invention is registered. That does not say anything. However,  in our country, registering patents is too expensive and takes  too long.    [Neuschwander] It is regularly argued that Germany is in  danger as a center for business, because of a costs crisis. Is  the pressure of costs one reason why innovations cannot be  translated into products?    [Rexrodt] The costs crisis would not be so pronounced in  certain areas if we had high-tech products above all. However,  an economy cannot just produce high-tech products. Most  products and processes are standardized, but we can still  produce a standard product, an armchair or a table, using  high-technology processes. As far as the costs crisis is  concerned, the facts are that we are a high-wage country with  wage increases that exceed the growth in productivity.  Ancillary wage costs are a very heavy burden on our companies  and our unit labor costs are the highest among all developed  countries.    [Neuschwander] If one lowers ancillary wage costs, that  affects the social welfare safety net, and if one lowers wages,  it affects what the employee has in his pocket. You can expect  to encounter considerable resistance.    [Rexrodt] It is precisely our policy to overcome rigidity  and change structures. We do not want to dismantle the welfare  state and become a low-wage country. We want to shift the  emphasis. The social welfare system accounts for a third of  gross national expenditure. We have reduced the social welfare  budget by 15 billion German marks, that is, 1.5 percent. Thus,  no one can talk about dismantling the welfare state.    [Neuschwander] It is supposed to be a first step....    [Rexrodt] ...and if it were followed by further steps, which  is not something that I am announcing, the welfare state would  still exist and would still be the most extensive welfare state  in the world. If, over a period of two or three years, there is  no further redistribution with respect to wages and real incomes  even decline or stand at their 1989 levels, this does not mean  that there will be poverty in this country.    [Neuschwander] Germany lacks 5 million jobs. What does full  employment mean today?    [Rexrodt] It would probably be possible to achieve a certain  degree of full employment today if labor as production input  were completely mobile, but labor also means people and ties,  and it is not possible to achieve this kind of mobility. That  is why I fear that we will no longer be able to achieve full  employment in the classic sense of the 1960's. However, we  cannot allow ourselves to have 5 million unemployed people on a  long-term basis, and that will not be the case.    [Neuschwander] How do you intend to create new jobs?    [Rexrodt] To tackle unemployment, we must also make  adjustments to the employment system that will be of financial  significance. Those who receive social assistance must be given  an incentive to transfer to the regular labor market, because  they will earn more there.    [Neuschwander] If one looks at the low wages in East Europe  in, for example, the Czech Republic, can adjustments to wages  have any kind of effect whatsoever? Should the emphasis be on  structural reorganization?    [Rexrodt] The emphasis is on structural reorganization. We,  that is, the parties to collective agreements, must achieve  changed conditions in the form of more flexibility and the  appropriate wage agreements for the time being. By transferring  certain forms of work to those countries, we even have a chance  to make a contribution to overcoming the costs crisis. Things  will only become dangerous if we can no longer keep up and  transfer so much that our integrated industrial structure, our  industrial network will suffer.    [Neuschwander] Collective agreement opt-out clauses have  become fashionable in eastern Germany. Will they become  customary throughout Germany?    [Rexrodt] I am sure of that. There will be more room for  maneuver, and in a few years we will have a labor market that  cannot be compared to the present one, a more flexible labor  market in the sense that people will be able to work 10 hours a  week, or 20, or 50, or 70. Whether working hours are to be  extended or reduced will become completely a thing of the past.    [Neuschwander] Anyone who banks on courageous innovations  and investment finds it difficult to obtain capital in Germany.  What has to be changed?    [Rexrodt] We have start-up capital and other assistance  programs. In providing capital, the banks perform a traditional  risk assessment and then make a slight deduction, but that does  not....    [Neuschwander] ...so one's own home is the necessary  security...?    [Rexrodt] ...exactly. However, I am by no means criticizing  the banks. Unlike a country such as the United States, there  are not enough private sources of venture capital on our venture  capital scene. This not an institutional, but a psychological  problem. I do not have a recipe for that.    [Neuschwander] Incentives can be created in the form of  higher depreciation?    [Rexrodt] That is exactly what we do not want, because it  means that the risk is borne by the state, whereas the risk  should be borne by the private sector.    [Neuschwander] You advocate an intensive dialogue between  political, business, and scientific circles. What has been  lacking until now?    [Rexrodt] In the past, dialogue was better with the trade  unions than with business, better in any case than dialogue with  the top business organizations. There was something of a  communication problem between business and the state as a result  of personal animosities on the part of certain representatives.  Those have been overcome, even though I still see that there  are problems.    In the case of scientific circles, discussion was  unfortunately confined to financial problems and qualitative  issues were talked about too little. I support as a matter of  urgency the introduction of qualitative standards for colleges  and institutes that would enable one to link the funds allocated  to a college or institute to its performance, or a system under  which the pay of professors or scientific personnel would be  based more on performance.    [Neuschwander] So, how will Germany's economic structure  change by the year 2000?    [Rexrodt] The services sector will undoubtedly expand, and  the role of manufacturing will decline. Mining will also  definitely decline. Steel will have to make adjustments. There  will definitely be a structural slimming down in certain areas  of manufacturing. Some areas will be transferred to low-wage  countries.    All sectors connected with the environment will experience  an  upswing, and that will also apply to transportation, aviation,  the railroads and the automobile industry. Above all, we will  experience a boom on an unprecedented scale in the  telecommunications industry.    [Neuschwander] What status will the trades have in a German  economy with an emphasis on technology?    [Rexrodt] If one knows a trade, one will always be able to  make a living, and that is equally true of both production and  services, because they are geared toward people's immediate  needs. Things will always be repaired, renovated, and produced.  That is why I believe it is more likely that the trades will  increase their share of the national product.</p>

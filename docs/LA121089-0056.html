			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: TIMELY LESSON ON AIRPORT ARRIVALS  </P> <P> This is a season of airports. Half of you reading this column will be arriving  in them from somewhere. The other half of you will be meeting someone there. It  is important for you to know how airlines work.  </P> <P> Many of you who are meeting planes will call the airport before you leave home  to find out if the flight is on time. If it makes you feel better, by all means  do call. But please know that no one will answer the phone. The monitor at the  airport, no matter what time of the day or night you check it, will always list  your plane on the "final approach" or "on time."  </P> <P> "On time" is a real enigma. When people complained that planes were notoriously  late, the airlines did some creative scheduling to correct the situation. They  just added 30 minutes to all their arrival times. A flight that normally takes  50 minutes now shows 80 minutes, so that when it arrives "on time," you're not  sure if it is the "real" time it takes to fly or the padded time that is logged  for the FAA.  </P> <P> Timing is everything when you are meeting people at the airport. You cannot be  too early or too late. If you are early and enjoying the luxury of breathing  normally and perhaps reading a newspaper, there will invariably be a  last-minute gate change that will necessitate your catching a shuttle and going  to another terminal. If you arrive "on time," there is the strong possibility  that the plane is arriving on the "real" time and didn't need the padded time.  In that event, do not pass security and collect your car keys out of the dish;  go directly to baggage claim.  </P> <P> I fly a lot, and over the years I've heard some of the most creative reasons in  the world for planes arriving late. "Bad weather" is a goldie oldie. However,  bad weather never is a problem at the gate. It occurs only after you are on the  airplane and holding, sealed away from a phone and other planes. Another reason  is, "We're waiting for late-arriving baggage to be boarded." (When pigs fly,  they wait for baggage.)  </P> <P> "Someone left a cargo door open" gives you a warm glow, as does, "We seem to be  missing a crew." A few weeks ago, I was detained a half-hour when our plane  became surgically attached to a jetport.  </P> <P> There's not a whole lot you can do about the hours spent at airports. Flying is  still the quickest and probably the safest way to travel. I just kick back and  people-watch. Every once in a while, you'll get a smile from a first-time  flier, like the one a few weeks ago who alighted pale, disheveled and shaken,  lamenting: "It was terrible up there. The captain said we had a tail wind all  the way!"  </P></p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Stringfellow liquidation STRINGFELLOW Enterprises, owner of nightclubs in London and the US, last night said it had gone into voluntary liquidation as a result of difficulties at its three US venues, Michael Skapinker writes. The company said its London nightclub, Stringfellows, would remain open. Nightclubs in New York, Los Angeles and Miami have sought Chapter 11 protection under US bankruptcy laws. The company said it was unlikely that they would be able to repay money owed to the London club, by which they had been funded. The Miami club had closed and was up for sale. The company said Mr Peter Stringfellow, the nightclub's founder, would concentrate on his UK business and planned a second club in London.</p>

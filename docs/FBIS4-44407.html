Reform before that can be divided roughly into two stages. In  the first stage (1978-1991), reform was launched in a sequence  from countryside to city, from allocation to production, from  enterprise operation rights to ownership rights, from adjusting  prices to relaxing them, and from a consumption market to a  capital market, having chosen gradual advancement as the way of  reform. This suits China's practical situation, and especially  suits its system and developmental background. The successes  attained in the primary stage of reform have provided the  impetus for the whole economic system to take an important step  towards shifting to the socialist market economic system.    Although the first stage of reform cannot be described  simply  by carrying forward a single project or by an isolated force  penetrating deeply into reform, still, a synthesized set of  reform supports was not really launched. The reform strategy  chosen was supervision by division of rights and transmission of  profits for steady advancement; at the outset, the ultimate goal  for changing the whole system was unclear, so reform could be  done only through taking each step cautiously, "fording the  river while touching each stone at the river bottom," which  definitely limited to some degree its width, depth and progress.    After Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech during his southern  China trip in 1992, and the 14th CPC Conference's positioning  the wholesale changeover of the economic system to the  "socialist market economy" as the overriding policy, the theory  of reform reached a new level. Once the goals of reform were set  out, there was motivation to shift to the new stage of economic  reform, and the reform strategy selected shifted from gradual  progress to acceleration, from supporting parts to a whole set  of supports, from research and experimentation to a  comprehensive plan. However, speeding up reform and the set of  reforms requires further perfecting and detailed consideration  and preparation. The reform of 1993 was conducted against just  such a background. Viewed from the strategic level of reform,  1993 was a year which pushed reform to accomplish a periodic  transition, a year of theoretical conclusions and designing  plans for the approaching complete set of reforms; meanwhile, it  also set out some reform steps to match up with developing the  market economy on a new level.    Because the new stage of reform is more strongly  characterized by comprehensiveness and continuity, we cannot ask  whether the reforms of one particular year were significant and  outstanding achievements. Rather, we should base our evaluation  on the whole entity and the long term. Especially since the  problems which exist in the current economic operations process  were brought on for the most part by conflicts between dual  channel systems, unavoidable when shifting from a commodity  economy to a market economy. Although "strengthening  macroeconomic adjustment and control" and leading into the  parameters for adjusting parallel systems in 1993 did not  completely eliminate the traditional means of planned economic  adjustment, the flexible operations of "microeconomic  adjustment" and strengthening finances, especially banks' key  role in macroeconomic management, have brought under control the  basic key elements of the macroeconomic adjustment system  linking with the market economy. Of course, it is the  economists' responsibility and duty to confront current  problems, analyze their outstanding causes, determine ways of  resolving them, and propose countermeasures aimed at speeding up  reform in the new stage, especially in 1994. It is also the  basic starting point of this research report.  <H5>  Reform Achievements in the Transition </H5>   In 1993, the central government gathered various forces  which  drew up plans for comprehensive reform, and proposed a  comprehensive set of reform plans, starting with the five areas  of finance, revenue, investment, enterprises, and social  insurance. This is a major achievement, defining the activity  and mission of reform in the new stage under the prerequisite of  summarizing the experience of the previous 15 years of reform.  It is certain that since 1984, every larger scale reform had a  plan, but these were either outlined or just promoted in a  single item, without a comprehensive supporting set in  accordance with the demands of the market economy. However,  1993s plan was a substantial supporting set of reform plans  based on marketization, which prepared for comprehensive  creation of the system in the second stage.    In the timely, sequential process of reform, distribution of  content and force of reform is not balanced and in equal value;  some years have more reform content while some have less  content. Usually, in years with less reform content the focus is  often on reorganizing and handling the economic order, resolving  outstanding new contradictions and problems, creating a better  environment for new stages of reform. The "reorganization and  handling" of 1989-1991 and the "macroeconomic control and  adjustment" of July to October 1993 were both of this sort. But,  the former was not only a comprehensive, long term shrinkage of  the economy, forcefully implemented, it was also carried out  through project cutbacks and termination of investment by  administrative orders handed down from higher to lower levels,  in an attempt to control increasing demand through a low growth  rate, bringing about an artificial "balance between supply and  demand". The result was that three years' reorganization and  handling brought on a two and half year slump in the market. In  addition, when a favorable reform environment emerged, there was  a failure to enforce reform promptly to promote the transition  from the first stage of reform to the second stage, and a  wonderful reform opportunity was missed.    In contrast, the second shrinkage of the economy was not  comprehensive, only about half a year, and carried less force.  In addition, it employed parameter controls instead of the  traditional quota controls. On the one hand, it adjusted  people's and enterprises' monetary activities by flexible  adjustment of the exchange rate, thereby stabilizing it, and  guaranteeing the RMB's reputation and status; this special  effort to unify the exchange rate provided experiences and  lessons in currency reform which definitely will be employed in  the future. On the other hand, although the interest rate  adjustment tended to be small, it basically worked to control  the expansion of investment and furthered the tendency of  residents to make deposits, stifling their overwhelming urge to  consume and stabilizing the market to carry out its "soft  landing" function. Doubtless, this parameter control was  accomplished through governmental intervention, certainly far  from the parameter management of the developed market economy.  But the problem is that the banks and the government are still  not separate. "Bank independence" and "specialized bank  commercialization" still have not moved from theory to reality,  the central bank has not gained its independence, stable  economic function and rights under the "bank president directed  by senior officers" system. If government did not intervene  directly, macroadjustment and control would have no function. In  the transitional period from the traditional planned economy to  the socialist market economy, from direct control to indirect  control, we will often have the situation that the new system  cannot work if we do not take advantage of the old system; what  is meaningful here is that the self-reform of the old system  will gradually provide space for breeding the new system. The  macroadjustment and control during the summer and autumn of 1993  is a model sample in this regard. For cooling down real estate  market, the major goal is to restrict developing a "froth  economy," to avoid having capital which is primarily short from  flowing into real estate excessively and thereby increasing the  basic industry bottlenecks, e.g., transportation,  telecommunications, etc. In addition, most of the capital used  on the stock exchange and real estate exchange are public funds,  so if we do not implement controls until the new system is built  up completely, the final explosion of accumulated contradictions  will be hard to imagine. Meanwhile, there cannot be lasting,  rapid, and healthy development of the economy either.    The operation of economic policy in 1993 can be summarized  as  "focusing with both hands". This means using one hand to grasp  macrocontrol and adjustment, while suppressing an overheated  economy, trying to avoid decline, and maintaining rapid growth.  On the other hand grasping system renewal, while carrying out  comprehensive reform design, accelerating domestic economic work  and progressively regulating marketization of the system.  Besides the reform achievements listed above, there was other  significant progress in 1993's reform, including the following  several areas:    1. The key measure of passing price reform    In the past 13 years, China has achieved much in the way of  price reform. Up to 1992, in the national market set price rate,  agricultural products and by-products occupied 78.5 percent,  gross social commodity retail sale value occupied 79.6 percent,  and production materials occupied 64.2 percent; as for share of  market adjustment in national commodity value, agricultural  products and by-products were at 77.8 percent, consumer goods at  83.4 percent, and among these, industrial consumer goods were at  78.1 percent, and production materials at 61.8 percent. In 1993,  in the commodity market, those items which had been viewed as  related to the national plan and the people's livelihood, such  as grain, had their prices opened up comprehensively,  implementing a policy of relying on the market fixed price for  the most part and totally abolishing the grain ration, with the  former ration provision shifted to free purchase in the market.  Although there still cannot be grain exchange between farmers  and government without government involvement, this type of  participation has to be regulated in accordance with supply and  demand.    When grain supplies are plentiful, a limited portion begins  to appear in the purchasing market, less is expended on grain  consumption and possible rises in price after opening up the  market do not create huge pressures on the average person's  life. Promptly opening up grain distribution and prices was a  successful step, offering new experiences in "reform must seek  opportunities."    Shifting grain distribution along with market adjustment,  fixing grain exchange prices according to supply and demand,  demonstrated that China had successfully passed the difficult  point in price reform, and also bolstered our confidence in the  marketization of housing and rental price reform.    2. Building a modern enterprise system was put on the  agenda    Building a modern enterprise system is a basic item in the  comprehensive reform plans issued in 1993. It broadened our  vision of enterprise reform, and showed that deepening  enterprise reform was not just a matter of carrying out  relaxation of operational rights or clarifying property rights.  But it should select and reorganize enterprises' organizational  form in accordance with fair competition and perfecting  efficiency in combination with relaxation of operational rights  and clarification of property rights. There are two fundamental  meanings here: one, is that in accelerating the transformation  of the state-owned enterprise system, whether we should go the  way of incorporation, how much should be run by local people,  how much do we implement the joint stock system, how much should  we retain the unitified state ownership form with local  operation, all must be determined solely by the demands of the  developing market and not by artificial will, and even less is  it necessary to set a quota figure in advance; two, it would be  suitable to creating a fair competition situation for the  various types of enterprises, including state-owned, collective,  and privately owned enterprises, in addition to requiring a  unified tax system, there should be permission given for capital  and labor force to circulate freely.    3. Initial progress in marketization of key elements    Taking establishment of a modern enterprise system as the  basic mission of microscopic reform logically raises the  question of marketizing key elements. In 1993, financing  channels in China tended to be pluralized, the amount of  currency freely exchanged in the currency market increased,  especially in the foreign currency exchange market, the  government reduced quota restrictions, and broaden the space for  automatic adjustment in market supply and demand. In the  dangerous situation of abnormal devaluation of the renminbi, the  government did not artificially restrict the price level but  used the means of raising the interest rate while selling  government reserves of gold and foreign currency, in order to  narrow the gap between foreign currency supply and demand, and  altering enterprises' and individuals' expectations of currency  value, and stabilizing the market. This is significant in that  it not only did not put any obstacles in the way of further  currency and fiscal reform, it also pointed out the possibility  and feasibility of establishing a unified currency rate system.    In a country like China, with an almost unlimited labor  supply, the development of a labor market, especially the  establishment of a labor market in the area of the state-owned  economy, will be an important reform project. In 1993, there  were two areas in the development of a labor market in the  state-owned economy that showed initial progress: one was the  establishment of an internal labor market, that is, "one plant  with two systems" an arrangement which increased the flexibility  of capital inside enterprises and reorganized labor; the other  was the establishment of the second job market, breaking the old  pattern in which labor could not flow between state ownership  and non-state ownership.    4. Accelerated development of the private economy    Another important achievement of reform in 1993 was the  accelerated development of the individual and privately owned  economies. These characteristically were demonstrated in: 1)  There was a rapid increase in the number of new registrations.  Taking the first quarter as an example, there were 153.000 new  private commercial and industrial registrations in addition to  the base of 15.53 million registered in 1992 nationally, an  increase of over 10 percent. Shanghai had a net increase of  2,000 families in the first half year, with 10 new businesses  starting up every day; Dalian had 1,284 new registrations in the  first half of the year, a 540 percent increase. 2) Private  capital joining state-owned enterprises is quite outstanding.  There were 34 state-owned and township collective silk industry  enterprises in Huzhou, Zhejiang which implemented joint  public-private ownership, with the private share being 60 to 80  percent, and these had a 100 percent rate of success. At  present, individual business and private owned business are not  only knocking at the doors of big cities, but also at the door  of the state-owned and collective economies, and their  developmental trend is bright. Although these facts are not  obvious results of reform measures, to a certain degree, they  can be looked upon as "self-reforms," closely connected with  government relaxation of the ownership structure policy.    5. Initial achievements in reform of the social  insurance system    Since the nineties, national health care, housing,  retirement  and provision for the elderly have been raised to an important  position, but the pace was not stepped up until comrade Deng  Xiaoping made his speech during his inspection tour of southern  China, and 1993 was a year of significant acceleration. Taking  housing reform as an example, each locality implemented "walking  on two legs," which means "raise rents, offer subsidies" and  preferential sales. Some carried out this raising of rent while  offering subsidies in three steps, some in one. Although rents  and housing prices generally tended to be low, at a considerable  distance from the current market price, it must be considered  that in a total reform measure, taking the first step is very  important. It is unrealistic to try to accomplish marketization  of the welfare system in one step.    In addition to the several areas listed above, 1993 also saw  some reform actions by government administrative organs in such  areas as finance and tax revenue distribution safety, the  external environment for enterprises, etc. However, reform in  these areas basically have not jumped out of the traditional  planned economy framework. Looking at what is required to  develop a new economic system, they are obviously backward. The  lack of progress in reform of these areas is precisely an  important source of the conflicts and problems produced in the  present dual system.  <H5>  Background of the New System: Contradictions and Difficulties </H5>   Reform has entered a new stage. It is impossible for things  to always go smoothly when there is a transition from shallow to  deep, from gradual to accelerated, from parts to a whole set of  reform supports; there will be many contradictions and  difficulties. If we say that reform in the eighties was solely a  confrontation with the monolithic system of the traditional  planned economy, while all other neglected tasks had to wait for  construction, still people were so eager for reform that even  superficial reform had a somewhat positive effect. The nineties  mean dealing with the implementation of a complete set of  supports for reform and development at a deep level in a  situation where a dual, mutually conflicting system exists, and  the difficulties are greater. Moreover the major tasks in the  new stage of reform, i.e., the property rights mix,  reorganization of employment, total marketization of the welfare  provision system, remolding the financial system into  competitive banking, reorganizing governmental functions to meet  the demands of the market economy, etc., will all probably  present a challenge to current profit takers at each level. New  conflicts may arise, as will the difficulties of economic  reality and the operational process of reform.    Let us start first of all with conversion of the enterprise  system, especially state-owned enterprises. This mission has  been suggested for several years, but it was only in 1993 that  establishment of a modern enterprise system was proposed.  Realistically, it has always been difficult to make fundamental  breakthroughs. In the past several years, many people have  attributed the causes of this to unliberated ideas and old  theoretical understanding, but the problem is by no means that  simple. If we assume that before the 3d Plenary Session of the  14th Party Central Committee, the task was to smash traditional  ideas about reform of state-owned property rights, and the ideas  of "clarifying property rights" and stepping up the pace of  property rights reform were written into the "Decisions," with  unanimous agreement, can it then be said that when conditions  are ripe, conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and  establishment of a modern enterprise system will be successful?  No.    Conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and  establishment of a modern enterprise system means accelerating  the reorganization of employment, and reorganizing employment  will definitely means reductions in the numbers of employees,  and a considerable number of current employees will be  dismissed. Once it has been decided to develop a market economy  and establish fair competition, we have must be duty-bound not  to turn back on establishing and developing a labor force  market, for with the promotion of efficiency and competition,  unemployment is unavoidable. That was why in the reform plan of  1987-88, we proposed "marketizing employment, and public  unemployment," for a market economy without some unemployment  and a labor force market are unimaginable. In state-owned  enterprises, the difficulty in implementing this plan is not  that workers cannot grasp the concept, but rather in the lack of  a suitable external environment. Public housing and pensions are  now assumed by work units, so if large numbers of people are  dismissed, they will be left in society with neither salary, a  place to live, or health and welfare benefits; how will they  live? Among the 150 million employee contingents we have today,  110 million, or two-thirds, are state employees; even if we  dismiss just one-tenth of these, more than 10 million will  remain. Calculated by a burden coefficient of 1.72, it means  over 27.2 million people may well be in the situation of having  nothing, and being homeless. In addition, China has a surplus  agricultural labor force of over 100 million which must be  shifted to non-agricultural industry, an average of more than 13  million annually who reach the age of coming into the work  force, plus a possible 10 to 30 million people dismissed from  collective enterprises. These will all bring huge pressures to  relocate surplus labors in state-owned work units.    On the one hand, we should resolve unemployment in  state-owned work units through bankruptcy and the system of the  excellent winning while the inferior are deleted; on the other  hand, it is difficult for surplus people to find new job  positions, as well as their family members not having  protection. While this will not be a difficult point in this and  the next year's reform, it will be a major conflict and  difficult situation in the second stage of reform.    In addition, the first 15 years of reform generally smashed  the original, excessively concentrated, centralized system, some  of the control rights which originally were the central  government's have been transmitted to the market and local  governments through releasing rights to enterprises and local  governments, but in the meantime there also appeared the  phenomenon of local government having excessive rights. At  present, there are three problems with the behavior of local  governments: one is adverse adjustment toward higher levels; two  is direct interference with lower; three is obstructing their  neighbors. These three have the common objective of protecting  local profits. Out of its need to develop the socialist market  economy, China must establish unified markets in all areas,  establish equal competition in localities, allow enterprises not  only to rid themselves of administrative control from the  central government, but also rid themselves of direct  interference from local governments, promoting each level of  government to act only a supply service, as all microeconomic  major bodies of government, especially local governments, must  accept adjustment by markets. The current situation far exceeds  this requirement.    Local governments' adverse adjustment and control toward  higher levels is found chiefly during periods of economic  adjustment. Whenever the central government cannot implement  policy either totally or mixed, it is generally due to not to  enterprises but to local governments. This is because when the  central government attempts to slow things down, stifling the  economy from being too hot, those regions which are already too  hot are usually in compliance in public but in opposition in  private. Although in report charts, the statistics figure show a  reduced rate of speed, yet in practice, there remains an  insistence on high speed to resolve regional employment and  improve the level of regional development; on mix adjusting,  although the central government has repeatedly stressed  accelerated development of transportation and telecommunication,  etc., in bottleneck industries by means of cooling down  manufacturing. Because manufacturing brings high value and large  profits, while basic industry is more long-term, local  governments usually put labor resources, material resources and  financial resources into manufacturing industry, so there is  always an unsatisfactory mix. Thus, resistance at present to  total amount and mix adjustment is not from enterprises but from  local governments.    Local governments' direct intervention with lower levels is  becoming stronger as the release of rights expands with reform.  This intervention is aimed chiefly at three targets: one is  enterprises, two is banks, three is the peasants. They complain  of excessive assignment of labor force, money, and materials,  "too many mothers-in-law." Actually, most of these are the  activities of local governmental organs. This direct  intervention with the main entities of the market, and  especially with banks, seriously impedes the normal development  of the market economy.    Local protectionism or local economic impedances not only  cause duplicated construction among different regions and  products and similar technology choices, but also impedes the  establishment of a unified national market.    Local governments' non-marketized activities higher, lower,  left and right have become a major contradiction in current  economic operations and reform. Due to local governments have  considerable power, strong economic force, a complicated  situation with economic conditions and unbalanced profits, etc.,  added to the reduction in the central government's powers, there  are no corresponding regulations restricting the activities of  local governments, so converting local governments' function  will become a difficult point in the new stage. The simple tax  division system can only resolve the distribution of tax  revenues between the central government and localities; it  cannot accomplish the goal of redefining local government's  function in accordance with the demands of the market economy.    Second, there is a problem with lagging financial system  reform. After 15 years' reform, China's financial channels have  begun to develop toward multiple elements. In addition to  deposits and bank loans, there are government and enterprise  bonds, stocks, and other forms of raising funds. However,  capital distribution is still affected greatly by the supply  system, and in a certain sense, the "external circulation" of  capital has more of a market component than does "internal  circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more  non-market component is that banks have not been separated from  government. The Bank of China not only is not an independent  unitary organ with the right to issue currency, it cannot make  its own decisions regarding adjustment of currency supply and  price levels. It is controlled by administrators in the central  government, but in addition each of the specialized banks  (especially branch banks) have their credit and loans controlled  by local governments; they do not obey markets but local  administrators. Meanwhile, banks continue to maintain the state  monopoly, rejecting the elimination system, and the lack of  competition also results in too tight control of "internal  circulation," which make the direction of application  unreasonable and inefficient.    Under market economic conditions, finance is at the center  of  domestic economic activities, the banks are the adjustment  center, and interest rates are determined by market supply and  demand of capital. However, finance, banking, and interest rates  in China are at present still operated directly by the  government. Changing this pattern, making an independent,  multiple element, competitive, and efficient new financial  system has naturally become a third theme and a difficult point  in the new stage of reform. The key here is to resolve conflicts  of interest and distribution of rights between government and  enterprises, and between the central government and local  governments.  <H5>  Key Choices for Accelerating the Marketization Process </H5>   In the first 15 years, the outstanding achievement of  converting the economic system in China is the establishment of  a price competition system, with the single planned, price  setting of the past changed into setting price in the market  with government supervision. The focal point of reform in 1994  and in the entire new stage is converting the state-owned  enterprise system, and around this focal point, the launching  and breakthroughs in reform will be from the following several  aspects.    1. Establish a modern enterprise system    The major battlefield for 1994 and future economic reform is  in the state-owned enterprises, that is, converting the current  state-owned enterprise system into a modern enterprise system.  In order to attain this goal, we must implement creativity in  both the internal and external state-owned enterprise system.  The theme of internal reform is still property rights reform,  while external reform includes three basic aspects, i.e., the  welfare system, the role of government, and the financial system.    In the transformation of the state-owned property right  administrative system, theoreticians are increasing their  demands for organizing and building up the limited  responsibility corporation and the joint stock limited  corporation. So this is a certain measure toward establishing a  modern enterprise system and a modern market system. Under a  joint stock system there are many levels one can choose, with  wide coverage, big corporations doing big shares, small  corporations doing small shares, allowing free purchase of  shares both by organizations who represent the state's and  residents' interests in joint stock. This form of property  rights organization can cut across cities and countryside,  regions and countries; it helps the flow of capital flow and  capital's concentration and decomposition. But, facing the huge  scale of state-owned asset property rights that we have now,  simply creating a joint stock limited corporation may not be  practical; one needs to consider a variety of alternatives. In  addition to developing joint stock limited corporations, there  should be appropriate development of two enterprise property  organization forms: a cooperative rights system and independent,  individual capital. These should be developed together by system  change, auction, lease, contracting and sales, etc. In the  process of reorganizing property rights, there is no doubt we  will absorb the "corporate culture" of enterprise operations in  Europe and America, but we must in no way ignore the "individual  and family culture" preserved from China. Chinese economic booms  in Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia have proven that the  latter can also be combined skillfully with the modern market  economy. In order to develop and expand the latter two property  rights organizational forms, we can on the one hand sell small  state-owned enterprises to individuals and families, while on  the other hand carry out reorganization of the system by selling  some segments which are unsuitable to capital concentration, for  example, selling some branch plants to individuals and families,  giving them the freedom to choose the property rights  organizational form. Regardless of what means are employed to  reform the enterprise system, there must be strict checks on  capital and assets clarified, doing a good job in assets  evaluation to prevent the nation from losing assets.    Implementing enterprise reform must combine internal and  external reform. The principal cause of inefficiency in  converting the enterprise system over the past few years has  been the lack of a better external environment. Enterprises  which should be eliminated cannot be eliminated, redundant  personnel who should be dismissed cannot be dismissed, because  it is hard to find a job again, benefit allocations are attached  to work units so lack mobility, and employees leaving work units  face loss of their current residences, medicare, pensions and  other benefits supplied by their work units. In order to  accelerate the transformation of the enterprise system in the  next several years, the first step is to accelerate  socialization and marketization in benefits allocation. This  will include:    1) Establishing a system of socialized unemployment, old age  insurance and medical insurance, establishing a nationwide  social insurance bureau, allowing insurance companies to operate  in multiple forms and with full responsibility for their profits  and losses. This will create a situation where workers' and  their family members' medicare, pensions and unemployment will  neither be attached to work units, nor having trouble at home.    2) Reform the current work unit housing allocation system,  having all publicly-owned housing managed by corporate  enterprises. Housing reform over the past few years stressed the  point of trying to raise housing prices, reducing the financial  burden of government and enterprises through building houses by  raising house prices and then selling some houses at discounted  prices. This still has not accomplished the commercialization  and marketization of housing. The difficulty here is not that  residents lack the ability to bear rising rents, or this is too  complex in operation, but rather that the commercialization of  public housing must first of all be socialized. We must convert  housing allocation by work units to allocation by socialized  corporations. Only after housing is socialized will it become  possible for the labor force to flow freely among different  enterprises.    3) For enterprise reform, a good external environment must  also include a flexible capital reorganizing system. China's  current enterprise system is a system in which "workers will be  workers forever, managers will always be managers." There are  all kinds of limitations on capital reorganization, such as the  "threshold is too high," there are excessive restrictions on  registering new corporations through requiring the approval of  many departments. But after registration it is difficult to file  for bankruptcy, just the opposite of the "easy to register but  hard to stay in business" situation which prevails in developed  countries. If this abnormal phenomenon cannot be changed, it  will be unfavorable to establishing a bankruptcy and  unemployment system in enterprises either. If workers lose their  jobs and cannot find employment in other work units, some of  them can collect funds or obtain loans to establish stores or  plants, becoming employers. More small enterprises in existence  means the absorption of more of the labor force, as well as  providing alternatives for surplus labor in state-owned work  units.  <H5>  2. Transforming the Role of Government on Two Levels </H5>   The basic condition for establishing a modern enterprise  system is the elimination of direct governmental intervention,  and this requires transforming the role of government,  especially that of local government. First of all, separate  government from enterprises, carry out a common policy of  "enterprises without mothers-in-law", do not permit government  administrative departments to directly involve themselves with  enterprises' activities. Government should only take care of  legislation, formulate regulations, collect taxes, and regulate  enterprises' activities through economic policies that either  stimulate or cool down, and all of these accomplished by market  parameters. For projects with direct government investment, we  should still entrust incorporated enterprises to undertake these  but not have them operated by government administrative organs.  All government management activities are public matters, and  include setting and implementing local tax regulations after  implementation of a tax division system, ecological environment  administration and public investment in infrastructural projects  at the local level, etc.    Carrying out the transformation of governmental functions  can  be considered on two levels: one is the function of the central  government (here we are only talking about the economic  function), two is the function of local government. In  principle, the chief function of the central government can be  regarded as: 1) carrying out macroadjustment and control of the  domestic economy, including macroemployment and inflation,  currency supply and interest rate level, the national tax  standard and economic growth and balance administration; 2)  national level social insurance arrangements, including poverty  and unemployment relief; arranging for retirement and care for  the aged and subsidies for military people, etc.; 3)  construction of interprovincial infrastructural facilities; and  4) developing natural resource monopolies and high tech,  education, and research on a massive scale.    Local governments should only undertake public affairs  within  their local sphere; there are chiefly two basic divisions  between their role and that of the central government: one is  division of scale, in that the central government governs an  entire entity, while local governments govern only parts; the  second is that localities lack macroeconomic adjustment and  control powers in such matters as the issuance of currency and  its circulation, etc. The only direct relationship between these  two levels of government and enterprises is revenue, with all  other regulatory activities conducted via two intermediaries:  the law and the market.  <H5>  3. Model an Independent, Multi-Element, Competitive </H5> Financial System    Establishment of a modern enterprise system requires the  support of the modern financial system. At present, in addition  to suffering from too much government intervention in supplying,  selling, and pricing of goods and in the employment of people,  state-owned enterprises also lack the power to make their own  choices in the use of capital. The capital distribution system  is still in effect. It is not simply a problem of the banks'  administration level: the key is factor is that the banking  business also suffers from interference by government officers.  The reason is that specialized banks are not incorporated, nor  are they separate from government. In developed market economy  countries, no matter whether commercial banks which operate by  enterprise methods or central banks which implement currency  policy, the controlling balance between currency supply and  demand, the regulation and control of overall interest rate  levels are all independent, and any direct interference by  government administrative organs is illegal. This explains why  their banking system is highly independent, because they are  responsible for macroeconomic balance. America has the most  advanced banking system in the world, with the greatest degree  of independence. While banks in Japan and Germany are subject to  more interference from government, this kind of interference is  indirect, and usually must be implemented by legal means. When  designing and constructing the new banking system in China, we  can refer to the Japanese and German experience, and learn from  the American model.    Regarding enterprise reform, there is also a problem of  inducing the competition system in financial system reform. At  present, all of our banks are run by the state, in a kind of  monopolistic operation without competition. Would it be possible  to try operating the banks on a joint stock system? Everyone is  very cautious about this question, because it is harder to  control than those assets in material form, such as land, real  estate and enterprises. Problems which arise in the reform of  material assets are easier to handle than those which arise in  the reform of financial assets. Plus, if the government  regulations on bank administration are unclear, it is easy  succumb to the lure of reaping staggering profits, so the income  gap caused by policy will be too sharp. There must be  appropriate controls on taxes on part of the income from bank  differential interest rate, and in addition, banks' activities  must be regulated by a corresponding set of legal regulations.  All of this requires very cautious and strict consideration.  Therefore, before launching bank system reform, we must make it  a goal that the new banking system "take state ownership as the  dominant factor, with multiple forms of ownership forms  coexisting". There should be a process for preparing legislation  and system design. When the situation is still not ripe, there  should be no rush to implement joint stock or privatized capital  banks. But this should be considered for the long term. Modeling  an independent, multiple-element, competitive bank finance  system to develop the socialist market economy is inevitably the  road we will take.  <H5>  4. Establish a System in Which Every Citizen Pays Taxes and </H5> There Is Public Financing    Enterprises are the principal entity of the market,  developing the market economy depends first and foremost upon  establishing this market principal entity. However, the  socialist market economy is not a free, laissez-faire economy:  the degree of government intervention is stronger and the scale  of government intervention is wider than in the Western market  economy. One of the former's important characteristics is that  it achieves more fairness by means of reallocation. This  involves the problem of national taxes, and involves the problem  of the distribution relationship between the "state" and the  "people."    The chief measure for handling the distribution relationship  between the "state" and the "people" is the tax. More taxes mean  more benefits go to the state, while less taxes mean more  benefits go to the people. Before the implementation of reform,  the tax system in China was very simple, having a very small  number of varieties, low tax rates and little change. The major  reasons for this were: one, there were no privately owned  enterprises, and the state-owned enterprises turned over profits  instead of taxes; two, both urban and rural residents generally  had low incomes, so paid no income tax; three, farmers paid in  grains in lieu of tax. Since the implementation of reform some  changes have occurred: the state-owned enterprises are carrying  out the policy of converting profits into taxes; privately owned  enterprises and other types of enterprises have become more  important taxpayers; with the rising incomes of both urban and  rural dwellers, personal income tax has been produced and  expanded; the tax on farmers' materials have been converted into  currency taxes. With the tax system changed, in order to prevent  the national treasury from drying up, the tax system should  correspondingly be reformed; there should be corresponding  adjustments in both the varieties and rates of taxes, and these  should be implemented by means of strong and powerful measures.  In the past several years, we did not attain this point, and  policies concerning this aspect had some deviation. This policy  deviation was due to the old tax system growing increasingly  unsuitable to the new economic situation. So, accelerating tax  system reform has become an urgent matter.    Recently, tax system reform has been listed as a very  important issue among five major reform issues, which  demonstrates that the central government is giving a great deal  of attention to the problems which exist in the tax system. But  if we look at the publicity and implementation of policy, it  seems that there has been more emphasis on resolving the tax  division system of revenue relationship between the central  government and localities. It is no doubt very important to  carry out a tax division system, as it can clarify the tax  allocation of rights, responsibilities and benefits between the  central government and localities. This will lay the foundation  for smashing the huge, monolithic, central government-intensive  type of financial system, and result in the future in less  wrangling between the central government and localities, and  among localities themselves, freeing each level of government to  concentrate on it regular work well, and improving the  efficiency of governmental activities. However, we cannot limit  ourselves to this if we are to establish a new tax system  suitable to developing the socialist market economy; it is  urgent that we establish an uniform tax payment system that  involves every citizen.    Now, evading taxes has almost become a habit with  businessmen, and the taxes evaded increase or decrease with the  amount of income. If we do not pay urgent attention to building  the system and legal restrictions, it could possibly lead to the  people growing prosperous while the state becomes impoverished.  The basic points of the tax system reform to be implemented soon  should not be an increase or reduction in taxes, but should be a  complete tax, which means collecting all taxes that should be  paid. We can consider establishing a uniform system of tax  payment involving every citizen in three aspects: 1) work out  detailed, well-organized tax collection regulations, including  the division between national taxes and local taxes, tax  varieties, tax rates, deadlines, scale, penalty rules, etc.; the  more the detail the better the tax law. 2) Establishing a strict  tax reporting system, fixing an annual legal tax reporting term,  with individuals and business owners required to report taxes to  government tax departments before the deadline. Once tax evasion  is discovered, there should be an audit of the past few years'  total income and tax report documents, and strict punishment  levied. This will form a habit of tax reporting for individuals  and business owners by the threat of strict punishment. 3)  Establish a two-level system of national tax administration for  both central government and provinces, giving tax officers full  authority to implement the state's tax laws, and no government  administrator can reduce or exempt taxes for individuals or  business owners which exceed the powers of tax officers, for any  reasons. 4) All individuals, regardless of their status,  citizenship, age and gender, must pay their taxes in accordance  with the same law. There can be consideration of implementing an  employee chart system in which all employees must have  employees' charts, as well as showing tax payment forms, letting  government restrict employers, and employers restrict employees.  When opening deposit accounts or opening accounts with currency  exchange organizations, the tax form must be attached when  providing identification.    Operation of the socialist market economy must be based on  an  extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundmental,  major laws in a nation's economy. Comprehensively accelerating  reform of the tax law is a very urgent part of accelerating  reform of the entire economic system.    Tax system reform is actually reform of the state's  financial  income system. Once equal competition is implemented, and  state-owned and other enterprises operate under the same tax  law, the state's tax revenues may shrink in scale, so government  expenditures will shrink in turn, which will require adjusting  the government's financial role. Our present government finances  are still comprehensive finances, and after releasing rights and  profits, in the original monolithic revenue and expenditure  financial model, unified revenues shrank at a faster pace than  the unified expenditures did, causing a steady increase in the  financial deficit. In 1985, our financial surplus was 2.16  billion yuan, and in 1992 we had a 23.66 billion yuan financial  deficit. If there is no adjustment in the pattern of revenue and  expenditure, the deficit will continue to grow, even if there is  repeated removal of educational funds. The basic way to resolve  the current financial difficulty is not to raise taxes ("digging  out resources"), and there should be no reductions in scientific  and educational funds ("cutting expenses"); rather, there can  only be fundamental reform of the financial revenue and  expenditure system, and this means moving the comprehensive  finances we have now to public financing, except that investment  in natural monopolies, extremely huge scale, national defense,  and some fundmental industries will continue to be government  expenditures, and the government should use capital which it  controls to provide social guarantees and other public affairs.  So, establishing a system of public finance will become one of  the basic missions of reform starting in 1994.</p>

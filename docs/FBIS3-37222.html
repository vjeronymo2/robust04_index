General Nuamann is in Russia on an official visit at the  invitation of the chief of the general staff of the Russian  Armed Forces.    Grachev spoke against the use of force in resolving the  Bosnian problem. According to him, the experience of U.S.  military actions in Vietnam and of the Soviet Army in  Afghanistan proves that one must find political ways for  resolving international disputes and overcoming armed conflicts.    Grachev thinks that if the bomb strikes are still carried  out, no good will come of it. The Russian defense minister  pointed out that, in any case, the Russian peacekeeping forces  would remain in the former Yugoslavia and would continue their  peacekeeping mission there.</p>

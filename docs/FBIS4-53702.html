			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- In Japan, often described as  one of the safest countries in the world, the private security  industry is doing a thriving business, with the number of  private guards exceeding police by 1.4 times, the National  Police Agency said Saturday [21 May].    As of the end of 1993, some 320,000 private security staff  were guarding companies and private homes in Japan, reflecting a  rising awareness of security and a soaring demand for  surveillance, the agency said, while the number of police  totaled about 223,000.    The agency said the private security boom has been fueled by  the spread of the five-day work week, with facilities remaining  closed during the weekend, and an increasing number of the  elderly feeling uneasy about safety.    The number of private security staff first outstripped that  of police officers in 1990, when it reached 230,000 guards.    Since 1972, the year when a law on private security  companies  was enacted, the number of firms has increased ninefold to  7,062, with a corresponding jump in staff by 7.8 times to an  overall 321,721.    The 1993 figures represent a year-on-year increase of 7.4  percent for the number of companies and a 10.4 percent rise in  staff.    Women made a slight inroad into the male-dominated security  business in 1993, boosting their share to 5.9 percent, or 18,880  guards, from 5.2 percent.    In 1993, the security business registered a record 1.56  trillion yen in annual turnover, a slight increase over the  previous year.    The business has also profited from a diversification trend.  Private guards nowadays work as bodyguards for politicians and  prominent people, direct traffic, monitor festivals and other  events or accompany cash deliveries and the transport of  hazardous goods.    Private guards were involved in more than 200 on-the-spot  arrests and joined police investigations into some 170 cases  last year, the agency said.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: BARTOK IN ABUNDANCE  </P> <P> As this columnist frequently has occasion to lament, the quantity of recordings  of a composer's music does not necessarily reflect or translate into frequency  of live performance.  </P> <P> Take the case of Bartok, all of whose major works have multiple listings in the  current Schwann CD catalogue while in concert he is regularly represented only  by his readily accessible, Romantically tinged Concerto for Orchestra and, for  a very different audience, his less compromising string quartets. Even the once  very popular Second Violin Concerto seems to have been replaced as the  20th-Century vehicle of choice by the Berg and Prokofiev concertos.  </P> <P> But any orchestra with a presumption to international stature has to record the  Concerto for Orchestra, with two relatively recent additions to the roster of  world-class ensembles now attempting it for the first time: the Los Angeles  Philharmonic, under Andre Previn (Telarc 80174), and the Montreal Symphony,  under Charles Dutoit (London 421 443).  </P> <P> Previn's conception is inappropriately benign, the sort of laid-back  performance of volatile music with which Previn came to critical grief during  his recently concluded tenure as music director here. Dutoit is, almost as  predictably, taut, quick-witted and flashy.  </P> <P> Previn couples his Bartok with a bloodless, disinterested run through of  Janacek's wonderfully ferocious and grandiose Sinfonietta. But rather than  excoriating the conductor, should one perhaps lament his being saddled with  music to which he is temperamentally unsuited?  </P> <P> No such problem for Dutoit, who gives us a becomingly high-voltage rendition of  Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta.  </P> <P> The Second Violin Concerto has long been a speciality of Yehudi Menuhin, but in  only one of his three commercial recordings are tone and technique sufficiently  under control to allow the musicianship to shine through: his first, dating  from 1953 -- a soaring, lush-toned (once past some early scraping) piece of  violin magic. And there are rewards as well in the partnering of the  Philharmonia Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtwangler, who abjures his normal  deep-think to provide vital, crisply rhythmical support for the soloist.  </P> <P> The recording is, interestingly, available in different couplings on different  labels: As one of Angel's mid-priced Great Recordings of the Century (69804) it  is accompanied by Bartok's last completed work, the Sonata for Solo Violin.  Menuhin -- to whom it is dedicated -- while hardly romanticizing a very  tough-minded score, does deliver it with more coloristic variety than  subsequent interpreters.  </P> <P> On the even less-expensive Price-Less label (15100) the Violin Concerto is  coupled with the scintillating Third Piano Concerto in a reading of delectable  vivacity by the Hungarian pianist Annie Fischer, ably supported by the London  Symphony under Igor Markevitch.  </P> <P> Bartok left only the most rudimentary sketches for the Viola Concerto at his  death in 1945. As interpreted -- or, more likely, largely composed (in the  Bartok idiom) -- by his pupil, Tibor Serly, it ultimately provided an  attractive, grateful vehicle for the revered William Primrose.  </P> <P> Primrose's poignant if roughly recorded first performance of the concerto in  France in 1950 has been made available as part of an invaluable Bartok program  in which an under-appreciated master among conductors of 20th-Century music,  Ernest Bour, conducts the Orchestre National (Mode Laser CD 672 006).  </P> <P> Bour and his Parisians also offer -- from handsomely recorded 1969 broadcasts  -- the "Miraculous Mandarin" Suite, vastly spookier and more exciting under  these live circumstances than in any studio-made version; and a pulverizing  assault on the Second Piano Concerto by soloist Claude Helffer, who will have  no truck with any of this effete Bartok-needn't-be-percussive nonsense.  Terrific stuff.  </P> <P> The inexhaustible riches of the six string quartets can be sampled in two  recent CD issues. The Emerson Quartet presents fast-paced, hard-driven,  quintessentially modern performances (Deutsche Grammophon 423 657, two CDs)  that revive memories of the Juilliard Quartet's first (circa 1950) recordings.  </P> <P> Coming from a totally different interpretive direction, the New Hungarian  Quartet, which flourished briefly a decade ago, presents warm-toned, probing  interpretations on three budget CDs (Pantheon 19149) reflecting the four  decades of stylistic growth and change that separate the first from the last of  these works.  </P> <P> As technicians, however, the New Hungarians are hardly in the same league as  the brilliant Emersons.  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Cadbury presumptions on role of directors challenged by IoD Sir, Your readers would be misled were they to assume from your report ('CBI and IoD attack corporate governance reform plan', July 30) that this institute's only reservation about the Cadbury report was its proposal to 'give non-executive directors a special function within boards'. The IoD's prime concern is that the report focuses on the accountability of directors and boards almost without reference to their main function. Our definition of the objective of good corporate governance is to ensure that companies survive and thrive, and that they conduct their affairs with ethics and integrity. The Cadbury report was strong on integrity, but it did not address the challenge of surviving and thriving, nor the qualities that directors and boards of directors need to discharge all their duties. It is, therefore, the Cadbury Committee's concept of the role of directors, boards of directors and the part played by shareholders and owners of companies about which the institute has the strongest reservations and about which we believe the report produces a distorted picture of corporate governance. The report sends out the general massage that there should be two groups on the board of directors - the doers and the checkers. It is the presumption that directors require assistance in how to run companies which the IoD believes should be reversed. Shareholders and auditors do have a role in relation to the conduct of a company, but the running of a company - setting the strategic direction, ensuring its implementation, supervising management and providing information regarding its affairs to those entitled to it - is determined by a unitary board in the boardroom and nowhere else.

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Watchdog criticises World Service THE National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, yesterday called on the BBC World Service to improve its efficiency. The report paid tribute to the World Service's independence and high standard of broadcasting. It also found that the organisation - which broadcasts in 38 languages to an audience of 120m - had 'a generally satisfactory system of resource planning and financial management, and had developed comprehensive procedures to assess the effectiveness of its output'. The watchdog called for: Further apportioning of overheads to individual services to improve decision-making. The continuation of improvements to weak cash flow forecasting. Further improvements in the use of studios and in deploying studio managers. Greater use of appraisal techniques to justify capital spending. Further assessment of the impact of the Pounds 166m spent over the past 10 years to improve the audibility of broadcasts. The NAO also argued that the World Service might be given more authority to vary the amount of broadcast time, as long as this did not cost more. The Foreign Office paid Pounds 143m to fund the World Service in 1991-92 - not including Pounds 16m for monitoring other foreign broadcasts. At the moment the number of hours broadcast in particular languages is set out formally after negotiations between the Foreign Office and the BBC. The NAO also said it would like to see the World Service move into profit on its commercial activities. Management of the BBC World Service. HMSO. Pounds 7.</p>

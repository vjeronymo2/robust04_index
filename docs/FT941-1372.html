			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Framework for London Sir, It serves neither the London boroughs' nor businesses' purpose to have central London planned on the basis of a 35-year-old statistical convention, the Central Statistical Area, as your report, 'London role as world city threatened' (March 17), appears to suggest. It also does the boroughs ill justice to claim that 'there is no agreement between them on what constitutes the Central Activities Zone'. In the London Planning Advisory Committee's new Strategic Planning Advice for London, all 33 London boroughs have unanimously agreed a body of policies for the capital as a whole. This includes a much more sophisticated and sensitive structure for central London than the old Central Statistical Area. It incorporates a Central Activities Zone and the Isle of Dogs Special Business Zone to accommodate the needs of metropolitan level activities, including offices. Where appropriate it also outlines the Wider Central Area to sustain the surrounding vital, but more vulnerable land uses which lend London so much character. In its Office Review Panel, it also proposes a forum for those involved in office development to ensure office supply and demand do not again get so badly out of kilter. The boroughs strongly advise government to support these proposals in its Strategic Planning Guidance for London. The capital must have the strategic planning framework it needs to enhance its role as a world city. John Lett, assistant chief planner, London Planning Advisory Committee, Eastern House, 8-10 Eastern Road, Romford RM1 3PN</p>

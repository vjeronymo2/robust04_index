			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ESCROW FIRM'S CUSTOMERS GET A PORTION OF SEIZED FUNDS  </P> <P> Three months after state officials seized an Encino escrow firm, the Escrow  Shoppe, and froze $5.5 million of customers' money, the customers are finally  getting their money back -- but not all of it.  </P> <P> Last week, Russell A. Greenwood, a court-appointed receiver looking into the  Escrow Shoppe's books, unfroze most of the money but withheld 10% of each  customer's amount. Why? Judy L. Hartley, a senior lawyer with the state  Department of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms, said up to $450,000 of  the money might still be missing.  </P> <P> The Escrow Shoppe had about 350 pending transactions when it was seized.  </P> <P> One customer, David Fein, said he was glad that he was finally getting his  cash, but was annoyed that 10% of his money is still being withheld because of  continuing confusion over the Escrow Shoppe mess.  </P> <P> "I would think by now it should be cleared up whether there are missing funds  or not," said Fein, who had sold his house in Woodland Hills just as the Escrow  Shoppe was seized, and whose five-figure profit on the sale was frozen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holding Money  </P> <P> Escrow firms such as the Escrow Shoppe help ensure that buyers and sellers of  real estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title search, and hold  documents and cash transferred between the parties until the sale is completed.  </P> <P> When the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe in mid-March, it  alleged that the firm made $3 million in unauthorized payments and that about  $200,000 of customers' funds might be missing. The agency alleged, among other  things, that the firm had shifted money from some pending escrows to pay  customers closing other escrows -- all without authorization by the customers.  </P> <P> The state also froze the customers' money to get an accurate accounting of the  Escrow Shoppe's assets.  </P> <P> But as the state probe continued, the customers grew furious. With their money  frozen, they could not complete their transactions unless they put up more  money. Their financial and housing plans were thrown into chaos, and  authorities could not predict when the money would become available.  </P> <P> Hartley said 10% of the customers' money was still being withheld "to cover  possible shortages," but said she had no additional details. Susan Allison, a  lawyer for Greenwood's office, would say only that "we have to pursue what are  some unexplained transactions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Criminal Action  </P> <P> Sandra Bianco is the owner of the Escrow Shoppe and one of her attorneys,  Thomas Warden, said he was aware of the state's concern about the possible  shortages, but that he had no details. He also noted that there is no criminal  action pending against Bianco, nor is she facing any formal proceedings by the  Department of Corporations.  </P> <P> However, the indications of further shortages appear to be at least partially  related to a civil suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles by a real estate  partnership named Los Angeles Martinique Investments.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Martinique filed its suit May 1 against the Escrow Shoppe, Bianco  and another firm owned by Bianco named Encino Equity Services.  </P> <P> Encino Equity is a so-called "accomodator" firm used in commercial real estate  deals. Specifically, when a group wants to sell one property at a profit, and  reinvest that profit in another property without having to pay taxes on the  profit in the meantime, it must use an accomodator to hold the profit as a  third party until the money is reinvested.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Los Angeles Martinique pursued just such a deal. According  to its suit, the partnership sold a Hollywood apartment complex in February for  a $451,000 profit, using the Escrow Shoppe as its escrow firm. Then it turned  over the profit to Encino Equity -- which had been recommended by the Escrow  Shoppe -- as its accomodator, as it searched for a new property in which to  invest the funds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apartment Purchase  </P> <P> On March 16, it found a new apartment building to buy, and asked Encino Equity  to deposit the partnership's $451,000 for its purchase of the new property. But  Encino Equity never turned over the money, the suit alleged.  </P> <P> Four days later, on March 20, the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow  Shoppe. The partnership's lawsuit accuses the defendants of fraud, breach of  contract and negligence, among other things, and asserts that the Escrow Shoppe  and Encino Equities were insolvent and that the defendants' "secret intent" was  not to complete the transaction, "but rather to close both businesses and to  retain the sale proceeds for their own use."  </P> <P> The two firms, Bianco and the other defendants denied the suit's allegations.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Martinique is not among the Escrow Shoppe customers getting 90% of  its money back. Why? Los Angeles Martinique's attorney Howard Grady explained  that technically it was out of escrow, it had closed the sale of the first  apartment building, and its money was not part of the $5.5 million in the  Escrow Shoppe's trust fund that was frozen.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the major players in the Escrow Shoppe mess are spreading the blame  for why the customers' money had to remain frozen for three months.  </P> <P> Hartley of the Department of Corporations said her agency had to go to court to  get the necessary records because of delays by the Escrow Shoppe, Encino Equity  and their lawyers.  </P> <P> But Warden said his people cooperated, that the state's court action was  unnecessary and that the delay was caused by the receiver Greenwood, who was  "very slow in doing his accounting."  </P> <P> Ed Moore, president of Townsgate Escrow in Thousand Oaks, which took over most  of the Escrow Shoppe's pending deals at the state's request, said the Escrow  Shoppe deserves some of the blame. He said their files "were horrible . . .  they were in all kinds of disarray," which made checking their accuracy more  difficult.  </P></p>

This was reported by our sources in southern Iraq. They said  that this heroic operation created a state of fear and panic  among the tyrant's security organs, which have been placed on a  state of alert and have deployed patrols to arrest those who  carried out the operation. The latter managed to return to  their bases safely.</p>

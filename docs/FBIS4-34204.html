			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 15 Jun (AE) -- Presidential spokesman  Fernando Costa announced that President Itamar Franco has been  deeply shaken by the death of his nephew Ariosto Franco in  Cartagena, Colombia. The president was informed early this  morning that his nephew had suffered a heart attack.    Franco and the members of his entourage have canceled every  appointment scheduled for today, and are preparing to return to  Brazil as soon as Ariosto Franco's body is released. Franco's  trip to Ecuador, which was scheduled to start on 16 June, has  thus been canceled. A medical bulletin will soon be released on  the death of the president's nephew.    [At 1438 GMT AGENCIA ESTADO adds that "in addition to being  President Franco's private secretary," the 36-year-old Ariosto  Carlos Franco "had been living with the president at Alvorada  Palace."]</p>

Chavan, of the  involvement of ISI [Inter-Service Intelligence] in the  insurgencies taking place in northeastern India. A Foreign  Office spokesman said in Islamabad that one purpose of this  smear campaign by India against Pakistan is to mask Indian  repression and atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. He  said the (?vehemence) and frequency of Indian allegations  against Pakistan are proportionate to the degree of its internal  difficulties.</p>

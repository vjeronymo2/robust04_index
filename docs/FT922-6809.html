			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Henderson seeks Pounds 20m from trust launch Henderson, the fund management group, is seeking at least Pounds 20m from the launch of an investment trust specialising in European equities. It is the second new European investment trust to be announced this week. Henderson EuroTrust will have a split capital structure, with 75 per cent of the issued capital in ordinary shares, and the rest in zero-dividend preference shares. It is hoped that this structure will stop the shares from moving to a discount to net asset value. The company has a 10-year life until the annual general meeting of October 2002, when the zero shares will be redeemed at 70p. This is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 10.2 per cent. Projected initial gross yield on the ordinary shares is 5 per cent. During the launch issue only packaged units, consisting of one ordinary share and one zero at a price of Pounds 1, will be available.</p>

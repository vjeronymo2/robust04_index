			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> SWIM CENTER GETS ADVANCE  </P> <P> A $1-million advance to help build the $6-million Rose Bowl Aquatics Center,  under construction since June, has been granted by the Pasadena Board of  Directors.  </P> <P> The advance was part of a $28-million revenue bond issue approved Tuesday by  the board.  </P> <P> Plans for the public swim center call for two Olympic-size pools, competition  diving equipment, a small children's pool and a clubhouse. The center is  expected to be completed by May, 1990.  </P> <P> Under a financial agreement with the city, the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center, the  nonprofit corporation building the center, was to receive $4 million from the  bond issue, pay back $3.5 million to the city over five years and obtain the  rest of the money from contributions. About $2 million in pledges has been  raised so far.  </P> <P> However, the $1-million advance from the city's General Fund was requested to  meet construction expenses that must be paid before money will be available  from the bonds and contributions.  </P></p>

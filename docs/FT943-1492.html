			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa appoints head of Securum as new chief executive Trygg-Hansa's search for a new chief executive ended yesterday when the Swedish insurer said it had appointed Mr Lars Thunell, president of the asset management group Securum. The appointment, which will take effect on November 1, came a month after Mr Bjorn Sprangare resigned from the post after strong criticism of his performance. Trygg-Hansa has been through a difficult phase due to heavy losses from its investment in Home, the US insurance group, its failure to gain a banking licence, and the collapse of its alliance with the mutual pension group, SPP. Its problems were highlighted this week when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, downgraded the company's senior debt and claims-paying ability. Mr Thunell, 46, is widely admired in the Swedish financial community for his stewardship of Securum, which was formed in early 1993 as a home for the failed loans within state-owned Nordbanken. Mr Thunell said yesterday that Trygg's domestic insurance business was 'sound,' but he was reticent on his plans for the group. One of his main priorities will be to find a strategic co-operation partner, allowing Trygg to reduce its 64.5 per cent stake in Home.</p>

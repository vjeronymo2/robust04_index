			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Karpenko report: "Anatoliy Chubays: Different Kind </F> of Privatization After 1 July"]    [Text] People at the Supreme Soviet used to attend  "privatization sessions" like a bullfight -- expecting thrills  aplenty. Echoes of the struggle for ownership were also  manifest 19 April at the final phase of the parliamentary  hearings at the State Duma. There were political attacks from  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputies and Communists,  extremist assessments, and so forth.    Nonetheless, the overwhelming sentiment was more favorable  than before, and there was a more businesslike attitude to the  results of voucher privatization and the problems of "monetary"  privatization. Rather, opponents are persuaded of the futility  of trying to change any aspect of the pace and terms of voucher  privatization before 1 July -- when voucher privatization comes  to an end.    Probably the only real threat to the privatizers' plans  comes  from the proposals to exclude fuel and energy complex property  from the auction program at the final stage of the voucher  auctions and, after 1 July, to declare a temporary moratorium on  privatization so as to "take stock, think everything through,"  and "not repeat past mistakes." Anatoliy Chubays dealt with the  familiar arsenal of accusations about the "wholesale" nature of  privatization (there was even a new version -- "blitzkrieg")  using arguments and normative document paragraphs that are also  familiar.    After the hearings A. Chubays told journalists about the  task  set by Viktor Chernomyrdin of submitting a draft law on the  monetary phase of privatization to the government by 1 May.  "Work however you like -- even day and night," was  Chernomyrdin's parting shot to the special commission, "but make  sure that there are no shocks when the vouchers are exchanged  for rubles."    To be frank, the timetable is very tight. All the more so  as, in the opinion of commission head Chubays, two documents  will have to be drawn up -- a law which parliament should  ratify, and a second version, in the shape of a presidential  edict, in the event of any possible holdups.    I asked Anatoliy Chubays whether it is possible to hope for  even one-tenth of the amount of privatization at the new stage  after 1 July.    "Of course," he replied, "there are some natural reasons for  the slowing of the pace -- there is far less demand for  privatization for money than there was for privatization by  voucher. But this will not mean a halt; it will merely be a  different kind of privatization. I am confident, though, that  the reduction will not be tenfold, but far less."</p>

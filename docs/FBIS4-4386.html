			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Japan is preparing to  revise its export control order in April as the 17 members of  Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls],  the Western agency to monitor sensitive technology and equipment  exports, have agreed to terminate the organization on Thursday  [31 March] midnight, the government said.    The revised cabinet order, however, will call for strict  curbs on sensitive technology and equipment exports to North  Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq as in the case of the United States  and main European states, Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] officials said.    Curbs on shipments to former communist nations will be  eased.    The amendment will retain the global export licensing system  for the 113 items, covered by the list of the Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), in  preparation for possible regional conflicts, the officials said.  They include high-technology computers and machine tools.    Under the system, however, applications to export such goods  will be basically approved instead of prohibited, in principle.    Confirmation of the final destination for shipments of  sensitive technology and equipment has so far been mandatory for  exporters. Such a requirement will be abolished.    However, the export of 20 highly sensitive items like  decoders and high-technology machine tools, will continue to be  subject to strict global controls, the officials said.    Big trading house officials said, however, that the  relaxations would not bring about a rapid increase in shipments  of ex-Cocom embargo items to former communist states. They  said there will be no big demand for such items in such  countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev believes  that the time is not yet ripe for international sanctions  against North Korea. In an interview for INTERFAX before flying  to Paris, he stressed that sanctions can be introduced in stages  but only after all other possibilities have been exhausted. In  the minister's view, the main possibility is an international  conference. Andrey Kozyrev also noted that international  measures should be introduced and lifted by the UN Security  Council alone.</p>

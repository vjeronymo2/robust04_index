			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: ANZ improves to ADollars 135m and holds dividend ANZ Group, the Australian trading bank, yesterday reported a modest 5 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 135.5m (USDollars 103.4m) for the six months ended March, 1992, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Gross income fell 16.4 per cent to ADollars 5.29bn, but the bank reduced bad and doubtful debt write-offs from ADollars 537.4m to ADollars 382.6m. The interim dividend is being held at 10 cents a share. Non accrual, or problem, loans rose to ADollars 3.53bn from ADollars 2.93bn in the first half of 1990-91. But they have stabilised since September when they stood at ADollars 3.6bn. While the results reflect overall improvement, the bank retains several trouble spots. The result was cut by ADollars 49.6m (ADollars 13.3m previously) in restructuring costs and the group's Australian banking business continued to trade at a loss, as did its finance offshoot, Esanda. Losses from the Australian banking division eased from ADollars 175.6m to ADollars 140.7m and Esanda declared losses of ADollars 33.8m, compared with ADollars 2.2m previously. On the other hand international banking, largely the former Grindlays group, lifted its contribution from ADollars 116.8m to ADollars 124.1m. Earlier this week, ANZ directors said they did not anticipate any losses from bankers' receipt scandals in India where Grindlays has a sizeable market share. The statement, which followed a meeting with the Indian Reserve Bank, said ANZ Grindlays had reconciled all bank receipts held. The ANZ's New Zealand operation also held their own in the latest half with a marginal earnings increase from ADollars 43.0m to ADollars 44.8m while profits from the section termed Australian retail services eased from ADollars 103.1m to ADollars 71.0m. Mr Bailey indicated that the company's property portfolio involved loans and acceptances of ADollars 8.5bn and development ventures of ADollars 700m. The non-accrual proportion of this exposure was ADollars 1.6bn. The result brought the company's capital adequacy ratio to 10.8 per cent, with Tier 1 capital at 6.6 per cent. Stated earnings followed a ADollars 106.1m tax provision (ADollars 104.5m previously) and excluded a ADollars 35.5m abnormal profit (ADollars 24.1m loss previously). The bank reduced its provisioning against exposure to debt rescheduling countries in the half from ADollars 479.9m to ADollars 395.8m, with carrying value approximating secondary market values.</p>

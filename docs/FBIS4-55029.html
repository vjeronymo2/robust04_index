			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Arjan Sokoli: "Why Is Our Diplomacy In a Blind </F> Alley Regarding the Albanian Question?"]    [Text] Our president's foreign policy has recently been  marked by intensive visits abroad and receptions of numerous  foreign dignitaries in Tirana. Leaving aside the frills of  expanding bilateral links, various possible fields of investment  in Albania, and promises by our friends (that in fact have  remained only on paper), the dialogue has always been focused on  the problem of Kosova and its future, which is our nation's  number one problem. This problem has become more acute in view  of the close prospect of a solution to the Bosnian-Serbian  conflict and the creation of a Bosnian-Croat Federation. In this  respect, there is a lot of talk about the danger of the war  spreading toward southern Serbia, into Kosova and beyond.  Warnings and predictions that such an extension of the conflict  would involve several Balkan countries come from various  quarters. In order to avoid a new Balkan war, almost all  European and Balkan diplomatic circles, in conjunction with the  United States, are insisting that the Albanian issue be  sacrificed. Calls of alarm and intimidation are heard by the  Albanians from all sides: "Be careful! Keep calm, control  yourselves, and be wise enough not to anger Serbia. We are  ready to help you in everything, provided you give up the idea  of a 'Kosova Republic' or 'an independent and neutral state of  Kosova.' Hold on and be patient, just be patient" (meaning  "submit, submit, always submit").    Our diplomacy seems to be greatly committed to the solution  of the Kosova issue and the problem of all the other Albanians  living outside their motherland. As already mentioned above,  there is a lot of talk going on, interviews given, and articles  written. However, what will be the ultimate outcome of it all?    President Berisha's diplomatic mission in March 1994 to  London -- a traditionally anti-Albanian capital as far as the  Kosova problem, and therefore the Albanian problem, are  concerned -- was evidence of our national policy succumbing to  the request, or rather the European and U.S. decision, that  Albania be compelled to accept "enlarged autonomy" for Kosova  under the former Yugoslavia. Even that kind of autonomy -- and  one never knows what is actually meant by the term "enlarged" --  could be achieved only if Serbia were to accept it. President  Rugova's line for Kosova to be "an independent, neutral state  under UN control" still hangs in the air. London, for the third  time this century, has buried our hopes of liberating Kosova  from the Serbian-Slav yoke. The Albanians' policy of peace and  restraint in the face of the barbarous Serbian repression, a  policy that was highly commended on both sides of the Atlantic,  resulted almost in suicide. International diplomacy again left  the Albanians in the lurch with an extremely bitter taste of  frustration and disappointment, but this time the reasons for it  included also our political naivete, tribal ego-tripping, and  national disunity.    Leaving the British capital with a feeling of legitimate  anger and admirable energy, our president found himself two days  later in Turkey, where he was received with the highest honors.  It is clear that all this haste had nothing to do with either  the signing of an agreement, the lifting of reciprocal taxes,  the smooth payment of the debt we owe Turkey, or boosting  Turkish investment in Albania.    His main concern was again the Kosova issue, where he hoped  that the failure suffered in London would in some way or another  be compensated by support offered to us by our traditional  friend. From what we could learn from the interview given by  Turkish President Demirel to Albanian Television journalist Reis  Cico about the stand that Turkey would take if the Serbs spread  the conflict toward Kosova, the Turkish leader replied that "we  will assist Kosova and Albania" -- a declaration of particular  importance. However, that declaration did not speak of any  support for the Kosova people's desire for self-determination,  and far less did it mention any Turkish acceptance of Kosova as  an independent, neutral state being an option. Why then did Mr.  Cico not ask the Turkish president this question, which  constitutes the Albanians' fundamental national problem? It is  not difficult to understand the reason for such "carelessness."  We think, as far as this problem is concerned, that it is  because our president's visit to Ankara had extremely bitter  results. It seems our Islamic ally is much more interested in  reviving its ancient influence on our troubled peninsula,  solving the Serbian-Bosnian conflict, and creating an  independent Bosnian state, than in creating a neutral state of  Kosova, independent of Serbia. At the same time, Demirel's  fatherland cannot opt out of implementing the other NATO  countries' policy. Its aid toward Albania also has to be within  the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. It could raise certain  objections to the EC sluggishness over the Balkan crisis, but  not to the sluggishness over the Albanian-Serb issue. Moreover,  one must not forget the strained Greek-Turkish relations over  the Cyprus affair, and Turkey's desire to play a prominent role  in the Black Sea countries' cooperation project.    The conclusion is that the Turkish rejection of our option  for Kosova was yet another failure of our diplomacy following  the one in London. On his return to Albania, President Berisha  on 8 April met with another top dignitary, a Western one -- the  commander-in-chief of NATO troops in Europe, U.S. Army General  George Joulwan. During the talks, our president assured the  general that Albania would fulfill all her obligations stemming  from the Partnership for Peace agreement with the utmost  readiness and devotion. It became clear from those talks (as  far as we could learn from the television) that our President  Berisha was mainly asking NATO to guarantee Albania's  independence against any possible Serbian-Montenegrin  aggression. Yet the Kosova problem was once more left out of  the discussions, and thus out of NATO's concern.    The commander-in-chief of the great Western military  alliance  showed considerable interest in, and remained very satisfied  with, the airfields, port facilities, and military bases that  Albania, as a country of strategic importance in the region, has  put at NATO's unconditional disposal. As for our national  question -- the Kosova question -- not a single word was uttered  by the U.S. army general (again according to what was said on  the television) during a news conference by [Albanian Minister  of Defense] Zhulali and Joulwan. Berisha's request for increased  U.S. presence in the region has to do with the Balkan crisis,  the restoration of peace in Bosnia, and the prevention of the  conflict from spreading toward southern Yugoslavia, rather than  with the Kosova people's aspiration for an independent and  neutral state.    Finally, there are the results of the talks with Klaus  Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister. He assured  Albania of support in all fields, promising heaven and earth.  However, as for the Kosova issue, nothing concrete was promised,  because, as it transpired from the discussions, the German  minister gained the impression that even his Albanian  interlocutors did not know precisely what they wanted.    Why, then, has our diplomacy entered a blind alley over the  Kosova issue -- the problem of our entire nation? There are a  great number of reasons that require individual, deep analysis  -- well- argued, mature, analysis showing patriotic courage. In  this analysis we are going to deal with just one of them. Our  Albanian diplomacy, on both sides of the border, does not have  any national political platform. The commendable work by  certain political and intellectual forces to chart a unified and  binding national policy has been attacked and sabotaged by the  Albanian state and its ruling parties. Our Albanian diplomacy  is faced with an impasse, and it will never result in any  achievements, because it is unable (or unwilling) to devise a  just resolution of the Albanian question, which is not only a  problem relating to Kosova. It has not properly formulated the  options that it has presented to the world, and, which is worse,  it has mangled them, reducing to an absurd level the will  expressed in a referendum by the Kosova people living in their  own lands occupied by the Serbs. There can never be any  prospect of success for a policy or diplomacy that fails to  tackle the Albanian problem as a whole, including the Kosova  issue as its indisputably main constituent part. The creation  of a union of all Albanians living in their ethnic territories  will be the only good solution for the Albanians, the Balkans,  Europe, as well as Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] themselves.</p>

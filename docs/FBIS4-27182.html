			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [30 May]  expressed regret over North Korea's refusal to suspend the  refueling of a nuclear reactor suspected of being used to  produce nuclear weapons.    "It is very regrettable North Korea has failed to make  sincere response to the IAEA's efforts," Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference.    North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA)  broke off their three-day talks in Pyongyang on Friday after the  two sides failed to come to agreement over the inspection of  spent fuel rods removed at the reactor.    The top government spokesman also demanded that North Korea  immediately suspend the removal of nuclear fuel rods from its 5-  megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the  capital, and fully abide by international nuclear safeguards.    The IAEA has told north Korean negotiators that continuing  replacement of fuel rods without inspection violates safeguards  requirements as specified by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty.    Saying Japan has tried to persuade North Korea to suspend  the  refueling in concert with the United States, South Korea and  China, Kumagai vowed further efforts to grapple with the  communist country's suspected nuclear arms program.    Meanwhile, Kumagai withheld comments when asked if  Pyongyang's reported preparations for test-launching a missile  is linked with the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA talks.    North Korea test-launched the Nodong-1 missile, with an  estimated 1,000-kilometer range, over the sea of Japan in May  1993.    Pyongyang's development of a long-range missile poses a  serious threat to Japan and South Korea, as does its suspected  nuclear arms program.</p>

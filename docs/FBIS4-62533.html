			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 13 May (LETA) -- On Thursday [12 May] Latvian  Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs received the Russian Ambassador,  Alexander Rannikh, who presented a fixed timetable for the  Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia. During the handover of  the document the Deputy Commander of Western Military Group  Fedor Melnichuk, the Commander of the Latvian defence forces,  Dainis Turlais, and other officials were present.    Under the document Russia pledges to withdraw all military  ships from Liepaja and Ventspils by 1 June. However, as the  Latvian premier stated after having viewed the timetable, the  document is a detailed variant of the previous one handed over  earlier and indicates 14 military units whose presence Latvia  was not aware of. The agreement provides that Russia must  present a full timetable of its forces pullout which is to be  accomplished in June under the agreements signed in Moscow.    Speaking on whether the Russian Army will be withdrawn  earlier than by 31 August, Birkavs said that the new timetable  indicates only this date as a deadline, although Mr. Melnichuk  reminded during the talk that Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has instructed Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev to speed up the  process. All issues concerning troop withdrawal will be  discussed at the special government session on Friday where  commissioners for the control over the Latvian-Russian  withdrawal agreements were confirmed.    The prime minister highlighted unpleasant news reported from  the firing ground in Adazi, whose installations were destroyed  and plundered. This incident will be specially discussed with  the commandment of the north-western military group.</p>

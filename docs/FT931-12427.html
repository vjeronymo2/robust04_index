			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: 'Marked loss' on chemicals side depresses Veba 20% to DM900m NET profits at Veba, the Dusseldorf-based conglomerate, fell by 20 per cent last year to DM900m (Dollars 570.7m), down from DM1.02bn in 1991. Sales climbed by 12 per cent to DM67bn, reflecting the inclusion of the forwarding company Schenker for the first time, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The profits drop was due to a 'marked loss' in the company's chemicals operations, combined with a substantial deterioration in earnings in the oil division. Profits increased in trading, transportation and services as well as the core electricity generating business. A fall of this magnitude was expected after the company warned last month of the impact of extraordinary charges to cover the costs of redundancies and other rationalisation measures, mainly in the chemicals sector. These were likely to amount to DM337m for 1992, the company warned at the time. Veba intends to hold its 1992 dividend at DM12 per share.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Erskine House down 29% as UK machine sales suffer PRE-TAX profits at Erskine House, the office equipment services company, tumbled 29 per cent to Pounds 4.7m following a severe decline in UK machine sales. Mr Brian McGillivray, chairman, said the group was 'searching very hard' for signs of a pick-up in UK trading, but there had been none so far. New machine sales had fallen by 24 per cent in the UK in the first half, with margins under severe pressure. Germany was also proving more difficult than last year, he said, although the US continued to show improvement. As a result of this, and exceptionally difficult trading in October and November, Mr McGillivray said about Pounds 1m in annualised costs had since been taken out of the services division and administration. The sales force had already been cut by 50 per cent over the past 18 months. During the six months to September 30, overall sales fell from Pounds 89.1m to Pounds 87.3m. Turnover in the UK declined by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 24.9m, with operating profits down by 60 per cent to Pounds 1.12m. In Germany, the operating profit slide from Pounds 745,000 to Pounds 214,000 had been disappointing, but were an improvement on the second half. The good news from the US, with dollar profits 9 per cent ahead, was virtually wiped out by currency translations. In sterling terms, US operating profits were flat at Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.02m). Mr McGillivray said the US was 'getting better, but not yet booming'. He expected the losses on exchange rates in the first half to be offset in the latter period by the devaluation of sterling. The dividend was maintained at 3p, reflecting 'a degree of confidence that we are capable of improving', said Mr McGillivray. Earnings fell from 6.3p to 2.5p per share, hit by a Pounds 500,000 write-off in advance corporation tax. Mr McGillivray said that put taxation on UK profits at about 60 per cent.</p>

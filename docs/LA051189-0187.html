			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> FIRE, RESCUE IDEA APPROVED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a proposal that  could pave the way for Monterey Park's fire and rescue operations to be  consolidated into the county Fire Department.  </P> <P> A study by the county indicated a possible annual savings of $594,571 to the  city. The board's vote authorizes the county fire chief to negotiate with  Monterey Park, if the city wants to pursue the topic.  </P> <P> But Monterey Park officials are reacting cautiously to the idea, which over the  years has been suggested as a cost-saving measure for the city.  </P> <P> "We'd certainly be interested in seeing what they've come up with," City  Manager Mark Lewis said. But, he said, the issue is not a priority. "We're  concerned that there may be hidden costs that would significantly add to the  city's costs."  </P> <P> Fire Chief Allen E. McComb said: "I haven't been convinced yet that  consolidation is the best solution. We're providing some services, such as  paramedic ambulances, which would not be as readily available with the county."  </P> <P> Neither McComb nor Lewis have seen the county's detailed proposal.  </P></p>

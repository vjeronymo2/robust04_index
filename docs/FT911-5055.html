			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury tax figures THE UK's highest earners are paying on average almost Pounds 35,000 less in income tax than they would if tax levels of 1978-79 had simply been indexed, according to Treasury figures published yesterday. The figures, taking into account the 1991 budget, cover all those earning more than Pounds 70,000. They also show a person earning less than Pounds 5,000 with a reduction of Pounds 130.</p>

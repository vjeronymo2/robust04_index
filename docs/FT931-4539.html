			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (6): From the depths of the slump - Catherine Milton hears about the travails of a private mortgage company MR RICHARD ANDERSON is head of underwriting at the Household Mortgage Corporation, the privately-owned residential mortgage company. During 1990 he regularly consulted a 'knowledge' engineer about his job. He was not suffering from brain strain. The discussions he had were part of the company's attempt to speed up its underwriting but maintain consistency through automation. The company, which is roughly the same size (in terms of assets) as the Chelsea Building Society, 12th or 13th largest in the UK, has traded through the housing slump, serving about 35,000 customers with about Pounds 2bn worth of business on its books. HMC last year announced bad debt provisions of Pounds 4.16m for the year to end-March 1991, sharply up from Pounds 2.2m the previous year. This was relatively modest compared with other lenders. Its pre-tax profits had more than doubled in the year to March 1991 from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 5.16m. The company says it identified four priorities in the 1980s as the need to maintain: the quality of its loan book in a difficult market; protection against fraud through scrutiny of applications; fast turnaround of mortgage applications - generally within 24 hours; current staff levels to handle a larger volume of applications when the market recovers. Automation seemed the logical route. HMC turned to Infolink Decision Services, one of the UK's four main suppliers and designers of credit scoring systems. A report into credit scoring published last year by the Office of Fair Trading found that the number of lenders using some form of credit scoring system in the UK has grown recently. The OFT said: 'Credit scoring is now an established and integral part of the procedures of much of the credit industry. Credit scoring is used extensively by many if not all the major lenders in banks, credit and charge card issuers, finance houses, building societies, retailers, mail order companies and direct selling companies as well as other lenders.' Mr Anderson says: 'We wanted the computer to do what underwriters have always done manually. For example, we wanted it to check the distance between a person's place of work and the property. There may be a very good reason why someone who gives a work address in the North of Scotland is buying in the South East of England, but it is unusual.' The company believed a computer could reach a level of consistency in underwriting which would normally take the combined efforts of several people to achieve. The computer would also leave underwriters free to attend to less straightforward applications where judgment is important. This consistency is a main element in detecting fraud, but the system is also designed to deter fraudsters. Mr Anderson says: 'There is a certain amount of shouting-from-the-tree-tops. We want people who are considering these kinds of frauds to know that their chances of success at HMC are slim.' But HMC wanted a system capable of producing a report which would allow underwriters to see clearly how the computer had arrived at its conclusion and investigate as appropriate rather than simply scoring applications. It was at this point that Infolink sent in the knowledge engineer. This was to try and identify the values behind HMC's underwriting decisions. Mr Anderson says: 'The psychologist was sent in to try and understand the way we underwrite. We will deal with a loan application and we will look at certain facets of that application. 'We had to give examples of what we would and would not accept and the relative importance of different factors in that decision.' Infolink studied the risk weighting HMC gave factors such as income, age and employment history, for each particular product. It also looked at cases which had been declined and the performance of those which had been accepted. Today, as each application form arrives at HMC, the operator will type in the name and address, which triggers a credit reference request. By the time the operator has finished inputting details, the credit reference will have been returned and will be weighted. An assessment breakdown form - based on the scrutiny of more than 100 factors - is then produced for underwriters to check. The procedure usually takes about 10 minutes. The old manual system took an average of two hours assuming no distractions from colleagues or telephone calls. Mr Anderson insists that the system has no flaws, although he admits to having dotted a few i's and crossed a few t's in the early stages after installation. The company is equally silent about the cost of the system. The OFT described cost of such systems as 'substantial' and requiring a volume of business for the increased efficiency generated by its use to offset the cost within the life of the system. Mr Anderson said: 'You are not talking about a Pounds 10,000 system. But it has already picked up a couple of cases of what we believe to be attempted fraud.' The company is also anxious to stamp on the idea that automation could lead to job losses. HMC has not reduced staff numbers since installation of the system, although some staff have been moved into customer services, to deal with the darker side of HMC's credit management - arrears management. Mr Geoff Wagland, HMC's corporate affairs manager, says arrears management is one area in which computers are unlikely to make much of an increased contribution: 'This is where the customer services element really comes into its own. This is where you need people, although computers can help.' All mortgage repayments are made to HMC by direct debit and the company will let customers know the debit has not been honoured before their bank does: 'We will get on to a customer in difficulties very, very quickly so as to work out a solution that works for both parties.' He says: 'If you have got it right in the first instance then customers don't get into difficulties without a good reason.' That is why his company puts such emphasis on underwriting quality and its computerised credit system.</p>

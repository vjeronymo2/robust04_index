			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Fitness regime for '90s: David Marsh on the changes foreseen by European banks European commercial banks pondering their strategies for the end of the century foresee a tighter, leaner future - for themselves and their customers. They will be more cost-conscious and closely regulated than today, and will employ considerably fewer staff. They will make more of their profits from trading activities rather than lending. They will offer a broader scope of services to retail and corporate customers, but at increased fees. These are the main findings of a broad survey of European banking and capital markets published yesterday, polling the views of executives from 400 banks and institutions across 21 European countries. The study, by consultants Arthur Andersen, shows that European banks are sceptical about the prospects for introducing a single European currency by the Maastricht target date of 1999. Doubts about the feasibility of reducing European currency fluctuations are greatest in Germany, France and the UK. Banks are unlikely, however, to be worried by the damping of hopes for speedy economic and monetary union, as they expect to make an increasing share of earnings from dealing in European currency instruments. The banks are pinning hopes for expansion above all on trading in derivatives, equities, money market instruments and corporate bonds. Their emphasis on derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options used to hedge exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations - has already caused some concern among international bank supervisors, who have pointed to the need for greater surveillance of these markets. Partly reflecting such worries, banks expect increased moves towards EC-wide regulation by the end of the decade, with 45 per cent of respondents saying this would hit profits. Anxiety about the impact on earnings of tighter regulation is greatest in Belgium, France and Luxembourg, as well as central and eastern Europe. A majority of banks believes a pan-European free market in financial services will improve profitability. But French banks are exceptionally nervous about increased competition from other EC countries: 45 per cent of respondents believe this will reduce profitability, compared with only 15 per cent who hold this view elsewhere in Europe. As increased domestic and international competition lowers profitability in traditional lending and deposit business, banks are consciously widening their scope. There is a trend towards German-style 'universal' banks, grouping commercial and merchant banking activities under one roof. Most respondents believe universal banks will significantly gain market share in a wide range of areas - from derivatives and foreign exchange to insurance and deposit-taking. The need to cut costs is reflected in banks' intention both to reduce staff numbers further and to press ahead with costly new technology - part of the move towards 'branchless' banking. Significantly, German banks - although apparently seen as a model by many competitors - emerge as among the most likely to be affected by future changes. At present relatively fragmented, the German banking industry expects much greater concentration. Ninety one per cent of German respondents, compared with 58 per cent of their European counterparts, expect further closures of bank branches. German bankers see far more opportunities than others from expansion in central and eastern Europe, and believe hostile takeovers - currently exceptional in Germany - will be more common. For all the differences in individual countries, banks spot one overriding trend with considerable relevance for the development of capital markets across the continent. As public sector social security schemes come under pressure for economic and demographic reasons, retail customers are likely to turn more to banks for long-term pensions and insurance products. As banks examine questions about their roles and identities, the report makes clear the scale of the management challenge. As Mr David Andrews, Andersen's head of financial services, puts it: 'For survival, change is not optional - it is mandatory.'</p>

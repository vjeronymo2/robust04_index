			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Truth and a Major Problem"] </F>   [Text] It is reported that the Vietnamese people and  government have made a strong demand to force residents and  foreigners in Vietnam to live in special concentration zones.  This is aimed at ensuring the safety of those people and that  of the Vietnamese inhabitants as well.    The report also indicates that foreigners have been deceived  bitterly by local people while the former, in turn, have created  no less multitudinous insecurity and anarchy among the  Vietnamese people and government.    In Cambodia, residents and foreigners, especially the  Vietnamese and Thais, are in a similar situation and are even  more powerful than those in Vietnam. They are living in an  uncontrolled manner and have created indecency throughout the  country. They are currently polluting the environment along  rivers and in villages; destroying fine ancient traditions;  causing insecurity in society; and committing thievery, robbery,  dupery, prostitution, obscenity, vices, and so on. As for the  Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has lately striven to  produce an immigration law with the aim of taking different  measures to restore social order.    Some local political analysts have expressed the belief that  the political situation in Cambodia will ease to some extent if  the government strives to codify the immigration law quickly and  if the National Assembly speedily adopts it. Owing to the lack  of a law, it is hard to organize these foreign residents in an  orderly fashion. The delay in the promulgation of the law has  been severely criticized.    It is also known that an anti-Vietnamese demonstration  recently was deterred. Analysts are of the opinion that there  will be obstacles in the implementation of the law as the  problem of Vietnamese in Cambodia is complicated and also has  political implications.    It is expected that there will be some reaction from the  Vietnamese Government after the immigration law is enacted and  after its enforcement. It, however, is hoped that the  settlement of the issue of foreign residents in Cambodia will  help ease some of the problems surrounding the issue of a  roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge.</p>

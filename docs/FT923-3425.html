			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Asia and Pacific bloc agree secretariat THE 15 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group (APEC) have decided to put the organisation on a more permanent footing by setting up a small secretariat in Singapore. The decision was reached in Bangkok, at the group's fourth annual ministerial meeting, which ended yesterday. The ministers also agreed a programme to prepare for regional trade liberalisation and issued a statement calling for a speedy end to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). APEC, set up in 1989, comprises the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Members say its main value has been its regular consultations and studies on matters such as compiling regional trade data. The decision to site the secretariat in Singapore is partly to quell worries in south-east Asia that the smaller nations will be dominated in APEC by Japan, the US and other economic powers. The Uruguay Round statement issued yesterday includes calls for the major economies in particular to settle their differences, and for countries such as the US to refrain from taking unilateral retaliation against countries deemed to be trading unfairly. Mr Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, said yesterday he had been assured by US officials that the Bush administration would push for a Uruguay Round settlement some time between the French referendum on Maastricht and the US presidential elections in November.</p>

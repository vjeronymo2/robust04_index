			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Argentine judge guilty FOR the first time in living memory, a senior public figure has been found guilty of corruption in Argentina, after the Senate yesterday impeached Mr Alberto Nicosia, a federal judge accused of multi-million dollar fraud against state-owned companies. The senators found the judge guilty of misconduct and failing to carry out the duties of a public official. They removed him from the bench and banned him from holding public office. Mr Nicosia was a key figure in an organisation involving other judges, expert witnesses and defence and prosecution lawyers, who colluded with plaintiffs suing state companies for personal loss in accidents. The judges invariably found against the defendants and inflated their damages, which they then shared out amongst themselves. Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the state-owned railway company, was their favoured target. In December 1990, a government watchdog agency reported that the company owed legal costs and damages of about Dollars 80m. The government has also initiated further, as yet unknown, charges against Mr Nicosia. Corruption is one of the principal complaints of ordinary Argentines against the government of President Carlos Menem. The government claims it is rooting out corruption by deregulating and privatising the economy. Furthermore, about 20 senior government officials, including five cabinet ministers, have been sacked in corruption-related scandals.</p>

The FFEL Program regulations govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal SLS, the Federal PLUS and the Federal Consolidation Loan programs are hereinafter referred to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs. The final regulations incorporate statutory changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), self-implementing provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (1993 Technical Amendments). Regulations needed to implement other OBRA amendments and the 1993 Technical Amendments will be published separately. The final regulations also reflect various policy initiatives intended to improve program administration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Pursuant to section 482(c) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1089(c)), these regulations take effect July 1, 1995, with the exception of &sect;&sect;682.401, 682.405, and 682.409.

The Consolidation Loan Program gives borrowers an opportunity to consolidate loans made under the Stafford loan, Perkins (formerly National Direct Student Loan), Auxiliary Loans to Assist Students (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, SLS, Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Professions Student Loan (HPSL), and the Higher Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 16, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL program in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 12484). Those proposed regulations were developed in compliance with section 492 of the 1992 Amendments (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), mandating that the regulations be submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. Regional meetings were held during September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of the proposed regulations and a negotiated rulemaking process was conducted during January and February 1993. The NPRM published on March 16, 1994 provided an indepth discussion of those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus as reflected in those regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student aid programs also enable current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate effectively, and solve problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.200&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The Secretary has revised the definition of ``disposable income'' to exclude: (1) child support or alimony payments that are made under a court order or in accordance with a written legally enforceable agreement and (2) the amounts withheld under wage garnishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Secretary has revised the definition of ``estimated financial assistance'' to exclude the amount of expected Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-study aid if the borrower did not apply for those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Secretary has revised the definition of ``repayment period'' as it applies to the SLS Program to reflect the borrower's option to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Secretary has revised the definition of ``satisfactory repayment arrangement'' to provide that for purposes of consolidating a defaulted loan, the borrower will be required to make three consecutive reasonable and affordable full monthly voluntary payments rather than six as provided in the NPRM. The definition has been also revised to specify that an on-time payment is one received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days of the scheduled due date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

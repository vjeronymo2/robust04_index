			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (2): Measures are having some success - The stabilisation plan aims to reduce the budget deficit and keep inflation at under 30 per cent THE ECUADOREAN economy, which derives nearly half of fiscal income and 45 per cent of export earnings from oil, has been through a few sharp ups and many downs in the past 10 years. Underlying problems include chronic budget deficits and inflation, deteriorating wages and an increasing concentration of income, low domestic and foreign investment, corruption and inefficiency in the public sector. Successive attempts to stabilise the economy by the past three governments have barely scraped the surface. However, the new administration's macroeconomic plan has found favour with bankers and appears to be producing results. The sucre was initially devalued by 35 per cent and then allowed to float between l,700 and 2,000 to the dollar, with the central bank intervening to keep it below 2,000. The idea is to boost exports and reduce expectations of further devaluations, while allowing an ample margin for price adjustment. Launched on September 3, the stabilisation plan's measures also included: Raising petrol and most other fuel prices by 125 per cent or more; Increased electricity tariffs on a sliding scale varying from nought to 120 per cent; Cuts in state spending; Freezing of recruitment in the public sector - a significant saving in a country where new governments normally addseveral hundred to the existing number of civil servants in order to pay off political debts. These and other measures are designed to bring the budget deficit down to a manageable level and keep inflation at under 30 per cent next year. Although the monthly inflation rate shot up immediately after the plan was launched, it fell back to 1 per cent in November, to the relief of economic authorities. International reserves have more than tripled to Dollars 800m since September, helped by the fact that importers had stocked up earlier in the year. However, the immediate inflationary costs of stabilisation are clear and the government has so far done little to mitigate them. It will be difficult to keep annual wage increases down to the 30 per cent level. The next stage of the plan entails extensive restructuring and privatisation and is one of the main elements of the modernisation policy. The public sector is involved in some 170 companies, many of them originally privately owned and propped up by the state when they collapsed. Although a detailed strategy is still being drawn up, Mr Pablo Lucio Paredes, of the National Development Council, outlines three main areas for privatisation: First, state shares in relatively small companies such as the National cement works, the Hotel Colon and some banks, will be sold through the stock exchange in a matter of months. The second group, consisting of medium-sized companies in state hands - for example the Aztra sugar refinery and the Selva Alegre cement plant - are also relatively short-term, uncomplicated cases. The third group, the state monopolies, will require special legislation. Each case in this group will be handled individually but the government has already made it clear that virtually everything - apart from a few 'strategic' companies - is on the table. Communications, oil, electricity, the ports, water provision, the main airline and even the politically controversial Social Security Institute, are included. Nearly all of these organisations need large investments and new technology and some may be broken up into several smaller companies. The Quito and Guayaquil stock markets, as yet very small, could be in for a boom. 'The first phase of privatisation represents companies with Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m in state shares,' said Mr Edison Ortiz, president of the Quito stock exchange. 'It is important that all the dealings should be absolutely transparent. 'This will help open up the market to more people. Investors here think stocks are just for the rich. Foreign participation is allowed but it has not developed.' Although foreign investments have remained under Dollars 80m a year recently, the privatisation programme is already attracting interest from the US, Japan and the EC. In principle, the government plans to offer foreign investors the same conditions as nationals. This means changing the tax system, removing restrictions in sectors such as telecommunications and streamlining regulations. One new area of special interest is mining - although the country has rich gold and other mineral deposits, invasions by prospectors and inadequate legislation have deterred foreign companies. 'When we have the framework and the regulations ready, investment will come,' Mr Paredes said. Mr Paredes is less confident about the question of labour: 'It's bound to be conflictive. Public employees must share in the privatisation process, there should be training for those who become unemployed . . . we must convince people that privatisation is all right.' A National Council for Modernisation has been set up by the government to recommend and carry through the necessary legal reforms. Its director Mr German Penaherrera, who is also an alternate congressman, says: 'Apart from privatisation, we are working to co-ordinate decentralisation, de-bureaucratisation and deregulation. 'There are too many contradictory laws and rules, we need fewer, clearer, ones. Every piece of paper is a potential for corruption.' A new anti-corruption unit is to investigate cases speedily and ensure charges are brought. The cornerstone of the strategy to rationalise public spending emerged with last month's budget law. Although it did not go through congress exactly as drafted, the law stops a multitude of special allocations to individual institutions and allows the minister of finance to control outgoings. The government also plans to strike at hidden subsidies, such as long delays in paying bills for public services. The next three months will be crucial, both for the start up of the privatisation programme and for the effects of the stabilisation plan. Economic growth for 1992 is expected to be around 2.5 per cent and next year's figure may be lower - barely level with the population growth rate of 2.2 per cent. But for the moment the government has made inflation its primary target and, judging by the remarkably quick deceleration in the cost of living, it seems to be having some success in this area.</p>

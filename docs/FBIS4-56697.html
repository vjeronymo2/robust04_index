			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Antonio Indacochea Alvarez] </F>   [Text] Tingo Maria, 25 Apr -- General Alfredo Rodriguez  Riveros, chief of the Huallaga Front, said that the bodies found  buried in a grave in the Shapingo sector (Moyuna) yesterday by  members of the Human Rights Commission of the Democratic  Constituent Congress belong to two Shining Path "commanders" of  a group that operates in this zone.    He said this was determined by the testimony of three  repented Shining Path members who were under the command of one  of them, and also from intelligence information.    Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade  Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military  commands, respectively, of the so-called 3d Batallion of the  Moena-Moyuno People's Committee.    "Comrade Abel" supposedly is peasant Felix Loyola who,  according to his wife and relatives, was a coca grower who had  his farm in this sector and was shot by soldiers when he was  leaving the area.    Gen. Rodriguez presumes that the bodies belong to some of  the  six terrorists killed by a militay patrol on 8 April in a clash  in another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by foot  into the jungle.    He said that all the information will be given to provincial  Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is investigating this case  to gain more evidence to clarify the killings.    Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the  port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary  information the bones have been there for several years.</p>

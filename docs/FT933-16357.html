			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Redgrave's return AFTER 15 years' absence, Vanessa Redgrave returns to the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in Maybe, a play about the McCarthy trials in America during the 1950s. It makes sporadically good drama, although the play has still to find its focus. Maybe tells two entwined stories of 1950s left-wing America. First of James (John Bennett), a third generation immigrant academic writing a biography about his film-director father Alan (also John Bennett). Second of Barbara (Margaret Robertson), a Polish emigre who reveals the past by telling of her friendship with him. Between them, his lover Lynn (Vanessa Redgrave), daughter of a mutual friend to Barbara and Alan, mediates past and present by acting out the memories of her mother, Patricia (also Vanessa Redgrave). This complicated situation appears clear enough on stage, with clever cutting between the 1950s and the 1990s, and good acting to differentiate between present and past. The characters stick to their cultural stereotypes. So Jewish left-wing represented by Alan and Barbara, meets old Boston in Patricia to forge an uneasy trio summoned before the Committee for Un-American Activities in 1952. Most creeds are right in what they affirm and wrong in what they deny. The Truman doctrine in the 1940s and McCarthyism in the 1950s failed to account for the changing state of things in Europe. The position for anti-fascists in the 1930s was untenable: to be anti-communist as well was to give succour to Hitler by attacking Stalin. But Maybe never shows, even in its fine trial scene, just what was at stake during that period. After all, 40 years ago, Julius and Ethel Rosenburg were executed at Sing Sing, New York, for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, then indirectly at war with the US in Korea. What emerges from the tangle on stage is part political history and part psychotherapy. James/Alan figures out who he is in writing the biography; Barbara confesses that she named names at the Committee hearing; and Lynn/Patricia unites the traumas of the past with the demands of the present. But the dialogue lacks subtlety: 'Were you really a communist in the 30s?' 'Who wasn't, in those days?' The programme records that Redgrave suggested the idea to writer Mikhail Shatrov and adapter Keith Reddin. It makes a good vehicle for the parts which give scope to her talent. Although Redgrave is not at her best in this difficult part, her acting is so strong that she draws fine performances from Robertson and Bennett. She argues so well on stage, twitching at a cardigan, tugging at the hair; that those opposite her, including Melanie Thaw as an errant daughter, respond to the strength and energy. Robertson and Bennett move easily into the flashback scenes, reeling back the years. Braham Murray's direction differentiates nicely between times, but leaves the actors looking uncertain over detail and props. Rehearsal should cure that. The patrician interior set blends Bostonian plainness and grandeur such that the drawing room easily transforms to the committee room. But Senator Joseph McCarthy, even in one of the drinking bouts which eventually killed him in 1957, could not have imagined the dissolution of the Soviet Union so quickly. History makes fools of us all.</p>

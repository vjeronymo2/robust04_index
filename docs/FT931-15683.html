			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Hong Kong delays plans to increase democracy GOVERNOR Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong are unlikely to be put before the local legislature until the end of next month, increasing the time available for legislators to draw up any alternatives. The Executive Council, Mr Patten's highest advisory body, begins its deliberations on the legislation today. Its consideration could last a month or so, far longer than had been generally assumed. Moreover, according to one government official, the Executive Council's blanket approval for all the proposed reforms cannot be taken for granted. 'You cannot assume it goes to LegCo (the Legislative Council) as proposed,' he said. 'The Executive Council could advise that the proposals need amendment, although I would be surprised if they were changed.' The general expectation in Hong Kong was that the Executive Council would approve the legislation at today's sitting. This would have cleared the way for the package to be introduced into the Legislative Council in the first week of February. The suggestion that the Executive Council may want to spend up to three sessions considering Mr Patten's legislation is bound to raise expectations that the governor's proposals might be altered to make them more acceptable to China. Beijing has ruled out accepting an Executive Council or LegCo-induced solution to its objections to the governor's plans. Beijing claims it will be satisfied only with the complete withdrawal of Mr Patten's proposals.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Struggle to climb above the cloud: Low morale and rising competition are the challenges facing British Airways' new bosses Mr Robert Ayling, British Airways' new managing director, was taking a steady stream of telephone calls last week in his Mexico City hotel suite, at the same time as completing a memo to the airline's 49,000 employees. Back in the company's London offices, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's new chairman, was calling in a succession of senior advisers for a series of hectic meetings. Though thousands of miles apart, both men were engaged in final preparations for the most important day in the company's annual diary. For both of them, taking over in the wake of Lord King's retirement as chairman, today's announcement of BA's financial results will be particularly significant. It will be the first time that the airline's new management team will have addressed the City of London since the company's High Court libel settlement and humiliating apology in January to Mr Richard Branson for the 'dirty tricks' campaign against his Virgin Atlantic Airways. The airline has continued to outperform most of its competition. Overall, BA's scheduled traffic rose by 12.3 per cent in the financial year ending March on a capacity increase of 11.3 per cent. BA is expected to show a drop of about a third in pre-tax profits for the financial year that ended in March, to a figure of between Pounds 180m and Pounds 200m compared with Pounds 284m the previous year. However, the majority of its competitors are continuing to report huge losses. Europe's biggest airlines, hit by recession, overcapacity and fierce fares wars, saw their accumulated losses increase last year to Dollars 1.35bn from Dollars 1.1bn in 1991, according to figures published last Friday by the Association of European Airlines. And in the last three years, the International Air Transport Association says western carriers have lost more than Dollars 10bn on their international scheduled routes. 'Under the circumstances, our performance is wonderful,' says Mr Ayling. But he is also the first to acknowledge that BA is entering a new era. The 'world's favourite airline', as BA likes to call itself, faces a number of strategic questions which will test the mettle of its new top managers. Externally, the company must continue to expand around the world at a time of increasing airline deregulation and competition. Internally, the new team faces an additional task: cleaning its own stables and restoring internal morale after the Virgin case. Mr Branson has launched new legal proceedings against BA and shows every intention of maintaining the pressure on his bigger UK rival. BA's board has again renewed its confidence in all the company's directors, stating publicly last month that board members 'do not question the integrity' of Sir Colin and Mr Ayling. Despite their efforts to distance themselves from the 'dirty tricks' campaign, a cloud still hangs over BA's management. The company has decided not to give details of its side of the story because of the threat of further litigation. But in the absence of any facts, speculation has been allowed to run rife, creating considerable anger and frustration inside the company. If internal morale has been sapped by the Virgin affair, BA's UK workers have become even more concerned about their own circumstances. Unions representing pilots, cabin crews and ground staff have balloted their members about industrial action. They are increasingly unhappy with BA's plans to become a global airline and its intensified efforts to cut costs, including the creation of low-cost subsidiaries for UK regional services and for the loss-making short-haul European operations based at Gatwick, acquired last year from Dan Air. Sir Colin insists BA is not attempting to 'export' jobs through its international partnerships with airlines in the US, Europe and Australia. 'We are trying to ensure BA becomes the lynchpin in the future global entity for our business,' he explains. But he admits he would have preferred to space out over a longer period of time the flurry of acquisitions the company has made in the last four months. The company has spent Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m acquiring strategic stakes in USAir, Qantas of Australia, the French TAT regional carrier and a small German carrier, as well as taking over Dan Air and the Plymouth-based Brymon operations in the UK. To help finance these acquisitions and reduce gearing, which stood at 46 per cent at the end of last year, City analysts expect BA to launch a big rights issue when it announces its results today. In his memo from Mexico City, Mr Ayling has attempted to reassure the airline's staff that the company will do all it can to safeguard their jobs. But he also warned it was necessary for the company to continue improving efficiency, introducing, among other steps, a differential pay structure as the only alternative to closure or disposal of loss-making UK operations. US airlines have already introduced two tier wage systems to reduce costs of lower yielding and unprofitable short-haul operations. But the concept is new in Europe. 'Gatwick has always been a loss maker: British Caledonian lost money on its short-haul routes and we found it difficult to improve the performance when we took them over,' Mr Ayling said. The collapse of Dan Air offered BA a 'one-off' opportunity to change the level of costs of the airline's operations at Gatwick, he added. 'If Gatwick is to work, we've got to have a lower cost base than we can live with at Heathrow. We came right up front on that,' Sir Colin explains. Gatwick has traditionally been a loss-making operation because of its higher proportion of leisure to business traffic compared with Heathrow. BA successfully restructured its UK regional operations last year into a low-cost subsidiary with lower wage levels than at Heathrow. But the decision to set up another low cost subsidiary at Gatwick has worried unions and staff who fear BA will seek new labour concessions at Heathrow. Mr Ayling has gone out of his way to stress that BA had no intention of seeking pay reductions except 'in the wholly exceptional circumstances where this is the only alternative to closure or disposal of parts of BA which are making unsustainable losses'. This was the case for the Gatwick short-haul operations, which are losing about Pounds 35m a year, and the UK regional operations, which have now become profitable under their new lower cost structure. BA's labour costs 10 years ago accounted for about 35 per cent of the airline's total annual costs. Today they have fallen to around 25 per cent. This steady improvement in productivity is largely responsible for the airline's profits this year when revenues and yields have been under pressure. With the exception of Belfast and the short-haul Gatwick operations, all the airline's operations were profitable last year although the company made less money on its traditionally lucrative North Atlantic routes because of intense fare competition. Sir Colin and Mr Ayling are now trying to create a new esprit de corps to take staff and middle management with them as the airline adapts to the competitive pressures of an increasingly global and deregulated airline industry. 'The company is not hell bent in cutting people's pay and conditions,' Mr Ayling insists. 'It is not trying to reduce the number of people employed - quite the opposite. We are enlarging the company and trying to use the benefits of globalisation to everyone's advantage.' In the past 10 years BA's employment in the UK has grown from 37,000 to 49,000. The airline has been significantly more successful in lowering its costs than its big European competitors. It must continue these efforts, however. The UK government has actively encouraged new entrants and opened up Heathrow to more competition. 'John King gave BA a new sense of commercialism. He brought that with Colin who brought the necessary customer service and disciplines of management to the company,' Mr Ayling says. 'My challenge is to take that on to the next stage,' he says, hoping to achieve 'as much participation and sense of belonging as possible.' Some in the company felt that the King-Marshall era created such a competitive - and at times ruthless - atmosphere that staff may have felt encouraged to overstep the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. Now, with the Virgin dispute hanging over it, BA will have to be seen to be whiter than white in an industry notorious for sharp practice. Pacing his Mexico suite, Mr Ayling had no doubt of the task he faces. 'The challenge,' he says, 'is to create a climate of enthusiasm and competitiveness within the bounds of the acceptable.'  --------------------------------------------------------------                AIRLINES' NET PROFITS AND LOSSES  --------------------------------------------------------------                           1990         1991          1992                       (Dollars m)   (Dollars m)   (Dollars m)  -------------------------------------------------------------- British Airways          174.5         444.0          400 Air France*             -277.5         123.0         -500 Lufthansa                  5.4        -272.4       -1,100  -------------------------------------------------------------- AMR (American)           -76.8        -239.9         -935** Delta                    -22.3        -239.5         -565 UAL (United)              95.7        -331.9         -957**  -------------------------------------------------------------- Cathay Pacific           373.0         380.0          250 JAL                       97.1         -22.2         -400 Singapore                499.2         568.7          600  -------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes UTA and Air Inter **Includes one-time accounting charges  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

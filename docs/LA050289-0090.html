			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS, PROTECTING HIS 'OPTIONS,' FILES FOR REELECTION AS CONTROLLER  </P> <P> Despite a persistent belief that the Democratic race for governor is wide open  and languishing for lack of pizazz, one of its most highly charged contenders  is pulling back. Gray Davis, after quietly exploring a gubernatorial candidacy  for some months, has now filed for reelection as state controller.  </P> <P> Davis insisted he is not pulling out of the 1990 governor's race for certain.  He said he acted only to protect his "options." But Davis' willingness to  plunge wholeheartedly into the governor's race has been questioned for months,  and this latest move is likely to fuel doubts whether the ambitious state  controller will be a factor as the campaign unfolds.  </P> <P> That would leave Democrats with former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and  state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp -- and with the uneasy feeling that things  are not going well for them in these early but important formulative campaign  days.  </P> <P> "The Democratic race for governor is dead in the water. It's a consensus among  a great many people but is just not being voiced. I think it's now time to  voice it. . . . And it's time to jump-start it," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica). "I don't want to sound negative, but I mean we have to work  on this."  </P> <P> The foreboding frequently voiced by Democrats is that Republican gubernatorial  candidate Pete Wilson, California's junior U.S. senator, has taken command of  the contest to replace two-term Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. Democrats  see Wilson suddenly framing the issues and claiming the high ground almost  without challenge. At the same time, Democrats worry that none of their  candidates has spelled out a platform for the 1990 elections, none has seized  and become identified with a popular issue and none has emerged with a  "winning" image.  </P> <P> "We Democrats are allowing Wilson to look like a governor. We should be up  there talking about change. We should be the party of change," said Democratic  campaign strategist Kam Kuwata, who has been advising Davis. "So far, all we  look like is the party of lost opportunities."  </P> <P> Davis has lagged in those occasional public opinion polls that have been  published about this campaign. But he brought to his exploratory campaign  superlative fund-raising skills, media savvy and the potential for derring-do.  </P> <P> But Davis, although active on the pro-choice front of the abortion issue and  elsewhere, has failed to crack what he calls "this name ID thing."  </P> <P> Even though he has formed his new reelection committee, Davis will not shut  down his gubernatorial campaign exploratory committee. He said Monday that he  had not formulated plans on how he would approach supporters from now on.  </P> <P> In contrast, Van de Kamp has had only one committee all along -- the one  raising money for his gubernatorial campaign. But there seem to be increasing  numbers of Democrats who are critical of the efforts so far by this  Establishment favorite. "There is the widespread feeling that John should be  doing better," said one party activist.  </P> <P> Several incidents are listed by the nay-sayers: Van de Kamp made a splashy  attempt to exert leadership in the campaign to slap controls on the sale and  possession of assault weapons. But as the debate developed, his role seemed  stretched and not particularly crucial to the outcome.  </P> <P> Then came his highly publicized admission of error in his handling of the  Hillside Strangler prosecution. In this sensational and long-running case eight  years ago, Van de Kamp, at the time Los Angeles County district attorney,  wanted to dismiss murder charges against defendant Angelo Buono Jr. and  prosecute him for sex crimes. A judge overruled him and state officials  ultimately obtained murder convictions.  </P> <P> For a candidate who is also anti-death penalty, this admission of error struck  some as showing vulnerability just where Van de Kamp was supposed to be  stronger than other Democrats, on the law-and-order issue.  </P> <P> Finally, Van de Kamp has failed thus far in his hope of clearing out the field  of Democratic challengers. In fact, some Democrats, even those with a basic  inclination to support Van de Kamp, wonder why the attorney general has been  unable thus far to capitalize on his standing among party brass and take the  lead in public opinion samplings. So far, through, Feinstein has held an edge  in the early samplings.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp backers argue that complainers fail to appreciate the value of the  ground work now being laid down for the real battles to come.  </P> <P> "Are we raising money? Yes. Are we on schedule? Yes. Have we put together a  team of well respected professionals? Yes. Are we taking our own (poll)  samplings? Yes. Are they encouraging? Yes," said campaign manager Richie Ross.  "The inside baseball players would only be happy if you have blown $2 million  now. And we're not going to do that."  </P> <P> There is, however, growing concern among Democrats that the would-be governors  are falling behind Wilson not only in the polls but also in spelling out the  visions that drive them -- the themes and hopes and dreams that might inspire  and sway voters.  </P> <P> In a couple of key speeches, Wilson has separated himself from Deukmejian in  support of new highway taxes, for an activist approach to health care and  environmental protection, among other things. Even critics give him credit for  this.  </P> <P> "Whether or not it's true, there is a perception of Wilson's strength that  carries with it a self-fulfilling prophesy. If he is thought of as strong, he  will be strong. And that is the way he is projecting now," said one leading  Democratic campaign strategist.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp Democrats say they are getting ready to fire back.  </P> <P> "In the next 60 to 90 days you will see -- we're going to be real clear that  we're setting the pace and taking command," said campaign manager Ross. "When  he begins to make his statements, he will be thoughtful, interesting and  offering something different from the normal kind of stuff the public has grown  tired of."  </P> <P> The Feinstein campaign is starting later, owing to the ex-mayor's early  ambivalence about the race. Campaign consultant Clinton Reilly said he is  unconcerned about the expressions of Democratic discontent.  </P> <P> "This is typical stuff. In the early stages, many people long for the ideal  that never materializes. First and foremost to win an election you've got to  run. Dianne has now shown the guts to run."  </P></p>

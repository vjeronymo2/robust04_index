			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UN warns over Bosnian deaths THE commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia yesterday warned of a race against time to prevent the deaths of up to 400,000 people this winter as Bosnian officials said there had been 15,284 deaths in the six-month war in the former Yugoslav republic. General Phillipe Morillon, the French commander, said repairs of water, electricity and roads were a priority of UN peacekeepers, who are due to be boosted by about 6,000 additional troops this month. He restated that the UN Protection Force was prepared to fire in self-defence and in protection of civilian technicians. Bosnian Serb leaders have pledged to respect the agreement to allow the UN force to help in repairs to water and power supplies and protect civilians doing this. The UN Security Council appears ready to approve a western resolution banning Serbian combat flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina today in a measure that could eventually lead to military enforcement. Britain and France demurred over an initial US proposal to permit the immediate use of allied fighter aircraft to enforce the ban, believing aerial dogfights could place UN peacekeepers at risk as they escorted humanitarian aid convoys. Speaking in Belgrade, Gen Morillon said he 'believed radar and AWACS would be sufficient control' rather than fighter aircraft. But a western diplomat in Belgrade said Serb forces had used combat planes on Wednesday in an attack on Gradacac, the northernmost Moslem stronghold in Bosnia. Under the resolution agreed among the three powers, the Security Council would undertake to 'consider urgently the further measures necessary to enforce this ban' only in the event that it was contravened by Serbian aircraft. There is provision for monitoring of the no-fly order by UN forces, 'including the placement of observers where necessary at airfields in the territory of former Yugoslavia.'</p>

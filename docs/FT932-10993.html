			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / A trolley full of troubles: Private-label products are threatening established brands Since Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco manufacturer, slashed the US price of Marlboro cigarettes last month in the face of falling sales, jitters have spread to many other branded consumer goods producers. If this could happen to a company as formidable as Philip Morris, observers have asked, is anybody safe? Pessimists have not lacked evidence for their case. The growing competition from retailers' cheap private-label products which humbled Marlboro has recently prompted other US brand leaders, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft and Quaker Oats, to cut prices or shelve planned increases. The private-label challenge has also gained further impetus from Wal-Mart, the largest US discount retailer. Wal-Mart, which has in the past sold few non-branded goods, recently launched its own 'Great Value' range of 350 food and drink products aimed at under-cutting popular brands. Optimists argue that private-label has long prospered in US recessions, as shoppers tightened their belts. Once the economy improved, consumers have invariably returned to buying favourite household names at premium prices. But will they do so as readily again? Though most industry experts dismiss suggestions that brands are doomed, several developments suggest that their manufacturers face a longer and tougher struggle than in the past. Some of the developments are peculiar to the US. But others appear linked to much broader trends which are reshaping consumer goods competition worldwide. Indeed, European experience may hold some lessons for the US. Private-label's share of total US grocery sales is hard to measure, partly because it varies between products. In breakfast cereals, it has only 5 per cent of the market, but in cheese slices it accounts for 26 per cent, according to Nielsen, the market research company. None the less, it appears to have made deeper inroads than in previous downturns. Kroger, the largest US grocery chain, says it is between 18 per cent and 20 per cent of group sales, compared with 16 per cent in the 1981 recession. Furthermore, it has continued to flourish even though US economic recovery got under way last autumn. Recent market research surveys suggest private-label is also increasingly popular with prosperous shoppers. This finding supports the popular view that consumers of all kinds are increasingly concerned with value - a trend which many experts expect to persist through the decade. 'Value has become the smart choice,' says Kroger. 'The only question is how far the private-label trend will go.' Yet some manufacturers, such as Philip Morris, have been slow to draw the consequences. Indeed, they have encouraged cut-price competition by regularly raising prices ahead of inflation in the belief that their brands were strong enough to keep consumers loyal. But that loyalty has often been strained by marketing tactics intended to boost short-term sales rather than strengthen brands. Since 1980, US food manufacturers' spending on promotional schemes, such as money-off offers and coupons, has risen from half to three-quarters of total marketing budgets, while advertising's share has fallen from 44 per cent to 25 per cent. In practice, as much as a third of promotional spending consists of inducements to supermarkets to stock goods. The proliferation of special offers which the money has also funded is widely blamed for weakening brands by producing frequent sharp price fluctuations and wide disparities between price levels across the country. Last year, P&amp;G sought to impose discipline by reducing promotional spending and cutting prices by as much as 25 per cent to a uniform national level. But the results have been mixed. This month, P&amp;G again cut sharply prices of disposable nappies, of which it is the leading producer, in an effort to beat back mounting private-label competition. Many other large branded US manufacturers are also counting on more aggressive pricing to regain market share. However, the tactic involves risks. In the short term it can depress margins, unless off-setting cost cuts can be found. An even bigger challenge is how to re-establish a premium market position for brands which have been forced to compete heavily on price. Some leading manufacturers, including H J Heinz and Campbell's Soup, are hedging their bets by also producing for private-label. Most say they refuse to do so in categories where they are market leaders, so as to limit competition with their own brands. However, some industry experts argue that, unless a manufacturer completely dominates a product category, it can be hard to straddle both businesses successfully for long. Challenges of this kind have long faced suppliers on the other side of the Atlantic, whose experience may offer pointers to future trends in the US. Private-label groceries are well established in Europe and have gained ground in recent years. In many northern countries they account for between a fifth and a third of the market. In reality, private-label covers a wide spectrum of goods and marketing practices. In Germany, it is still largely confined - as it has traditionally been in the US - to discount generic products such as toilet paper, often of inferior quality. But in Britain, chains such as Marks and Spencer, J Sainsbury and Tesco have developed sophisticated private-label ranges, which earn high margins and sometimes sell at a premium over branded lines. Many Continental retailers, particularly in France, are now trying to emulate their example. Private-label products are still dismissed by some brand leaders as cheap imitations. 'When they flourish, it usually means branded marketeers are dozing,' says Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. His solution is to 'keep moving the goalposts' through faster product innovation. However, UK supermarkets have been innovators in some fast-growing areas, such as chilled convenience meals. They also increasingly control the development, quality standards and marketing of the products they sell, turning many private-label suppliers into little more than contract processors. Above all, they have transformed their own names into powerful brands. Will the US follow the same pattern? Sceptics point out that supermarkets there wield less clout than in most of Europe, partly because regulatory restrictions have kept the industry fragmented and prevented national chains emerging. The industry has also to recover from the turbulence created in the 1980s by a wave of leveraged buy-outs which has saddled many groups with heavy debt. None the less, there is evidence that US private-label ranges are shedding their traditionally dowdy image. Safeway, for instance, recently reformulated its soft drinks line and says it is now faring much better against Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which lost share to private-label rivals last year. One recent survey found that many consumers ranked the quality of many private-label goods equal to branded lines. In part this trend may be due to the influence of European retailers such as Ahold of the Netherlands, Delhaize of Belgium and Sainsbury, which have acquired US supermarket groups in the past few years. Since Sainsbury bought Shaws, a New England chain, it has concentrated on up-market private-label products carrying the Shaws name. The supermarket sells about 1,200 such items and added 300 lines last year. However, the formula has yet to improve profitability. Last year, Shaws' margins of 2 per cent were only a quarter of its UK parent's. Whether or not the private-label challenge continues to grow, many branded US manufacturers expect leaner times on their home market. A recent survey of more than 100 big American consumer goods companies by McKinsey, the management consultancy, found they expected sales abroad to grow twice as fast as in the US in the first half of this decade. Four-fifths of companies also said their overall success in the next five years depended heavily on international growth - up from half in the past five years. The clear message is that, whatever the fate of brands in the US, producers elsewhere can expect tougher competition.</p>

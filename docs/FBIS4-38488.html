			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russian newspapers comment on  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan.    TRUD writes that "the visit can be viewed as a practical  step  to flesh out the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on the  delimitation of the spheres of competence and mutual delegation  of powers". The newspaper emphasises the president's words that  "this is the first such treaty. So, the Russian president shows  special interest in how it is being carried into life."    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI notes that "Yeltsin began his  familiarisation with the reform process in Tatarstan with a  visit to the kamaz in order to decide on how the automotive  workers can be helped". One of major sections of the kamaz -- a  motor engine manufacturing plant -- is known to have been gutted  out by fire on April 14, last year. "Measures to help overcome  this problem are expected to be the basis of one of future  economic agreements," the newspaper reports.    PRAVDA points out that "the Russia-Tatarstan treaty,  undoubtedly, has opened the door for the establishment of  constructive relations of trust between the central authority  and regions". The newspaper quotes the Russian president as  saying that "the treaty between Moscow and Kazan has become a  precedent on the basis of which relations between Russia and  Chechnya as well as between the Crimea and Ukraine could be  settled".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA evaluates the results of the the  president's two-day visit as follows: "Yeltsin is satisfied  with his stay in Tatarstan. It remains to implement the  bilateral treaty between Moscow and Kazan".    SEGODNYA (TODAY) newspaper carries an article headlined  "Zhirinovskiy Repays Debts to the GMM" about a relationship  between the Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and the GMM trust company. The newspaper  reproduces Zhirinovskiy's letter, addressed to Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin. In the letter, Zhirinovskiy requests  assistance in settling "relations between the GMM and financial  agencies as well as a resumption of televised advertising on  state-run broadcasting channels".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs an article in which writer Eduard  Limonov criticises LDPR leader Zhirinovskiy.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that the MMM joint-stock  company  has again incurred financial losses. This time owing to an  attack of the company's money collectors who were robbed of  money amounting to 1,500 million roubles. "None of three  robberies has been exposed so far. But then the MMM remains one  of few firms which avoid businesslike contacts with the 38  Petrovka criminal investigation department."    PRAVDA runs an article by retired Colonel Robert Bykov about  Pavel Grachev in his capacity as Russia's defence minister. The  writer of the article critically evaluates the minister's  activities, pointing out his inconsistency.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that an expedition to the  area of the sunken nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets is  planned in the coming months. The submarine with two torpedoes  is known to have met with an accident in Norwegian Sea. The  newspaper points out that the environment can be contaminated as  a result of the corrosion of the torpedoes, each of which  contains 3,200 grammes of plutonium. "According to the most  pessimistic expert forecasts, this may happen at the end of 1995  or early in 1996".</p>

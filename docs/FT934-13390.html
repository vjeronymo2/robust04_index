			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Whistle while you work, brothers, but not at women WOMEN have not had a good week in the corridors of power but there may be some consolation from the TGWU, Britain's biggest trade union. The union has asked its 300,000 male workers in the construction industry to show women a bit more respect. Mr George Henderson, national secretary of its construction section, has urged building workers to cut out the wolf whistles, lewd comments and gestures widely associated with 'that small minority of workers on sites who have never behaved like proper men'. Mr Henderson said yesterday: 'For some people, the whole thing may seem to be just a joke. But it is no joke for women who have to endure unacceptable behaviour from men who delude themselves that they are paying a compliment to the victims of their unwanted attention.' He said he was not advocating prudishness. 'But, I would suggest that the men responsible should consider treating women with more respect.' He urged employers' organisations, his own regional secretaries and other trade unions with members in the construction industry to set a good example.</p>

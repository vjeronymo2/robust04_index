			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Road management project in Belarus RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON is working on a project aimed at rehabilitating and introducing effective management of the strategic M1/E30 road link between Warsaw and Moscow. The road is a major corridor in the state of Belarus linking 11 towns with a population catchment of nearly three million people. The M1/E30, although designed to generous standards, is poorly maintained and managed. Rendel, in association with the French company, BCEOM, has been appointed by the Belarus Government and the European Community. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is acting as executing agency. The objective of the four-month project is to establish an effective management and development organisation for the road. Within this framework rehabilitation is to be undertaken and maintenance equipment procured.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Saudi budget may have to reflect some harsh realities: There are hints of structural reform to deal with Riyadh's acute two-year-old cash flow problems Saudi Arabia's economic policymakers are busy preparing the annual January 1 budget statement, the kingdom's main public declaration of economic policy. It is traditionally rather a spare document - usually little more than a statement of intended government spending. But this year's budget, if hints by senior Saudis prove correct, may contain somewhat more. They suggest it may include serious steps towards structural budgetary reforms to address the government's acute cash flow problems of the past two years. 'One should expect major decisions,' said one official, without elaborating. 'You will be surprised, we are realistic. We will face the situation, and it's going to be across the board.' The 'situation' is the worst slump Saudi Arabia has faced since the oil price collapse of the mid-1980s and an unprecedented tightness in public coffers - the product of the Dollars 55bn bill for the Gulf war Desert Storm, subsequent costly military purchases, unhelpfully soft oil prices and the cumulative effects of a decade of high spending. Saudi Arabia's 1993 budget deficit of around Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.3bn) was its 11th in a row, and 10 per cent of GDP. Such pressures, augmented by warnings from the International Monetary Fund, embarrassing reports in some western media about 'bankrupt' Saudi Arabia and consequent speculative assaults on the riyal, led the government in last year's budget to announce a 19 per cent cut in state spending in 1994 to Dollars 46bn. Some economists believe this may still leave a Dollars 6bn gap, given best estimates of this year's oil earnings. But they also believe the 19 per cent cuts may be met. Government departments all report slashed travel, frozen hiring, cut perks, abolished overtime and, most important, either cancelled projects or frozen payments for those to which they were committed. The result, however, has been to extinguish economic growth. Bankers and economists believe the economy has shrunk this year by 2-5 per cent, the first GDP fall in nominal terms since the mid-1980s. Government non-payment of bills to private sector contractors is the chief reason, and one which is stretching to the limit both private companies and, in turn, the banks on which both government and private sectors rely for financing. So far there have been few company failures, but this is largely because banks have extended bridging credit to their main clients. Most of the kingdom's 12 commercial banks are now increasing provisions and hoping for a revival of government payments. But between the increasing demands of private clients and the government's equal reliance on bank financing, bankers say the system is now at capacity. Money supply and bank deposits are both down in recent months. And though Saudi British Bank this year pioneered a Dollars 280m floating rate note to help ease the government's pinch, and is believed to be considering a second, bankers say they have reached the crunch. 'The banks can't deal with any more,' says a Riyadh banker. 'More than half the banks are over the official lending limit and the rest are right up against Sama's (the central bank's) prescribed loans to deposits ratio.' The government has made almost all its borrowings through the sale of treasury bills and development bonds to the commercial banks. Saudi Arabia's foreign debt amounts essentially to a post-Gulf war syndicated Dollars 4.5bn jumbo loan, which bankers say is being repaid. But domestic borrowing has accumulated at a pace which alarms the IMF and others. 'In six years it has gone from zero to Dollars 84bn, which is 70 per cent of GDP,' says a western economist. 'That's quite a rise.' All of which points to the need for the 'major decisions' hinted at for the January budget. And with sources of borrowing drier than ever, the government has apparently little option but to broaden its revenue base. One option, which King Fahd has mentioned twice in recent speeches, is privatisation of some of the state's assets. But while Saudi officials have canvassed preliminary information about managing state sell-offs from, among others, the British government, most observers believe privatisation to be some way off. A sale of some of the government's 70 per cent holding in Sabic, the industrial holding company, is not ruled out. But Saudia, the heavily subsidised state airline, for instance, would require considerable and costly restructuring to make it attractive to buyers. Another much discussed option would be to raise electricity, petrol, water or telephone charges, which are indulgently subsidised. Petrol, for example, is 5 cents a gallon. But this would be a brave step on to hugely sensitive political terrain. such a move would almost certainly excite opposition - not least from hardline Islamists who argue that the country's wealth should be enjoyed as a right by all. They are also highly critical of what they see as royal profligacy, and would make political mileage out of attempts to tax Saudis while senior princes continue to build palaces. And they are not alone. Hard-pressed Saudi businessmen have also become unusually critical of royal spending, and royal economic management. 'There's not been a year like it in terms of the openness of the grumbling,' says a seasoned foreign Riyadh banker. September's unrest in Burayda, when more than 100 demonstrators were arrested after the detention of a cleric who was critical of the royal family, will have given the government pause. Not least because the agricultural area around Burayda, while historically a sternly Islamic heartland, was also among the most affected by the government's main structural budgetary change to date - a swingeing cut in previously generous subsidies to wheat farmers. How King Fahd weighs such factors in making the budget decision - for the ultimate decision will be his - is unknowable outside his close court. So is the true state of the kingdom's finances. Some observers believe oil earnings this year, for example, have been better than budgeted for last January. They point to IMF figures showing that reserves, minus gold, rose from an April low of Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 8.4bn in July. King Fahd may therefore believe the government can muddle through another year, crossing fingers for an improvement in the oil price, without having to take awkward political decisions at all. As one diplomat puts it: 'There's almost a tradition here of putting off difficult decisions until there seems to be absolutely no other choice.' Only on January 1, therefore, will anyone outside the royal court know quite how seriously the Saudi government believes its present economic difficulties really are.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / CBI points to Welsh jobs threat JOBS and investment will be threatened if the government cuts its grants to the regions, the Wales CBI said yesterday. The employers' body argued against any reduction in financial aid to assisted areas, currently under review as part of the government's tightening controls on public spending. It said it was only new investment that had prevented the principality from falling further behind the rest of the UK. 'Any diminution of assisted-area status would threaten this flow of new capital and jobs and thereby exacerbate already serious economic imbalances between regions,' it argued in a paper submitted to the Welsh Office.</p>

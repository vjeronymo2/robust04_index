			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, National Action Party President Carlos  Castillo Peraza said the Tijuana police security director, who  was gunned down last night, had information on the assassination  of Institutional Revolutionary Party presidential candidate Luis  Donaldo Colosio. Castillo said his party repudiates and demands  an investigation of the assassination of party member Jose  Federico Benitez Lopez, municipal public security director in  Tijuana, and Benitez' bodyguard Ramon Alariz.    [Begin Castillo recording] First, we repudiate the crime.  Second, we demand a thorough investigation. Third, we appeal to  the citizens of Baja California, who apparently have been  selected as the target for intimidation, to behave civilly,  politically, lawfully, and peacefully. [end recording]    Speaking to this station, Castillo said Benitez had given  information to the Special Deputy Prosecutor's Office in charge  of investigating Colosio's murder and that on 29 April he  planned to talk to deputies and senators who are members of the  commission created to investigate the crime.    [Begin Castillo recording] It is surprising, worrisome, and  alarming that Benitez was assassinated the day before that  meeting would have been held. [end recording]    Castillo added that the violence in Mexico provoked by some  groups is an attempt to create a climate of insecurity and fear  in the country.    [Begin Castillo recording] Cardinal Posada's assassination,  the outbreak of violence in Chiapas, the kidnappings with which  we are all familiar, Colosio's assassination, and now this  murder all look like an attempt to create a climate of fear and  terror in Mexico, which runs contrary to all civilized  coexistence and the interests of those of us who are fighting  for democracy from many angles. [end recording]    Castillo said the people should do everything possible to  defeat crime, terror, unlawfulness, and violence.</p>

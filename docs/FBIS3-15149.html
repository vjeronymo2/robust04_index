In his words, "hysteria stirred by the  opposition Russia's Choice" is the major hindrance on the way to  unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary systems and  further integration of these two Slavic states.    Zametalin is convinced that by preventing creation of a  monetary union, "the Gaydar-Fedorov bloc is fulfilling the order  of their behind-the-ocean patrons who are concerned over  Russia's entering the geopolitical arena."    Meanwhile, according to Zametalin, Moscow "sees the way out  of the crisis at the expense of strengthening of integration  ties with young Slavic states as well."    He expressed opinion that "strengthening of Russia's  positions on international arena and possible unification of  Belarus and Russia will put an end to the West's monopoly in  determining priorities in mutual relations between world  community states which has established over the last period of  time."    Responding to the question whether the delay in signing of  the Belarusian-Russian documents on creation of a monetary union  affects the situation in Belarus economy, Zametalin pointed out  that over the last few months the situation in the republic "is  characterized by substantial lowering of businesslike activity."  In his words, entrepreneurs do not risk to take "serious  credits due to uncertainty, to be or not to be for the union  and, if yes, then what will be the exchange rate of the  Belarusian ruble to the Russian one."    "There is artificial manipulation in the increase of the  Russian ruble to a hair" (a common name for the Belarusian ruble  -- INTERFAX) underlined Zametalin. To reaffirm his words, he  mentioned the fact of the exchange rate growth of 1.5 over the  last months. "There is more policy than sound financial and  economic sense in the increasing discrepancy of two monetary  systems," believes Zametalin. At the same time he "does not rule  out the possibility that such a situation in the financial  sphere is being created by special adversaries of monetary  systems' unification in order to get rich at the expense of  variance in exchange rates."</p>

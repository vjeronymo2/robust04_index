			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  described as diplomatic impropriety the move by [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM, President Kiro] Gligorov  to make his letter to the Greek prime minister public before it  was actually delivered to Papandreou. The government spokesman  reiterated that the Greek Government received the letter with  some reservations, since it bore the name Macedonia. It merely  received the letter so that it might learn the content and study  it.    Venizelos said the European Union's [EU] Dutch Commissioner  Hans van den Broek established Skopje's intransigence, so he  might have realized, even belatedly, why Greece adopted these  measures. Asked if Van den Broek asked the Greek Government to  lift the measures, Venizelos said he had not, because Greece  insists on its positions. Only when there is practical proof of  Skopje's goodwill could our country lift the measures and  reconsider its stance on Skopje's accession to the CSCE. Only  then, the government spokesman stressed, will we resume the  dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and Cyrus  Vance. The subject of the dialogue will be Greece-Skopje's  economic cooperation and the name, on which Greece's position is  well known.    Venizelos said he hoped the Dutch commissioner's initiative  would continue.</p>

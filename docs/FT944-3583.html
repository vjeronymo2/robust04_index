			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Lee sues newspaper over article Mr Lee Kuan Kew, Singapore's elder statesman, has filed a civil suit for damages against Mr Christopher Lingle, a US academic, and executives of the International Herald Tribune newspaper over an article Mr Lingle wrote, a Tribune official said yesterday. On Saturday the Tribune published an apology to Mr Lee and to the Singapore judiciary over remarks in the October 7 article by Mr Lingle, who was then a professor at the National University of Singapore. The suit is in addition to a contempt of court action by the Singapore government over Mr Lingle's opinion piece. The contempt case is scheduled for a Singapore high court hearing on January 9. A court date has not been set for Mr Lee's civil suit, the Tribune said. Mr Bruce Singer, the paper's spokesman, said Mr Lee claimed he had been libelled. Mr Lee, now senior minister, was prime minister from 1959 to 1990. He has brought the suit against Mr Lingle as well as Mr Michael Richardson, the paper's Asia editor, and Mr John Vinocur, the executive editor and vice president, Mr Singer said. In its December 10-11 edition, the paper apologised over remarks in the article that, among other comments critical of Asian governments, referred to unnamed 'intolerant regimes' and attacked their judiciaries.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: National Savings quick to launch new issues National Savings has launched new issues of its fixed-rate products a week after the government put up base rates by half a percentage point, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Variable-rate products are unaffected. Savings certificates: The new 42nd issue pays a tax-free 5.85 per cent a year compound when held for five years. The return is equivalent to an attractive 9.75 per cent gross for a 40 per cent taxpayer (7.8 per cent gross for a lower-rate taxpayer). Index-linked certificates: The 8th issue pays the same as the one it has just replaced - a return of 3 per cent a year compound in addition to inflation when held for five years. The new issue has been released because purchases above the minimum no longer have to be made in multiples of Pounds 25 - they can now be in any amount. The same applies to the savings certificates. How attractive you find index-linked certificates depends on your view of inflation over the next five years. Yearly plan: The tax-free five-year return is increased to 5.85 per cent a year compound. The plan is designed to help those who want to buy a savings certificate through regular instalments. Monthly payments of between Pounds 20 and Pounds 400 are made by standing order for 12 months to buy a four-year Yearly Plan certificate. Capital bond: This taxable fixed-rate product is aimed at non-taxpayers, since the return is paid gross. The new series I pays 7.75 per cent a year compound if held for five years. But given that the returns are taxable and the money is tied up for five years, many people may find even the new rate relatively unattractive. Pensioners guaranteed income bond: The new issue pays 7.5 per cent a year gross, fixed for five years and paid monthly on a minimum of Pounds 500 to those aged 65 and over. Interest is taxable but is paid gross. There are few products paying monthly income on such a small deposit but look first at fixed-rate building society rivals. Children's bonus bond: Issue G now pays 7.85 per cent a year when held for five years on Pounds 25 up to a maximum of Pounds 1,000. The bond is a useful way for parents to give to their children as it is tax-free. First Option bond: Aimed at taxpayers, returns on this bond, which are fixed for one year, are paid net of basic-rate tax. The new issue pays 6.4 per cent gross, equivalent to 4.8 per cent net, on Pounds 1,000-Pounds 19,999. The rate goes up to 6.8 per cent gross (5.1 per cent net) on Pounds 20,000 up to a maximum of Pounds 250,000. The rates are competitive but not overly so. Look first at building society fixed-rate products.</p>

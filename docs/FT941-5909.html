			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Clarke pledges domestic focus on interest rate moves Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, assured the Commons yesterday that he would continue to have 'British conditions' in mind when determining interest rate policy. He was replying to Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a former Treasury minister, who urged him to send a clear message to 'voices in the City' calling for an increase in interest rates. Mr Clarke said he would continue to set interest rates according to British conditions, taking account of medium-term prospects for factors such as inflation, exchange rates and asset values. He told the House that these had guided his decisions on monetary policy so far, and they would continue to do so. The chancellor's emphasis on British conditions was welcomed by Mr Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry north-west, who, like Mr Sheldon, is an advocate of further cuts in interest rates. Mr Robinson underlined the need to consider the interrelationship between UK interest rates and the value of sterling, and the implications for industry. He hoped the government would combine downward pressure on inflation and interest rates while maintaining a competitive exchange rate.</p>

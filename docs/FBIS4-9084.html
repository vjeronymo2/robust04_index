			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kuzma Kuzmanov, director of the Kozloduy </F> Nuclear Power Plant, by Veselka Damyanova; place and date not  given: "Our Country Has the Potential to Protect Its First  Nuclear Power Plant, Kozloduy Director Kuzmanov Thinks"]    [Text] [Damyanova] Why did you say the Kozloduy Nuclear  Power Plant will close soon?    [Kuzmanov] It will be inevitable if we are not given the  money we need to maintain the plant. I am not speaking about  investment, simply about funds for maintenance. I do not even  mean the funds needed to implement the plant's safety program.  If we are not given the resources we need, we will have to  close down Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.    [Damyanova] What is the basic source of funds for Kozloduy?    [Kuzmanov] The basic source is the National Electricity  Company, from which we receive revenue (for consumed energy).  Special measures must be adopted because it is the power supply  issue that is involved here and we must receive the funds we  need. In addition to money for maintenance, we also need money  to develop the plant -- this involves investments. These must  be pegged to inflation in order to ensure a proportional  increase. I could understand a difference of 6, 8, or 10  percent, but when investment is not coordinated with the  inflation coefficient then the situation becomes dangerous.    [Damyanova] You also receive help from the West....    [Kuzmanov] In fact, we receive a fixed amount of aid on the  basis of an agreement between the government and the European  Development fund. This is gratuitous aid for increasing safety  and the conditions of exploitation, which in 1993 amounted to 12  million francs [currency not further specified]. It has been  increased to 20 million francs for the next three years.  Obviously, this aid is significant, but not decisive. The  money we receive from the National Electricity Company is  decisive.    [Damyanova] Who else could help?    [Kuzmanov] I think that our country has sufficient potential  and could protect its nuclear power plant, but there is no one  to decide the issue.... We cannot allow the power plant to  continue to be exploited under the existing conditions.    [Damyanova] Does the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant continue  to be an evil myth for some people, as you once told KONTINENT?    [Kuzmanov] I said this in the past because certain circles  are trying to present the nuclear power plant precisely in this  light. I meant that several years ago the Western politicians  turned Kozloduy into an evil myth. However, we showed the world  that we can implement measures and improve conditions. We  showed that the reactors about which it was said that they  cannot function, could function after we obtained the  appropriate permission from the relevant organs.    [Damyanova] Your colleague Delcasso said that if the problem  Kozloduy faces at present happened in France, the relevant  minister would immediately resign....    [Kuzmanov] He even said that he could be imprisoned for  something like this....    [Damyanova] Do you have many problems?    [Kuzmanov] Yes, there are a lot of problems in Kozloduy, and  let us not even mention the problems Bulgaria faces as a whole.  However, there is an unwritten rule: always to follow closely  the situation in every branch. Otherwise, you know very well  what could happen if we had to close down Kozloduy.    [Damyanova] Who is interested in closing the plant?    [Kuzmanov] I do not want to comment on this issue. The most  important thing for us is to receive what we are entitled to.</p>

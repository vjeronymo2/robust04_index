			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: PolyGram pays Dollars 25m for Philips' CD plant POLYGRAM is buying a CD manufacturing plant in the US for Dollars 25m from Philips, the Dutch electronics group, which owns 80 per cent of the record and entertainment group. The acquisition follows earlier agreements between the two for PolyGram to acquire a CD factory in Germany and one in France for a total of around Dollars 100m from Philips. The US factory has a capacity of 60m discs per year and produced 50m CDs last year. It employs 530 full-time staff, and 60 per cent of production from the factory went to PolyGram itself, with the remainder going to third parties. The group's sales of CDs has been growing and they have increased as a proportion of the overall product mix in unit terms, from 48 per cent in 1990 to 58 per cent last year. The three recent acquisitions of CD manufacturing facilities from Philips was based on what PolyGram sees as a need to have a guaranteed, fast and economical supply of CDs for its largest markets. The group plans to make CD-I discs for interactive TV games and other programmes stored in compact discs. PolyGram also announced plans recently to manufacture digital compact cassettes, the new audio cassette tape format to be introduced by Philips, at its Amersfoot plant in the Netherlands.</p>

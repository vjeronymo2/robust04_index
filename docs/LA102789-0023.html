			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS FORFEITS TO HAWTHORNE  </P> <P> Beverly Hills High forfeited today's scheduled Bay League football game with  Hawthorne because of the Beverly Hills Unified School District teachers strike,  Principal Ben Bushman announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Bushman said the Normans will not play the game because co-coaches Bill  Stansbury and Dick Billingsley are on strike. Beverly Hills also forfeited last  week's game with Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "We will not play unless we have our regular coaches," Bushman said.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills' players had practiced this week with substitute coaches.  </P> <P> The loss all but eliminates the Normans from playoff contention. They fell to  3-5 overall and 2-3 in the Bay League.  </P> <P> Bushman said Beverly Hills will continue to conduct practices in hopes of  playing Palos Verdes next Friday if the strike is settled.  </P> <P> Hawthorne, which moved to No. 1 this week in the Southern Section Division II  rankings, improved to 8-0 overall and leads the league with a 5-0 mark. The  Cougars resume play next Friday against Leuzinger. ROB FERNAS  </P></p>

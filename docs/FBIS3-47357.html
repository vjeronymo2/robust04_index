Toshiba officials said its plant in Yokkaichi will have a  capability of manufacturing two million chips of that type of  DRAM every month by the end of the year.    They said the plant will need an investment of 20 billion  yen  and require 450 more employees, who will be transferred from  nearby factories or newly employed, increasing the staff to  about 1,000.    The 16-megabit DRAMs, used in advanced personal computers,  are in strong demand from computer-related equipment makers,  particularly in the United States.</p>

This assembly was presided over by Pedro Ross Leal, a member of  the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and secretary  general of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]. The parliaments  in the workplace had the desired effect and much more: From  these parliaments emerged solutions that, despite a great many  earlier meetings and assemblies, had never been forthcoming.    [Begin Ross recording] That is a bonus that we must get out  of this. That experience, even if it is negative, must serve the  purpose of making us rectify our way of zeroing in on problems,  of confronting problems, of looking into things with the workers.    The point is not just to drop by the work center. The point  is to reach the workers. And the point of reaching the workers  is not to say hello to the workers but rather to set up a  framework and create an atmosphere conducive to the workers'  talking, and for us to communicate with them. [end recording]    At the Holguin plenum, the nation's first, the final report  on the process was presented -- a process during which certain  subjects were much discussed and during which different opinions  were expressed regarding, among other things, taxes [words  indistinct] and the prices of products in the basic family  shopping basket.    A consensus was reached on matters such as the urgency of  producing efficiently, reviewing the policy of enterprises'  prices, eliminating undue gratuities, recovering work  discipline, and, especially, increasing the stringency,  monitoring, and management on the part of administrations and  the state -- as well as what was said regarding illegal  businesses and private production.    In this connection, Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary  of the PCC in Holguin, reflected:    [Begin Garcia recording] As party and revolutionary leaders,  this gives us satisfaction, because we realize that the working  class is fully aware of the fact that Cuba's solution does not  lie in every man for himself, nor individual solutions, nor  private solutions. And that is important. That is an ideological  phenomenon the importance of which we must examine. Therefore,  we cannot help but feel tranquil; feel that our working class is  not confused, that it is very clear on things. The working class  is aware that by struggling to produce more -- but doing so  efficiently -- we will move forward. [end recording]    This has been Jorge Quevedo, reporting from Holguin  Province.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by F. Ilyukhin: "37,000 Casualties! It Is Terrible"] </F>   [Text] In commenting on the accidents statistics for the  first 6 months of last year (ZA RULEM No 11, 1993), we predicted  that the annual total would differ little from 1992, a year with  a high accident rate. Unfortunately, this prediction was  generally correct.    Despite the fact that the number of DTP [traffic accidents]  in 1993 dropped by 3.7 percent compared with 1992 and there were  3.9 percent fewer persons injured in accidents, the principal  and most alarming indicator--the number of casualties--rose by  1.5 percent.    More than 37,000 persons were killed on Russian roads, 100  people per day. You remember how the country was shaken last  December by the aircraft disaster over Irkutsk, where about 120  passengers and crew members were killed. But there are almost as  many here every day, and there is no public reaction. This is  the kind of dangerous magic involved in large figures.    The steady increase in severity of the consequences of  accidents (with a decrease in the number of accidents) attests  to the fact that they are becoming bloodier. The reason for this  often is unregulated high speed, poor roads, and the  disgustingly poor condition of the vehicles.    All the same, in grieving about casualties on the roads last  year, let us not pass over the positive trends which provide at  least a little hope. The number of accidents and the number of  persons killed and injured by drunk drivers have declined (by  5.5, 3.7, and 3.5 percent, respectively). The accident rate  involving the transport facilities of enterprises and  organizations has decreased. The number of accidents here  declined by 14 percent, and the number of persons killed and  injured decreased by 13 and 14.9 percent. Though we should not  boast too much about this--the fleet of motor vehicles which  belong to so-called juridical entities has been reduced, as we  know. And one more positive result--fewer children have been hit  by vehicles than in 1992.    In one of the commentaries on accident rate statistics  published in the journal, they were compared with a pendulum,  because there is no assurance that individual indicators which  declined last year will not increase in the following year.  There is no such assurance now, either, since there is no  unified highway traffic safety system in Russia--it has not been  created yet. There is no law on road traffic, although it has  been drafted, but it was not moved for almost a year in the  former VS [Supreme Soviet]. Perhaps the new parliament will find  the time for it, and devote its attention to one of the most  important social problems of our time.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is further proposing to expand the 1990 baseline volume to allow for imports during 1994, but this expanded baseline volume would apply only for gasoline imported during 1994&hyph;1995. The mechanism proposed for this volume expansion is to multiply the foreign refinery's 1990 baseline volume times 1.17, which would result in an additional volume equal to two months of the 1990 baseline volume. EPA believes this approach for expanding the 1990 baseline volume to cover imports during 1994 is appropriate, because it would allow imports subject to an individual baseline to begin in November 1994 and to continue at the same rate as would be allowed for 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on this proposal for combining gasoline imports in 1994 and 1995 for purposes of applying the proposed volume constraint on use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, and on the proposed mechanism for calculating an expanded 1990 individual foreign refinery baseline volume for use during 1994 and 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Requirement To Allow EPA Inspections and Audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that, as a condition of use by an importer of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, EPA inspectors and auditors would have to be given full access to conduct inspections and audits related to the foreign refinery's baseline and to the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery. The proposed access for inspections and audits would be at the foreign refinery, at any place gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for the U.S. market is located, and at any location where documents are kept that relate to the foreign refinery's baseline or to gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for the U.S. market. EPA is proposing that the access would have to be granted in response to inspections or audits that either are announced or unannounced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing the inspection and audit access requirement in order to allow EPA inspectors and auditors to confirm the baseline submissions that would relate to any foreign refinery. In addition, EPA inspections and audits would confirm the information related to refinery-of-origin that is reported to EPA. The proposed access requirements related to foreign refineries would provide EPA with access analogous to that exercised over domestic refiners to conduct inspections and audits. EPA historically has conducted inspections and audits of domestic refineries in order to ensure compliance with gasoline quality rules, including the lead phasedown requirements at &sect;80.20, and the gasoline volatility requirements at &sect;&sect;80.27&hyph;28. EPA intends to follow this enforcement approach with the reformulated gasoline program. EPA believes it is important that it have comparable access to foreign refinery operations under the proposed approach for foreign refinery baseline in order to meet its enforcement responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of the proposed access requirement is intended to allow EPA to inspect or audit wherever documents are located that would relate to an individual foreign refinery's baseline, or to the production or shipping of gasoline that would be subject to such a baseline. In addition, the access proposal would ensure EPA access to collect samples of any gasoline that would be subject to an individual foreign refinery baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that the access requirement would terminate on January 1, 2003. This proposed termination date is five years following January 1, 1998, the last date individual foreign refinery baselines could be used. Five years is the statutory limitation that applies to potential liability for violations of the reformulated gasoline requirements. EPA also is proposing that its inspection and audit access would be limited to gasoline produced before 1998 and to documents that relate to such gasoline. This proposed limitation on the access requirement also corresponds to the January 1, 1998 date individual foreign refinery baselines would become unavailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

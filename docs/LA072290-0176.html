			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHEN AIRPORT FACES OVERRUNS, TAXPAYER PICKS UP TAB  </P> <P> I have been reading recently about the cost overruns, funding losses and  lawsuits pending over the expansion of John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> This seems to be a result of a new form of government, a government in which  cost is not an issue.  </P> <P> A decision is made to do something, build an airport or a freeway, and the  taxpayer is expected to approve such a development on preliminary and, in  hindsight, woefully inadequate data.  </P> <P> The taxpayer, the apparently limitless source of funds, is then expected to  assume payment for the overrides, on the principle of having started the  project the public entity in charge can't stop -- that would waste the  taxpayer's money! It also would leave unfinished a monument to a public  "leader."  </P> <P> This attitude on the part of elected officials is so prevalent that I feel it  is standard operating procedure. First they find a project to satisfy their  megalomania, and, by quoting a cheap cost, they gain taxpayer approval. Then to  get it finished and satisfy their ego, they sock us for the cost overruns.  Meanwhile, we have been disenfranchised and are sheared like sheep.  </P> <P> In the specific case of the John Wayne Airport, we were certainly deceived as  to cost and as to what it would look like finished. When are we going to stop  egocentric politicians from wasting our tax dollars this way? I may be naive,  but I assume the politician is supposed to watch out for the taxpayer's  interests.  </P> <P> Voters, it is time that we stop letting our officials waste our tax dollars.  Let's hold them accountable.  </P> <P> For every bond issue, independent feasibility studies and cost estimates should  be done and the data provided to the voters. When voters approve a project, it  should be clear that the approved bond issue is the limit of the taxpayer's  responsibility. If the politicians need to return to us for more money, they  automatically should be required to resign.  </P> <P> To promote a specific project, like the airport as originally proposed, and  then raise the cost and cut back on the project smacks of malfeasance.  </P> <P> ROBERT M.

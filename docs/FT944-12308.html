			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / People: Sir Brian Shaw - Knight of the Road Sir Brian (above), chairman of the Port of London Authority, is to be the next chairman of The Automobile Association, which represents one in three of all UK motorists and solved 4.5m breakdowns last year. Sir Brian, 61, will take over as chairman at the end of next year when the current incumbent, Sir Ralph Carr-Ellison, turns 70. Sir Ralph, a landowner in the north east who has been chairman since 1986, has presided over a period of rapid change. The AA's membership has increased from 6m to 8m and the voluntary organisation has invested heavily in information technology to handle over 6.5m calls a year from motorists. Sir Brian, a former chairman of the Furness Withy shipping group, will inherit a major private business. Last year the AA reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 39.7m on income of Pounds 576m and net assets of Pounds 178m. Although half the AA's income still comes from subscriptions, 28 per cent comes from insurance and financial services and provides the bulk of the organisation's profits. Other AA ventures include Britain's second biggest driving school and the introduction of an emergency service for homeowners (AA Homeline).</p>

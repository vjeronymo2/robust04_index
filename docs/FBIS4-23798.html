			<p>BFN     [Text] Yusuf Jama Burale, the Somaliland minister of  resettlement and reconstruction, has briefed a Radio Hargeysa  reporter on his ministry's work. The minister reported in  general on the tasks and plans of the ministry, most of which  have not been realized due to relations with the international  community, which need to be set straight. The government is  arguing that the international community should contact the  government directly about activities in Somaliland. The  minister went on to say that the plans include action on  reconstruction and resettlement affairs in the country and ways  of repatriating refugees. He said these things would be  stressed.    On refugees from Somaliland in neighboring countries, Mr.  Burale said that discussions have been held in the last eight  months with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and  host countries on the most appropriate way of repatriating them.  The minister said the government has told the UNHCR how the  refugees should be repatriated and has explained the plan for  preparations for resettling them before their arrival in the  country. The government has requested that the basic  necessities should be made available for resettling the refugees.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ares-Serono sells its diagnostics division Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based leader in human fertility drugs, is selling its diagnostics division to BioChem Pharma of Montreal for Dollars 44m in cash and Dollars 21m in notes. The group is developing biotechnology-based drugs for treating infertility and multiple sclerosis. It plans to invest SFr300m (Dollars 208m) in expanding production facilities in Switzerland. The deal is the latest in a series of transactions this week that illustrates a fresh drive by pharmaceutical companies to focus resources on their most competitive businesses. Earlier this week Roche, the Swiss group, took over Syntex of the US for Dollars 5.3bn. The Anglo-US drugs group SmithKline Beecham announced it would buy Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US drug distribution group, for Dollars 2.3bn, while Eastman Kodak put its three healthcare divisions up for sale. Ares-Serono's diagnostics division was established in the 1970s and was boosted substantially with the purchase of Baker Instruments of the US in 1988. It had sales of Dollars 89.3m last year, 12 per cent of the group total.</p>

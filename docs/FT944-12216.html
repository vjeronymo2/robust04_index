			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Visa Int'l joins China 'Golden Card' venture Visa International yesterday signed a consultancy agreement with Jitong Communications to help extend China's 'Golden Card' national payments and credit-clearing system, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Mr Lindsay Pyne, president of Visa International Asia Pacific, said that the two sides would collaborate in speeding the establishment of a national payments infrastructure. Visa would use its relationship with seven of China's specialised banks to assist Jitong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ministry of electronics industry, to promote its Golden Card. Officials said Visa would not take an equity stake in the project at this stage, but it would 'assist in introducing advanced technology and software for identifying counterfeit activities and for solving problems in linking regional and international networks'. Jitong launched its Golden Card pilot project last year. Other participants include IBM and the China Great Wall Computer Group.</p>

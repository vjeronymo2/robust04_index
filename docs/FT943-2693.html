			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Better viewing at MAI - The Week Ahead MONDAY: MAI, the money broker and television group, is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of between Pounds 88m and Pounds 109m for the year to June, against Pounds 80.2m last time. It will be the first period including results from Anglia Television. The tax charge is set to rise from 37 to 44 per cent, causing a fall in earnings per share. The dividend is likely to rise from 6.9p to between 7.25p and 8p. TUESDAY: A spread of businesses which includes retail and industrial logistics, business mail and chemical distribution makes Hays, the business services group, a good indicator of the pace of economic recovery. It is expected to report annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 66.6m to about Pounds 86m, helped by a strong rebound in performance from its network of personnel recruitment agencies. TUESDAY: Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, is expected to announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 247m (from Pounds 235m last year), adjusting for new depreciation policies and before Pounds 4m property losses. Some recovery in margins is expected but uncertainty about the extent of this, and over the fortunes of the Catteau chain in France, is reflected in the wide range of forecasts - from Pounds 240m to Pounds 252m. WEDNESDAY: Half-year figures for British Aerospace will show a dramatic turn-round from last year. But much of the headline improvement will come from the one-off profit on the sale of the Rover car group to BMW. This is estimated by some analysts to be in the region of Pounds 250m. Underlying profits are likely to be in the region of Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 20m in the first half of last year. A strong performance from the defence operations will be held back once again by losses in BAe's turbo-prop commercial aircraft subsidiary. The dividend might also be increased from an interim 3.3p last time to around 3.75p. THURSDAY: Wm Morrison, the regional grocery superstore group, is forecast to announce an 18 per cent increase in half-year, pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.2m about Pounds 45m. Analysts believe the group has had strong sales growth, with some improvement in margins. THURSDAY: Guinness, the brewing and spirits group, is expected to report pre-tax profits of around Pounds 320m for the first half. Last year's result, published at Pounds 320m, will be re-stated at Pounds 305m to allow for an increase in pension contributions. Operating profits from both spirits and brewing are expected to be fairly flat, but interest charges will be lower following last year's cash inflow. The City will also be be watching for any announcement on a new managing director for United Distillers to replace Crispin Davis, who resigned almost a year ago. THURSDAY: RMC, the world's biggest concrete company, reports half-year figures which are expected to show a sharp rise in UK profits. The market, however, will be more interested to hear if the heady pace of German growth has slowed. Latest forecasts suggest that pre-tax profits could be just over Pounds 90m, compared with Pounds 61.6m in the first half of 1993. FRIDAY: Hepworth, the clay pipes and refractories group, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 35.5m in the first half of 1994, compared with Pounds 27.5m. Analysts will be looking for the effects of stiff eastern German competition, while the group also could reveal weakness in the clay pipes market. The dividend is likely to be unchanged at 5.5p.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / S Africans take mass day-off in ANC move MILLIONS of South Africans will stay away from work today to mark the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto uprising and to observe the start of an African National Congress campaign of mass action aimed at breaking a deadlock in constitutional talks. The ANC believes that the government is stalling in negotiations at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the national negotiating forum, and that mass action is necessary to force it to quicken the process. Codesa failed last month to agree on the the details of a constitution-making body. Although this subject was yesterday returned to at Codesa, no breakthrough was expected until progress had been made in bilateral meetings between the government and the ANC. The mass action has been widely denounced by the ANC's political opponents, particularly the government, amid fears that it will exacerbate violence. In language reminiscent of the darkest days of the state of emergency in the 1980s, Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, yesterday told the Afrikaans newspaper Beeld that if mass action was the way in which the ANC sought to support negotiations, the government would have to look again at continuing the the negotiations process. He said there was a possibility of special legislation going before parliament this week to assist in countering mass action, while police and army forces are on standby. 'This government will not let itself be threatened by mass action to hand over power in the country to the ANC,' he said. The business community has also been been critical of the ANC saying that the economy, in deep recession and with unemployment running at 40 per cent, can ill afford a period of sustained disruption. Mr Sam Shilowa, assistant general secretary of Cosatu, the union grouping closely allied to the ANC, yesterday outlined a four-phase programme of action. The first phase will be at the regional level, with protests already under way by municipal and health workers, and further protests planned. The second phase will run for the whole of July if the government has not by the end of this month committed itself to firm time-frames. Next would follow a general strike while the final phase, dubbed 'Exitgate', envisages the existing government resigning and preparations commencing for new elections.</p>

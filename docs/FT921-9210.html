			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: ITT posts 14.7% decline in earnings ITT, the US conglomerate, blamed the extended worldwide recession and the strength of the US dollar for a 14.7 per cent drop in its 1991 net earnings to Dollars 817m, or Dollars 6.05 a share. The New York-based group recorded a 1 per cent decline in 1991 revenues, to Dollars 20.4bn. However, it said its operating income and financial strength were sufficient to permit an increase in the annual dividend, from Dollars 1.72 to Dollars 1.84 a share. Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 was Dollars 195m, or Dollars 1.44 a share, more than double the Dollars 84m, or 65 cents, earned in the last quarter of 1990. But the 1991 fourth quarter included after-tax portfolio gains totalling Dollars 79m at the ITT Hartford insurance group and ITT financial division. Fourth-quarter revenues fell by 2 per cent, to Dollars 5.35bn. ITT said three of its four service businesses improved their operating earnings in 1991. These were the Hartford insurance group, the ITT communications and information services division and the ITT financial arm. The ITT Sheraton hotel business suffered lower earnings as a result of lower occupancy rates, which reflected reduced travel in the US and the impact of recession.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Protest grows over airline deal UNITED Parcel Service, the world's largest parcel delivery company, and Federal Express, the largest overnight package delivery operation, have joined the chorus of US airlines opposing British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) investment in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. UPS, a private company based in Atlanta, has put its name to a briefing document outlining the case against the BA-USAir deal, 'An issue of national policy, competition and fairness', circulated yesterday by a Washington DC lobbying firm, Powell Tate. The other three signatories to the document are American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - the nation's three biggest airlines - which have publicly opposed the deal. According to Powell Tate, UPS was closely involved in the drafting of the document. Part of the company's concern appears to centre on repercus sions for the freight market. 'This is a direct assault on the US airline industry,' reads the document at one stage. 'This is not a question of British Airways acquiring a 'toehold' in the lucrative US market, but a potential stranglehold over access to 55m USAir passengers and 200m freight tons per kilometre of air cargo a year.' Under the proposed deal, BA would invest Dollars 750m in USAir, in return for a potential 44 per cent equity stake and 21 per cent voting stake. The document argues, however, that USAir would be under BA's control, since 'all critical business decisions' would need the approval of 80 per cent of the board, and the UK airline would hold four of the 16 seats. The outcry from the US carriers is widely viewed as an effort to put pressure on the Bush administration to win greater access for US airlines to the UK and Europe, in return for approving the transaction. However, in London, British Airways repeated its conviction that the deal 'falls squarely within existing regulations and has no implications for the bilateral agreement'. Federal Express, of Memphis, yesterday added its support to the campaign. Like UPS, it has been expanding air freight operations outside its domestic market. It recently pulled out of the intra-European delivery business, but still flies a sizable 'Expressfreighter' service across the Atlantic. A top Transportation Department official said yesterday the US and the Netherlands would soon sign an 'open skies' agreement, AP-DJ reports from Washngton. The agreement with the Netherlands - the first of its kind - might be completed in weeks, said Mr Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary for policy and international affairs. The agreement would give KLM Royal Dutch Airlines blanket authority to fly to any US city it chooses. In return, US carriers would be able to serve any city in the Netherlands.</p>

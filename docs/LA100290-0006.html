			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEELER FAN BEATEN AT RAIDERS GAME  </P> <P> I have been an avid Raider fan since the day the team arrived from Oakland. I  do not believe it is fair to judge all Raider fans or the Coliseum as a place  where "hooligans" gather.  </P> <P> Unlike the riots that occur at English soccer matches, this was an isolated  incident. The Los Angeles Police Department and the Coliseum security staff do  a fine job of controlling the crowd.  </P> <P> I strongly believe that new rules should be drawn up that prohibit the sale of  any alcoholic beverages after the second quarter, and possibly permit a maximum  of two beers per customer at all games league-wide.  </P> <P> I ask that the media and everyone in general not allow "one bad apple to spoil  the whole bunch of us."  </P> <P> GILBERT DE ALBA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

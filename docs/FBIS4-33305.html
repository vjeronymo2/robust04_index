			<p>BFN     [Text] On 31 May, provisional President Emile Jonassaint's  government banned members of the resigning government of Prime  Minister Malval from leaving national territory. The Interior  and National Defense Ministry issued a press release on national  television that "advises the border posts and those most  concerned that the formal order banning departure is now applied  to all who must explain their management of public funds."    This order, which also concerns all high-ranking employees  appointed by President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide or by  Malval, aims at officially figuring the country's accounts. The  press release asserts that the measure is taken "in the  legitimate interest of guaranteeing the interests of public  administration and those of the Haitian nation." The former  authorities must present an official discharge regarding their  management when they leave the territory. A number of Malval  government ministers are already abroad, according to some  informed sources. Father Aristide ordered the same measure  after the election, which was denounced at the time as political  revenge.</p>

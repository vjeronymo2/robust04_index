			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Benazir holds the cards in dynasty power game: Bhutto family feud leaves Pakistan party leadership and military unmoved 'This is not democracy, this is a police state. The day of celebrations has been turned into a day of mourning. What is the difference between the dictatorial regime of General Zia and this so-called democracy?' These bitter words did not come from any ordinary opponent of Pakistan's prime minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto. The speaker was Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, her mother, after a week of family feuding triggered by the 66th birthday of the late Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, respectively their father and husband. 'Benazir Bhutto is responsible for all these incidents. It is a shame on Benazir Bhutto,' Mrs Bhutto said after police fired on a crowd of demonstrators on Wednesday, killing one and injuring seven. The procession of several hundred people was attempting to march from the family estate at Larkana, in the southern province of Sind, to Mr Bhutto's grave on his birthday. Mr Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in 1977 and hanged in 1979 by the military regime of Gen Zia-ul-Haq on charges of ordering the assassination of a political foe. His daughter, months after sweeping back to power in October's elections, is now locked in an extraordinary power struggle within her family, reminiscent of soap operas watched avidly by Pakistanis on satellite television. Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, angry at being ousted from her position in the ruling party, is supporting her son, who is in jail on terrorism charges, against her daughter. Mr Murtaza Bhutto, her son, faces charges of running an anti-government terrorism campaign during 16 years of self-imposed exile. He returned to Pakistan two months ago after winning election to the Sindh assembly from a seat in Larkana while still abroad. His mother supported him in the election. After the election, Benazir Bhutto had her mother removed as co-chair of the ruling Pakistan People's party, leaving the prime minister herself in sole charge. Mrs Bhutto now wants her son to lead the party. This week's eruption of the feud came after supporters of Mr Murtaza Bhutto refused to allow Ms Benazir Bhutto to visit her father's grave unless he was released on bail to preside over the birthday ceremonies. The resulting confusion has seen armed police laying siege to 'Al-Murtaza', ancestral home of the Bhuttos. Power supply to the house was cut and telephones disconnected. But at the same time, fireworks celebrating the late prime minister's birthday lit the sky and the music played on. After the shooting, Mrs Nusrat Bhutto ordered her loyalists to cancel the ceremonies. Servants were told to cut a large cake and distribute it among the poor without fanfare. However, the prime minister's supporters continued to celebrate. She visited her father's grave amid tight security. Mrs Nusrat Bhutto plans to demand a full parliamentary debate on Wednesday's events. Her daughter appears strong enough to keep her position, since there are few signs of any divide within the party leadership, and the powerful military and the bureaucracy do not want another change at the top after last year's political turmoil. Nevertheless, the feud is embarrassing for the prime minister, who faces demands to remove from key positions party leaders who have been accused by Mrs Bhutto of being enemies of her late husband. For many family members, Mr Murtaza Bhutto's return has provided him with the opportunity to claim leadership. His supporters are waiting for him to emerge from prison to exert his authority as the clan's pugdaar - the one entitled to wear the family's turban as a mark of leadership. However, the future of the charges against him remains unclear. The family feud could come to a head again on April 4, the anniversary of the elder Mr Bhutto's execution. Once again, his grave could become the centre of his children's fight to lay claim to the family dynasty.</p>

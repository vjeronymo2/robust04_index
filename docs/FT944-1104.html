			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / SIB sets guidelines for probe on pensions Life companies which seem to have advised the most people to leave employers' pensions schemes and take out personal plans will have to make greater efforts to identify potential victims than other insurers, City regulators said yesterday. The Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial services watchdog, said companies which could show that they had fewer victims in the categories of investors most at risk would not have to go to such lengths to persuade them to respond. The differences in how far life insurers will have to go were revealed as SIB published guidance about how the millions of personal pension holders should be approached to identify those who should be compensated. The guidance contains three warnings that the exercise must not be used to try to sell new policies to investors. The format of covering letters and the questionnaire to go to personal pension holders have been prescribed by SIB after research intended to make them understandable. The questionnaire is an important step in identifying the estimated 850,000 people who were advised to take a personal pension and opt out of, or not join, an occupational scheme. But the guidance leaves issues unclear, including whether life companies which sell through independent financial advisers should take on the administration of the questionnaires. This was discussed at the Association of British Insurers last week but it has proved impossible to find a consensus. Many companies will not want to send out the questionnaires before a decision, even though delays will make the deadlines for dealing with cases where there is the most risk of poor advice harder to meet. SIB has said that most of the 350,000 priority cases should be reviewed by the end of 1996.</p>

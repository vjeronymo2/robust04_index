			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Criteria for rail investment Sir, Richard Tomkins, in his article 'When fare is not fair' (January 29) on the costs of road and rail travel, is wrong to say that 'the case for rail investment is judged solely according to commercial criteria'. While this is true of investment by the commercial sectors (Freight and Intercity), which are in direct competition with other - unsubsidised - forms of transport, it is not true of investment in Network SouthEast and Regional Railways. In these sectors, the overriding objective is to maintain the existing network of services in the most cost-effective way, even if the investment needed to do so does not make an 8 per cent return. And, where the network is being expanded, wider benefits such as the relief of congestion in urban areas can also be taken into account. Similarly, essential safety investment is not required to make an 8 per cent return. This means that in practice well over half of British Rail's programme of investment in its existing rail network is not judged 'solely according to commercial criteria'.

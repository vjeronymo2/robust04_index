			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / The Markets: China's gradualist strategy not a Russian option - Economic Eye 'Therapy without shock' is a tempting slogan for Russian politicians, as they stake out their positions in the run-up to next month's elections. With inflation running above 1,000 per cent a year, and industrial output expected to fall a further 10 per cent this year, the need for therapy is obvious. But 'shock therapy'? The Russian people may well figure that they have had more than their fair share of shocks already. In fact, the party of shock therapy is currently firmly in the lead in the polls. The liberal Russia's Choice party, led by Yegor Gaidar and backed by the president, wants to cut subsidies to state enterprises in order to control inflation and encourage the private sector. But for supporters of groups such as the Civic Union for Stability, Fairness and Progress - backed by Russia's industrial lobby - a more gradual approach to subsidy cuts has an obvious appeal. 'Gradualism' also has an impressive pedigree. China, which began its transition from central planning back in 1978, has avoided shocks like the plague, while eschewing rapid cuts in subsidies to inefficient state enterprises or mass privatisation. Instead, the Chinese leadership has concentrated reform first on agriculture and rural enterprise, while cautiously experimenting with liber-alisation in selected pro-vinces. And this 'gradualist' strategy has worked. The Chinese economy has grown by a dramatic 8 per cent plus since 1978, doubling its share of world trade. Compared with Russia, it remains a poor country. Russia's average income per head in 1991 was Dollars 3,220 compared with a mere Dollars 370 in China. But the contrast between the drab streets and decaying industry of Moscow, St Petersburg or Volgograd, and the dynamism of the shining industrial development zones that surround Tianjin, Shanghai or Guangzhou, suggests that these simple dollar income comparisons tell only a small part of a much larger development story. How tempting, then, to see China as a role model for Russian reform: a relatively pain-less way to make the transition from plan to market, encouraging the non-state sector and foreign investment but with-out requiring immediate cuts in state output and employment. Sadly, the analogy does not work, as Harvard professor and Russian adviser Jeffrey Sachs argues in a forthcoming Economic Policy paper, written with Wing Thye Woo. The reason is that Russia and China started the transition to a market economy at very different stages of economic development. In China in 1978, the bulk of the population worked in collectivised, but unsubsidised agriculture - state enterprises employed less than 20 per cent of the population. Liberalisation of agriculture, and the consequent rapid (not gradual) rise in productivity, meant substantial gains to the rural population and allowed surplus peasant workers to move to the rural industrial sector. The potential losers from cuts in subsidies to unviable state enterprises are a dwindling minority, while the willingness of the population to increase its holding of money balances has allowed the government to pay monetary credits to industry without fuelling inflation. China has not escaped inflationary problems. But its inflation has resulted not from the need to subsidise the old, but because the growth of new enterprise has run ahead of the ability of physical infrastructure and economic institutions to support it. It is the World Bank, not the International Mone-tary Fund, which is advising China on the structural reforms. For Russia, this Chinese 'gradualism' is not an option. Russia's highly centralised planning means that state enterprises are much larger than in China, while in-dustry is more regionally concentrated, making closure of non-viable plants more difficult. But Russia is also over-industrialised - only 6 per cent of the population works in agriculture, compared with 93 per cent in state enterprises. The constituency which stands to lose, in the short-term, from cuts in subsidies is therefore much greater. Meanwhile, as confidence in the currency has dwindled, the government's resort to the printing press has meant accelerating inflation. This Russian inflation is not a product of overly rapid development but of the government's need to continue to subsidise the past at the expense of progress. Until these industrial subsidies are cut, the bias against the non-state sector and very high inflation will continue to impede growth of the non-state sectors. Indeed, a gradual approach to cutting state subsidies risks being the worst of both worlds - it hurts the state employees, while providing little incentive for state employees to move into the service or private sectors. Hence, the importance the IMF attaches to linking aid to cuts in inflationary industrial credits. Of course, Russia's transition to democracy makes the short-term task of cutting subsidies even harder, a problem that China has never had to face - which explains why the IMF has been criticised, both by Russia's reformers and western economists, for being much too cautious in offering this financial support, most recently by Mr Sachs in today's FT Letter's column. But, in the debate between advocates of 'gradualism' and rapid disinflation, Mr Sachs and the IMF are on the same side.</p>

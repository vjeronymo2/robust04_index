			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM OF THE YEAR? DODGERS WERE MERELY LUCKY IN '88  </P> <P> When is enough, enough? Now is the time for General Manager Fred Claire of the  Dodgers to admit his GM of the year award should be given back.  </P> <P> Pedro Guerrero for John Tudor was a big mistake and replacing Guerrero with  Eddie Murray was even worse. Kirk Gibson was a one-year wonder whose vision  must have left him. John Shelby was also a one-year hero in 1987.  </P> <P> Letting Steve Sax get away was unforgivable.  </P> <P> When will the Dodgers again stick with a Mike Devereaux, a Cecil Espy or a Dave  Stewart, among others. Why this affinity for American League heroes of the  past?  </P> <P> DAVE SALVIONE  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PATERNALISTIC' LETTER SPURS REPLY  </P> <P> I take exception to Jesse L. Robinson's paternalistic attitude to the Latino  community ("No 'Guarantees' in Council Election," Times, April 13). I have  lived in Compton for over 30 years and have seen its transformation from white  to black. Now a huge furor -- and "blacklash" -- is developing over Latinos  wanting a piece of the sweet potato pie. Robinson says that "(City Council  candidate) Martin D. Chavez's master's degree is not a prerequisite for  election to the Compton City Council." Let me tell you, it's a better  alternative than ignorance. I am not for any one color whether it be black,  brown, red, yellow or puce. I am, however, against ignorance and race-baiting.  </P> <P> One of the incumbent candidates was heard to say that if they (Latinos) don't  like it here, they should go elsewhere. In the '60s, conservative (read:  incumbent, ensconced, don't bug me) America told those who wanted to change  America for the better -- "America: love it or leave it." But now it's become,  "Compton: love it or leave it." And, I guess, the proper response would be:  "Compton: change it or lose it."  </P> <P> Robinson labels as "crazy" the projected 38.8% Latino population figure from  the National Planning Data Corp. because he does not know where the housing  would come from. Robinson is definitely no authority on housing. Whites sold  out to the blacks, and blacks are selling out to the Latinos.  </P> <P> I know Chavez as a competent young professional who would infuse the Compton  City Council with a spirit of honesty, decency and respect for good, clean hard  work. I have seen Compton used and abused time and again. Robinson says  "Compton has paid for (Councilman Robert L.) Adams' education." And how! The  city is still paying for it -- through the nose. How much did the city (read:  local taxpayers) lose on the Compton Auto Plaza? How much did the city sink  into the Compton Lazben Hotel and it still hasn't had one paying guest?  </P> <P> Chavez, and other rising Latino stars like him, may not now have the votes or  money, but they will. Just give them time.  </P> <P> It's plain to see that Robinson does not have a handle on the numbers, nor  quality, of the city and school district employees, since he said he "hopes"  that the city of Compton and the Compton Unified School District are hiring the  most qualified people regardless of race, creed or color. If the city and  school district were hiring the best qualified employees it would stand to  reason that the city of Compton would be the best-run city in America, and the  school district would have test scores and student achievement that would rank  it as No. 1. This, however, is not the case.  </P> <P> I know some people are uneasy because of the increasing number of Latinos in  the city, but in the '50s, whites were uneasy about the blacks coming into the  city, too. I know, also, that those in power (city and school district) don't  like people to make waves.  </P> <P> Robinson and others like him must realize that the only constant in life is  change, and the sooner the powers-that-be in the city and school district begin  incorporating Latinos into their future design, the better city government and  the schools will serve their customers -- the people who reside here and the  students who attend the schools even if they speak black English with a Spanish  accent.  </P> <P> GORGONIO SANCHEZ  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

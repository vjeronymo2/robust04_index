			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Australian opposition picks youthful leadership The Australian Liberal party, the main federal opposition party, yesterday voted for a change of leader, with Mr Alexander Downer replacing Mr John Hewson. Mr Peter Costello, joining Mr Downer on a joint 'youth' ticket, will act as Mr Downer's deputy. The change was achieved at a 15-minute party meeting in Canberra called by Mr Hewson to face up to the challenge. Mr Downer won 43 votes against Mr Hewson's 36. The build-up to his overthrow began with the opposition's surprise loss in elections just over a year ago to Mr Paul Keating's incumbent Labor party. Although Mr Hewson's fortunes revived last summer when the government's budget was stalled in parliament for two months, his opinion poll rating then dropped very sharply. Mr Downer, aged 42, comes from an Adelaide establishment family which has been involved in federal politics for several generations. His father was immigration minister in the Menzies government. Such a background has often been viewed as a liability but Mr Downer has attempted to combat this image  -partly through astute handling of the shadow treasurer's job, and partly by conscious efforts to portray a down-to-earth, family image. Mr Costello, six years younger than Mr Downer, is a Melbourne lawyer who has been in federal politics for only four years.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> RANCH STILL A RANCH ON 44,000 ACRES  </P> <P> Stepping outside of his Irvine Ranch farm headquarters on a recent late  afternoon, Pete Changala surveyed the skyline. He was looking for clouds, but  not necessarily for rain.  </P> <P> "If it clouds up, it stays warmer at night," Changala explained. "When it's  clear, the temperature can drop into the high 20s. Of course, 32 degrees is the  threshold. When it freezes, we can have some crop damage."  </P> <P> Crop damage is something Changala constantly looks out for as director of the  agricultural division of the huge Irvine Co. home-building and land-management  empire.  </P> <P> Overnight lows on the ranch and the adjacent Saddleback Valley farmland have  stayed in the high 30s so far this winter, nothing like the freezing  temperatures that have plagued farmers in Texas and Florida, two of  California's major agricultural competitors.  </P> <P> "In Texas, the weather got down into the teens, meaning they actually lost some  of their citrus trees," Changala said. "That's devastating for a farmer. It's  one thing to lose part of a crop and have some damage. It's another to lose the  trees altogether."  </P> <P> Changala, 30, watches over what has become a diminishing ranch program. Long  gone are the heyday of lima beans and such crops and the old warehouse off Sand  Canyon Avenue near the Santa Ana Freeway -- now the site of a La Quinta Inn,  Tia Juana's and Sirius Cellars.  </P> <P> "As the Irvine Co. has evolved and land values in Southern California have  become astronomical, the farming business has changed around here," said  Changala, who was born on the Saddleback Valley's Moulton Ranch. "This has  become an urbanized area. Grading controls have increased. We have to get  permits for any agricultural grading, just like a development. Pesticide  controls are very strict. We can't start our machines up until 7 a.m. and we  have to shut them down at 5. It makes it very difficult to compete with the San  Joaquin Valley."  </P> <P> But 44,000 acres of Irvine Ranch land are still being farmed or used for  pasture. And while oranges remain the No. 1 crop, necessity has mothered the  invention of newer, hybridized vegetables. The first seedless melons were grown  on the ranch and, these days, red (Sunworld's Le Rouge Royales), yellow and  even orange bell peppers are being harvested, patented and given a trademark.  </P> <P> "We seem to be taking a lot of our directions from the Israelis, who are great  innovators when it comes to farming," Changala said. "The Israelis have  developed a new strawberry variety and a new tomato variety with a longer  shelf-life."  </P> <P> With the ranch flatlands gradually being taken over by new homes, local farmers  are now turning to planting on the hillsides, thanks again to techniques from  the Israelis.  </P> <P> "Avocados are often grown on hillsides because the trees are non-sensitive and  can adapt to the poorer soil you find on a hillside," Changala said. "But we  also have some tomatoes, cabbage, squash, strawberries and bush beans growing  on the hillsides."  </P> <P> Strawberries used to be the second biggest crop on the ranch, but they are  gradually being replaced by bell peppers, Changala said. Celery and asparagus  are also beginning to disappear at the ranch, although not completely.  </P> <P> "Our early-season berries get air-freighted to Europe and the Far East,"  Changala said. "Most of our asparagus go to Europe, to the high-end market.  Ninety percent of our Valencia oranges go by boat to the Far East, places like  Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. For some reason, they really like our  oranges. . . . "  </P> <P> Educating buyers is part of a grower's job in a specialized market, according  to Changala. A group of Korean buyers recently visited the ranch to taste the  avocados, he said.  </P> <P> "They loved our avocados, which were new to them. You have to educate people  about different products. The Koreans had not seen a lot of avocados. But then  a lot of our own people from the Midwest don't know what avocados are either,"  Changala noted. LEN HALL  </P></p>

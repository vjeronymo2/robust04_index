			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Hopes rise for further cuts in German interest rates CONDITIONS for further interest rate cuts in Germany improved yesterday amid fresh signs and renewed claims that the German recession was approaching its low point. Hopes of an upturn rose when the economics ministry reported an increase of almost 4 per cent in new industrial orders in May compared with the previous month. The figures supported the Bundesbank's belief - aired last week when it reduced interest rates, and repeated by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president yesterday - that the worst may be over. While last week's reductions in the discount and Lombard rates to 6.75 per cent and 8.25 per cent respectively were largely motivated by a government agreement on public spending cuts and encouraging inflation indicators, they were designed to help support economic recovery. The fragility of the situation was underlined yesterday by aggregate figures for April and May showing demand for German products still 10 per cent down on the comparable two months in 1992. However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined the optimists, echoing Mr Schlesinger's remarks and citing reduced interest rates, the closer linkage of pay to productivity and improving export demand as grounds for believing that recovery should come by the turn of the year. He told a delegation of industry leaders, headed by Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German industry federation, one of his critics, that conditions had been improved by Bonn's spending cuts package, corporate tax reforms and a draft law aimed at increasing working hours flexibility. Taken with the likelihood of lower inflation, the possible end to economic decline will raise hopes that the bank will continue its cautious monetary easing. According to Mr Schlesinger, west German inflation had come a 'step closer' to the bank's goal of 2 per cent with a 2.7 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the past three months. A real 9 per cent fall in turnover in service industries, reported by the ZDH federal association representing diverse sectors including dry cleaning and motor repairs, prompted hopes of lower prices as suppliers competed for business. But the Bundesbank president also appealed to Bonn to honour its pledges to reduce state spending next year - and to carry on cutting in future. 'It is important for everyone that the planned reductions will be translated into reality,' Mr Schlesinger told an audience of bankers in Bavaria.

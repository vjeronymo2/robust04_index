			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> LPGA NEEDS SELLING JOB, AND NEW COMMISSIONER SAYS HE'S MAN TO DO IT  </P> <P> As a public address announcer at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in the 1960s, Bill Blue  was accustomed to introducing athletes.  </P> <P> Specifically, he was the freshman game announcer while getting his master's  degree in business at the school.  </P> <P> He had some marquee names to introduce, Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar),  Lynn Shackelford and Lucius Allen, among others.  </P> <P> Now he's trying to put the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. into the spotlight as  its new commissioner. Blue, 48, succeeded John Laupenheimer, who resigned last  summer.  </P> <P> In terms of popularity, exposure and prize money, the LPGA tour lags behind the  PGA Tour. Moreover, now that the Senior PGA Tour is flourishing, the LPGA has a  bit of an indentity problem.  </P> <P> Blue, a former director of international marketing, only talks about the  positive aspects of the LPGA.  </P> <P> A salesman with a plan, he is visible at all tournaments, such as the recent  Nabisco Dinah Shore in Rancho Mirage. And he'll be bustling around the press  room and golf course this week at the AI Star/Centinela Hospital tournament at  Rancho Park.  </P> <P> "I don't find any negatives," Blue said of the LPGA. "What I found was an  organization going through growing pains, that didn't have any of the marketing  acuity that the other two tours had.  </P> <P> "It's so simple. The focus is that we concentrate on being the premier women's  professional sports organization in the world.  </P> <P> "We're competing against women. We aren't competing against anyone else. And we  have to go out and let enough sponsors know that our targets are women. I think  it will take care of itself."  </P> <P> Whereas the men's tour is on television every week, either cable or network,  the women's sometimes operates in the dark.  </P> <P> "The only competitive area (with the other tours) is for available television  time," Blue said. "And with the explosion of cable network, we don't see that  as a problem. We have plenty of opportunities and we're going to exercise those  by next year."  </P> <P> Blue estimates that the LPGA will have 19 cable or network exposures this year,  having lost a few televised events from 1988.  </P> <P> "We just haven't been terribly active in this area," he said. "Next year, when  it's all said and done, we should have a total of 27 to 30 events.  </P> <P> "All I can say is that if I had been here two years earlier, we would be  significantly ahead of where we are right now, simply because of common-sense  marketing and working to get windows (of publicity) ahead of the fact, rather  than relying on each individual tournament to sell itself."  </P> <P> As a marketing man, Blue said, he is contacting advertising agencies and  specific corporations who already have women as a target market.  </P> <P> "We are making presentations to them on the benefits of looking at the LPGA as  an adjunct to their marketing program," he said.  </P> <P> "It isn't just the tour. We have a fast-growing teaching division, which is our  equivalent to the PGA of America. We are also working with communities in terms  of building a junior golf program and programs for women only."  </P> <P> Although Nancy Lopez and Amy Alcott are women golfers who are generally known  to the public, the women's tour lacks the name attraction that goes with the  PGA and senior tours.  </P> <P> "The way we can (promote the players) is to get ourselves on television and be  more involved with the press," Blue said. "If we could have had the exposure  that the PGA Tour and seniors had on a normal basis, the names of Betsy King,  Sherri Turner and Juli Inkster would be much better known than they are. They  are every bit as good as, and in some instances, better players than the women  stars we once knew."  </P> <P> So for Blue, an avid golfer who plays to an eight handicap, it's blue skies  ahead for the LPGA.  </P> <P> "They couldn't have designed a better position for me," he said. "Nobody could  be happier than I am to get a chance to exercise business, leadership and  public relations skills and love of the game."  </P> <P> Lopez will defend her title in the AI Star/Centinela event, beginning with  first-round play Friday over the 6,191-yard Rancho Park course.  </P> <P> She shot a six-under-par 210 in 1988 and was tied with Marta Figueras-Dotti at  the end of 54-hole regulation play. Lopez won the tournament on the second  playoff hole  </P> <P> A field of 144 will begin teeing off at 7:30 a.m. Friday. First prize in the  $450,000 event is $67,500.  </P> <P> Separate pro-ams Wednesday and Thursday at Rancho will precede tournament play.  There also will be a free junior clinic Tuesday, starting at 4:30 p.m. on the  Rancho Park practice range. About 300 juniors, 8 through 17, are expected.  </P> <P> Hord Hardin, chairman of the Masters tournament, is concerned that escalating  purses at other tournaments may lure the pros away from the Masters in the  future.  </P> <P> Curtis Strange, who became the first player to earn $1 million in a tour season  in 1988, said that Hardin's concern is unfounded.  </P> <P> "I think Mr. Hardin is exaggerating if he actually believes that," Strange  said. "He doesn't know what the Masters means to the players. I've been  thinking about this tournament for a long, long time. The purse means nothing."  </P> <P> Apprised of Strange's comments, Hardin said: "I like to hear that, but I don't  know if the younger players have the same feeling."  </P> <P> The Champions Locker Room at the Augusta National course is reserved for past  winners of the Masters.  </P> <P> Some of the former winners are uneasy about their exclusive quarters. Others  favor it.  </P> <P> "It's nice, but in a way it's not nice that they separate the guys," Bernhard  Langer said. "You've won and you can come in here and the people who haven't  won can't. We don't don't like to think that way."  </P> <P> Said Craig Stadler: "I don't believe it is any advantage at all. I don't eat up  there very often. I eat at the other locker room, with some of the guys."  </P> <P> But he added: "However, it's kind of nice, a special thing for the champions,  and I think they should keep it that way."  </P> <P> Said Tom Watson: "There are so many media people here that you can't go  anywhere to get away from the questions. When you're contending for the  Masters, you need some time to think and get ready. When we were down in the  other locker room, we didn't have that time."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Lanny Wadkins and Blaine McCallister were playing the  par-three course at Augusta in preparation for the Masters.  </P> <P> They had a $100 bet if either made a hole-in-one.  </P> <P> On the eighth hole, Wadkins hit his tee shot down the slope on the back of the  green. He figured that his ball had gone into the water behind the green.  </P> <P> So he teed up another ball and aced the hole with a pitching wedge. Did he win  the bet?  </P> <P> No way. McCallister told Wadkins the bet was off, saying, "I don't count  mulligans."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> The Pride of the Foothills invitational tournament is scheduled May 5-7 at the  Glendora Country Club. . . . The $2.5-million Nabisco Championships, richest  event on the PGA Tour, will be played at Houston's Champions Golf Club in 1990.  </P></p>

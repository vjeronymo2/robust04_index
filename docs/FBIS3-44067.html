			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harare Jan 24 SAPA--Azanian People's Liberation Army  [APLA] Commander Sabelo Phama has dissociated APLA from claims  that it would continue fighting in spite of the suspension of  the armed struggle by its parent Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC].    Callers claiming to be APLA commanders have vowed to  continue  fighting in spite of PAC leaders' decision on January 16 to  suspend the fight. "Various political decisions have been made  and one of them is that we would stop armed operations. That is  exactly what we have done," the Harare-based HERALD newspaper  quoted Mr Phama as saying in a weekend interview in Windhoek,  Namibia.    The APLA leader said it was most unlikely that the claims  were made by APLA members. "Specific instructions have since  gone out to our members to cease all military operations as per  the decision of our political leadership, and they have (ceased  operations). Now we have all these people 'phoning newspapers  in South Africa with so- called pre-arranged codes and claiming  to be members of APLA, vowing to continue the armed struggle.  Who are they? I can say with authority that they are not our  people."    Mr Phama was sure the claims were part of a campaign to  discredit the PAC and APLA. He also dismissed charges that his  organisation had been responsible for a spate of controversial  attacks on civilians such as last month's shooting at the  Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town which left four people dead.  "There have been many attacks on innocent civilians and certain  people claiming to be our guerrillas have occasionally claimed  responsibility. I know which ones have been our operations and  which have not...And I can tell you that we have not conducted  any atrocities."</p>

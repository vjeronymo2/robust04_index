In a statement made at the beginning of the meeting, Mr.  Paul  Filipi, the president of the forum, said that the goal of the  meeting was to mark the date of 8 January 1919, when the  Transylvanian Saxons, on the basis of people's right to  self-determination, through their National Council, assembled in  Medias, proclaimed unity with the Kingdom of Romania.  Describing the historical importance of this act, Mr. Filipi  stressed the role of a connecting bridge between Romania and  Germany played by the German minority, a role also acknowledged  in the treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two  countries, concluded in 21 April 1992.    The meeting was attended by representatives of the German  minority from various regions of the country, who presented to  the Romanian president the problems that they are currently  facing in the areas of education and religion, as well as the  state of mind of citizens of German nationality. They requested  that a law on minorities be drafted and asked President Ion  Iliescu to issue a declaration in which it is recognized that  the German minority in Romania suffered discrimination after  World War II and that the compensatory measures that they are  demanding are justified.    In a statement made to the press at the end of the meeting,  President Iliescu said that, in our country, there is a  constitutional framework for the development of a common life  between the majority population and ethnic minorities, noting  that, within this context, the claims expressed by the  participants are resolvable and there is a chance for the  citizens of German nationality who left Romania to return to the  homeland.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> FIRETRUCK MISUSED, COUNCILMAN CHARGES  </P> <P> A councilman is charging the firefighters association with improperly using an  antique firetruck for political purposes.  </P> <P> Councilman Daniel E. Griset said on Monday that a 1957 Ladder Truck sold to the  Santa Ana Firemen's Benevolent Assn. earlier this year had carried campaign  signs during visits to several local shopping centers last weekend.  </P> <P> Griset said the truck was to be used only for public education and parades and  charged that the 200-member association may have "misrepresented its  intentions" when buying the truck because members used it to promote the  reelection campaigns of Mayor Daniel H. Young and Councilmen Ron May, Richards  L. Norton and Miguel A. Pulido Jr.  </P> <P> City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said the association "can't be using city property  for promoting candidates or issues. I think it could be in violation of using  public funds for private purposes, which is a constitutional issue."  </P> <P> Art Del Gaudio, vice president of the association, said members didn't think  they were doing anything wrong by posting the signs on the truck.  </P> <P> "We certainly didn't do anything intentionally," Del Gaudio said. "We don't do  dirty politics. We support the people we feel are supportive of public safety."  </P> <P> Del Gaudio said the association will be moving the truck, which is parked at a  fire station at 1029 W. 17th St., from city property within 48 hours.

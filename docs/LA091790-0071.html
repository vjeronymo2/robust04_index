			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME;  </P> <P> NFC: THEIR PLAY IS NOT UP TO THEIR REPUTATION IN A 26-13 LOSS AT SAN FRANCISCO.  MONTANA COMPLETES 29 OF 44 PASSES FOR 390 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS.  </P> <P> When the Washington Redskins kicked off to the San Francisco 49ers Sunday,  there was a perception that the 49ers, Rams and Redskins are the NFL's three  best teams -- if not in that order.  </P> <P> Before the end of the third quarter, however, the Redskins had dropped out --  at least for the time being -- when they couldn't score a touchdown against a  San Francisco linebacker, ex-Raider Matt Millen, with first and goal at the San  Francisco one-foot line.  </P> <P> As the 49ers returned toward respectability after a slow Monday night in New  Orleans, their timely goal-line stand made the defensive team a partner with  Joe Montana and the offense in a 26-13 conquest of one of the East's best  teams.  </P> <P> Montana passed 44 times, completing 29 for 390 yards and two touchdowns, to  keep the champions ahead from the first quarter on, although, at a critical  moment in the second half, he threw the only interception of a game that was  played with no fumbles and no sacks.  </P> <P> "This was a big step up from the way we looked (in New Orleans)," Montana said.  "You can't throw without great protection."  </P> <P> Said 49er Coach George Seifert: "This was the best we've played as a team  (since the Super Bowl), but we did give up some big plays."  </P> <P> The biggest, potentially, was Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien's 40-yard  third-quarter pass to wide receiver Gary Clark, who was driven out of bounds at  the 49ers' one-foot line by their new safety, Dave Waymer.  </P> <P> The 49ers were leading, 20-10, but they hadn't made a first down since the  second quarter.  </P> <P> Waymer's touchdown-saving tackle was followed by the goal-line stand that  featured Millen on all three downs. On the third, he crashed through to sack  Rypien for a two-yard loss.  </P> <P> The Redskins took a field goal there, closing to 20-13, but they had lost an  opportunity.  </P> <P> In his big third quarter, Rypien twice moved the Redskins into touchdown  position before the 49ers twice forced them into field-goal formation, and then  blocked one of the two field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> "We should have gotten more than three points there," Rypien said. "We got  ourselves back into the ballgame, but. . . . "  </P> <P> Too much defense.  </P> <P> Said Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs: "We had our opportunities, but we just didn't get  the job done. When we blitzed (Montana), he hit the slants (pattern pass  routes)."  </P> <P> Too much Montana.  </P> <P> In retrospect, it seems likely that the 49ers' indifferent game in the  Louisiana Superdome Monday night was because it was the season opener.  </P> <P> "We hardly ever played our starters more than a quarter in the preseason,"  Seifert said. "So against the Saints, we were out of sync."  </P> <P> Most noticeably in New Orleans, Montana was "out of sync" with his wide  receivers, Jerry Rice and John Taylor.  </P> <P> But after practicing with them then and through another week, Montana threw  eight passes to Taylor for 160 yards and six to Rice for 74.  </P> <P> Together, they outproduced Washington's so-called posse -- wide receivers Art  Monk, Ricky Sanders and Gary Clark -- of whom only Clark stood out, with seven  catches for 106 yards.  </P> <P> The Washington problem seemed to be Rypien's nervousness. He is an accurate  passer, and he has the arm to throw the football as far as he wants to, but on  the same field with Montana he seemed to lack some confidence.  </P> <P> Rypien drove the Redskins repeatedly -- and often impressively -- but only once  all the way. Typical of the lapses that hurt Washington was Rypien's  second-quarter pass to a well-covered deep receiver, Monk, when another  Redskin, halfback Kelvin Bryant, was open 10 yards away in Monk's direction.  </P> <P> Montana would have seen Bryant easily, and quickly. Rypien only had eyes for  Monk, who couldn't catch it when surrounded by 49er safety Ronnie Lott.  </P> <P> "(The Redskins) had us reeling," 49er linebacker Millen said in a reference to  Rypien's numerous long drives. "But on the big plays, we had just the right  (defensive) calls from the bench."  </P> <P> It was a game in which Montana had the 49ers ahead in the first quarter, 3-0;  in the second, 10-0; at halftime, 20-10; after three quarters, 23-13; and early  in the fourth, 26-13.  </P> <P> Second-quarter 49er touchdown drives of 67 and 80 yards were followed before  halftime by the longest scoring drive of the game, Rypien's. It lasted 83 yards  and ended with a 35-yard pass to Monk in the end zone on fourth and six.  </P> <P> Rypien and the other offensive players were walking off the field after a  third-down incompletion when Gibbs waved them back in to go for it on fourth  down.  </P> <P> Montana's touchdown passes were thrown to Rice for 12 yards and to Taylor for  49. Rice was running a slant pattern in front of Redskin cornerback Darrell  Green when Montana hit him in the end zone.  </P> <P> Taylor was running down the left sideline -- with the other 49ers massed right  -- when Montana's pass reached him after he had raced past a single-covering  Redskin cornerback, Martin Mayhew. It was a 20-yard pass followed by a 29-yard  sprint.  </P> <P> On Montana's only interception, Rice was waiting for the ball instead of  fighting for it when Green stepped in front of him and took it away.  </P> <P> It could have been a serious mistake, but not Sunday. The Redskins aren't yet  ready to play on even terms with the 49ers -- or with the Rams.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Geronin and </F> Vladimir Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin of  Russia and President Kim Yong-sam proclaimed that "relations  between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea develop  into a constructive mutually complementary partnership based on  the common values of freedom, democracy, legality, respect for  human rights and a market economy," said a joint Russo-South  Korean joint declaration which the two presidents signed at the  close of summit talks held in the Kremlin on Thursday.    The two presidents agreed that success of political and  economic reforms in Russia would be a substantial factor of  peace and prosperity in the world as a whole and stability in  Northeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean area, in particular", the  declaration said. Mr. Kim assured Boris Yeltsin of South Korea's  "cooperation and support for reforms which are being effected in  Russia".    The leaders of the two countries decided to give a boost to  political dialogue at various levels, including meetings between  the heads of state and government, parliamentary leaders and  cabinet ministers. They agreed to establish a "hot line"  between the Kremlin in Moscow and the Blue House in Seoul to  maintain close contacts between the heads of two states.    The two sides agreed to make joint efforts to combine  Russia's high technologies with the introduction and industrial  resources of the Republic of Korea and encourage investments in  co-development of the natural resources of the Russian  Federation. They came out in support of direct business  contacts between the Russian Far East and the Republic of Korea.    The two presidents were gratified to note a steady growth of  bilateral trade and agreed to further efforts to strengthen  legal and organisational principles in such spheres as  transport, customs, and industrial standards to promote  bilateral trade and investments.    Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Kim agreed on close cooperation  between  the two states in tackling global issues. They highly  appreciated possibilities for dynamic growth in the Asia-Pacific  region and agreed to join hands to make it a region of peace and  prosperity.    Mr. Kim welcomed Russia's aspiration actively and  constructively participate in all areas of Pacific Rim  cooperation and pointed out that the Republic of Korea would  positivly consider Russia's candidacy for Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum membership.    The two presidents "called on the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea as a party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation  of Nuclear Weapons strictly and consistently fulfil its  obligations under the treaty and as regards inspection under the  safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Boris Yeltsin, the declaration said, "reaffirmed that  Russia,  alongside other states, will continue actively to participate in  the international community efforts to ensure denuclearisation  of the Korean Peninsula".    President Kim Yong-sam, for his part, "gave a high appraisal  of Russia's proposal to convene a multilateral conference on  security and non-nuclear status of the Korean Peninsula."    The two leaders agreed that "any attempt to produce nuclear  weapons on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat to peace  and security not only in Korea but in Northeast Asia and and the  whole world as well". They agreed to hold bilateral  consultations on matters of security in Northeast Asia.    The two presidents "pointed out the need for a continuation  of the dialogue between South and North Korea to ease tension,  to strenthen peace, security and stability, and agreed that the  unification of Korea should be achieved in a peaceful and  democratic way, through a direct dialogue between the two sides."</p>

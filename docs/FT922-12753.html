			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Sales fall 29% at LA Gear LA GEAR, the embattled US athletic shoe and apparel maker, is once more in technical default of its bank credit facilities after posting a first-quarter loss. In the first three months of 1992, the company suffered a loss from continuing operations of Dollars 6.3m or 32 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 11.1m or 56 cents a year earlier. The net loss in the latest quarter was Dollars 8.2m or 42 cents, compared with Dollars 12.5m or 63 cents in the 1991 quarter, which included a loss of Dollars 1.4m or 7 cents from discontinued operations. Net sales fell 29.5 per cent to Dollars 109.6m from Dollars 155.3m a year ago. Mr Mark Goldston, chief operating officer, blamed the falling sales on a drop in the number of shoes sold worldwide and lower average selling prices. 'A substantial part of the volume decrease occurred in the domestic market as a result of increased competition and continued weak demand from department store and athletic footwear store customers,' he added. LA Gear has been in the throes of reorganisation since it posted its first loss in the fourth quarter of 1990. Last May, the company had agreed to sell a 30 per cent stake to Trefoil Capital Investors, a fund led by Mr Roy Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney and vice-chairman of the entertainment company. Trefoil is believed to have pressed for the resignation of Mr Robert Greenberg, LA Gear's founder, chairman and chief executive, who was replaced earlier this year by Mr Stanley Gold, Trefoil's managing director. Trefoil's role in LA Gear is expected to increase as a result of the latest default. The company said it did not expect to be able to satisfy the conditions attached to the payment of preferred stock dividends at any time during fiscal 1992. As a result, Trefoil would have the right to elect additional directors and would have the exclusive right to elect a majority of the company's board of directors at the end of August. On Wall Street, shares in LA Gear closed down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12 5/8 . Wall Street analysts had expected a first-quarter loss.</p>

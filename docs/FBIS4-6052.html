			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu voiced optimism Sunday [17 April] on  settling the North Korean nuclear dispute.    Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy  Agency (IAEA) are likely to go well, Han told reporters in  Brussels, where he presided over an annual meeting of Korean  envoys serving in Europe.    The North's reaction cannot but be limited, particularly  since China is urging acceptance of nuclear inspections, he  noted.    The foreign minister reiterated that Seoul will keep  dialogue  channels open with Pyongyang to prevent the nuclear issue from  entering a critical phase.    He added that the inter-Korean envoy exchange was withdrawn  as a precondition to further Pyongyang-Washington talks for that  very reason.    In his opening address at the envoy meeting, Han said Seoul  will draw up proper environmental, labor and economic policies  to work within the World Trade Organization after the Uruguay  Round's conclusion.</p>

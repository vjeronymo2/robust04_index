			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure Blacks Leisure Group, the camping, sports and fashion group, lapsed back into the red at the half year stage. Although still in the black at the operating line with profits of Pounds 339,000 (Pounds 499,000 from continuing operations), interest charges and a Pounds 95,000 provision for reorganisation pushed the group into a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 53,000 in the six months to August 27, against profits of Pounds 638,000. Nevertheless, Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, was reasonably upbeat on prospects: 'I do not believe the results fully reflect the progress made in the last six months,' he said. Accordingly, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p; losses per share were 0.62p (earnings of 1.86p). However, the second half had started well, Mr Bentley said. New stores had opened in Chester and Glasgow with others set to open in Worcester and Kingston by the year-end. The shares fell 3p to 31p, valuing the company at just under Pounds 10m.</p>

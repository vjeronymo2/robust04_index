			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNDS FOR 'GENETIC FINGERPRINTING'  </P> <P> In a letter to the editor a few weeks ago, I voiced my concern about the  apparent non-use of DNA "genetic fingerprinting" in Orange County. I asked if  someone could tell me why it was not being used here. I assumed this would be  just a rhetorical question.  </P> <P> To my surprise, the next day I received a telephone call from Larry Ragle,  director of forensic science in the county. He assured me that, indeed, genetic  fingerprinting was very much in the forefront of the collective forensic minds  here and that the obstacle is funding for equipment and analysts to handle the  test results. He invited me to a Sheriff's Advisory Council reception for the  business people of our community to hear more about it. What I learned about  genetic fingerprinting was very interesting, but what I valued most was seeing  the dedication of our law community officials to this cause.  </P> <P> The benefits of this forensic tool would save Orange County taxpayers millions  of dollars to say nothing of the absolute proof of guilt it could establish in  court. I am appalled that today, with crime out of control and the courts  inundated with cases, these officials must go to private citizens with hats in  hand to solicit $200,000 that the county should be providing for this important  work. I urge the Board of Supervisors to take another look at their priorities.  </P> <P> DIXIE MITCHELL  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES, SALAZAR KICK AWAY GAME TO METS IN NINTH, 2-1  </P> <P> The ball hit the grass in front of Luis Salazar's glove, then bounced off the  tip of the glove. Then it spun and hopped and rolled and didn't stop until it  had knocked the Padres into a cold and unfamiliar place.  </P> <P> Last place.  </P> <P> In a fitting end to yet another game of blown chances, Salazar booted rookie  Mark Carreon's double play grounder with the bases loaded and one out in the  ninth inning Sunday to allow Keith Hernandez to score from third base and give  the New York Mets a 2-1 victory in front of 35,547 at Shea Stadium.  </P> <P> This morning the Padres will slowly climb out of bed and rub their aching  hitting, and fielding, and baserunning. Then, when they glance at a newspaper,  they will want to rub their eyes.  </P> <P> As the losers of five of six games on this current trip, they have fallen to  18-21 and into last place in the National League West for the first time since  the second day this season and for only the fourth time since Jack McKeon took  over as manager last May 28.  </P> <P> "Right now, we'll take a win any way we can get it, any time, any place, any  how," said Jack Clark, who went zero for four and now is in a two-for-28 slide  since hitting his last homer May 2 against St. Louis. "Some of these games . .  . they are the kind that really hurt because we know we can win them, and  don't."  </P> <P> Remember that this was the same team that began the season as pennant  favorites. The same team that won five of its first eight games to bolt into  first place.  </P> <P> But since then, they have won only 13 of 31 and are suddenly four games behind  first-place Cincinnati with every other team in the division separating them.  </P> <P> And suddenly, as Sunday's three hours here would indicate, everything is going  wrong. Even when things go right. Especially when things go right.  </P> <P> "It's the kind of loss," pitcher Dennis Rasmussen said, "where we're sitting  over here kicking ourselves."  </P> <P> One kick is needed for the offense, as the Padres had two blown sacrifice bunts  that could have led to runs on a day the teams combined to leave 24 men on  base.  </P> <P> Another kick is needed for the baserunning, which ended a first-inning rally  and then killed a possible game-winning rally in the ninth. Tony Gwynn ended  the first inning with the go-ahead run on third base by being thrown out  attempting to steal second.  </P> <P> And then there was the bottom of the ninth, an inning requiring not just a kick  but a couple of good slaps.  </P> <P> Reliever Dave Leiper, who had escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, allowed  a leadoff ground-ball single to Howard Johnson, who just beat shortstop  Salazar's throw to first. Hernandez then ripped a line drive down the  right-field line for a double. Johnson was sent home on the hit, but Roberto  Alomar took the good relay from right fielder Bip Roberts and threw Johnson out  at the plate on a nice diving tag by catcher Mark Parent.  </P> <P> Great play, right? "But it didn't mean anything," Parent noted glumly.  </P> <P> How true. With Hernandez on third after the throw, the Padres intentionally  walked both Kevin McReynolds and Greg Jefferies to set up a force play at home  plate with Carreon hitting. There was also the chance of getting a double play  grounder, but because Carreon runs well, McKeon pulled the infield in on the  grass, hoping to start any double play with a throw home.  </P> <P> "We had to get the guy at home first," McKeon said. "We were not thinking about  going around the horn on the double play, because it was the guy going home who  would have beat us."  </P> <P> As the Padres and McKeon's luck would have it, Salazar might have handled the  next play easier if he were playing back.  </P> <P> Facing a two-and-two count, Carreon fought off a curveball and bounced it  toward Salazar. Funny, but it was just what Salazar, and pitcher Leiper, had  hoped for.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get a ground ball, and I wanted it at the shortstop, and that's  what we got," Leiper said.  </P> <P> Only, it wasn't what Salazar got. The ball suddenly took a quick hop at  Salazar's feet and bounced off his glove and trickled back toward left field.  Hernandez could have scored while running on his hands.  </P> <P> All of which made for a bad ending to an otherwise proficient day for Salazar,  who was making his first start at shortstop this year because Garry Templeton  needed a rest because of a sore left knee. Before the ninth, Salazar had made  only good fielding plays and even knocked in the Padres' only run with a  looping double to left field in the fourth off Mets starter Bob Ojeda.  </P> <P> "I made all the plays . . . but one," said Salazar. "I can't explain it. I  don't know how I missed it. It was the easiest ball hit to me all day. It was  hit right at me . . . the perfect double play ball. It was the strangest way to  make an error.  </P> <P> "I'm still wondering, why do I do that? How does that happen?"  </P> <P> Rationalized McKeon: "Hey, it could have been the ninth inning or the first  inning. It was just spinning, he was trying to get the guy at the plate with  it, and it kicked off his glove. That stuff happens."  </P> <P> What happened in the top of the ninth with the score tied 1-1, now that doesn't  always happen. With eventual winner Roger McDowell pitching, Randy Ready led  off the ninth by drawing a walk. Given the task of bunting Ready to second,  Parent failed miserably. The bunt bounced almost directly to McDowell, who  threw to shortstop Kevin Elster for the start of a double play.  </P> <P> Marvell Wynne followed with a single that would have scored the run from  second. It was almost a carbon copy of the third inning when, with the Padres  trailing, 1-0, Rasmussen faced the same situation with Parent on first. He also  bunted terribly, forcing Parent at second. Gwynn followed with a single that  would have scored Parent.  </P> <P> "I make the bunt, maybe we win," Parent said. "I have got to get that bunt  down. I'm not executing, none of us are executing."  </P> <P> The Padres still had a chance to salvage that ninth when, after Wynne's single,  Gwynn followed with a line drive to right to move Wynne to third and bring up  Roberts.  </P> <P> But Roberts never got a chance. On a three-and-one fastball, Gwynn took off for  second and was thrown out by catcher Barry Lyons, even though Gwynn claimed he  was safe, and jumped around second base in front of umpire Jerry Crawford to  illustrate that point.  </P> <P> "You never see me jumping like that, so you know I was safe," Gwynn said. "I  slid outside (Elster's) tag, he never got me."  </P> <P> But with his run perhaps meaningless anyway, and with two out, why steal in the  first place?  </P> <P> "It's what we've been doing all year, it's been working," said Gwynn, who  entered Sunday as the National League leader with 14 stolen bases, although he  had been caught four times. "I figured, they weren't looking at me, so why not  go for it? And I had it beat, too."  </P> <P> But today all the Padres have is last place. All to themselves. And no answer  is the right one.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Ali Feyz: "Foreign Debts"] </F>   [Text] Remarks concerning foreign debts are so vague and  sometimes so contradictory that a clear picture of what the  situation is like cannot be obtained. Figures that have neither  been officially confirmed nor refuted show that we have a  foreign debt of about $30 billion and that officials believe  that this amount is not so great as to spark any concerns,  especially when the Central Bank has been so unprecedentedly  successful--allegedly--in being able to arrange for the  repayment of these loans in installments. And according to  officials, all this has been achieved despite the obstructionism  of America in its opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran.    As to the interest rate on this debt and to what amount from  the national wealth will ultimately be paid in interest is  something nobody is ready to comment on. But judging from the  nature of credit organizations or of Western companies, one can  conclude that these installment payments will not be free of  charge.    Nevertheless, the most interesting remarks on this came from  Dr. Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli [Central Bank governor] who claimed  that Iran's debts will be $18 billion by the year 2006. In  order to better understand this point, we should first point out  that it is now 1994 or, in other words, the last decade of the  20th century and that Mr. 'Adeli is therefore talking about 12  years from now or the first decade of the 21st century.    Of course there is no doubt that it is our problem that we  do  not understand which policies we should adopt in order to solve  our debt problem. But, at any rate, policies are not that clear  for the man in the street to understand. Thus, instead of  considering the Central Bank governor's remarks that our foreign  debts will be limited by the year 2006 as a promising sign, we  see, on the contrary, that despite the previous promises by the  officials who claimed that with the adoption of contraction  policies, loans would be quickly repaid, we should not expect  our debts to smooth out. If the Central Bank can truly limit  the foreign debt to $18 billion as stated by Dr. 'Adeli, then  the Iranian nation should be thankful. But what we are worried  about is that the volume of debts will increase while our  foreign exchange income will not reach a favorable level that  will allow us to limit our debts, especially when it is not  clear what interest will be added to these debts.    Another important point is that our foreign exchange  policies  are not based on comprehensive planning that covers the other  sectors of the economy as well. And based on this, one cannot  be very optimistic. Nevertheless, the bad experience that we  have concerning foreign debts shows that this is an experience  that should not be repeated. Explaining the reasons and  answering the question on why we have foreign debts or even  telling us that these expenditures were for infrastructure  projects that will yield fruit in the future are not enough to  convince the people why we should have amassed debts in the  first place. Our culture, based on its history, considers  borrowing--for whatever reason--a weakness, and it will not  easily accept the fact that we have debts to repay.    At any rate, we will be lucky if our debts are limited to  $18  billion until 2006 as has been stated by Mr. 'Adeli. But what  we should be afraid of is that we gullibly sit back and not  realize that an important part of our national income is being  devoured by debts. Many of the countries that have debts today  did not realize when they received the loans that one day they  would be unable to repay them. Moreover, is it really wise for  us to spend our replaceable national resources which are the  backing for our world credibility for areas the returns of which  are doubtful? The answers to these questions should be given by  those who compile our country's fiscal policies. But, at any  rate, these are the questions that exist, and we should not turn  a deaf ear to them.</p>

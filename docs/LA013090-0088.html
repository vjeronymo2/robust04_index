			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: BUCKING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM -- SOME HOLLYWOOD SUCCESS STORIES  </P> <P> Hollywood often appears to guide itself exclusively on conventional wisdom, an  amalgam of "If it worked before, try it again," "If if works, don't fix it" and  (as Adlai Stevenson once described Republican policies), "Try anything, but  never for the first time."  </P> <P> The operating principles of Hollywood wisdom include Action in Summer, Feelies  in Fall, Biggies at Christmas and Happy Endings Anytime. But the conventionally  wise are going to have a tough time fitting 1989 into the comforting patterns  of the past.  </P> <P> In the films that are certain to be prime Academy Award contenders: one ends  with everyone you cared about killed in battle; in another, the heroine is at  last having to be spoon-fed in a nursing home; in another, the beautiful young  heroine dies after childbirth; in another, the handsome young hero ends as a  paraplegic in a wheelchair; yet another centers on a teen-age suicide and the  dismissal in disgrace of a charismatic teacher.  </P> <P> The list can be extended easily, to a protagonist who is an almost totally  crippled cerebral palsy victim, to a marital comedy so dark and lethal you  almost need a flashlight to see the screen.  </P> <P> The conventionally wise might say that, ah, well, there are always tough films,  but they never make money. The surprise (heartening to anyone who cares about  the state of the movies) is that all these tragedy-toned films are doing or  have done very well at the box office -- better than some starry attractions  ("We're No Angels," "Family Business") that had little on their minds but what  is known in the trade as sheer entertainment.  </P> <P> It may be that there will have to be a new commandment on the tablet of  conventional wisdom: Try a little bravery; it couldn't hurt.  </P> <P> In truth, the offerings have not been revolutionary. One piece of conventional  wisdom that has not been overturned is that audiences don't mind and may  welcome a good cry; it's that they don't like to go away depressed or convinced  that the world is beyond redemption.  </P> <P> The slaughter at Fort Wagner, S.C., that concludes "Glory" is at least as  compelling a statement about and against war as "All Quiet on the Western  Front." But the film, directed by Edward Zwick and written by Kevin Jarre, also  illuminates an important piece of American history: the creation and the brief,  valiant exploits of the first black regiment in the Civil War.  </P> <P> It is a rich human drama that carries the reverberating truth of history and as  an act of film making it is amazing in its scope and smoky realism. The Civil  War battles, as they were fought, have never been so well depicted on screen.  </P> <P> "Born on the Fourth of July," regarded as the short-odds favorite in the Oscar  sweepstakes, is another piece of American history, recreating Ron Kovic's life  from gung-ho Marine to embittered paraplegic fighting against the war, and  echoing the larger national turmoil about Vietnam. Its scenes of battle, of a  rat-infested VA hospital, of family divisions and private anguish, are brutal  and uncompromised, but ultimately there is a cleansing and triumphant uplift.  </P> <P> The Irish-made "My Left Foot" succeeds on the power of Daniel Day-Lewis's  portrayal of Christy Brown, the severely crippled cerebral palsy victim who by  force of will became a poet, painter and novelist. The later years were sad for  both Brown and the woman he married. But the film leaves him at the peak of his  triumphant happiness and it's the possibility of hope that the audience carries  away.  </P> <P> "Steel Magnolias" and "Driving Miss Daisy," both expert middle-class comedies  drawn from successful plays, were nevertheless daring in the eyes of  conventional thinking: the former virtually an all-women's film with the men as  ciphers on the fringe and with a tragic death as its centerpiece. The latter  watches an elderly Jewish widow and an elderly black widower grow older. Not,  you'd have said, sure-fire stuff despite the play's success and not, as it  turned out, a cinch to get financed.  </P> <P> But at the heart of both films is sharp and sympathetic observation of loving  relationships. The authors, Robert Harling of "Magnolias" and Alfred Uhry of  "Miss Daisy," obviously evoked responses in their audiences in matters of  parenthood, tolerance and compassion. And the performances, directed by Herbert  Ross and Bruce Beresford, respectively, are smashing.  </P> <P> "Dead Poets Society" defied the wisdom on summer fare, as being about school,  literature, frustration and suicide. Not a car crash in sight. It was not that  great a risk, in retrospect, with Robin Williams as its star and a theme --  young people in contention with their elders -- certain to appeal to young  audiences. And, as written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir, it is a  first-rate film. But the early summer opening defied that old devil  conventional wisdom, raising again the treasonable thought that decisions may  be conventional but not necessarily wise.  </P> <P> "War of the Roses" is unrelenting in its cynical view of marriage, no last-reel  forgivenesses, a defiance of the film proprieties. It divides viewers sharply  between love and hate, but presumably there are enough customers who've had  searing matrimonial experiences to make the Danny DeVito film written by  Michael Leeson from a novel by Warren Adler a hit.  </P> <P> There seems finally no substitute for a nice, healthy defiance of the rules,  and for following a particular passion to get a film written, cast and made as  passion would have it. The year's best films -- "Glory," "Born on the Fourth of  July" and "My Left Foot" high among them -- play as works of passion, not  calculation, conventional wisdoms thankfully ignored.  </P></p>

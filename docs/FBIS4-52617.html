			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan opposes moves by  Russia to join the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers, a  senior Finance Ministry official said Thursday [12 May]. The  official, who requested anonymity, said, "It is difficult for  both donors and a recipient nation like Russia to sit at the  same table."    The official was responding to a news report that said  President Boris Yeltsin hoped Russia will be allowed to join the  G-7 group of industrialized nations. He made the remarks at a  news conference with [the] German chancellor in Bonn.    "Japan expects Russia to play a big role in resolving the  Bosnia issue. Yeltsin seems to be pandering to domestic  considerations in trying to show that Russia is a strong country  and a big power," the finance official said.</p>

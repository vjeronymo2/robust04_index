			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Smits: "`Purple' Coalition Will Demand </F> Sacrifices From People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in  Particular"]    [Text] A "purple" coalition involving the PvdA [Labor  Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and  the D66 [Democrats 66], possibly supplemented by the GroenLinks  [Green Left], could become stuck on their respective views about  the future of social security. Nevertheless, as if the  elections have already been concluded, open negotiations are now  taking place to reconcile the extreme positions.  Hans Van Mierlo, D66 leader, sees great chances for success if  all the parties are simply willing to compromise. He is asking  a lot, because the various positions, as they stand in the  electoral platforms, are far apart.    One point which stands out is the VVD's desire to introduce  a  basic system. That would mean that all social security benefits  apart from the AOW [General Pensions Law] would be reduced to 60  percent of the minimum wage. The D66 wants the partial  abolition of the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The Green Left  wants to increase minimum social security benefits and the WAO  by 10 percent. Even if this radical party is excluded from a  "purple" coalition, the PvdA remains a stumbling block because  it wants to leave the WAO untouched.    However, anyone who wanted to pin a party down to its  electoral platform promises would be naive. The programs are  written to make differences clear to voters. They say less  about what a party is willing to sacrifice of its own ideals, if  it is able to realize part of its program by taking part in  government.    There is also agreement on some points. For example the VVD,  the D66, the PvdA, and the Green Left all want a sharper  selection procedure in allocating social security. The Green  Left and the D66 want to abolish the WAO for people partially  incapacitated for work on the assumption that they will continue  to work for their company. The VVD wants to abolish the WAO for  people who have not had five years of paid work.    The D66, the PvdA, and the VVD want stricter WW  [Unemployment  Law] criteria. The PvdA wants to abolish the WW for unemployed  people who were employed for a short time only. The VVD and the  D66 want no WW for people who resign of their own accord or  refuse suitable work.    It appears that all four would also be able to quickly reach  agreement about the Sickness Insurance Act. The D66, the VVD,  and the Green Left favor the abolition of the Act, subject to  the condition that employers are obliged to pay part of the  wages of their sick employees. The PvdA has said nothing about  this point, therefore has not said it is against it.    The VVD's wish to reduce all social security benefits for  new  cases to 60 percent of the minimum wage appears to be the big  problem in the formation of a "purple" cabinet. That is 1,029  guilders per month. For an average employee who is made  redundant or becomes unable to work, that would mean halving his  current social security benefit.    The VVD also understands that things cannot suddenly change  just like that. The party is assuming that every employee will  take out additional private insurance. Employees themselves  will decide the size of their premiums and the extent of their  security.    Officially, the D66 and the PvdA see little in this  additional insurance system. It encroaches on solidarity, among  other reasons because private insurers will not accept providing  additional insurance to all employees. Nevertheless the D66 and  even the PvdA are calling for more freedom of individual choice  within the social security system. In addition, last year the  PvdA agreed on a reduction in WAO benefits with the argument  that employees could take out additional insurance.    It is generally recognized that it is difficult for  employees  to insure themselves against the financial consequences of  redundancy. In order to be completely sure, the PvdA recently  made enquiries at private insurers. They all said that the risk  of redundancy was too uncertain and extremely expensive in times  of increasing unemployment. But it does not all have to come  from insurers. Employers already tend to supplement the WW  payments of redundant employees.    It will be the VVD in particular which will have to swallow  its own wishes in the formation of a "purple" coalition.</p>

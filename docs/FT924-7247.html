			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (9): It's all a matter of will - Known techniques can bring big rewards EVER since the UK's Energy Efficiency Office was set up just prior to the 1983 election, there has been a recurring theme concerning the potential savings that can be achieved by following the advice it proffers. A succession of energy and environment ministers - and, for that matter, two Prime Ministers - have gone on record, stating that the use of cost-effective technology and techniques could cut existing bills 'by at least 20 per cent'. During this period only the relevant savings figures have altered. In 1983, the UK spent Pounds 35bn per year on fuel; knocking 20 per cent off that figure would have saved Pounds 7bn each year. In 1992 ministers now put the total UK energy bill at Pounds 50bn - and the concomitant saving at Pounds 10bn. Such savings each year from fuel bills could then be spent on other goods and services. The economy would benefit from the increased cash flow, jobs would be generated by the extra spending, and the capital expenditure would be recouped - but in how long? In its evidence prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (which itself did much of the groundwork for this summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro) the Government estimated in detail what could be achieved 'if consumers were to take up the easily attainable and economically attractive opportunities that are available'. It later published this work (through the Stationery Office as Energy Paper 58). The truth is that this 20 per cent savings figure is predicated on the use of well-established techniques rather than new technologies. These primarily are 'good housekeeping' (eg mending broken windows, servicing vehicles, closing doors) and 'monitoring and targeting' of performance (eg logging fuel bills). Beyond that are 'retrofit investments with a payback period of around two years'. The technologies which have qualified for inclusion within the basic two year payback period have varied over the years, according to the price of fuels. But given the tightness of the requirement, they are currently relatively few: draughtproofing, compact fluorescent lightbulbs, some insulation, some thermostatic controls, a few industrial motors. However, the Government report does acknowledge that the potential savings are very different, if alternative qualifying criteria are used. If investments with a five year payback period were permissible; if the best available economic techniques were always deployed (the BATNEEC principle); if energy efficiency was automatically the primary consideration - then the cumulative saving potential would be very different. Most tellingly, the Government researchers urged that allowance should be made for further developments in the effectiveness of various energy-saving techniques, across the 15-year period under consideration. Putting all these criteria together the cumulative savings potential on the current energy bill becomes not 20 per cent, but 60 per cent of current levels. There is little doubt that, of the new measures which tripled this figure, the one most likely to deliver is the development of new energy-saving technologies. Or, more likely, the streamlining of many existing technologies to make them even more effective. In practice, it is the only one the market-place is likely to welcome without some external stimuli - such as tougher standards or offering taxbreaks or grants to shorten five-year payback periods. Even so, there are many examples of energy saving techniques and technologies which are not installed or used, despite their apparent economic sense. That has been one of the main motivations behind the European Commission's THERMIE scheme. It is specifically intended to promote the rapid implementation of the best new energy technologies. As such, it can play a critical role in improving energy conservation and the use of renewable energies. Between 1975 and 1992, the UK received support of Pounds 218m (Ecu312m) from THERMIE and its predecessor programmes. For both hydrocarbons and solid fuel research, the UK received easily its fair share of resources. But Britain has not done so well for funds from energy saving, or for renewable energy; it obtained only 12 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the budget, although its fair share is closer to 18 per cent. For 1993, THERMIE is due to enter a new phase. Increasingly, it will concentrate upon technologies designed to reduce environmental damaging emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Over recent months many other schemes designed by the EC to assist energy saving have been decimated. The wide-ranging legislative programme intended to upgrade energy efficiency standards, under the SAVE banner, has effectively become voluntary - and is thus likely to prove far less effective in reducing energy consumption, and hence carbon emissions. Legislation which has been approved, (like that on domestic gas boilers), will effectively deliver only one-third of the emissions savings originally identified. The ALTENER scheme for renewables is far less ambitious than originally projected. Which makes the success of the THERMIE programme all the more important. A budget of Pounds 250m (Ecu350m) has been allocated by the EC to THERMIE for 1993 and 1994 alone. Bids for 1993 have to be submitted by December 1, 1992. To alert British businesses of this opportunity to the potential, the Department of Trade and Industry has been mounting a series of briefing seminars around the country. The DTI official in charge, David Irving, says: 'We would like to see even better results in the current THERMIE round. But that depends in the first instance on British industry coming up with good ideas.' There is undoubtedly an enormous potential market, not just in Britain but throughout Europe, for energy conservation equipment. Mr Irving's boss, Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, has identified a Pounds 230bn market across the EC alone for technologies intended to combat global warming. It is a market for which the main economic powerhouses - Germany, Japan, America - have all set up specific programmes intended to gain a substantial slice of the action. But Britain's market for energy efficiency equipment has recently been sliding backwards, not forwards. Investment levels are down 28 per cent in two years. The potential, however, remains enormous. So great as even to dwarf the 20 per cent reduction target set way back in 1983, and which is still far from being achieved.

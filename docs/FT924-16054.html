			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (9): When push comes to shove - Scotland SCOTLAND'S five new towns are not going to go quietly. Their key role in economic development distinguishes them from their English counterparts and has made phasing them out a difficult task for the Scottish Office. East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston, Glenrothes and Irvine have been instrumental in the industrial transformation of Scotland. They have been the magnet for inward investment providing professional, centralised and comprehensive handling for relocations particularly in the high technology industries which have replaced some of the heavy industries which have died away. The government has wanted to absorb the five new towns in its restructuring of industrial promotion in Scotland. But the industrial culture, as well as the physical property, of the five is proving hard to swallow and the government's initial enthusiasm for the idea seems to have waned. What is more, the new town Development Corporations themselves have made it quite clear that theirs is a difficult act to follow especially if the towns' role in promotion is to be taken up by the private sector as planned. 'It is a strange concept that we are to disappear without trace and no-one is to notice that we have gone,' says Mr Martin Cracknell, chief executive of Glenrothes in Fife. 'It is difficult to see how others could do our work. We do things here that are not commercial and which would not get done if commercial forces were left to handle it.' Among the new Development Corporations is a feeling that the expertise they have collected may be wasted and that the government is re-inventing the wheel in hoping that this know-how can easily be picked up by the network of new Local Enterprise Companies. The LECs are private organisations with public sector funding and are part of Scottish Enterprise, the de-centralised successor to the Scottish Development Agency. The readiness of the LECs to take the residual assets of the Development Corporations seems mixed and many are fully stretched already coming to grips with their remit to encourage local enterprise. In its white paper The Scottish New Towns: The Way Forward published in 1989, the Scottish Office floated the idea of management buy-outs for the teams running the new towns. 'A development company set up through the management buy-out option would allow invaluable experience of the staff to be retained and more widely applied in the private sector,' it said. This idea appears to have become partially unstuck over the disposal of the considerable assets of the new towns. In May, the Herald newspaper in Glasgow got hold of new Scottish Office guidelines issued to the new towns which ordered them to 'maximise disposal receipts' for land and property. This would make it nearly impossible for a management buy-out to be sympathetically considered by government because a new town management might not be able to produce the best price for its land and buildings. Possible conflicts of interest might also arise as the new towns would be selling their own property. There is a feeling among new town executives that the government is demonstrating how much intense scrutiny it faces over the disposal of public assets and that the Scottish Office has gone off any sell off that would not get the best price. The new Scottish Office guidelines, issued just before the General Election, say that the appropriate asset base for any one taking on where the new towns left off would be a portfolio made up largely of development land and part-developed estates. This effectively leaves the present new town management with the option of selling themselves as largely service companies or consultants to the Local Enterprise Companies. Corporation staffs will be cut from several hundred to possibly under 20. The Herald disclosure has already provoked anger in the opposition Labour Party. Mr Alex Smith, a Scottish Euro MP, has demanded that before any new town assets could go to the Treasury the European Commission would have to be repaid for any development it backed in the new towns. The matter has more time to stew for some of the new towns than others. Last February the Scottish Office issued the winding-up date for the five new towns. East Kilbride and Glenrothes are to go on December 31, 1995; Cumbernauld on December 31 1996, Livingston on December 31 1998 and Irvine on December 1999. 'We are lucky that everyone has until 1998 to consider the implications,' says Mr James Pollock, chief executive of Livingston Development Corporation. Livingston has more undeveloped land than the older new towns and could fit in with the revised government thinking. 'The new towns have been successful in their ability to work in a local area. We have a total team package able to focus on specific areas needing regeneration,' Mr Pollock adds. Livingston has been successful in attracting inward investment in Scotland. It now has more than 400 resident companies and 42 per cent of these are in manufacturing. Mr John Shaw, the managing director of East Kilbride, warned that Pounds 100m of public and private investment will be withdrawn from his Lanarkshire area in the wind-up. 'I would very much like to see new systems credibly in operation before the new towns are dissolved. It would be a tragedy if this experience is lost to Scotland,' he says. East Kilbride started in 1947 with a population of 2,000 and now has 670,000 inhabitants. It was first set up to relieve congestion in nearby Glasgow and created 32,000 jobs. East Kilbride has returned an operating profit for the past 23 years and created assets worth Pounds 220m. Mr Shaw's administration approaches wind-up without any debt to hand on to his successors. 'The more difficult and worrying task for the future is to ensure that the domestic and international business built up in the new towns is sustained and developed,' he says. 'Scottish new towns have been the most consistently successful urban development initiative of the post-war era in any country in Europe. All of them are committed to Scotland and to support local economy where we live and work. We hope very much that we have the opportunity to contribute to those areas following the wind-up.'</p>

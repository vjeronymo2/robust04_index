			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Colour that drove Elvis's mum wild - The fickle love affairs between the commercial world and an often shocking pink THERE is a scene in Funny Face, Stanley Donen's 1950s musical, where Miss Prescott, the indomitable editor of Quality magazine, is searching for a new theme. Suddenly she finds it. 'Here it is,' she exclaims. 'Here's our theme. Here's our answer - pink.' Pink according to Miss Prescott, is a panacea, not only for the editorial problems of Quality magazine but for 'women everywhere'. 'Banish the black,' she trills. 'Burn the blue and bury the beige. From now on girls, think pink.' And she is not alone in her Panglossian view of pink. It almost always conjures up positive images. Anyone who is 'in the pink', is at the peak of health. A 'rose-tinted' view is invariably optimistic. The French call happiness la vie en rose. 'Pink is a joyful colour,' says Christian Lacroix, the Paris fashion designer who has used it in several collections. It is these connotations that some companies have tried to harness. Lacroix packaged his perfume C'Est La Vie] in pink to evoke 'a zest for life'. Ten years ago James Dyson, the British industrial designer plumped for pink as the colour of his new product - a vacuum cleaner. 'Pink had shock value,' he says. 'At the time no one had used pastel shades or Hollywood colours for electronic products. My vacuum cleaner was a heavy piece of technology. I liked the idea of juxtaposing the serious aspects of the machine with a friendly, feminine colour.' Cadillac adopted the same strategy when marketing its pink models as symbols of all-American success in the 1950s. The pink Cadillac became the essential accessory for blue-collar boys-made-good. Elvis Presley even gave a 1955 pink Cadillac Sedan de Ville to his mother, Gladys. Sugar Ray Robinson travelled across the country in his favourite flamingo pink Cadillac complete with his valet, barber, golf partner, midget jester and at least 50 pieces of luggage. But, as even its devotees agree, pink is not a serious shade. It is the colour of the baby doll nighties that Hollywood starlets wore in the 1950s. In cartoons it is often used to convey frivolity. Although Lady Penelope and FAB 1, her pink Rolls-Royce, rode to the rescue of the Thunderbirds pilots, they often had to wait nail-biting minutes while she fumbled with her lipstick, or her pink powder-puff although the elegant and urbane Pink Panther did give a certain coolness to his colour. Pink has, after all, always been embroiled in the louche side of life. The chorus girls in fin de siecle music halls sipped pink champagne from their satin slippers. The cads in 1930s detective novels often downed pink gin. Pink also has links with the sex industry from the 'pink films' that swamped Japan's pornographic cinemas in the 1970s, to the Minitel-Rose sex-lines on France's interactive computer network today. Even the fickle fashion industry sees pink in a frivolous light. The designer who is most closely associated with pink, Elsa Schiaparelli, is also renowned for her gift for gimmicks. Schiaparelli was an Italian couturier working in Paris during the 1930s who invented the wide-shouldered look that dominated women's wear until the late 1940s and peppered her collections with a string of oddities including a shoe-shaped hat, edible cinnamon buttons and fabric woven with cellophane and straw. Schiaparelli also pioneered the use of shocking pink, which became her signature shade. She even called her perfume, Shocking, and asked Salvador Dali to design the bottle for it. He produced a body-shaped bottle modelled on a dress Schiaparelli made for Mae West. Perhaps it is this ephemeral air which means that pink never seems to last for long in the business world. Schiaparelli closed her fashion house in 1954, after her square shouldered pinks had been ousted by the softer shapes and sober tones of Christian Dior's New Look. Cadillac stopped producing pink cars. Gladys Presley's Sedan de Ville is now on display at the motor museum in Gracelands, her son's old home. Even the pink film has perished, killed off by the adurato, adult videos now popular among those who used to flock to Japanese porn cinemas. C'est La Vie], the pink-packaged perfume, never took off and has lost Pounds 18m in the three years since its launch. Lacroix's latest collections have moved from pink to more muted colours. 'I still love pinks, particularly fuchsia and very pale pastels, but it's less important in my work,' he says. 'It doesn't feel right any more.' James Dyson has also changed his choice of colour. His pink vacuum cleaner is still available in Japan, where it sells as a collector's item for Pounds 1,200. 'But I wouldn't work in pink today,' he says. 'It would be too roue.' This month he is introducing another new vacuum cleaner - in silver and yellow. Perhaps the most sobering story of all is that of pink champagne. Originally all champagnes were pink. Most of the grapes growing in the Champagne region are red, after all. But in 1682 the cellar master at Hautvillers Abbey, one of the largest in the area, invented a gentler form of pressing which produced white champagne from the local crop. The cellar master was Dom Perignon. His white champagnes were so successful that he transformed the finances of the Champagne region and laid the foundations for the champagne industry of today. Moet &amp; Chandon, one of the largest champagne houses, celebrated the 250th anniversary of his invention in 1932 by naming a new and exclusive champagne after him. White champagne easily outsells pink, with the latter representing less than 3 per cent of champagne sales in France and 4 per cent in the UK, although some pinks are still sought after by champagne buffs. One of the most coveted is Dom Perignon Rose, which is made in very small quantities and sells for FFr1,000 (Pounds 119) a bottle, more than twice as much as the white champagne with which the cellar master made his name. Pink champagne, like so many other pink products, has floundered in the business world. The Financial Times is an exception in having stuck successfully to pink for so long. The Sporting Times, the original 'Pink 'un', has disappeared from the news stands. Miss Prescott got it right in Funny Face. As soon as she starts singing 'Think Pink', all the other characters in the movie change into carefully co-ordinated pink clothes. But Miss Prescott has much too much sense to swallow her own editorial advice. She stays in a sedate grey and white.</p>

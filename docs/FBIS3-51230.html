"The independent central banks in all the other countries  must, under one form or another, support the general economic  policy of the country without, of course, prejudicing their  monetary independence. This is what French law says (...). This  is also what German law says and, finally, it's what the  Maastricht Treaty says."    "Likewise, communication between the executive power and the  central bank will be natural," continued Mr. Trichet, alluding  to the possible participation in council meetings--without  voting rights--of the prime minister and the minister of  economy. "In countries which are deeply attached to the  independence of the central bank, this direct communication  between the government and the monetary authority occurs  naturally and bears no prejudice against the independence of the  monetary institution which alone decides, within the law, that  is, without receiving or soliciting instructions from anyone."    "The independence of the Central Bank permits improvement of  the efficacy of price stability policy, aids the international  credibility of our money, and at the same time gives our economy  the best financial environment possible," declared Balladur  afterward. "I've always thought that the stability of prices was  a necessary, if not always a sufficient, condition for durable  growth. This stability particularly assumes the operation of an  efficacious monetary policy clearly and explicitly oriented  towards this objective," he added.    "It is credibility which now appears to be the key value,  the  condition for success (...). When there is total credibility in  the Central Bank (...) market rates (...) can progressively  eliminate (...) risk premiums (...). All countries are gradually  reaching the same conclusions on the appropriateness of central  bank independence," the prime minister concluded.    After its installation, the Monetary Policy Council, which  consists of six members, in addition to the Governor of the Bank  of France and his two vice-governors, held its first meeting,  devoted to setting the length of each councillor's term. After  drawing lots, the length of term for Jean Boissonnat and Bruno  de Maulde was set at three years, that of Denise Flouzat and  Jean-Pierre Gerard at six years, that of Michel Albert and  Michel Sapin at nine years. These are not renewable except for  the three-year terms.</p>

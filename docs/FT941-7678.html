			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain seeks to raise FFr3.6bn Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday announced a one-for-11 rights issue to raise FFr3.6bn (Dollars 616m). The new shares will be priced at FFr550, a sharp discount from the FFr674 at which trading opened yesterday. The company said the capital increase would strengthen its balance sheet and allow it to expand. However, a spokesman said that there was no specific project behind the issue. Over the past few years, the group has been seeking to reduce its debt burden. Last year, group debts were reduced to FFr15bn from FFr18.1bn, and the debt-to-equity ratio came down to 40 per cent at the end of 1993. However, the company has also been seeking to expand in new markets, with an emphasis on eastern Europe and south-east Asia. Saint Gobain said that the company's principal shareholders had agreed to subscribe to the offer, which will be managed by Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Indosuez and Lazard Freres. Shareholders will have priority rights to subscribe to the issue between March 1 and March 21. The new shares will have rights to the 1994 dividend. The group's shares fell from FFr674 to FFr662 yesterday, following the news of the rights issue. The shares have risen strongly over the past month, since the company announced better-than-expected results, of FFr1.3bn, for last year and after upbeat comments about this year's trading prospects by Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman. The rights issue is the latest in a series of capital increases by French industrial groups, including Compagnie Generale des Eaux and Lafarge Coppee. The SBF, the French stock market association, said the Paris market would be able to absorb further issues, in spite of the impact of several substantial privatisation issues.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Kwik Save rises 22% in first half AGGRESSIVE plans for expansion at Kwik Save, the discount grocery chain, were reinforced by a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. The group planned to step up its store opening programme, said Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, to one store a week over the next three years. The company said it had benefited from the extension of scanning which covers over 90 per cent of sales volumes and is expected to cover all sales by the year-end. Kwik Save is to buy back the Liquorsave concessions in its stores from Argyll Group. This will give it an additional 240 concessions in its stores to add to its 375 existing Best of Cellars outlets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud al-Zayyat from Sidon] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that the Palestinian detainee  Yasir al-Shuraydi, whose extradition is requested by the German  authorities for alleged involvement in the bombing of a  discotheque in Berlin in 1986 that killed three Americans is in  a Tyre prison on charges of attempted murder and forgery and may  face fresh charges in seven pending cases.    It has been learned that several charges against al-Suraydi  were dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, he is  expected to face further charges in several other cases and will  stand public trial later this month.    You will recall that in 1983, when al-Shuraydi lived in  Libya, Germany called on that country to extradite him. He was  later implicated in the murder of a Libyan citizen called  Mustafa al-'Ashiq. Al-Shuraydi, born in 1959 and a resident of  'Ayn al-Hulwah camp, hails from the al-Safsaf, a village in  northern Palestine.    South Public Prosecutor Justice Hatim Madi commented on the  German request for al-Shuraydi's extradition, saying: "The issue  of extradition depends on whether the legal conditions for  extradition are met. It also depends on the strength of the  case against the defendant. Following the interrogation of the  person whose extradition is requested, the Higher Court's public  prosecutor is to refer his file to the justice minister together  with a report."    Justice Madi added: "Extradition can be effected by a  cabinet decree passed upon the recommendation of the justice  minister. I do not think that there is an international  extradition treaty between Lebanon and Germany. In this case,  Articles 30 to 36 of the Lebanese penal code, governing the  extradition of criminals between countries, would apply."    Justice Madi said: "As long as an individual is facing trial  in a Lebanese court he cannot be extradited, because Lebanese  law should take precedence. If the extradition of a prisoner is  requested for a certain crime, we will not try him for that  crime, but it have to wait until he serves his prison sentence  before we look into the crime for which his extradition is  requested."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andy McSmith] </F>   [Text] Ministers have been warned that they risk bringing  300 years' worth of stored-up pollution flooding into rural  rivers if coal privatisation goes ahead without legal safeguards.    Environment experts have called for a new law forbidding the  owners of disused mines from polluting the water supply.    The water pumps are never switched off in Britain's former  coalfields because, if they were, water would flood the tunnels,  turning rivers orange, killing the fish and poisoning local  residents.    The dangers are at their worst in Durham and South Wales,  already hard hit by the post-1992 wave of pit closures. Dr Paul  Younger, lecturer in water studies at Newcastle University,  says: "There are nine pumping stations in the Wear Valley,  Durham, which cost British Coal &pound;1m a year.    "If they were switched off, 100 million litres of acid water  a day would be discharged into Durham's rivers.    "Iron's the main problem. Any microbes living off the bed of  the river would die, and about 20 to 25 per cent of the water  supply of Sunderland is in the line of fire."    Mine owners are exempt from a 1991 law which makes it  illegal  to pollute rivers. So far, the Government has only promised that  the new Coal Authority will have to give a fortnight's notice  before switching off the pumps.    Sunderland MP Chris Mullin says: "The problem is that nobody  wants to accept responsibility. The buck keeps moving around in  ever faster circles."    COPYRIGHT: THE OBSERVER LTD, 1994</p>

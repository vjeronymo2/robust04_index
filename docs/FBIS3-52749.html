And all those oil producing countries,  both within and without OPEC, that rely primarily on oil for  income are suffering and will continue to do so if they do not  devise real alternatives to oil as a source of their livelihood.    Iran is no exception to the above rule and it is suffering  just as hard both externally (debt and its servicing) and  domestically (spiralling inflation and uncertain economic  future). But there might be a difference between Iran and the  majority of other oil producing countries. The Islamic  Revolution and its republic have advocated efforts towards  reducing dependence on oil, and finding alternative to it, from  the moment of victory as the centerpiece of its economic policy.  The most important alternative, and one which the government  promoted whole-heartedly, has been to strengthen foreign trade  and enter international markets.    But the government campaign to cut reliance on oil has  remained just that, and in practice no tangible results in this  connection have been make. The reason for this failure is that  the oil income has been too readily available. In the foreign  trade, or export promotion arena, there have been some advances  but the income has been too small and the gains too partial to  be of any effect.    The reason for the government's partial success in the  foreign trade has been due to the absence of a long-run,  well-researched and integrated trade policy. And there will be  no real success unless the government relinquishes its  short-run, inconsistent, and sometimes contradictory, policies.    Oil prices have fallen and there are indications from the  international economy, and its lingering recession, that this  trend is not temporary, and that the low oil prices will not  rise in the foreseeable future. And this is where the  governments of oil producing countries, and especially Iran,  come in to make the necessary adjustments and perhaps make the  best of a bad situation. The Islamic Republic seems to be  finally ready to institute the painful and real changes and  compensate for the lost income.    How can the government do that? -- compensate for the lost  income. The immediate and the one that applies to all  situations is to cut fat, or unnecessary expenses, reduce the  size of government, or at least stop its growth, transfer over  to the private sector those tasks or responsibilities it is  unable to do effectively, institute administrative reforms to  improve efficiency, and use the available resources more  effectively, among others.    As in often the case when governments lose some projected  sources of income, the immediate alternative is to hike taxes,  and raise the price of products and services they provide. It  was disclosed by the head of Majles plan and budget commission  that the government's proposed budget bill, presented to the  Majles last week, is providing for a tax hike amounting to some  100 billion rials.    For the Islamic Government the income from tax hike is a  real  alternative just as the incomes from export promotion or tourism  can be. But the government should approach this matter  ingeniously by trying to widen and diversify its sources of  income.    When it comes to taxes or their hikes as alternative source  of income to oil, the government should be careful. Because it  is a sensitive issue and the wrong approach to it can backfire.  The existing tax collection system has often come under fire as  being weak and inappropriate. The country's present tax  apparatus is in need of a change to make it responsive to the  needs of a changing society.    Formerly the widely practiced and internationally accepted  tax paying culture had no acceptance basis, and the Iranian  people used to pay taxes reluctantly. That has changed, and  people pay taxes willingly as a part of their social  responsibility. But what people ask of the Islamic government  is to collect taxes equitably and justly. There are a lot of  people who believe the government does not need to raise taxes  or move people to higher tax brackets. What it should and can  do is improve tax collection system. The higher income as a  result of improved collection system might be beyond  government's belief. Otherwise arbitrary tax hikes lead to  inflation, which can offset the government's increased income.    In Iran a lot of people with very high incomes do not pay  taxes, or if they do what they pay comes nowhere close to the  real taxes they should be paying. Also, because the supply is  often below demand, there is no real competitive market  condition, and the general public has no choice but to buy what  it needs, the producers of goods and services are not often  afraid of tax hikes because they can always pass it down to the  consumer by raising the prices of their products or tampering  with quality. The government should devise a plan to deal with  these problems. Only then can it be sure that it has the  support of the public for what it is doing.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: S Korea instructs telecom bidders to form consortium The South Korean communications ministry has ordered competing bidders for the nation's second cellular telephone project to form a single consortium to operate the system. Foreign partners will be allowed a 20 per cent stake in the consortium, which will compete against the state-owned Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT). But the government also decided last Friday to privatise KMT. The state-supported Korea Telecom, the country's leading telecommunications operator, will reduce its 64 per cent interest in KMT to 19 per cent by selling its shares to domestic companies. The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the country's main business organisation, has been appointed to select consortium members within two months. The second cellular telephone project was announced in 1991, and the government last year held a licence bid that involved six competing Korean consortia and 11 foreign partners, including British Telecom. The licence was awarded to a consortium led by Sunkyong, the country's fifth-largest business group. Other leading contenders included Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) and Kolan, a textile group. The Sunkyong bid was supported by the UK's Vodafone, GTE of the US and Hong Kong-based Hutchison. But the government then rescinded the decision because critics charged that nepotism was involved in the selection process, since the son of the Sunkyong chairman is married to the daughter of South Korea's then-president Roh Tae-woo. Controversy may continue over the new contract award since the FKI is headed by the Sunkyong chairman, Mr Chey Jong-hyon. Analysts also believe the competing bidders may find it to difficult to co-operate on the project. If it proves impossible to form a consortium, the government will then select applicants and allot equal equity. Telecommunications companies will be barred from participating in the consortium as part of an anti-monopoly policy. An independent management team will be appointed to operate the carrier without interference from the consortium's shareholders. In privatising KMT, the government said that it would allow any one company to buy one-third of the carrier, which would give it management rights.</p>

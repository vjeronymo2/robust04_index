			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Operational Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information below further describes the operational tests needed in the identified focus areas. It is the DOT's intention to fund offers in these areas. These are listed in order of the user service numbering sequence identified in the program plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. International Border Electronic Clearance (Commercial Vehicle Electronic Clearance_User Service 4.1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An operational test is needed to evaluate strategies to facilitate the movement of commercial traffic at highway crossings along the United States-Mexico border. This test would involve the development of electronic credentials and records that could be used to automatically verify the identity of the shipper, and the nature of the cargo, check carrier safety and credential records. The purpose of this test is to extend the electronic clearance concept for State border crossings to the Mexican border and support the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). By working with Mexico, a more efficient traffic flow could be provided at border crossings and the deployment of technologies in this country could ultimately prevent overweight, unsafe, or improperly registered vehicles from entering the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The development of this test, while based on advanced technologies, will be dependent on the resolution of a number of legal, technical, and institutional issues. The test will also have to address specialized enforcement and cargo issues associated with crossing national borders. Automating the international border crossing process will require the involvement and cooperation of the immigration and customs organizations of the countries as well as shippers, carriers, local officials from the border States and provinces, and other relevant parties. While the general framework for this concept might be the same for crossings along the border, specific system designs will have to accommodate the variations in border crossing, laws, and language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOT is committed to accelerating testing activities in the area of International Border Electronic Clearance to provide early deployment successes in support of the NAFTA and other related ITS activities. Proposals submitted should reflect this commitment with realistic, aggressive time schedules and completion dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Automated Collision Notification (Emergency Notification and Personal Security_User Service 5.1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An operational test is needed to evaluate the improvements in safety and efficiency of emergency services offered by systems that provide automatic notification of automobile collisions. In automobile crashes involving life-threatening injuries, time is the most critical factor in saving lives, therefore, rapid notification and response by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel is a necessity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary goal of automatic collision notification is to reduce these times for medical assistance in those incidents involving serious injury, where the occupants of the vehicle are incapacitated and unable to notify authorities on their own.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operational test will include an in-vehicle collision notification system which would determine that a serious collision has occurred, and then automatically transmit information about the occurrence of the collision to the proper authorities. This system should have the capability to accurately sense vehicle location, to sense that the vehicle has been in a collision, and ideally to provide additional information with regard to the severity of the collision and/or likely injuries. A report by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (``Technology Alternatives for an Automated Collision Notification System,'' January 1994, publication no. FS&hyph;94&hyph;008, available from Mr. Ray Yuan at (301) 953&hyph;6356) provides background on alternative technologies for crash sensing, communicating the crash occurrence, and fixing the position of a crash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHTSA will contract with an independent party who is not a member of the partnership to conduct the independent evaluation of this operational test. The offeror, however, should address those selection criteria (listed below) involving scheduling, funding, and responsibilities of members of the partnership in the conduct of the evaluation. The proposal should also discuss how the partners will address the protection of the rights and welfare of participants as spelled out in NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1 are directed to the NHTSA individual named above under the heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Intelligent Cruise Control (Longitudinal Collision Avoidance_User Service 6.1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An operational test is needed to evaluate improvements in safety offered by Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) systems. The operational test should include appropriate number of vehicles with an in-vehicle ICC system which would control vehicle speed and headway and should not require active communications from other vehicles or roadside equipment. This system should, at a minimum, have the capability to sense distance and relative velocity of other vehicles, accurately control vehicle speed and headway, and to disregard vehicles in adjacent lanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary purpose of ICC systems is a higher level of convenience than is normally offered with standard cruise control, however these systems have the potential for decreasing the number and severity of rear end collisions. The evaluation will address both aspects of ICC. The proposal should discuss how the partners will address the protection of the rights and welfare of participants as spelled out in NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1 are directed to the NHTSA individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

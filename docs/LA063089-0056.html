			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTENDED VISA OFFER TO CHINESE CALLED 'CATCH-22';  </P> <P> FEW APPLY FOR PROGRAM THAT CRITICS SAY CUTS OFF OTHER OPTIONS TO REMAIN IN U.S.  </P> <P> Nearly a month after the Bush Administration announced that Chinese nationals  with expiring visas could stay in the United States for another year, only a  small number have applied for the program, and some say they will lobby  Congress for a more generous offer.  </P> <P> Chinese students who are on temporary visas at U.S. college campuses say the  Administration's offer would force them to return home at a time when danger  still exists. Those who take part in the program, which allows Chinese  nationals to remain in the United States until June 5, 1990, are not eligible  for other visa extensions.  </P> <P> "The program was announced by the Bush Administration as the solution to the  students' problems," said San Francisco lawyer Edward Lau, who specializes in  international law and has counseled a number of Chinese students. "But it  should only be used as a last resort."  </P> <P> "It's a Catch-22," said Yu Maochen, a graduate student at UC Berkeley. "If we  apply for that, we will lose everything. We will be forced to go home."  </P> <P> U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Washington said few  people have stepped forward to take advantage of the government's offer.  </P> <P> "We have not been inundated with applicants," said INS press officer Duke  Austin, who, although unable to provide exact figures, said he has heard  reports from regional INS offices that response to the offer has been poor.  </P> <P> A check with immigration offices across the nation showed San Francisco, which  has the largest Chinese community in the United States, with 25 applicants. Los  Angeles reported two, San Diego two, Honolulu one, Washington 15 and  Philadelphia three. INS officials in New York would say only that the response  there was "not overwhelming."  </P> <P> Immigration officials said they had not expected an early rush of applicants  because the only ones who would benefit from the program are those whose visas  will expire in the next year or those who are in the country illegally.  </P> <P> However, INS estimates place the number of people in those categories as high  as 18,000, or almost 25% of the 73,000 Chinese students, scholars and others in  this country, Austin said.  </P> <P> Many experts attribute the low response to confusion among the Chinese students  over how the program works. Some students erroneously fear that signing up for  the yearlong extension would mean that they forfeit their rights to apply for  political asylum.  </P> <P> Signing up for the Administration's offer, however, does limit the students'  options in extending their visas -- either by staying in school or obtaining  work permits -- because it means they automatically lose their visa status,  said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Asian Pacific  American Legal Center.  </P> <P> Kwoh's organization established a hot line last week to answer visa questions  of Chinese students and received more than 500 calls in four days. And to help  the students further, the INS opened up a toll-free hot line Wednesday to  explain the program's guidelines. The hot line received 91 calls by late  Thursday afternoon, INS officials said.  </P> <P> "There's massive confusion about what they should do on their visa status,"  Kwoh said.  </P> <P> Kwoh, Lau and other attorneys are advising students in most cases not to apply  for the one-year extension in hopes that a better offer will be forthcoming  from the U.S. government.  </P> <P> The lawyers, along with many Chinese students, are rallying around a bill  introduced in Congress last week by California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San  Francisco) that would broaden the government's offer by allowing students on  exchange visas to stay in this country for a longer time. Most Chinese students  seeking advanced degrees here have exchange visas that require them to return  home and work for two years once their schoolwork is completed.  </P> <P> Pelosi's bill would also allow Chinese nationals who already have applied for  the program a chance to stay here past next June.  </P> <P> "It's a dangerous situation in China right now," Pelosi said. "And we have  reason to suspect that Chinese officials are maintaining lists of Chinese  students."  </P> <P> Chinese students from Stanford, Berkeley and colleges throughout the nation,  such as Harvard and the University of Maryland, have been asking friends to  lobby members of Congress to support the bill.  </P> <P> More than 100 students met at the Berkeley campus last week to set a course of  action. They plan to launch a letter-writing campaign, and some vowed to  testify at a congressional hearing for the bill set for July.  </P> <P> In addition, Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) proposed legislation last week  co-sponsored by 10 senators that would allow all Chinese students to apply for  permanent residency status immediately, even if they are staying on an exchange  visa and are supposed to return home.  </P> <P> "The President's proposal only pushes out the stay for Chinese students a  year," said Gorton's press secretary, Sharon Kanareff. "They need longer than  that under the circumstances the students face."  </P> <P> The bill does not have as much support from the students, however, because they  do not necessarily want to apply immediately for permanent residency in the  United States. They also believe that the Gorton bill might be too drastically  worded to be enacted into law.  </P> <P> One student who did apply for the government's offer, Huang Shengyu at  Berkeley, said he took advantage of it because it offered him four additional  months in the United States.  </P> <P> At the Justice Department, parent agency to the INS, David Runkel, special  assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said the Administration's offer  "doesn't prohibit further action" at a later date and "takes immediate heat  off" students and other Chinese who might otherwise be forced to return home  immediately.  </P> <P> At times, the U.S. government has decided to lengthen the period that foreign  nationals may stay in the United States to avoid political persecution at home,  Austin said. Ethiopian refugees are still permitted to stay in this country,  and Polish immigrants who fled their country in 1981 after martial law was  declared received visa extensions lasting up to five years.  </P> <P> "It (Pelosi's bill) is a rather drastic and dramatic move," said Austin of the  INS. "If the situation remains the same, the U.S. has extended visa programs.  It is generally not done at the initial stage of the problem."  </P> <P> But until Chinese students are assured that they might not have to return home  next year, many will either curtail their activities or maintain a low profile.  </P> <P> "I need this bill passed to take pressure off the students," said Huang,  noting, "My face is already on the TV many, many times."  </P> <P> "If we know we have a chance at permanent residency, our energy will be  released immediately," Yu said. "People fear in the meantime that if we do  anything the (Chinese) government will never forgive us."  </P> <P> Basheda reported from San Francisco and May from Washington.  </P></p>

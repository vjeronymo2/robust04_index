			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Council set to alter voting policy: Public record to make decisions of EU ministers open to scrutiny The Council of Ministers, where European Union member states decide in secret on EU laws, is set to compile for the first time a central, public record of how ministers vote. The policy change is expected to be announced this week in a written response to a Financial Times request for a record on qualified majority voting (QMV) by ministers going back to 1989. According to EU diplomats, the Council letter will contain a final refusal of the voting record request. But it will state that, from now on, there will be a formal and open register of how ministers line up to legislate on behalf of 340m EU citizens. The refusal to reveal the record of more than 300 laws passed by QMV in 1989-93 was the result of resistance by a German-led coalition of nine member states, opposed by the Netherlands and Denmark. The UK - traditionally reticent about open government - in the end brokered a compromise. The Council's general secretariat in May turned down the initial request for information, made under new provisions for public access to EU documents, claiming it 'does not compile voting records'. A second request forced an appeal, obliging the Council under the new rules to reply before July 6. Member states, meeting under the Council's general affairs group on June 17, withdrew a second rejection of the request when the Netherlands and Denmark vetoed it and the UK switched sides. The draft rejection letter contained the assertion that 'the Council is not in possession of any such statistics' on QMV. The votes are recorded, but in the minutes of ministerial meetings, which the council refuses to release. At further meetings of the general affairs group on June 28, and of the 12's ambassadors to the EU on June 30, the Dutch and Danes called for a full debate at ministerial level. The British argued that the EU stood to gain in credibility if the record sought by the FT were compiled and released. But 'there was nothing approaching a serious yes,' one EU diplomat says, as the German-led majority, flanked by lawyers, stood fast. 'They live in the 19th century,' another diplomat remarked. 'They said these are the rules that we have and we have to stick to them.' The Council's legal defence appears to be that there is no single document recording QMV votes. But there will be one in future. The UK, the architect of the compromise, was under pressure from two questions to the government on QMV in the House of Commons. The first was answered by Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office minister, on June 27, saying 'the UK is arguing that the response to the Financial Times should be as helpful as possible'. But a second, still to be answered, wants a full account of how the UK voted on all the measures which put in place the EU's single market. Participants' accounts of the three Council meetings since June 17 on the issue make clear that the main underlying fear about going into the past record on QMV is that ministers could risk being accused of misleading the public and/or their national parliaments. The Council reply to the FT now being prepared will make clear that 'the Council often takes decisions without a formal vote where it is clear that the required majority exists'. This consensual formula, used in most QMV decisions, nevertheless enables ministers to leave meetings declaiming their opposition. But a retroactive voting record would not substantiate this; only the minutes of meetings would record ministers' initial positions before decisions went through. The new policy should therefore bring with it some changes in the habits of the secretive Council. As one EU diplomat points out, 'the way people vote often depends on whether they know it's going to be published'.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Toyota out of talks over R-R takeover TOYOTA, the leading Japanese car maker, yesterday ruled itself out of further negotiations with Vickers for a possible takeover of the UK engineering group's troubled Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota president, disclosed that Vickers, which holds its annual meeting in London today, was concerned that talks between the two companies should reach an early conclusion. 'Rolls-Royce asked Toyota to make a quick decision (on whether to acquire the company). Toyota refused the offer as we did not have enough time to consider (the acquisition),' he told a press conference in Osaka, Reuter reported. Mr Toyoda gave no further details of the talks. Vickers has confirmed that it has been holding talks with a number of international companies about the possible sale of its luxury car subsidiary, which plunged into heavy losses last year. It has refused to reveal the identity of potential buyers, although it is understood that the most serious negotiations to date have been held with BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, which already has some limited technology links with the UK prestige car maker.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Utd Breweries refinances and buys Inn Business United Breweries, the financially troubled public house operator controlled by Mr Vijay Mallya which has had its shares suspended since September, has finally come to an agreement with its bankers about a refinancing. Following support by Mr Mallya's UB Group of India and an unnamed institutional shareholder, a refinancing has been agreed which will be accompanied by a capital reorganisation, a placing and an open offer to shareholders. The USM-quoted company, which had debts of Pounds 9m in September, is not disclosing the sum it hopes to raise, but the shares will be offered at substantially below the current suspended market price of 6 3/4 p. UB is also to acquire Inn Business, a privately-owned public house operator with 70 houses. The deal - for an undisclosed consideration - will more than double the number of public houses operated by the group. The group originally breached its banking covenants last April after a Pounds 7.2m write-down in the value of its public houses.</p>

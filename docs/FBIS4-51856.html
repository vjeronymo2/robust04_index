			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 1 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An  Osaka prefectural meeting of Koreans in Japan was held at the  Nakaosaka Korean Primary and Middle School on April 30 to  denounce the suppression of the Osaka Organisation of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by  the Japanese authorities.    A statement of the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the  DPRK was read out and O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of Chongnyon and chairman of the Osaka  prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, made a report at the  meeting attended by more than 3,000 Chongnyon officials and  Korean residents in Japan.    The reporter pungently denounced the large-scale suppression  unprecedented in history by the Japanese police, branding the  case as a grave hostile act against the DPRK and as an  unjustifiable political suppression of Koreans in Japan and  Chongnyon.    Japanese figures including the vice-chairman of the Osaka  headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party and a lawyer  made solidarity speeches, which were followed by indignation  speeches of representatives of Chongnyon and the Democratic  Union of Korean Women in Japan.    The meeting adopted a resolution and elected delegates who  would conduct a protest action against the Osaka Precfectural  Police and the Higashi Police Station.    In connection with the outrages by the Osaka Prefectural  Police, Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of Chongnyon, and Kim Tae-hui, director of  the International Department of the Chongnyon Central Standing  Committee, on April 28 visited the headquarters of the Liberal  Democratic Party and met the chairman of the Policy Affairs  Research Council and deputy secretary-general of the party and  handed them a request of the Chongnyon Central Standing  Committee addressed to its President Yohei Kono.

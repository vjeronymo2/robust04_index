			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wassall chiefs repay Hanson THE FAMILY trusts of Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, and two other directors of Wassall, the conglomerate, have sold about 1.4m shares worth Pounds 2.8m to repay loans made by Hanson in 1988 at the start of the conglomerate's life. One of the conditions on the loan to Mr Miller, a former personal assistant to Lord Hanson, and his colleagues, was that the loan should be repayed as soon as the Wassall share price exceeded 200p. The share price jumped above that level during Wassall's bid for Evode, when the directors were prevented from selling.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Measures aim to end threat of dominant market role - Commission's proposals THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in two separate reports, concentrated on the potential threat to customers and competitors of the dominant market position held by British Gas. One report will go to the secretary of state for industry, the other to Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Gas Supply (Ofgas). The commission also examined the way the company calculates its prices, and recommended several changes to formulae used by British Gas to measure price movements. Its principal recommendation was that the company - the country's largest gas supplier as well as its biggest seller of gas services - should divest itself of its trading activities by March 31 1997. This would leave the company to concentrate on gas transportation and storage using its 250,000km national pipeline network to sell gas to a new generation of independent suppliers. The commission concluded that the dual role of British Gas as a seller and owner of gas might be 'expected to reduce the effectiveness of competition in supply of gas . . . inhibiting choice, restricting innovation and leading to higher levels of gas prices'. It said that the longest independently operated pipeline, known by the commission, was just 50km. Competitors, therefore, were almost completely dependent on the company's transportation and storage facilities and so vulnerable to prices and conditions imposed by British Gas. It said the sale of the company's trading activities, in its view, would not put at risk security of gas supply or safety. The reports concluded: 'Although some increase in costs in the short term may result, the development of self-sustaining competition would bring significant benefits to users.' The MMC proposed two big changes to formulae used to determine prices. These recommendations, if approved by Ofgas, would mean higher prices for many domestic customers. One proposal would mean that the next price change - due on April 1 next year - for customers consuming 2,500 therms a year or less would be based on the annual rise in the retail price index less 4 percentage points. This compares with the present arrangement of price changes of RPI less 5 percentage points. The average household uses about 600 therms a year, so most domestic customers will be affected. The commission has also recommended changes to the formula used to calculate prices charged to competitors using British Gas's pipelines. This formula is based on a rate of return determined by Ofgas which British Gas is allowed to earn from its pipeline business. The commission has rejected claims from British Gas that the rate of return be lifted to 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Instead the commission concluded that the company should earn between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent on existing assets and between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent on new investment. This compares with the rate of return previously allowed by Ofgas on existing assets of 4.5 per cent. The commission said that previous attempts to encourage competition had been only partially successful. About one third of all non-tariff customers at industrial and commercial premises using more than 25,000 therms a year were currently supplied by independent companies, according to British Gas. This compared with just 5 per cent in 1991. Recent attempts to encourage greater competition for non-tariff business customers between 2,500 and 25,000 therms, however, had been unsuccessful. Also, customers served by independents were almost entirely contracted to buy continuous gas supplies while so-called interruptible supplies, under which gas availability can be restricted at peak demand, were almost exclusively provided by British Gas. British Gas also retained a monopoly on tariff customers using 2,500 therms a year, most of them domestic customers charged under the formula calculated by Ofgas. The removal of the company's tariff monopoly, which the government has announced is likely to abolished, would be beneficial to users, said the commission. It recommended as an interim measure that the threshold for tariff customers be reduced from 1997 from 2,500 therms to 1,500 therms a year. It also recommended that the non-tariff market share of British Gas over 2,500 therms a year, excluding gas for power generation, chemical feedstocks or natural gas vehicles, be restricted to 55 per cent until the transportation and trading can be separated. British Gas had previously agreed to reduce its market share in this part of the market to 40 per cent by 1995. The commission said that increased competition had been beneficial in driving down costs, with the average revenue per therm from contract gas sales by British Gas falling by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 1986-87. This was mainly due to lower prices for North Sea gas, but also to reduced margins. In spite of this there were 'still complaints by some users that gas prices are higher than for their European competitors'. The commission noted: 'In the USA there is a high degree of competition between interstate pipeline operators, who have also been under pressure to withdraw from the sale of gas to end users.' The MMC rejected a proposal by British Gas that it be allowed to retain common ownership of separately established transportation and trading businesses. The commission also disagreed with the company's view that 'competition was now self-sustaining and that the rapid growth of competition showed that barriers of entry to the market were now negligible'. It said that the viability of competitors of British Gas depended on gas-selling prices, which could be influenced by the large market share of their biggest rival, and by gas transportation costs which were determined directly by British Gas. The recommendation that the company divest itself of its trading activities would require changes to the Gas Act, the commission said. Until that could be achieved the company's non-tariff activities should remain subject to price schedules and to market share limits. A date for removal of the tariff monopoly would 'depend on the progress of legislative change so as to impose obligations for safety and security of supply and social obligations on all competitors in the domestic market,' the commission said.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- GAS SUPPLY: RATES OF RETURN ON NET ASSETS (RONA)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Rona (%)                1987/88  1988/89  1989/90  1990/91  1991  1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tariff                      4.1      5.3      4.3      6.5   6.8   4.9 Contract: Firm             18.7     15.5     11.9     10.0   8.9   5.6 Third party transportation    -        -        -      1.7   3.7   4.8 Gas supply overall          6.3      6.6      5.4      7.2   7.1   5.3  --------------------------------------------------------------------- British Gas does not allocate capacity-based assets to interruptible turnover and so does not calculate Ronas for interruptible sales  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tariff: domestic and small commercial users Firm: continuous supply Interruptible: cheaper rate for supply which may be restricted at peak times  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

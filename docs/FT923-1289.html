			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / BAe share price plunges on news of 3,000 job losses BRITISH AEROSPACE'S share price fell 43 per cent yesterday after it announced the closure of its historic Hatfield plant, the loss of 3,000 jobs and a proposed joint venture with Taiwan to manufacture regional jets. The move, part of a sweeping attempt to secure the future of one of Britain's biggest manufacturing companies, was coupled with the announcement of a Pounds 129m first half loss and a Pounds 750m write-off - to be taken in the second half - on its regional aircraft operations. BAe shares closed down 86p at 113p. Its market capitalisation of Pounds 426m last night was less than the Pounds 432m it raised in a rights issue a year ago. The share price collapse revived City speculation that the company could now be vulnerable to a takeover. The restructuring, including the proposed joint regional jet venture with Taiwan Aerospace, was attacked last night by unions and opposition MPs as a devastating blow for British manufacturing industry. The move follows the arrival four months ago of Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, who was charged with restoring the credibility and profitability of the company which had been shaken by a top management crisis and losses in its commercial aircraft, Rover car and property operations. But the long-awaited restructuring package failed to impress the City, which continued to express serious doubts over the future of the company and its lossmaking regional aircraft operations. Mr Cahill defended the rationalisation programme as 'the best way forward' for the company, which lost Pounds 278m in its commercial aircraft operations in the first half. These losses, coupled with Pounds 31m losses at Rover, wiped out the Pounds 296m profits BAe made in its defence business. The company cut its dividend for the first time by 5.9p to 3p. BAe is also undertaking a capital reduction to cover the cost of its Pounds 750m restructuring programme. Although the company said its proposed joint venture with Taiwan would protect jobs in the UK, the overall impact of the restructuring would lead to 3,000 job cuts, including 2,060 at Hatfield. The Hertfordshire plant was the home of the Comet and the Trident before the BAe 146 regional jet. Another 1,000 jobs will be lost at the company's Woodford and Chadderton plants near Manchester under the restructuring, which will see all the company's turbopropeller aircraft production concentrated at Prestwick in Scotland. BAe has already shed 4,500 jobs this year in its commercial aircraft and defence activities hit by the effects of both the recession and cuts in defence spending. The company is also expected to complete soon the sale of its space and communications activities, which it no longer regards as core businesses. Although BAe's defence activities remain strongly profitable, City sentiment was also hit by the company's failure so far to announce a long-expected Saudi Arabian order for Tornado and Hawk aircraft. Germany's decision to withdraw from the European Fighter Aircraft production programme has also cast doubts on this project in which BAe is the leading UK partner. But Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, suggested yesterday the company could 'go-it-alone' if other countries dropped out.

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Poor economic data leave markets in a quandary A WEEK of consistently poor economic data but no reduction in interest rates left the US bond markets waiting and hoping. The statistical build-up was impressive. On Tuesday, there was the Commerce Department report, which showed that the index of leading economic indicators - supposed to gauge future industrial and commercial activity - fell 0.2 per cent in August. The same day, the Conference Board unveiled its consumer confidence index for September. This, too, showed a slump, with the number falling to 56.4, from a revised 59.0 in in the previous month. A couple of days later, the National Association of Purchasing Mangers index for September rolled out at 49.0, having stood at 53.7 for August. When the index slips below 50.0, this suggests that activity in the manufacturing sector is declining - a scenario which was last posted in January. To compound the gloom. spending on new construction during August was shown to have fallen by 0.8 per cent, after a 0.2 per cent rise in July. Finally, Friday brought the September unemployment figures - the bond market's primary focus all week. The data could have been worse. Non-farm jobs fell by 57,000 during the month, substantially less than the 120,000 decline forecast by many economists, while the unemployment rate improved marginally - from 7.6 to 7.5 per cent. However, after closer inspection, the numbers seemed less encouraging. While the effects of Hurricane Andrew and summer jobs programmes undoubtably muddied the figures, analysts were quick to note an apparent continued decline in jobs in both the manufacturing and construction sectors. The consensus was simple: the employment market remains extremely weak. Still, the Federal Reserve took no further action on interest rates. On the contrary, the Fed conspicuously failed to inject reserves into the banking system during the traditional pre-noon intervention period on Friday - a move which was generally read as signalling caution. So the US bond markets, which had rallied early in the week and then eased when the dollar came under pressure, were left in something of a quandary. The knee-jerk reaction was for bond prices to fall immediately after the unemployment numbers were announced. However, by Friday afternoon, when the numbers had been examined more closely, prices rose again. The benchmark 30-year long bond ended the week at 99, down just  3/32 , where it yields 7.33 per cent. This was marginally below the previous week's closing yield of 7.35 per cent. All eyes are now on the monthly policy-setting meeting of Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. This is due to take place on Tuesday, and many pundits believe that the recent stream of economic data - including the unemployment numbers - more than justifies some further reduction in interest rates. 'We would anticipate that easing to incorporate a reduction of the funds rate target to 2.75 per cent and the discount rate to 2.5 per cent', commented analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette - a sentiment echoed by a number of other commentators. One obvious consideration for the Fed is the potential impact on the dollar  -although most economists now suggest that disinflationary forces present in the US economy are capable of offsetting any inflation generated by a declining currency. However, a timely reminder of the continued hawkish sentiment which dominates some quarters came when Federal Reserve Board Governor Mr Wayne Angell indicated that another downturn in economic activity was 'not likely at all' and predicted that nominal growth in GDP should range between 4 and 5 per cent during the next nine months.</p>

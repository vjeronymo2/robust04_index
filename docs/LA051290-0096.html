			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA;  </P> <P> CITY PANEL OPPOSES DRUG DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> The Minneapolis City Council approved a measure aimed at blocking enforcement  of the federal law allowing the death penalty for some drug-related murders.  </P> <P> It would have the city's law officers bypass the U.S. attorney's office if the  death penalty were at stake. Officers instead would turn cases over to state  and local prosecutors, because Minnesota has no death penalty. Critics say the  resolution lacks teeth because federal authorities could still step in and try  a homicide case if they wanted to. U.S. Atty. for Minneapolis Jerome Arnold  responded that he is willing to try such cases and push for the death penalty  where appropriate.  </P></p>

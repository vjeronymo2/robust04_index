			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail sales data fail to provide lift for Dow Wall Street DISAPPOINTING news on inflation and a weakening bond market pushed share prices on Wall Street lower, as stronger than expected retail sales figures failed to impress equity investors, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.45 down at 3,615.76. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.16 to 459.90, while the American SE composite shed 1.54 to 452.76 and the Nasdaq composite fell 7.68 to 732.64. New York SE trading volume came to 258.6m shares. Stocks opened moderately lower in reaction to an early sell-off in the Treasury bond market. The bearish mood was triggered by the release of August's consumer price index, which showed a 0.3 per cent rise in retail prices last month. Analysts had expected a 0.1 per cent uptick. A surprising 0.6 per cent decline in the August producer price index, released last Friday, had served to heighten expectations of moderating inflation on the retail level as well. As the day progressed and the bond market tumbled, stock prices slipped further. Investors took little comfort in a 0.2 per cent increase in August retail sales, even though a slight fall had been predicted. Any indication of growing consumption - and a more buoyant economy - was undercut by an upward revision in July's figure, to a 0.3 per cent increase, which suggests a declining month-to-month trend. AMR, parent of American Airlines, edged Dollars  3/8 down to Dollars 64 3/8 after it announced 5,000 job cuts by the end of 1994. Other leading US airlines, which on Monday cut fares by up to 45 per cent, lost ground as well. UAL, operator of United Air Lines, shed Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 142 1/4 and Delta Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 5/8 . Viacom, which this week agreed to acquire Paramount Communications in a cash-and-stock transaction now valued at Dollars 7.9bn, dropped on a report that heavy buying by Viacom's chairman had helped to boost its share price in the weeks before the announcement. On the Amex, Viacom's class A shares fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 , while its B non-voting stock was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 3/8 . Paramount slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 . After a big sell-off late on Monday, Compaq Computer sought to downplay its announcement of relatively flat personal computer shipments in the second half. By the close the shares had recovered Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 . Home Depot dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 36 1/4 after Goldman Sachs removed the building supply retailer from its recommended list. Canada TORONTO closed mixed after busy trading. The TSE 300 index gained just 0.3 at 3,972.1, but declining issues outnumbered advances by 445 to 313. Volume was 68.5m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-indices were lower, led by energy, off 1.0 per cent. The gold shares index, after dropping 5.4 per cent on Monday, rallied 2.7 per cent, helped by a recovery in the bullion price, which firmed USDollars 2 an ounce to USDollars 345 in New York.</p>

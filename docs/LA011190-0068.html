			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE SEAT BATTLE PROMISES TO BE QUICK, DIRTY  </P> <P> With the prospect of a charged debate over ethics and abortion in a short  five-week campaign, the special election to replace former state Sen. William  Campbell promises to be quick and dirty.  </P> <P> "I didn't think they were going to sling so much mud so fast," said Sal Russo,  a political consultant for Assemblyman Frank Hill, the candidate who so far has  drawn most of the dirt. "It started right away."  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian decided just before the holidays to set the special  primary for Feb. 6, in part so that Republican Assembly members could run  without risking their seats in the June election.  </P> <P> Hill (R-Whittier) and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) are among  eight candidates running to represent the predominantly Republican 31st  District that straddles the Los Angeles and Orange County border.  </P> <P> The candidates waited until the New Year and then launched a mad five-week dash  last Tuesday. So far, almost every day has involved accusations and  name-calling. Candidates have criticized both Hill and Ferguson for accepting  what their opponents say are excessive honorariums, and last week Hill was  attacked by three candidates for mailing a letter that they said implied he was  endorsed by Campbell.  </P> <P> Campbell, first elected to the 31st Senate District from Hacienda Heights in  1976, resigned last month to become president of the California Manufacturers  Assn. He has told the candidates that his contract prevents him from endorsing  a successor.  </P> <P> The major factors expected to influence the race are:  </P> <P> Pro-choice forces that are hoping to turn the campaign into a repeat of  California's last two special elections, in which their candidates upset  anti-abortion opponents. This race has some of the same dynamics, with a  pro-choice Republican encouraging Democratic crossovers and two anti-abortion  Republicans who could split their constituency.  </P> <P> An ongoing FBI investigation of Hill involving an influence-peddling scandal at  the Capitol. Hill, meanwhile, has been the prime target of the other candidates  because he appears to be the best financed and he has the backing of Republican  leaders in the Assembly and the Senate.  </P> <P> The heavy negative campaigning that is likely to limit the discussion of issues  and discourage voters in an election that was already expected to have a low  turnout of about 20%. The shortness of the race and the presence of some  little-known candidates have contributed to the attacks, since it is easier to  sully an opponent than it is to sell an unknown candidate.  </P> <P> The district stretches from Whittier and West Covina in Los Angeles County to  Laguna Beach in southern Orange County. Its registration is solidly Republican,  about 60%, to 30% Democratic.  </P> <P> Of the eight candidates who filed on Dec. 26, only Hill and Ferguson have  served in the Legislature. But Ron Isles, a city councilman from Brea, has been  included among the leaders because of his claim that he will spend up to  $500,000 of his own money on the campaign, if necessary.  </P> <P> Isles, a consultant who sold his electronics manufacturing company in 1981, is  also a pro-choice Republican.  </P> <P> The other candidates are Republican Gary C. Miller, a city councilman from  Diamond Bar; Democrat Bradley J. McFadden, a councilman from West Covina;  Janice L. Graham, secretary of the Orange County Democratic Party; Thomas M.  Whaling, a Democratic attorney from El Toro; and Robert W. Lewis of Rowland  Heights, who filed for the race with the American Independent Party.  </P> <P> If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote on Feb. 6, a runoff between  the top Republican and Democratic vote-getters will be held April 10.  </P> <P> Ferguson said he is counting on a strong showing in Orange County to win the  race, since 60% of the Republican voters in the district are on his side of the  county line.  </P> <P> Instead of running a negative campaign, Ferguson said, he will stress his  background as a family man who has worked in business, served in the military  and won three terms in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Likewise, Hill said he hopes to campaign on his accomplishments during eight  years in the Assembly and on his "reputation for getting things done in  Sacramento."  </P> <P> And he said his geographic base is stronger than Ferguson's because half of the  population in the Senate district is within the boundaries of his Assembly  district.  </P> <P> Isles' campaign is counting on the race becoming topsy-turvy with a groundswell  of voters turning out either because of the ethics issue or abortion, two of  the hottest political subjects of the 1990 election cycle.  </P> <P> Isles has repeatedly attacked Hill and Ferguson, charging that they have been  unethical in office. Most often he has criticized Hill for being a subject of  the FBI's Capitol sting operation.  </P> <P> Hill has been accused in court testimony during the corruption trial of state  Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) of accepting a $5,000 honorarium in return  for his support of legislation for a shrimp company.  </P> <P> "I haven't done anything wrong," Hill said. "I know as much about the  investigation as anybody who reads the papers." Hill also said he does not know  how the investigation will affect his race.  </P> <P> Isles was endorsed by Pro-Choice Orange County, a bipartisan organization that  was formed in response to the Supreme Court's Webster decision in July, which  gave states more authority to regulate abortion.  </P> <P> Linda Schwartz, a Democrat and president of Pro-Choice Orange County, said she  expects Democrats to vote for Isles because of his pro-choice position on  abortion and the likelihood of a Republican winner.  </P></p>

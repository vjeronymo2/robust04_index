			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Ghanaians go to polls Ghanaians today elect their first parliament since 1981 but an opposition boycott will hand President Jerry Rawlings a hollow victory, Reuter reports from Accra. Three pro-Rawlings parties and a dozen independents were left to compete for the 200-seat assembly. 'That will. . .put in place a one-party, rubber-stamp parliament with no credibility,' said Mr Kwesi Pratt, a radical opposition activist. Ghana's three main opposition parties announced the boycott this month in protest at what they said was wholesale rigging in the November 3 presidential elections. Mr Rawlings was declared winner with more than 58 per cent of the vote. Foreign observers said the result was broadly fair but agreed that the electoral register was over-sized.</p>

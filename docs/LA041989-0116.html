			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: CONTROL DATA'S FAILURE WASN'T TECHNOLOGICAL  </P> <P> Money talked on Monday when Control Data withdrew from competition in  supercomputers. It couldn't continue financing a money-losing but  technologically advanced operation, said its Chairman Robert Price.  </P> <P> The pullout is a bad sign, but not for the reasons you may think. It's not that  the United States -- the country that worries about its schools turning out  enough engineers -- is falling behind in technology. In fact, there is little  doubt that the U.S. industry leads in supercomputer technology.  </P> <P> It was U.S. financial markets that failed Control Data. The real story is that  the nation that turns out more business school graduates than any other is  threatened competitively because it cannot figure out how to finance a business  over the long pull, how to stay the course when the going gets rough.  </P> <P> Supercomputers, machines that can perform billions of mathematical calculations  per second, are important. They are used today to design airplane wings,  simulate weapons systems, find oil deposits or decipher photographs from outer  space. In the next decade, as their powers increase, so will their value and  importance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threw Towel In  </P> <P> Yet sadly, Control Data, the Minneapolis company that first developed such  computers in the early 1970s, threw in the towel even though it turns out one  of the world's most powerful supercomputers. Its ETA Systems computer had  technical flaws and needed software. But Control Data has sold 34 ETAs  worldwide -- in a global market that has seen only 409 supercomputers sold to  date. It had possibilities.  </P> <P> And with time Control Data might have rejiggered its machine, developed the  software. But nobody would take a chance on it. Banks wouldn't extend its  credit lines, and the stock market seemed happy to accept its decision to close  the business and restructure; the speculators said the company was "creating  shareholder value."  </P> <P> Control Data's departure leaves U.S. industry with two prominent supercomputer  players: Cray Research -- the global leader with more than 200 machines sold --  and giant IBM, which has declared its intention to enter the field and is  backing entrepreneur Steve Chen's company, Supercomputer Systems Inc. A variety  of supercomputer start-ups round out the U.S. industry.  </P> <P> Japan, meanwhile, has three major entrants in the supercomputer olympics:  Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. The Japanese companies are not making any money in  the business, but they are persevering. NEC, for example, in a joint venture  with America's Honeywell, has just brought out a powerful new supercomputer. It  has no orders but it is patient.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Strengths  </P> <P> What are the U.S. strengths? Technical brilliance and venturesome  entrepreneurs, who are advancing the state of the art. Both Cray Research and  Supercomputer Systems are going beyond one big machine to parallel processing,  which breaks down massive problems, gets many parts of answers quickly and puts  them back together -- as you might do in developing a satellite photograph.  </P> <P> The U.S. industry also is bringing new power to supercomputing with an effort  by Intel Corp., the semiconductor company, to put together 2,000 chips, of 1  million transistors each, to produce the most powerful computers yet made.  Intel is working under a contract from the Defense Department on that advanced  development.  </P> <P> But most U.S. financing is entrepreneurial. Cray Research, now grown to $800  million in revenue, was founded by Seymour Cray, 62, who left Control Data in  1972 to form his own firm -- with backing from Control Data. Two years ago,  Steve Chen left Cray to form Supercomputer Systems, and attracted backing from  IBM.  </P> <P> Other companies are springing up: Thinking Machines of Cambridge, Mass., and  Kendall Square Research of Boston, Tera Corp. of Seattle and companies named  Mips and Convex, Masspar and Alliant, Solbourne Computer and Key Laboratories.  </P> <P> Which is exciting, but the staying power of small firms is suspect. Gary Smaby,  a supercomputer specialist for Needham &amp; Co., an investment bank that backs  start-up companies, believes the next decade will demand larger firms with the  resources for a high-stakes game -- Control Data, after all, lost $100 million  in supercomputers last year.  </P> <P> Without patient financing, home-grown technology may leave home. Two promising  newcomers in supercomputers are already owned or backed by Japanese companies:  Key Computer Labs, of Fremont, Calif., was recently bought by Amdahl Corp., of  which Fujitsu owns 45%, and Solbourne Computer of Longmont, Colo., is backed by  Matsushita.  </P> <P> "Capital is a competitive threat," says Intel's President Andrew Grove, who  sees Japanese financing being offered to start-up companies up and down Silicon  Valley. But does it matter who finances technology? Yes, says Grove "because  control of technology leads to jobs and development for your people and  leadership for your country."  </P> <P> True enough, but unless U.S. financial markets recognize there are values other  than shareholder values, that leadership will fade.  </P></p>

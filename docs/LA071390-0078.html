			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THANKS TO STALEMATE, STATE REAPS $300,000 A DAY IN INTEREST  </P> <P> As California's budget impasse drags on, its unspent income is rising -- and  earning a handsome profit.  </P> <P> Because the state by law cannot pay its bills as long as it has no budget,  revenues are mounting up and are now $1 billion higher than they would be in  normal times, state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes said Thursday.  </P> <P> Hayes said the state so far has earned $1 million in interest on the money, and  interest income is accumulating at a rate of $300,000 a day.  </P> <P> "We are rolling over $1 billion in bills that have not been paid. We have the  cash in the bank and will earn interest on it until there is a budget and we  can again legally pay our bills," Hayes said.  </P> <P> Most of the interest income will be redeposited in the state general fund. Some  of it will be added to the money the state owes cities and counties, so the  local governments will get slightly fatter checks than usual -- once the state  starts sending out checks again.

In an interview with  Berlin "Deutschlandradio," Naumann said on Friday [4 March] that  the alliance must also ask itself the fundamental question of  whether it should assume a mandate in which it simply carries  out orders on behalf of the United Nations or the CSCE, without  being permitted to make its own decisions; or whether NATO  should make decisions on a United Nations or CSCE mandate.    The question is also whether NATO will say of its own  volition: Here is a security problem that we want to solve in  the sphere of our interests in consensus between the 16 nations,  and this is where we will prepare for the necessary action.  Naumann emphasized that this issue requires a political answer.  The inspector general reiterated his view that, in future,  German units should also participate in such NATO operations.</p>

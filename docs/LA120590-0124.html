			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> OUT OF ARSONIST'S ASHES;  </P> <P> AS REBUILDING MOVES TOWARD END, SCHOOL RECALLS A DAY OF FIRE  </P> <P> Kathy Barnett remembers reading a Christmas story to her first-grade children,  who were just settling down from lunch one year ago, when she noticed an odd  smell coming from the next room. "I thought to myself, 'Gee, something smells  like burnt popcorn,' " said Barnett, who went outside to discover flames  shooting from the roof. "When I opened the door I realized we weren't having  popcorn, we were having a fire."  </P> <P> Barnett quickly moved to get her students out, then watched in horror as  firefighters battled to save the building.  </P> <P> "I was stunned. My first reaction was why is this building on fire."  </P> <P> It was a year ago this week that an arsonist set fire to a portion of Arthur F.  Corey Elementary School, causing more than $500,000 in damage to six classrooms  and the school's library. About 125 students and adults had to be evacuated as  the blaze swiftly moved from a storage room to classrooms, destroying  everything in its path. None of the children were injured but Dick Martin, who  was principal at the time, sustained moderate burns when he ran back into the  building to check the restrooms for students.  </P> <P> A year later, Barnett and other teachers whose rooms were destroyed have  settled into makeshift classrooms while construction crews work nearby to  restore the burned building. An interim library has been set up for the  children and even former Principal Martin, the man considered a hero for his  efforts, had to be reminded that a year had passed.  </P> <P> "Oh yes, it was a year ago," said Martin, who has since taken over the top job  at James A. Whitaker Elementary School. "Every once in a while I do think about  it. . . . You still think, 'What if.' "  </P> <P> Hours after the fire, the district set in motion an elaborate plan to get the  school up and running. Portable classrooms were brought in eight days later and  school personnel worked overtime to be ready for the students when they  returned from Christmas vacation.  </P> <P> As soon as the next day, some teachers and students worked to salvage as much  as possible while the rest of the school settled into business as usual.  </P> <P> While the school recuperated, fire officials searched for whoever set the fire.  After the school fire, several palm trees in the area were torched by youths  calling themselves the "Pyros," officials said. However, a connection could  never be made.  </P> <P> "Arson is one of the hardest crimes to solve," Buena Park Fire Marshal Don  Tully said. "Unless someone actually sees someone with a match in their hand it  is very hard to prove."  </P> <P> Reluctantly, the investigators have stopped looking for the arsonist.  </P> <P> "We don't have any leads," Tully said. "The case is suspended. We are not  actively working on it."  </P> <P> Instead, talk is of the future.  </P> <P> "I think the new room is going to be great," said second-grade teacher Ron  Severin, who manages to squeeze fifth-and sixth-grade choir practice into his  tight, temporary quarters, piano and all.  </P> <P> For the past few months, construction crews have been working to restore the  building. A new roof, interior walls and wiring are being added along with  carpeting and tile. The district had initially planned to have the classrooms  open by last September, but the new estimate is this March, officials said.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 books are waiting to be stocked in the new library, along with  television sets, movie projectors and other audiovisual equipment. "Everything  is just stored waiting for someplace to go," said Jerry Horton, the new  principal.  </P> <P> Almost everything could be replaced, even the pupils' sense of security. With  an air of adventure, they excitedly recount exactly where they were during the  blaze.  </P> <P> "Yes, I remember," said second-grader Amber Miller. "We were in the classroom  and Miss Wilson came in and said (to another teacher), 'There is a f-i-r-e.' I  started to cry because all my friends were still in there."  </P> <P> Only a few things will be missing when the classrooms are dedicated, Horton  said.  </P> <P> "The saddest part is that all the trophies that the school won are all gone.  You can't replace them." LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

They call for serious efforts by all the sides  involved, but some progress is already showing up. The sides  involved in the conflict are beginning to think more in terms of  peace and not military confrontation," special envoy of the  Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told  a press conference here on Thursday [as received] after his trip  to Sarajevo.    While in the Bosnian capital, Churkin met leaders of the  Muslim community and commanders of the Bosnian Serb army, as  well as representatives of the command of the U.N. Forces in  Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Russian special envoy said that the  U.N. Forces were successfully establishing control over the  heavy armaments of the conflicting sides, emplaced around  Sarajevo. "It is difficult to say for sure that this process  will be completed within 2-3 days," Churkin noted, "but the  actions of the sides are reassuring."    The Russian diplomat again stressed the immutabilty of  Russia's stand. He said that NATO air strikes at positions of  the Bosnian Serbs could be considered only as an extreme  measure, permissible in an emergency situation. "In any case,"  he stressed, "it is necessary to realise that this step will  escalate the Bosnian conflict."    Touching on the possibility of a Russian military contingent  taking part in the NATO-planned operation, Churkin noted that  there was no reason for this. He does not think it possible  that Russian soldiers could be sent to an area, where their  lives and safety will be in danger, as a result of a decision  adopted without Russia's participation.    The special envoy of the Russian president will arrive in  Belgrade from Zagreb today.</p>

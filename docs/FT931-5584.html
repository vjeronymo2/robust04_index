			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / EC to order BAe repayment: Rover 'sweeteners' and interest could amount to more than Pounds 60m THE European Commission will next week order British Aerospace to repay Pounds 44.4m it received in 1988 from the government to 'sweeten' its purchase of Rover, the car manufacturer. BAe will also have to repay interest which has accrued since 1990, when the commission ruled that the sweeteners amounted to illegal state aid. That ruling was overturned in the European Court of Justice a year ago on a technicality. EC officials confirmed yesterday that a recommendation by Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, was on the agenda of next week's commission meeting and should be approved without further discussion by the 17 commissioners. Mr Van Miert's proposal does not include a figure for interest charges - some commissioners had urged that interest be calculated from the date of the 1988 sale. The charges will be calculated according to UK rules governing recovery of state aid and some estimates have put the total repayment at more than Pounds 60m. The decision should bring to an end 4 1/2 years of court cases and political wrangling within the commission and between Brussels and BAe. BAe could launch a further court appeal, however. The company said yesterday it would not decide whether to challenge the decision until it had been formally announced. Mr Tony Parry, head of BAe's Brussels office, said yesterday: 'Clearly we are disappointed that the commission has decided to apply interest charges in circumstances where we felt that the basis for the decision was flawed in the first place.' The commission agreed to BAe's Pounds 150m purchase of Rover in 1988, after approving a government cash injection into the car group. But the National Audit Office discovered that the government had also sweetened the sale with an additional Pounds 44.4m to the aerospace group. Brussels decided in 1990 that the sweeteners amounted to illegal state aid. After the ruling was overturned Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, pledged a new inquiry. The commission was almost certain to rule against BAe, because the Court of Justice did not challenge the substance of the 1990 decision when it overturned the ruling. Sir Leon's demand in 1990 that the sweeteners should be repaid was seen as a counterbalance to his decision not to question the Pounds 150m sale price. He chose not to pursue BAe for repayment of the balance between the price paid and any higher bid for Rover, in spite of the fact that the National Audit Office said Pounds 150m was 'substantially' too low. Sir Leon, a former Conservative cabinet minister, was accused at the time of being too soft on the government, and last year proposed to omit interest charges from the repayment.

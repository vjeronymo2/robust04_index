			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / People: Council of Management of Templeton College, Oxford Sir Bruce MacPhail (above), whose own impeccable academic pedigree reads Balliol, Oxford, followed by an MBA at Harvard, is becoming chairman of the Council of Management of Templeton College, Oxford, succeeding David Rowland, who is stepping down after seven years. Rowland has just taken over as chairman of Lloyd's. P&amp;O's managing director, Sir Bruce has served on Templeton's council since 1986, and the college's new president, Clark Brundin, says he expects him to continue to produce 'a significant intellectual contribution'. It doesn't take a man from the top of P&amp;O to realise that Britain is very much at a disadvantage with regard to its competitors as regards educational training. But Sir Bruce is sounding optimistic that if Oxford really embraces management studies - a discipline which in the past it has treated with some disdain - and turns itself into a 'world-class school', this could have a very positive impact on domestic industry's perception of the value of business education. Templeton is on its way to receiving the Royal Charter as Oxford's 37th college. At the same time, a separate school of management will be established, with an MBA programme now targeted (after several postponements) to commence in October 1995. While Sir Bruce says he has never for an instant regretted his Harvard training, he explains that the Oxford version of the MBA will be 'extremely international in its direction, with a certain amount of on-the-job experience, and it will involve fluency in another language - all in all a far cry from the pure case-study stuff I did at Harvard'.</p>

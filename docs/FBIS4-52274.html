			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's total exports  are likely to surpass Taiwan's this year for the first time in  six years with Korea recording relatively stable export  increases over the past years, the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy said Monday.    South Korea exported 19.95 billion dollars worth of goods  during the first quarter this year while Taiwanese exports hit  20.1 billion dollars, according to the Ministry.    Ministry records, however, show that South Korea recorded a  9.8- percent increase in exports during the period while Taiwan  posted a mere 0.4-percent rise.    South Korea has recorded export increase rates exceeding 7  percent since 1991. In particular, it has posted increase rates  of more than 10 percent every month this year except for  February, according to the Ministry.    The growth rate of Taiwan's exports, in the meantime, has  leveled off, declining from a high of 13.3 percent in 1991 to 7  percent in 1992, 4.3 percent in 1993 and then to just 0.4  percent during the first three months of this year, the Ministry  said.    South Korea has lagged behind Taiwan in exports since the  1980s. The only exception was 1988, when South Korea shipped out  60.7 billion dollars worth of goods compared with Taiwan's 60.5  billion dollars.    "The Taiwanese export structure, composed mainly of light-  industry products, faces limitations due to the stiff wage  increases nowadays," said one Ministry official.    "The situation will reverse toward the end of this year  unless something happens because South Korea shows brisk export  increases in the heavy and chemical industries where Taiwan is  weak," said the official.    South Korea took second place in the first-quarter export  increase rate competition among the four newly industrializing  economies, with a rate of 9.8 percent followed by Hong Kong (8.6  percent) and Taiwan (0.4 percent), according to the Ministry.  Singapore came first with 15.3 percent.</p>

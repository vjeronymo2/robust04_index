Mr Tom Hartley, national chairman of Sinn Fein, told a news  conference at Westminster that links began in October 1990 with  a meeting between Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein deputy  president, and an unnamed representative from the Government    The press conference, sponsored by Left-wing Labour MPs Mr  Tony Benn and Mr Jeremy Corbyn, was condemned by Tory MPs as an  "abuse of privilege" and a "publicity stunt".    The decision to publish Sinn Fein's version of the contacts  and to lodge them in the Commons library did little to dispel  the view that the "peace process" launched at Downing Street  last month had become bogged down.    The language used by Mr Hartley, who accused ministers of  "Iying" and issuing "bogus" accounts of the communications,  confirmed there had been no progress in the intervening four  weeks.    Sinn Fein has written to Mr Major asking for clarification  of  the Downing Street declaration, something the Prime Minister  resolutely refuses to provide.    Mr Hartley said a decision by the IRA on whether to continue  with the process would not be made until there had been a  response from the Government though the absence of clarification  would not necessarily end the initiative.    The documents, many of which have been seen before were  published by Sinn Fein to back up its claim that it was  justified in asking for clarification. "Throughout this record  of exchanges, there are examples of clarification sought by Sinn  Fein and given by the British Government," said Mr Hartley. "All  this begs the question about the seriousness of the Government's  approach to a peaceful settlement in Ireland."    A line of communication has existed between Sinn Fein and  the  Government for more than 20 years and was used at the time of  the Maze prison hunger strikes in 1981.    According to the documents published in November by Sir  Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, the channel was  reopened last February after a message from Mr McGuinness  stating that "the conflict is over".    Sinn Fein denies this message was ever sent and traces the  communications to October 1990, followed by 18 messages between  then and February 1993, when the contacts started in earnest.    They included advance notification to Sinn Fein of speeches  to be made by ministers and a position paper setting out the  progress of inter-party talks then going on in Northern Ireland.    Which side instigated last year's contacts continues to be  disputed, but it is clear that events moved swiftly from last  February, with discussions even at this stage about the  withdrawal of troops to barracks and the removal of checkpoints.    A report of a meeting on Feb 24 last year--which was not  included in the British record of contacts--said: "The IRA needs  to provide the space to turn the possibility of meetings into a  reality. A suspension is all that is being required of them. The  British believed that two or three weeks was a sufficient period  to convince republicans."    A later document claims that Britain was suggesting venues  for talks, including Scotland, the Isle of Man, Denmark and  Norway.    Sinn Fein also denies having sent a message to the  Government  on Nov 2 last year which prompted a definitive policy statement  three days later. Four documents were withheld by Sinn Fein on  grounds of "sensitivity". Mr Hartley said they "have a relevance  to the on-going efforts to build on the process."    Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam who  attended  the press conference accused Sinn Fein of "cynical hypocrisy".    Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann said  there was nothing new in the documents."That makes it absolutely  outrageous that Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn should abuse their  privileges as MPs to give a platform to a squalid terrorist  gang," he said on BBC radio.    "I believe that they have taken the decision to reject the  declaration."</p>

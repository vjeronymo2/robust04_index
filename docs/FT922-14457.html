			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Russia sets pace on forces split THE Russian parliament has forced other republics to decide on a carve-up of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, at present under Russian control. A statement agreed at the weekend by the praesidium of the Russian parliament said the new Russian army would take over all the present CIS forces, even those based in non-Russian republics. Russia pays for all the former Soviet armed forces except those taken over by Ukraine and Moldova. The praesidium's decision will force the other republics to decide what proportion of forces based on their territory they wish to take on and pay for. General Pavel Grachev, named on Friday as one of the two deputy Russian defence ministers, said the government wanted the Russian army to number between 1.2m and 1.3m, out of the 3m former Soviet troops. Deputies say the praesidium decision also means that the strategic nuclear forces, currently under CIS command, would also be put under Russian control. The republics of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belorussia still have substantial strategic forces on their territory, none of which have so far been returned to Russia - though all have pledged to do so. The deputies say that Russia will attempt to conclude a treaty with the other CIS members on the provision of a 'nuclear umbrella' once the strategic forces have been secured.</p>

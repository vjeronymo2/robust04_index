			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Top planner in Venezuela offers to quit The head of Venezuela's presidential planning office, Cordiplan, has offered his resignation in protest at the government's failure to approve a series of free-market reforms he proposed. Mr Luis Carlos Palacios, who joined Cordiplan from the industry ministry at the end of May, had recommended President Rafael Caldera's government approve moves including: negotiating agreements with the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies; increasing domestic petrol prices and subsidising public transport; reforming the country's onerous system of severance benefits to workers; higher taxes. Free-market policies have been generally rejected by the Caldera administration since it took office in February. Announcing his resignation, Mr Palacios said his proposals had not been accepted by the cabinet, and warned that price and exchange controls introduced on June 27 were attacking only 'the symptoms of the crisis', not the causes. Although it was not clear yesterday whether President Caldera would accept the resignation, Mr Palacios's initiative reflected the depth of the schisms within and outside the government over the imposition of the controls. Another cabinet member, Mr Alberto Poletto, industry minister, told businessmen that the recent controls, while necessary in the short term, were 'not the correct way to run the economy'. He said he had never imagined that he would be industry minister when such drastic measures were taken. Since the controls were announced, several ministers have said they will be 'temporary', although no time span has been specified. Details of the price and exchange controls are still being announced. The government was expected to announce the new foreign exchange programme - Venezuela's fourth this year - late last night. Bad economic news has continued to pile up. Mr Palacios announced that Venezuela's GDP shrank by 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the equivalent period in 1993. The oil sector grew by 2.9 per cent but non-oil activities declined by 4.8 per cent. Imports for the first four months of 1994 were down 32 per cent from the equivalent period last year. Some economists are predicting a 5 per cent decline in GDP this year, compared with a 1 per cent decline in 1993. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of depositors are still waiting to claim their money from eight financial institutions closed by the government last month. Depositors protesting outside Banco Metropolitano on Monday threatened to set fire to bank offices if they were not paid. Two prominent bankers - Mr Jose Mara Nogueroles, president of Banco Provincial, Venezuela's largest bank, and Mr Edgar Dow, head of Banco del Caribe - warned that the government's plan to 'recycle' money from strong banks to weak institutions will destroy what is left of the country's banking system. A recent IMF report, published by a Caracas daily, predicted that the Venezuelan government would have a budget deficit equivalent to nearly 17.5 per cent of GDP this year, due to official financial assistance to the banking system. Caveme, an association of pharmaceutical companies, has also warned that the government ban on foreign exchange sales will cause shortages of medicines since many raw materials are imported. Stocks of some processed foods have also run low due to the industry's reliance on imports.</p>

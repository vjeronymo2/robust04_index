			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Housing starts fall by 2.7% THE US housing market is continuing to move sideways despite the lowest mortgage rates in two decades, figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2.7 per cent between June and July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21m. In the first seven months of the year, starts were only 2.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The market's relative weakness may reflect consumers' reluctance to make long-term financial commitments because of doubts about job security. The weakness last month was concentrated in the Midwest, where building activity was adversely affected by flooding, and in California where economic recovery has been slow to take hold. Starts rose modestly in the northeast and south. Building permits were more encouraging, rising 3 per cent last month and by 4 per cent in the first seven months relative to the same period last year.</p>

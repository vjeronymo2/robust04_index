			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Breakthrough in the Investment Field"] </F>   [Text] The government's decision to issue a deregulation  package to open new areas to foreign investment is a new  breakthrough in the field of investment. The deregulation  measure also opens many business activities that supplement the  basic needs of the people in their daily life. As a matter of  fact, the government has taken a very daring move to issue the  new investment deregulation measure. The new deregulation  package on investment was announced to newsmen by Murdiono,  minister/state secretary, at his office in Jakarta on Thursday,  2 June. Murdiono was accompanied by ministers in charge of the  measure. Now that the deregulation package has been issued, it  looks like the government is determined to make the country more  attractive to foreign investors to face the keener and stiff  competition in the international capital market.    The latest deregulation measure is contained in Government  Regulation No. 20/1994 on shareholding in companies and it was  approved by President Suharto on 19 May.    Under Government Regulation No. 20/1994, foreign investment  can be set up in two forms -- wholly-owned foreign enterprises  and joint ventures. The foreign investor is allowed to hold up  to 95 percent share of the joint venture, and a 100-percent  share of the wholly- owned investment. According to the  previous regulation, foreign investors were required to  gradually reduce their shareholdings to 51 percent after the  20th year of business. This means the foreign investor was  forced to become a minor share holder of the business.    It is interesting to carefully note that under the new  deregulation package, foreign capital in joint venture projects  can now enter into business activities that are considered  strategic to the nation and which cater to the needs of many  people. The new regulation opens seaports, telecommunications,  power, civil aviation, sea transportation, production of potable  water, railway, nuclear power, and mass media to foreign  investors. It looks as if the government made a breakthrough in  the capital investment to revitalize foreign investment, to  overcome limited infrastructure facilities, to create a lot of  job opportunities, and to boost the exports of nonoil and nongas  commodities.    While the public sector is now opened to foreign capital, we  have to further scrutinize the legal aspects and the  implications of the deregulation package. Section 33 of the  1945 Constitution stipulates that various kinds of production  activities that are strategic to the nation and those that cater  to the needs of many people, should be controlled by the state.    However, according to Sanyoto Satrowardoyo, minister for  investment development, the Government Regulation does not  contradict the 1967 Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment. Meanwhile,  Murdiono, minister/state secretary, said that the latest  deregulation package on foreign capital investment clearly  defines the 1967 Law No. 1. On the other hand, we should  realize that there must be objective, effective, and timely  adjustments to suit the rapidly developing situation.    Five years ago, developing countries like PRC, Vietnam,  Bangladesh, and India were considered to be closed to foreign  capital investment. Nowadays, we are facing keener competition  from these countries in attracting foreign investment in  response to the process of globalization.    Another main reason for the announcement of the deregulation  on foreign investment is to enable the economy to grow above 6  percent, which has been fixed as the precondition to overcome  unemployment. This is because population growth in Indonesia is  still relatively high. Indonesia needs at least 660 trillion  rupiah in new investment during the current sixth five-year  development plan and 73 percent of the total is expected from  private investment, including foreign capital.    Still, despite the seemingly attractive incentives offered  by  the new regulation, will the foreign investors be attracted to  invest in Indonesia and can the foreign capital increase the  limited funds owned by the local private sector? There are  other factors that determine the investment climate in the  country. They are, among others, economic and political  stability and the risks from growing corrupt practices and  collusion. Accordingly, we should exercise caution against such  country risks [preceding two words in English] to attract  foreign capital.    Besides, the foreign capital that is invested in vital  public  sectors should be fully controlled, supervised, and managed by  the state. Otherwise, the risks are very high.</p>

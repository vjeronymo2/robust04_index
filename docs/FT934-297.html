			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Text of Bank of Spain statement The following is an unofficial translation of a statement issued by the Bank of Spain: Note to central banks and foreign supervisory authorities. The Bank of Spain has agreed, as of today's date, the substitution of administrative organs of the Banco Espanol de Credito in accordance with the Third Title of Law 26/1988, July 29, on Discipline and Intervention by the Credit Bodies. Consequently, by this accord, effective immediately, Banco Espanol de Credito's administrative council is wound up and the Entity (Banesto) remains under the supervision of the provisional new administrative body named by the Bank of Spain, and composed of the following persons: Alfredo Saenz Abad, who will act as president; Ildefonso Ayala Garcia; Marcial Portela Alvarez; Epifanio Ridraejo Briueva; Matias Rodriguez Inciarte. The aforementioned provisional administrative body remains under the direct supervision of the Bank of Spain, through having been designated to exercise the public faculties that the law confers upon it. Banesto's situation has forced the adoption of restructuring measures that could not be taken by the Entity in isolation by itself and which require, on the contrary, the support of the whole banking system, in its case of the Guarantee Fund for Deposits in Banking Establishments. Those reasons have determined the composition of the new governing body, which will always act in the best and exclusive interest of the depositors and shareholders of Banesto. Its mission is to maintain the Entity's normal functioning, and to set up a restructuring programme in collaboration with the Bank of Spain, and, in particular, to ensure the stability and future of the entity, maintaining at all times the full confidence of the depositors and the financial markets. In this way the Bank of Spain guarantees the liquidity of the institutions in local and foreign markets, adopting all measures necessary to that end. - Madrid, December 28 1993</p>

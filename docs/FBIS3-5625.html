			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Both the Construction and  Finance Ministries and several local governments Wednesday [9  March] announced decisions to suspend contracts for their public  works projects with Kajima Corp. for several months in a protest  over the rearrest of its former vice president in a bribery  scandal.    The two ministries said they will prevent the major  contractor from being offered public works projects for up to  three months.    Saitama and Fukui are among the prefectural governments  which  will bar the company from their projects for five months, while  Karatsu in Saga Prefecture, southern Japan, will take the same  measure for six months.    Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama was rearrested  Tuesday for his suspected involvement in allegedly bribing  former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura with 10 million  yen.    This is the first time the Construction Ministry has  suspended a company from public works projects in relation to  the alleged bribery of a Diet member.    Kajima is one of eight major general contractors at the  center of investigations into a series of bribery scandals  involving politicians and construction firms.    On Wednesday morning, prosecutors raided Kajima's head  office  in Tokyo in connection with Nakamura's alleged acceptance of the  10 million yen bribe from the construction giant.    The raids covered more than 30 locations, including the  homes  of Kajima Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa and President Akira Miyazaki.    On Tuesday, prosecutors rearrested Kiyoyama for allegedly  passing the bribe to Nakamura, a House of Representatives  member, for his help in heading off a Fair Trade Commission  criminal complaint over a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama  Prefecture in 1992.    Prosecutors are asking the Diet to remove Nakamura's  parliamentary immunity to allow his arrest.    Despite the punitive action against Kajima, the central  Japan  city of Nagano signed a contract with a joint venture led by the  scandal-tainted company Wednesday for the construction of the  1998 Winter Olympics speed skating venue, city officials said.    Nagano city officials approved the pact with the Kajima-led  joint venture because its sanctions against Kajima were  irrelevant since Kiyoyama was not a representative of the firm  at the time of arrest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard report: "Americans and Europeans </F> Opposed Over Plan for Military Transport Plane"]    [Text] The United States and the European countries are  engaged in a "show of strength" over a plan for a new military  transport plane. "The FTP [Future Transport Plane] program (a  European program intended to replace the Transall plane)  directly competes with the U.S. aeronautics industry which  clearly wants it to fail," Albert Voilquin, senator for Les  Vosges, said in a report published on Tuesday, 12 April, and  devoted to the future of military air transport in France.    From 2003 onward, France is due to replace its Transall  planes, which were put into service in 1967 and some of which  were modernized after 1981. According to Mr. Voilquin,  requirements are for a fleet of planes capable of carrying 950  tonnes over a distance of 7,000 km or 1,500 tonnes over a  distance of 1000 km according to the mission selected. In all,  this fleet should comprise between 60 and 70 planes.    Six European countries -- Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and  Portugal, in addition to France -- have come together to design  a plane known as FTP, and two other European countries --  Belgium and Britain -- are participating as observers (allowing  their industrial groups -- Flabel and British Aerospace -- to  fund their own investment without the assurance of a national  order).  <H5>  Doubts About Britain </H5>   The FTP program has been revised and amended several times  with the aim of considerably reducing the costs. Today, on the  basis of a total requirement of around 300 planes, the overall  cost is estimated at around 188 billion francs [Fr], Fr50  billion of which to be contributed by France (less than the  development cost of the Rafale, Mr. Voilquin points out). "If  we build a European plane," the senator writes, "we give French  industry the opportunity of producing the equivalent of 500  A-320 Airbus planes, in other words, more than 33 million hours  of work and more than 5,000 jobs per year over 20 years."    Before giving preference to this solution, France has  examined the possibility of buying existing or proposed planes  from abroad. Some, like the Boeing 747 cargo or the A-340 Airbus  are not in their present form suited to the transportation in  their holds of heavy or light armored vehicles and helicopters,  even if they are partly dismantled. Others, like the American  C-17 are too expensive. Yet others, like the Ilyushin 76 or the  Antonov 124, have many technical and commercial drawbacks. And  finally the development of others, like the Antonov 77, has been  halted.    That is why France supports the European FTP program with  17.8 percent of the funding. In October 1993, the plane entered  what is know as its feasability phase, which involves a spending  of Fr50 million by the French side. "If the FTP does not see  the light of day, the European countries' air forces, which will  sooner or later have to renew their transport fleets, will be  forced to buy outside Europe. The European aeronautical  industry would be likely to lose a large part of its  technological capabilities and Europe a part of its  independence," Albert Voilquin notes.    The Europeans' camp could be divided in face of an offer by  the United States which is leading by putting on the market the  latest version of the Hercules (the C-130J) produced by the  Lockheed group and to which the British seem particularly  sensitive. In a 48-page report which has just been published in  London, the House of Commons suggests the "off-the-shelf"  purchase of 30 C-130J planes to start the replacement of the  British fleet of 60 Hercules planes, while advising the general  staffs to take into consideration the European FTP for the  remaining 30 planes next century.    Analyzing the "trial of strength" which will start on both  sides of the Atlantic, the senator thinks that European industry  is probably "fighting for its survival" in this affair. The  British Government therefore holds in its hands the fate of the  FTP program. In 1989, the United Kingdom withdrew officially  from the European project, authorizing British Aerospace, its  aeronautical constructor, to continue to be included in it at  its own financial risk.    "The implementation of the FTP program would be a strong  symbol of the success of the gradual creation of European  defense cooperation. Its failure would be a failure for  Europe," Mr. Voilquin writes, assessing at 20,000 the number of  jobs which could thus be created in Europe.</p>

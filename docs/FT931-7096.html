			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Chairman bows to criticism: Ambulance board considered sacking senior executive Concern over lack of accountability MR JIM HARRIS, chairman of the London Ambulance Service board, announced his resignation when yesterday's report was published. It was also announced that Mr John Wilby, the service's former chief executive, was about to be dismissed when he resigned in October after the computer collapse. Mr Chris Spry, general manager of South West Thames regional health authority, said a number of concerns had been raised with Mr Wilby at his annual performance review in spring last year. These included concerns about his leadership style. He said Mr Wilby would not have been aware that the board had decided to terminate his contract when he resigned. Mr Harris, announcing his resignation at a press conference in the ambulance service headquarters, said: 'It is clear that a review of the accountability arrangements between the regional health authority and the London Ambulance Service is necessary. In order to allow that process to proceed without inappropriate distraction, I have decided to step aside as chairman of the LAS board with effect from next Monday.' It appeared from Mr Harris's replies to questions about the non-statutory board's management of the service that it had experienced difficulties in questioning decisions of executive directors. 'You either have to fire the lot or accept what they say,' he said. Yesterday's report raises important issues of managerial and public accountability in the service and, by implica-tion, other areas of the reformed National Health Service. The resignations of both the chairman and former chief executive of the service are unlikely to end discussion about whether the introduction of a more devolved and supposedly business-like management structure may have contributed to the computer problems not being spotted earlier. In 1989 the government decided, as part of the process of shifting the NHS towards locally-based management, that regional health authorities should stop running non-core services. This led the South West Thames region, which had managed the London Ambulance Service, to set up an arms-length board in 1990. While the regional authority remained accountable for the service the board became responsible for day-to-day management. The inquiry report concludes that, although lines of accountability looked secure on paper, the board was in practice given insufficient information to exercise its delegated responsibilities. 'Neither was it apparent that they actively sought such information.' The regional authority believed it important not to interfere, having set up the board at arms-length. Although the board and the regional authority realised there were continuing problems with the implementation of the computer system, says the report, both 'consistently accepted assurances' from ambulance service executive directors that problems were being rectified and successful implementation would be achieved. 'At no time was a full independent review commissioned of the true state of the project.' Union leaders say they repeatedly tried to draw concerns to the attention of the management and board, and are calling on the entire board to join Mr Harris in resigning. Mr Stuart Barber, national officer of the public service union Nupe, said: 'I was personally the author of hundreds of letters to the board.'</p>

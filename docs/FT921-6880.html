			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Gloom on French economy - but the doom is overdone: If the recessionary clouds are darker than expected, they are not without a silver lining ALMOST every time President Francois Mitterrand appears in public, he chides the French people for their pervasive mood of gloom. 'France has the highest average income in Europe,' he said earlier this month. 'I want to convince you that the French are as capable as others of overcoming the crisis. Our economy is in good health.' Fundamentally the French economy is indeed in good health, and it has received an approving verdict in the latest report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But the current gloom about the economy is justified: revised government figures show that the recession in France is significantly more severe than was previously forecast. The Statistical Institute had been counting on gross domestic product growth of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, to give overall growth for 1991 of 1.4 per cent. However, the latest figures show that the economy was flat in the fourth quarter, and that the final figure for growth in 1991 was barely 1 per cent. The rising trend of the unemployment figures is an increasing preoccupation for a government facing the prospect of a severe rebuff in next month's regional elections, and the near-certainty of defeat in the general elections a year from now. During September, October and November the unemployment figures rose steeply. And though the rate of increase appeared to slow significantly in December, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at the turn of the year was equivalent to 9.8 per cent of the workforce, compared with 9.1 per cent in 1990. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, recently said: 'We shall avoid 3m unemployed in 1992.' But figures published yesterday show that unemployment rose again in January, bringing the total to 2,860,000. The Labour Ministry yesterday predicted that the number of job-seekers would decline, in crude terms, in coming months. But the unadjusted unemployment figures are already up to 2,965,617, only a whisker short of the politically fateful figure of 3m despite three government-sponsored job creation packages in less than a year. If the recession has a silver lining, it is the continued decline in inflation and a sharp improvement in the trade figures. The 0.1 per cent increase in the retail price index in December brought the overall increase for 1991 to 3.1 per cent. This was not just an improvement on the previous two years (3.4 per cent in 1990 and 3.6 per cent in 1989), but also a better performance than in most of France's neighbours, including Germany (4.2 per cent), Netherlands (4.9), Italy (6.5) and Switzerland (5.3). The improved competitiveness of the French economy has been reflected in a sharp recovery in the trade figures. Last year the total trade deficit fell from just under FFr50bn (Pounds 5.09bn) to just over FFr30bn (Pounds 3.05bn). The trade deficit in civil industrial goods fell from nearly FFr86bn in 1990 to just over FFr49bn in 1991. France has also made a spectacular turn-around in its trade balance with the rest of the European Community, from a deficit of FFr39bn in 1990 to a small surplus of FFr2bn in 1991. The positive trend in the trade balance was confirmed yesterday with figures for January, showing a surplus of FFr3.6bn, compared with a deficit of FFr2.7bn in December. The recession has, however, blown the government's budgetary strategy off course. Last year it managed to stay pretty well within its planned spending limits, but tax receipts collapsed. As a result, the Finance Ministry says the 1991 budget out-turn will be FFr123bn, compared with a target of FFr80bn. The knock-on effect of the tax short-fall is that it is doubtful whether the government can stay within its 1992 planned budget deficit of FFr90bn. Here the critical unknown factor is the timing of the recovery. The most recent forecast by the Statistical Office pointed to an annual growth rate of 2 per cent during the first half of this year. This was broadly consistent with the calculations of the OECD, which forecast a rate of 1.9 per cent in the first half, accelerating to 2.4 per cent in the second. However, both these predictions were made in December, before the depth of the recession was fully known. Moreover, the record suggests that France needs a growth rate of at least 2 per cent to stabilise unemployment and of 3 per cent to bring it down. It is not surprising, therefore, that the OECD forecasts unemployment will continue to rise this year, before stabilising at slightly over 10 per cent; not surprising, but very uncomfortable for a Socialist government.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY 1992 FORECASTS FOR FRENCH ECONOMY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               OECD   Insee*   BNP   Goldman Sachs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP growth %                   2.1     1.0    2.1       1.4 Unemployment %                10.1    10.2    n/a      10.3 trade balance FFrbn          -10**    -9.5    -20     -43.8 Inflation (annual rate) %      2.9     1.8    2.9       3.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Forecasts for first half 1992. ** USDollars bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: OECD Economic Outlook Dec 1991; Insee December 1991;Banque Nationale de Paris, 1st quarter 1992; Goldman Sachs, February 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: EIS moves ahead to Pounds 14.4m and expects further advance EIS GROUP has extended its record of continuous profit and dividend growth to 21 years and predicted another improvement in 1992. The specialist engineer reported pre-tax profits ahead by 7 per cent to Pounds 14.4m in 1991. This was in line with expectations and with the interim results when profits rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 7.06m. Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said conditions remained tough. 'But we're budgeting for an improvement this year and we're happy to say we achieved our budget in the first quarter,' he said. Turnover increased to Pounds 190m (Pounds 178m) of which 52 per cent (48 per cent) was generated overseas. Interest receivable grew to Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 1.21m) as net cash at the year end increased to Pounds 13m, thanks to last year's Pounds 18m rights issue. Flexibox, the seals and transmission couplings subsidiary, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.19m). Pre-tax profits of the aircraft engineering division fell to Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 3.09m). Mr Haslehurst said that was entirely caused by a cost overrun on an unnamed, sizeable project. Process equipment, which includes a range of vacuum pumps, suffered from price competition but increased pre-tax profits 11 per cent to Pounds 4.41m due to reduced costs. Capital expenditure fell to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.7m). However, this reflected price reductions rather than lower investment levels, Mr Haslehurst said. Staff numbers were reduced by 350 to 3,850, leading to restructuring costs of about Pounds 750,000. Earnings per share fell to 28.526p (28.769p adjusted for the rights). A recommended final dividend of 8.525p makes a total of 11.7p (11.4p). COMMENT The market forgave EIS' unfortunate cost overrun in its aircraft division, concentrating instead on the company's well-regarded management and ability to cope with costs. The shares gained 8p against the trend to 394p, helped by optimistic noises about the outlook and by news that capacity has been increased at Davall Moulded Gear, the precision gear system maker. But while EIS has proved it can handle recession, most of its businesses will be late beneficiaries of the upturn. Davall should come out early, in line with business machines, but aircraft engineering and the process equipment's vacuum range are still some way off. On that assessment, forecast profits this year of Pounds 15m put the shares on just over 14 times earnings and suggest they are well valued. The rating is slightly ahead of its sector, but the premium is underwritten by EIS's 21-year record.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals and computer side curb IMI IMI, international engineering group, saw pre-tax profits nudge up in 1993, but its advance was held back by losses in its computer business and by the restructuring of its fluid power division. Pre-tax profits for the year to end December were Pounds 70.2m against Pounds 68m. Earnings per share came out ahead at 13.8p (13.6p). A same-again final dividend of 5.8p is recommended, to maintain the total payment at 10p. The figures were in line with expectations, but the promise of further recovery, implicit in the results and carefully indicated in the formal statement of the chairman, Sir Eric Pountain, helped the share price rise 7p to 347p. Turnover increased to Pounds 1.06bn (Pounds 1.01bn). Three of the four main business groups - building products, drinks dispensers and special engineering - had significant increases in operating profits. Only the fluid power division, where there was a decline in operating profits to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 16.9m), broke the pattern. Mr Gary Allen, the chief executive, reported a 3 per cent increase in trading volume in the US last year and a 2 per cent increase during the second half in the UK, but falls in Germany, Italy and Spain. The troublesome titanium operations were in and out of profit during 1993, falling back into loss during the last quarter. Mr Allen expects the business to be in profit by the second half. With losses at the group's copper tube plant eliminated by reductions in the cost base and a Pounds 30m investment programme, the group's problem area has been computers. Losses at Brook Street Computers led to the sale of the company, acquired in 1990, at a loss of Pounds 5.9m, shown in the accounts as an exceptional item. COMMENT Computers replaced titanium and copper as the gremlins in the IMI figures, which showed the group poised for, rather than actually enjoying, recovery. The computer problems should sort themselves out this year as new products from the division come on the market. Like other engineering groups, IMI has been honing both manufacturing and financial efficiency during the recession and an improvement in market conditions would rapidly come through to the bottom line. But the prospects for that look patchy, suggesting a steady advance for the group this year, perhaps towards Pounds 90m pre-tax, and a much stronger move in 1995. With earnings going up to 19p a share, this would put the shares on a multiple of 18, more keenly priced than some of their peers but demanding of their holders patience as a virtue.</p>

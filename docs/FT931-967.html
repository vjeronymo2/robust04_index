			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: BMW makes first-term profit BMW is escaping the worst of the downturn afflicting the German motor industry, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the group's chief executive said yesterday. Mr von Kuenheim, who later this year will take over as chairman of BMW's supervisory board after 24 years as chief executive, said the group made an operating profit in the first three months of the year - in stark contrast to other German car manufacturers which have plunged into operating losses. Whilst both sales and production dropped over the three months, Mr von Kuenheim said that the drop was significantly less than that of the German market overall, where car registrations were likely to fall by 25 per cent over the year. BMW's turnover was down by 6.4 per cent to DM7.3bn (Dollars 4.6bn) in the first quarter compared to the same period last year and car production slipped by 4.9 per cent to 150,500 units. Car deliveries fell 5.7 per cent to 133,000. Last week, BMW reported net profits for last year down to DM726m from DM783m, although turnover climbed almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn. BMW said that currency movements had been the chief factor behind the downturn: the appreciation of the mark in the latter months of last year had shaved DM200m to DM300m from operating profits. These were down to DM1.48bn last year from DM1.75bn in 1991. The BMW group delivered a record 594,895 cars last year, 42,235 more than in 1991. The US saw sharp growth where deliveries rose by more than 20 per cent to 66,000. BMW said yesterday that it expected US sales to increase by at least 10,000 cars this year.</p>

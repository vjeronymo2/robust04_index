			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Guns fire on after weapons deadline UNITED Nations monitoring of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo yesterday gave the Bosnian capital a relatively quiet day, Reuter reports. But the UN commander in the city, General Hussein Ali Abdul Razek, called it 'only one step on a long road to peace'. Elsewhere in the republic the guns fired on. Serb forces yesterday fired heavy artillery and mortar shells at Bihac for the fourth consecutive day in spite of the deadline for the monitoring of heavy weapons, the town's Moslem defenders said. UN sources confirmed that Howitzers and tank cannon pounded the outskirts of the north-west Bosnian town and shells landed in the deserted centre after sirens sent frightened civilians scurrying for cover. Eyewitnesses heard no artillery being fired from Moslem positions in Bihac. Four hours before Saturday's noon deadline, Serb infantry were also said to have mounted a three-pronged attack on the village of Golubic, just 5km to the south-east. 'It was a long-planned attack with the aim of taking Bihac,' said Mr Ramiz Drekovic, commander of the Bosnian Defence Force in one of the last pockets of territory in western Bosnia still controlled by Moslem forces. 'The Serbs are given one deadline, then a second and no action is ever taken,' Mr Drekovic said. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said at the weekend that all his heavy artillery was now being watched and monitors would be able to confirm that Serb forces never started firing first. Military sources said UN observers had visited some weapons sites in the Bihac area but co-operation in some places depended on the character of the Serbs in charge. Building up trust was essential, they said.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Accountancy firm to shed 225 jobs KPMG PEAT Marwick McLintock, the UK's second largest accountancy firm, is making 225 qualified staff redundant, mainly in London and south-east England - probably the largest single batch of redundancies made by a UK accountancy firm. Since December last year, Ernst &amp; Young, the UK's third biggest accountancy firm, has made about 100 qualified staff redundant, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the largest firm, has said that at least 200 staff will go in the next few months. Other large firms have been discreetly 'counselling out' unwanted staff and many medium-size firms have also been cutting employees. Such redundancies were unheard of in the 1980s when the big firms grew between 20 and 40 per cent a year in terms of fees and staff. The firms are now being squeezed by increasing costs and falling revenues. Mr Jim Butler, a senior partner in Peat Marwick, said the reason for the redundancies was that young, newly qualified staff were failing to leave for jobs in industry and the City and that as a result the firm had become marginally overstaffed. 'In the past our problem was retaining people, but now we have the opposite problem. There is virtually no movement at all.' He said the redundancies should be seen in the context of Peat Marwick's total professional staff of about 7,000. The redundancies affect people with up to three years' post-qualification experience, and will not change the firm's plans to recruit 850 graduate trainees later this year.</p>

MacLennan] </F>   [Text] Berlin March 10 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel said on Thursday [10 March] afternoon there was  talk that a coup had begun in Bisho, Ciskei.    Speaking in Eastern Cape town of Berlin, he apologised for  cutting his electioneering meeting short. "There are problems in  the Ciskei at the moment in Bisho. There's talk of a coup."    He said he was was going to see what was going on. "Let's  hold thumbs it doesn't lead to bloodshed."    However, spot telephone inquiries to people working in  Bisho late on Thursday afternoon did not reveal anything unusual  in the Ciskei capital.    A lawyer in Bisho told SAPA "nothing extraordinary" was  happening. He said he had a bird's eye view of the town's main  etreet from a hill in neighbouring King William's Town.    A businesswoman said she had heard "talk of toyi-toying  [protest dancing] by NEHAWU (the National Education, Health and  Allied Workers Union".    Soldiers had been coming and going throughout the day, but  there was nothing unusual in that, she added.    A local bottle store was "as busy as heck" shortly before  5pm, and civil servants were among the customers.</p>

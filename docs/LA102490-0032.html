			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CIVIL RIGHTS;  </P> <P> BUSH'S VETO MAKES ALL AMERICANS LOSERS;  </P> <P> FAILURE TO BRING BLACK AMERICANS INTO THE MAINSTREAM IS IMMORAL; IT'S ALSO A  FURTHER DRAG ON OUR ECONOMY.  </P> <P> From my office in the West Wing of the White House I could see the windows of  the adjacent Executive Office Building redden with the first light of a June  dawn. I had spent the entire night drafting a speech that Lyndon Johnson was to  deliver at the Howard University commencement that very afternoon.  </P> <P> "Now we've got voting rights, Dick," the President had told me, "but that's  just the tail on the pig. Now we've got to go for the whole hog." I had worked  closely enough with Johnson to understand the object of his porcine quest. A  series of civil-rights laws had swept aside the legal barriers to equal  opportunity. The task now was to transform the abstractions of law into reality  -- jobs, income, standard of living, equal treatment in every sector of life.  </P> <P> Legal equality was not enough. Not for those who had been crippled by  generations of gateless poverty, preceded by two centuries of slavery. A few  laws could not compensate for so long a heritage of oppression.  </P> <P> So Johnson was ready to take the next step -- decisive, far-reaching  affirmative action to provide American blacks with the education, jobs, access  to income essential to make them full members of American society.  </P> <P> Two months later, American combat troops were on their way to Vietnam. The  necessities of war had overwhelmed the President's profoundly held intention to  remedy the single most brutal injustice of American history -- the racial  oppression that was, and that remains, the great original sin of the American  nation.  </P> <P> From that day to this the relative condition of black Americans has worsened by  every measure -- from infant mortality to income. And we have done virtually  nothing about it.  </P> <P> Finally, just the other day, Congress passed a rather mild "civil-rights bill"  that takes a few small steps toward the goals so loftily proclaimed on that  June day a quarter of a century ago. It is a decent bill, one that will make it  somewhat easier for blacks to enter the mainstream of American society. Not  full equality, but a step in that direction.  </P> <P> And the President of the United States, one George Bush, has vetoed that bill.  Using a series of tendentious rationalizations -- too riddled with misstatement  and misunderstanding to permit detailed refutation -- he has deprived black  Americans of their first real glimmer of hope since the moral destruction of  the war in Vietnam. Thus the Republican successor to the Great Emancipator has  -- perhaps unwittingly -- become the instrument of the great oppression. Once  again the promises made to the ear have been broken to the heart.  </P> <P> It does not require a litany of statistics, the accumulation of evidence from  daily life, to prove a self-evident reality -- America is a nation riddled with  racism. Black Americans live shorter and more impoverished lives, the vitality  and intelligence of black children is snuffed out at an early age. Almost all  aspects of our national life -- those that offer opportunities and rewards for  achievement -- are at least partially closed to blacks. And for most those  doors begin to close from the moment of birth.  </P> <P> There is no rational way to deny this reality. But should you doubt it, visit  South-Central Los Angeles or, for that matter, the inner cities of every major  urban center. You will see it for yourself -- conditions so abysmal, social  institutions so defective that mere survival is an achievement and only the  strongest and most fortunate can hope to emerge.  </P> <P> Blacks are the sufferers from oppression. But we are all losers. We cannot  afford to eliminate a large number of our fellow citizens from the enterprise  and production on which the well-being of all Americans is based. The resistant  racism that stains America has created a burden and a cost that all of us must  bear. And when the history of U.S. economic decline is written -- in a not too  distant future -- the failure to assimilate black Americans will rank high  among the causes.  </P> <P> Moral imperatives and practical necessities do not always coincide. But this is  such a time. George Bush has not simply made a mistake or done the wrong thing.  He has committed an enormous wrong -- against blacks, against the founding  principles of his own party and against the idea of America itself. He  proclaims himself passionately attached to the Pledge of Allegiance. Perhaps he  should read it more carefully. It calls for "liberty and justice for all." Not  all whites or all employers, but everyone. And in vetoing the civil-rights act  he participates in a denial of that justice to millions. Thus, he joins Ronald  Reagan in that mercifully short roll of shame -- Presidents who have betrayed  their solemn obligation, sworn to before God, to strike down the weapons by  which fellow citizens are denied the equality that is amply guaranteed in law  but so cruelly deprived in practice.  </P></p>

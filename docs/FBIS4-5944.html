			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korean Revolution With Leader and People in Perfect </F> Harmony Will Be Ever-victorious" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  describes the unity of the leader and the people in harmonious  whole as the greatest gain of the Korean revolution and the  source of the invincible might of Korean-style socialism.    The paper in an editorial dedicated to the birthday of the  great leader President Kim Il-song stresses that the whole  history of the Korean revolution is proud annals which have seen  the achievement of the perfect unity between the leader and the  revolutionary soldiers, between the leader and the people and  victorious advance of the revolution based on its might.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "Since the dawn of our revolution, the Korean communists  have  been convinced that they could carve out the thorny  revolutionary road only under the leadership of the great  Comrade Kim Il-song, and have won victories, enduring all  ordeals, and lived and fought with everlasting, single-hearted  loyalty to him, entrusting their destinies entirely to him."    The editorial continues:    Since the beginning of his revolutionary activities, the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has always believed in the  people and found himself among them in leading the revolution,  unreservedly displaying the qualities and traits of a great  leader of the people.    The great leader believes in the people and the latter trust  and follow him. The bonds between them are those of kinship  between the father and his children; they are so unbreakable  that they can withstand any storm and stress and accomplish  anything. Thus, the Korean revolution began with the harmonious  unity between the leader and the people and has traversed a  brilliant course on the basis of its might.    The perfect unity between the leader and the people is a  mighty strength in resolutely defending the cause of  Korean-style socialism.    The might of perfect unity between the leader and the people  is fully demonstrated in the Korean revolution because it is one  living body of common destiny and an integral whole in ideology  and purpose.    He has always sincerely trusted the revolutionary soldiers  and people and regarded their destiny as his own, while the  people have absolutely trusted him as the centre and top brain  of their lives and resolutely defended him.    Still today he is leading the people along the road of  socialism, unswervingly assuming responsibility for their  destiny, and the people are entrusting their destiny to the  party and the leader and fighting with the unshakable resolve to  follow them forever.    Our people have staunchly fought, taking the immortal chuche  idea as their unshakable faith and the only banner of unity  since the great leader founded this revolutionary idea.    The unity of our people in ideology and purpose is growing  stronger because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is  constantly developing the chuche idea to perfection.    The perfect unity between the leader and the people is  mighty  because it is being carried forward and consolidated through  generations for the accomplishment of the cause of socialism.    The vigorous advance of the whole party, the entire people  and the whole army closely united behind the dear leader shows  that the harmonious unity between the leader and the people,  which has been formed and consolidated through history, is being  successfully carried forward with eternal vitality.    The source of the solidity of our perfect harmony is the  great leader's idea of "believing in the people as in heaven."  Our perfect harmony based on this great idea will never be  broken.    The integral whole of the leader, the party and the people  has been, is and will remain the lifeline of our socialism and  the all- conquering banner.    We must make the advance of our revolution a history of the  most tight bonds of kinship between the leader and the people,  between the leader and the soldiers in the future, too.</p>

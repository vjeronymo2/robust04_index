			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Aegon ahead 10.5% at Fl 827m AEGON, one of the leading insurance groups in the Netherlands, yesterday reported a 10.5 per cent increase in 1991 net profit, to Fl 827m (Dollars 445m) from Fl 749m. Group operating income climbed to Fl 712.8m from Fl 645m. Aegon said total revenue advanced to Fl 13.6bn from Fl 12.04bn, an increase of 13.2 per cent. Of this, premium income generated Fl 7.9bn, up Fl 750m. Investment and other income accounted for Fl 4.89bn, an increase of Fl 843m. Aegon turned in a strong performance in the life insurance sector in its two main geographical markets, the US and the Netherlands. The operating result from the life insurance business rose to Fl 721m from Fl 624m. This more than compensated for a continued weakness in its other European markets, where operating losses more than doubled to Fl 19m, concentrated in the accident, health and general insurance sectors. Aegon is forecasting 'a clear increase' in 1992 operating income, which, on a per-share basis, will 'at least equal' the Fl 15.45 last year. The board has proposed a dividend of Fl 7.35 per share, an increase of Fl 0.25.</p>

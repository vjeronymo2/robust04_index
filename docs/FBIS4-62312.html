			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels May 13 TASS -- Russia and NATO will  possibly sign two documents on cooperation simultaneously: a  framework document on the "Partnership for Peace" programme and  a bilateral programme for partnership, said Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin in an exclusive interview  with ITAR-TASS here on Friday after today's meeting with NATO  Deputy Secretary-General Gebhardt von Moltke.    In the opinion of the deputy minister this "should remove  misunderstandings and apprehensions on both sides".    "I have developed an impression that NATO started to  understand better after the recent events around the Bosnian  city of Gorazde that real partnership presupposes serious  preliminary consulations with Russia before taking decisions,"  he added.    "Partnership for Peace is only a part of the general picture  of our cooperation, although an important one," the deputy  minister continued. "In this case, the sides should find a true  correlation between the principle of equality of all countries  wishing to join the programme for multilateral cooperation and  the objective account of Russia's role and position."    Therefore, the sides will put signatures under the  multilateral document already signed by 16 NATO countries and 18  east European states, including eight former Soviet republics,  on the one hand, and a bilateral programme of partnership  between NATO and Russia, determining specific parameters of  cooperation, on the other.    "Regrettably," Adamishin noted, "there is much confusion  about the multilateral document in our country. In actual fact,  it is a statement of intention to cooperate and not to conduct  hostile actions.    "If we compare it with the trade and economic sphere, it is  'a protocol of intent' which should be specified and amplified.  But it does not impose any obligations on either side to take  joint decisions, to conduct joint operations or to standardise  weapons. That is, it does not tie our hands."    The bilateral document can and must be more specific, and  NATO, according to Von Moltke, is waiting with great interest  for the Russian side's ideas on this issue.    "Nobody will be able and does not intend to thrust upon us  anything in the bilateral programme, which would not suit  Russia," Adamishin stressed.    The deputy minister said that at today's talks, the NATO  leadership spoke of serious importance it attaches to  cooperation with Russia and of a desire to expand it, especially  through contacts between the military.    This would help the two sides "to forget the image of an  enemy". NATO already reveals some secrets to Russia, which were  a relish piece for intelligence services in the recent past:  data banks, codes, means of communications, etc.    Military and political contacts under the aegis of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council are also fruitfully developing.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KHABAR-SERVIS report: "Railroad Will Link Azerbaijan to </F> Iran"]    [Text] Rafik Zeynalov, deputy chief of the Azerbaijan  Railroad administration and its chief engineer, characterized as  a matter of great strategic importance the construction of the  Astara (Azerbaijan)-Qazvin (Iran) railroad, the possibility of  which was discussed during negotiations between Azerbaijan  President Geydar Aliyev and the head of the Iranian state.  Construction of this line will make it possible to first and  foremost establish a supply line to the Nakhichevan Autonomous  Republic [NAR], weakened by the Armenian seizure of part of  Azerbaijani territories and the blockade of the NAR. Second, it  will link Azerbaijan with two neighboring states--Iran and  Turkey, which will allow the republic a gateway to the  Mediterranean and Asian countries. The Government of Iran also  places great importance on this line, since it will bring to  Iran metal and timber from Russia, which Iran acutely needs. At  the same time, freight transit will bring huge foreign currency  earnings into the Azerbaijani budget. As R. Zeynalov pointed  out, the proposed route for the railroad is the optimal one. In  particular, it is envisaged building a 100-meter-wide rail  bridge over the border river Astarachay.    The chief engineer of the Azerbaijan Railroad emphasized  that  the Russian Ministry of Railroads is already interested in this  project. Foreign companies--the Canadian company Maple Wind, the  largest European company M&amp;M, and the Austrian A-Trade  company--are willing to invest in the construction. The only  condition set by foreign companies' representatives is President  G. Aliyev's personal guarantee. The Azerbaijan Railroad's  leadership recently petitioned the Cabinet of Ministers and  Geydar Aliyev to consider this matter.    The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is willing to  fully finance construction of the line on its territory.    On 2 June 1994 the head of the Azerbaijan Railroad received  written assurance that the final decision on the matter of  building a railroad between Azerbaijan and Iran will be made  during the expected visit of G. Aliyev to Tehran.</p>

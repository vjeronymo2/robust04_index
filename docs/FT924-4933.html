			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Hope for house sales in new year THE long-awaited recovery in house sales is expected to begin next year even though prices may continue to fall for a further 12 months, securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew says today, Andrew Taylor writes. P&amp;D predicts the number of sales could rise by as much as 15 per cent next year. But prices are unlikely to rise and could fall by up to a further 5 per cent, housing analyst Mr John Wriglesworth said. Prices were unlikely to recover until the overhang of 225,000 unsold empty homes was taken up. It is the third forecast in less than a week to predict a rise in sales. Fixed-rate mortgages accounted for more than a fifth of advances for house purchases in the second quarter of this year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said. Lex, Page 16</p>

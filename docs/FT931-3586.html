			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / BA wins temporary approval for USAir link-up THE US gave temporary approval yesterday to British Airways' plans for a partnership with USAir but demanded that London and Washington renegotiate their aviation treaty to allow US airlines greater access to British airports. Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, agreed to BA's request for 'code-sharing' with USAir, which the two carriers hope will create a 'seamless service' by listing USAir's US flights and BA's transatlantic flights under the same codes in computer bookings systems. He also approved plans for USAir to lease aircraft and crews to BA for London-Baltimore and London-Pittsburgh flights, but not for London-Charlotte. Mr Pena said BA's initial Dollars 300m (Pounds 210m) investment in USAir did not breach US laws restricting foreign ownership of US airlines to 25 per cent, but that the second and third phases of the proposed deal, under which BA would invest a further Dollars 450m, could not be completed unless the US Congress changed the law on foreign ownership. This, he hoped, would provide the incentive for the UK to renegotiate the Bermuda 2 treaty: 'If Congress doesn't act, British Airways will have invested Dollars 300m and cannot proceed further. That is the hook.' He said he would review the deal in a year. The 'big three' US carriers - American, United and Delta - which lobbied against the code-sharing arrangement, reacted to the announcement with 'disappointment and puzzlement'. 'There's not a bit of it which makes any policy sense,' said one adviser. BA welcomed Mr Pena's statement, saying it would begin the code-sharing arrangement to three US cities - Cleveland, Syracuse and Rochester - on May 1, as previously announced. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said he was delighted that passengers would be able to fly more easily between airports on the two airlines' networks. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said he broadly welcomed the arrangement and hoped it would attract more passengers to BA from airports it does not serve directly. He added, echoing Mr Pena's comments on bilateral co-operation, that he remained committed 'to achieving greater liberalisation between our two countries across the Atlantic.' Mr Pena said that, although he did not like the terms of the Bermuda 2 treaty between the UK and the US, the US could not disregard it while insisting that Australia and Japan abide by the provisions of their bilateral aviation treaties with Washington.

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CRIME STORY  </P> <P> Life magazine once called him "the mob's young genius," detailing his  organized-crime exploits in a five-page spread. Fortune included him on its  1986 chart of "The 50 Biggest Mafia Bosses." The U.S. government convicted him  in 1986 on racketeering charges, sentencing him to 10 years.  </P> <P> Now, Michael Franzese -- stepson of John (Sonny) Franzese, alleged enforcer of  a New York crime family, who's currently imprisoned -- is back in Hollywood,  renewing his career as a producer.  </P> <P> Through Cammy-Co. Prods. (named for his wife, Cammy), Franzese, 38, is exec  producing "Stryker's Force." According to co-producer Leon Isaac Kennedy, the  action-thriller, now being cast, is the first of three planned projects.  </P> <P> Franzese is also working with CBS on a miniseries -- packaged by his agency,  ICM -- about his life.  </P> <P> In the mid-'80s, Franzese produced four low-budget films. One, "Knights of the  City" (1986), starred Kennedy. According to the Life magazine piece, Franzese  kept up his wheeling and dealing from behind bars.  </P> <P> "We stayed in touch while he served his time," said Kennedy, explaining that  they began talking their film projects "about four or five months ago."  (Franzese was released in May.)  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, he's paid his debt to society. And now he's starting  again -- his life is on a whole new course.  </P> <P> "One of the great things about America," Kennedy added, "is that you can start  again." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

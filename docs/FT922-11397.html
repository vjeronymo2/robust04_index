			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Look east for the quota problem - A tale of frustration over international textile regulations It all seemed so easy. Carolyn Whitwell had a shop in Bristol ready to open. She had supplies of clothing ready to transport from India. She had never even dreamed of the existence of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA). The MFA governs world trade in textiles. In practical terms it means that if you want to export clothing from India you need 'quota' - approval from the Indian authorities. The origins of Carolyn's business lie in a twinning arrangement between the Bishopston district of Bristol and the south Indian village of K V Kuppam. The people of Bishopston asked those of K V Kuppam what they most wanted. The answer came back: jobs. An enterprise began, involving at first six tailors in India. K V Kuppam is in a cotton-growing area with a traditional village textile industry. Carolyn and her partner, Jaki Collard, supplied sample garments, and within weeks the first products were ready. Carolyn, a former nurse, had put herself through a business course at Bristol University. She had no experience, but a lot of enthusiasm, and some luck. A Pounds 1,500 insurance payout after her home was burgled provided some working capital. Then they heard about the quota. 'We knew nothing about international trading,' said Carolyn, 'and we couldn't get our clothes out of India without quota.' Carolyn learnt that a quota was awarded on the basis of past export performance. 'So how did new exporters get started?' Nobody knew - or nobody who knew was telling. In desperation, Carolyn rang everyone she could think of who might help. No one wanted to know. Finally a friendly response from clothing retailers Oasis Trading referred her to its Delhi agent. From the agent Carolyn learned of 'sample quotas'. You could export 25 garments every 10 days, as samples. Form two companies and you could export 50 items every 10 days. Then there was 'first-come-first-served quota,' awarded to those who put in the highest bids. And once established, you qualify for 'past performance quota.' Anomalies abound. Carolyn can never get enough dress quota. Why? Because other exporters pass off long T-shirts as dresses to get round the shortage of shirt quota. One wheeze she discovered was to package jackets and trousers together and call them a suit: two garments thus pass as one item. Eventually that first day of trading arrived. 'I was intoxicated,' she said. 'Then we ran out of stock after three weeks.' With 1,000 members of the Bishopston Link there was no problem finding customers or staff for the shop. But obtaining sufficient supplies was another matter. The Delhi agents were far from K V Kuppam in south India. And they had to be paid months in advance. In K V Kuppam, delays meant the village ran out of money to pay for cloth and the tailors. In Bristol, garments had arrived in the wrong season. At the end of the first year, all there was to show for the months of struggle was a Pounds 15,000 loss. 'That was our worst point,' said Carolyn. 'But we could see why we had made a loss. The clothes had all arrived at the wrong time and we had too much stock unsold.' The next year they concentrated on improving quality. The village tailors were used to making garments as fast as possible to maximise earnings. They had to be persuaded they would be paid the same for making fewer but better items. By the third year Bishopston Trading, propped up with a bank loan, a second mortgage and funds from Carolyn's grandfather, finally broke even. Again, a friendly tip from a big company had come to their aid. The Delhi agent was too far from the village, but P &amp; O responded to a call from Carolyn and put her in touch with its own shipping agent in nearby Madras. This modern, efficient, big-city agent was a world away from the primitive village industry, but it agreed to take on Carolyn's little business. Some staff knew nothing of village life, but in time the agents almost took the role of managers, providing the on-the-ground control that was so hard to supply from a distance. Last year the agents came to the rescue when the workforce, by now 70 tailors and 140 handloom weavers, threatened to strike. What had seemed from Bristol like a coming together of two communities - albeit a rich one and a poor one, with a hefty dose of paternalism - seemed different from the viewpoint of the Indian villager. Far from feeling humbly grateful to western benefactors who had created so many jobs, Carolyn's workforce was beginning to exert a little trade union muscle. Unknown to her, her workers had been organised by a communist activist, and were demanding huge pay rises. Carolyn refused to pay, insisting that she was not an employer, simply a benevolent buyer. With mediation from the Madras agents, a 20 per cent rise was eventually agreed. Today the business has a turnover of Pounds 250,000, with three shops, sales through the Oxfam catalogue, and other outlets. Carolyn readily admits to breaking all the rules of business. She does not share the usual business motivation - making money for herself: only recently she raised her own pay to Pounds 4 an hour. And profit is a secondary factor after fair wages and prices, and creating employment  - although in the last full year she made Pounds 15,000. The export quota rules remain a bugbear and a constraint on growth - and likely to remain so, with the Gatt talks on reforming world trade edging closer to failure.

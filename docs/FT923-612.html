			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The problem of too much energy WE HEAR little about a world energy shortage these days, at least compared with the era of oil shocks. The World Energy Congress, which has just concluded its triennial deliberations in Madrid, estimates that there is enough oil to last 44 years, enough gas for 57 years and enough coal for several centuries. Moreover these estimates take little account of the role that technology could play in improving both the supply of energy and the efficiency with which it is consumed. The picture is complicated by the fact that the fastest rates of economic growth in the coming decades may well occur in third-world countries where energy efficiency is lowest. But against this, the former communist countries should make substantial offsetting efficiency gains. Even when the oil and gas do begin to run out, the WEC believes that sufficient strides will have been made to improve the environmental acceptance of both coal and nuclear. Barring the unforeseeable, this portends plentiful and relatively cheap supplies of energy. The WEC does not expect the price of oil to rise much in real terms before the end of the first quarter of the next century, when the exhaustion of known reserves begins to loom. Opec continues to look like an organisation fraying at the edges. This is a comforting outlook for the energy consumer. But the prospect of abundant energy also has its darker side. It provides little incentive for the energy industry to diversify sources of supply and develop new fuel types. The longer the energy market remains secure, the stronger will become the tendency to draw on a narrow range of cheap and convenient fuels - as now in the UK with the shift to natural gas at the expense of coal. A sharper element of uncertainty would produce more hedged energy policies. Although the emergence of a shortage would quickly push up energy prices, this might be too late for the long lead times needed to bring about changes in the energy balance. Another concern must be that cheap energy will remove the stimulus to technological innovation, and that the sharp gains in energy efficiency triggered by the Opec oil shocks could peter out. Similarly, energy at its present oil- dictated price is too cheap to warrant wide-scale development of new forms of energy such as wind and solar, even though these may be needed in the longer term. But the sharpest problems are likely to arise in the mounting tensions between energy and the environment. If the WEC outlook is correct, the energy market will not generate enough pressure to reduce consumption, produce cleaner fuels, and encourage a shift towards renewable energy forms. Quantifying environmental benefits and costs is anything but an exact science, but increasingly governments will have to weigh these calculations as rigorously as possible. The energy/environment balance is one that will need to be struck politically, whether through tighter regulation or, preferably, via the price mechanism using taxes. Although industrialists and consumers in a recession-hit world will be grateful for WEC's comforting message, there is a growing constituency for higher energy prices in a world of traffic jams and dirty powerstations where global warming is becoming a matter of strong public concern. As the world shifts towards a greener agenda the case for a costlier energy structure becomes more compelling. In the context of the 30 years over which the WEC is looking, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that more energy taxes will have to come.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers face 'uphill task' on rubber pact THE ASSOCIATION of Natural Rubber Producing Countries meets in Bali today for its annual forum amid renewed hopes that an international rubber agreement will be negotiated, reports Reuter from Singapore. But association officials said producers would have to struggle to make headway in the battle for a new pact. 'It is going to be an uphill task for producers,' a Malaysian industry official said. 'Consumers are likely to stick to existing provisions as they are happy with current terms.' Key rubber consumers led by the European Community and the US have agreed to renegotiate a new International Natural Rubber Agreement to replace the existing one, which expires in December. But this is conditional upon producers agreeing to a 5 per cent cut in the reference price range that triggers market intervention by the International Natural Rubber Organisation. Rubber producers had until early September refused a reference price cut, saying they would operate a producers-only price stabilisation scheme if Inra fell apart.</p>

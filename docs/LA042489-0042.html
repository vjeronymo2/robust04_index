			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S HOT IN N.Y.? . . . CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> IMPERIOUS MANHATTAN IS EMBRACING STATE'S FASHION, FOOD AND ART.  </P> <P> Could it be that Manhattan, the self-important hub of American cultural  sophistication, is beginning to admire and perhaps even emulate California?  </P> <P> To judge by California-style restaurants, stores, fashion collections and art  galleries springing up in and around Manhattan Island, it would seem that New  Yorkers' attitudes have evolved since Woody Allen dismissed Los Angeles as "a  city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a  red light."  </P> <P> Manhattan, of course, is still Manhattan, and newsstands, tall buildings and  briefcases still predominate. Haberdasheries selling conservative business  attire still vastly outnumber the handful of boutiques selling neon-colored  Lycra bathing suits.  </P> <P> But to gauge the emergence of California influence in Gotham, consider a  three-square-block area in midtown Manhattan around Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street. On Lexington between 59th and 60th is the California Clothing Co.,  purveying sportswear, athletic shoes and lightweight apparel, much of it  imported from California.  </P> <P> Around the corner, on Third Avenue, the Mulholland Drive Cafe, partly owned by  actor Patrick Swayze, offers the authentic feel of an airy L.A. bistro to New  York diners. It draws a fair number of celebrities, and it's big, open space,  typical of Los Angeles-style restaurants, enables patrons to see each other or  be seen. For New Yorkers eager to escape the litter on the streets, the honking  and fumes of traffic, the restaurant offers, in the form of a mural that  extends from the front door to the very back of the restaurant, the soothing  vista of L.A. lights as seen from Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> And back at Lexington and 59th, Bloomingdale's flagship store offers the most  glaring sign of all that things Californian have arrived in New York: A mammoth  promotion of California wares is in full swing.  </P> <P> Arthur Mortimer, a California muralist, has painted the eastern facade of the  building with a work titled "The 12 Californias." In a big corner display  window, sand sculptor Todd Vander Pluym has built representations of California  fun spots, including Disneyland and Universal Studios.  </P> <P> Almost every window, set off by sand and baby cacti, is featuring California  merchandise. The store is brimming with California-designed bathing suits,  dresses, tableware, whole-grain breads, cooked breast of free-range duck, as  well as perfumes bearing the names of Jaclyn Smith and Joan Collins.  </P> <P> For six weeks, Bloomingdale's has been transformed into a California cornucopia  in virtually every department at each of its 17 stores with the theme  "California: The new international style."  </P> <P> It is the first time that Bloomingdale's, which has regularly put on promotions  of wares from countries such as China and France, has chosen instead to focus  on an American state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Life Style People Dream of'  </P> <P> Why? "Bloomingdale's feels that there's a lot of energy and imagination in  California and a fresh, casual, wonderful life style out there that a lot of  people want to emulate," said Miraed Smith, a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman. She  said the idea for the promotion arose because the store's buyers increasingly  felt that trends in clothing fashion and "home fashion" -- linen, tableware,  decorative pottery -- were being set in California. In what may be a heretical  view for a New Yorker, Smith said, "Maybe New York is becoming the Grand Dame  and California is becoming the Bright Young Thing."  </P> <P> Harried New Yorkers yearning for what they imagine is a more relaxed,  sun-filled, easy-going style of living is one big reason for the growing market  for California items in New York. Marjorie S. Deane, owner and publisher of the  Tobe Report, a weekly New York publication on fashion merchandising, said the  California influence in New York, although still limited, is real and growing.  "It's the kind of life style, real or fake, that most people dream of having."  </P> <P> As a result, she says, more New York retail stores are sending buyers to  California in search of special discoveries, although she sees no danger yet  that California is about to overthrow the New York fashion establishment.  </P> <P> Bob Mackie, a California-born fashion designer whose "Spanish mission-inspired"  chiffon evening dresses adorn one window at Bloomingdale's, agrees that "New  Yorkers have always thought that they were the best anywhere and at anything,"  and probably will continue to do so. But he says the allure of California is  growing, and New York is more accepting of ideas from the West Coast. He said  stores such as Bloomingdale's are now more apt to recognize that California  clothing "isn't corny leisure-wear; it's fashion."  </P> <P> Indeed, the openness to outside ideas -- what Deane sees as a trend toward  recognizing that other parts of the country have something to contribute --  seems to account for a growing California influence. Some attribute it to a  perceptible decline in the quality of life in New York -- decaying city  services, legions of homeless, general degradation -- that lately has prompted  comparisons in the press of New York with Calcutta, India.  </P> <P> Among signs of accepting influences from outside is the small but distinct  increase in the number of Manhattan art galleries presenting the works of  California artists.  </P> <P> Pamela Auchincloss, the proprietor of a gallery on Broadway, moved to New York  from Santa Barbara in late 1987. Her gallery features artists from Santa  Barbara and the San Francisco Bay Area. She says that in New York, "there is a  growing acceptance of what is going on in California."  </P> <P> Auchincloss said she doesn't see demand for California art per se, but simply a  perceptible decline in New York chauvinism. "Before, New York had maybe a bit  of an attitude about its art over what's happening in the rest of the world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attractive Presentation  </P> <P> A growing acceptance in New York of contemporary art from outside also has  influenced a Venice gallery, L.A. Louvre, to plan a New York branch, due to  open in September. It will feature California artists, as well as European  painters and sculptors. Peter Goulds, the gallery owner, said: "New York  galleries and museums no longer confine themselves to looking into the city  itself."  </P> <P> In the realm of food, California's influence on New York cuisine has been  notable for some time. It washed across Manhattan in a trend that Armando  Russo, the owner of Cafe LA in Scarsdale, N.Y., called the "Spago-ization" of  New York, and then receded, leaving behind permanent changes in New York  cuisine. It includes an emphasis on salads and fresh vegetables, very light  dishes and above all attractive presentation.  </P> <P> The Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey has a special heading for notable  Manhattan restaurants specializing in California cuisine and reviews nine.  </P> <P> The continuing allure of authentic California ingredients and cuisine is still  apparent in the success of restaurants such as Melrose in Greenwich Village,  where chef Richard Krause, formerly employed at Ma Maison and Spago in Los  Angeles, continues to offer dishes such as black bean soup with creme fraiche,  avocado, cilantro and chilies. Lee Friedman, a co-owner with Krause of the  restaurant, says much of its clientele comes because of the reputation in New  York of Ma Maison and Spago. "Everybody who comes here knows where Richard's  been," he said.  </P> <P> Now the influence of California on New York is spreading beyond the food to the  design of the restaurant itself, says Michael Rotondi, one of the principals at  the Los Angeles architectural firm Morphosis, which designed Kate Mantilini and  a number of other Los Angeles-area restaurants.  </P> <P> Rotondi said the principal current influence of Los Angeles style on New York  restaurants is that, as in Los Angeles, increasing numbers of architects rather  than interior designers are being called on to design the restaurants. "People  have realized that in restaurant design, the quality of the architecture can  reflect the quality of the food and the quality of the service, so that the  entire experience is conceived of as one entity," he said. "It's not divisible  anymore."  </P> <P> Rotondi notes that it has become common in Los Angeles, where space is more  plentiful, to have architects rather than decorators design the interiors of  restaurants. This trend, he says, is influencing New York. Among examples of  this influence in New York he cited Le Cygne, an expensive restaurant on East  54th Street.  </P> <P> California also is credited with sparking the popularity of Mexican food in New  York. There is a growing number of Mexican restaurants, or restaurants with  Mexican-style offerings. Prudence Baird, a Los Angeles publicist, said she was  astonished on a recent visit to Manhattan's Upper West Side. "I got a perfectly  decent margarita," she said.  </P> <P> And even on the down-scale end of the market, Taco Bell, which started in  Downey and is now owned by Pepsico, is opening outlets in the New York area.  Elliot Bloom, a Taco Bell spokesman, said that thanks to California's  influence, "Mexican food has become a rage throughout the country."  </P></p>

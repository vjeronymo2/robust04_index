			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Photo-Me up 21% to Pounds 10.5m - Substantial boost from favourable currency movements STERLING'S devaluation helped Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, increase pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 10.5m in the six months to October 31. Currency movements boosted profits by Pounds 1.3m, compared with a debit of Pounds 123,000 last time. Sales rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 72m. The group translated its overseas earnings into sterling at the rate prevailing at the end of December. Mr Dan David, chairman, said the worldwide recession showed signs of recovery and this, together with current operating returns, encouraged confidence in continued progress during the second half, subject to no significant exchange rate movements. Mr David Miller, chief executive, said the best measure of the underlying performance was the 12 per cent growth in operating profits from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 16.2m. Operating profits grew less rapidly than turnover because about Pounds 8m of sales went to the group's new business, including 'Fun' studios, which allow customers to be photographed in front of famous backdrops or with celebrities. Another new business is the instant printing systems division, which has 2,000 business and invitation card machines worldwide, a quarter of them in the UK. Potentially the most lucrative new business provides photos for identity cards, which are made in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the US. Although all the new businesses are profitable, they enjoy much lower profit margins than the core division. Mr Miller said that although he continued to be excited by the potential of putting photos on products such as bank cards and driving licences, these results showed the group could grow steadily even without such breakthroughs  -which were largely in the hands of banks and governments. Since the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, the group has put 200 booths into eastern Europe, Russia and the Baltic states. Mr Miller said there was huge potential for expansion there, the main constraint being the group's need to get its returns in hard currency. The group has 14 booths in China, which produce revenue in Hong Kong dollars. Mr David said: 'World demand for real identity ensures that the group continues to expand and we continue to look for realistically priced international opportunities.' Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 10.76p (9.37p). The interim dividend goes up from 1.3p to 1.4p. COMMENT These results were above expectations, and the shares were duly marked up 15p to 349p. Photo-Me emphasised that much of the profits rise was due to the weaker pound and it is assuming there will be a smaller currency benefit in the second half. The new businesses are only just profitable, but the photo-booths keep chugging away impressively. The real bonanza for these shares would come with greater use of photographs in bank cards, driving licences and identity cards. Forecast annual profits of Pounds 19.5m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.6, a slight premium. Some institutions have been put off by the high proportion of stock held by directors through nominees, but the register has become clearer and the shares are likely to attract an increasing following.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamamatsu, June 11 KYODO -- Japan will continue  efforts via China to persuade North Korea to change its stance  on the suspected nuclear weapons development program, the chief  government spokesman said Saturday [11 June].    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a lecture in  this  central Japanese city, said there is "a strong possibility" that  the United Nations Security Council will adopt a resolution  against North Korea in a week or 10 days unless Pyongyang  reconsiders its stance on the issue.    Kumagai said Japan's basic policy will remain unchanged over  the issue, as the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has  resolved.    He noted the absence of China's objection to a sanctions  resolution adopted Friday by the International Atomic Energy  Agency against North Korea. China abstained instead of voting  against it.    Kumagai also said the nuclear issue poses to Japan a policy  choice of whether to continue or abandon 50 years of alliance  with the United States since the end of World War II.</p>

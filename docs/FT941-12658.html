			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Tax deferred may be tax saved - Investing offshore, roll-up funds / The chief reason for using such funds is the expectation that you will one day be in a lower income tax bracket - say, on retirement Offshore roll-up funds may have lost some of their investor appeal in today's low-interest-rate environment, but they remain valuable financial planning tools for those who want to accumulate income and to defer their tax liability. Roll-up funds provide investors with exactly the benefit that their name suggests. Income and capital gains are retained and rolled-up within the fund. Investors are only liable to tax when they withdraw their money. The funds offer a number of investment benefits and tax-planning opportunities, therefore, and, unlike some offshore investment vehicles, they have clear advantages for UK, as well as overseas, investors. Roll-up funds are invariably based in favourable tax environments, so investors enjoy the gross accumulation of interest and dividends, and money that would be lost to tax each year in a UK account continues to earn interest, giving a further investment boost. But the most significant planning benefit is investors' ability to defer the payment of tax. Nick Smith, marketing director of Guinness Flight, says: 'The main reason why roll-up funds are still of interest to UK investors is that they can basically decide at what point they want to be taxed.' Graham Barker, executive director of Fidelity Investments, agrees: 'The whole benefit occurs because you can choose when to make the realisation, and therefore when to pay the tax. And you can avoid tax completely if you are by then non-resident or go to work abroad. So investors have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.' Jeremy Norfolk, managing director of Cater Allen, which plans to launch a roll-up fund later this year, adds: 'The other related advantage is that you can effectively take the same income out of a roll-up fund by selling shares, but you only pay income tax on the capital gain made by the shares.' David Major, personal finance partner of the accountancy firm Touche Ross, 'uses roll-up funds a lot for people who do a considerable amount of work overseas. After enjoying a gross roll up, they can redeem the funds when they are not resident in the UK for tax purposes.' Certainly, the chief reason for placing money in a roll-up fund is the expectation that the investor will be liable to lower rates of income tax at some future date. Obvious candidates for the funds, therefore, are those who are currently higher-rate taxpayers but who reckon that their tax position will change when they retire, either because they will have less income, or because they anticipate retiring abroad and will thus escape any UK tax bill. UK employees who know that their career may take them abroad at some time can also make good use of a roll-up fund. If they withdraw cash when overseas, they will not be liable for UK tax. Conversely, temporary residents or workers in the UK can put money offshore in a roll-up fund until they move elsewhere. Roll-up funds also provide financial planning opportunities within the family. For example, parents are normally liable to tax on any income arising from money that they have given to their under-age unmarried children. But if this cash is kept in a roll-up fund until the child is 18, the accumulated interest can then be set against the child's own personal allowance. Similarly, a roll-up fund can be used to mop up the personal tax allowance of a non-working or low-income spouse. Elsewhere, roll-up funds can be a useful aid for UK companies (or for the self-employed), if they want to defer tax on investment income. Barker comments: 'If a family business plans to relocate or expand in two years time, and it knows that it will then make a trading loss, that will be the year to redeem the roll-up fund investment.' Most roll-up funds are cash-based, but there are some equity and bond funds. For instance, the Guinness Flight International Accumulation Fund is a roll-up umbrella vehicle with five bond funds and two equity funds among its sub funds. Donald Elkin, a director of financial adviser Wilfred T. Fry, says there are a number of circumstances where equity-based roll-up funds are helpful: 'There is no taxable event until you make a realisation; so if you are only resident in the UK for a couple of years, you could shelter your equity investments in a roll-up. Conversely, if you were going to Hong Kong, say, in two years time, and you wanted to make an equity investment, you could anticipate your departure.' Most UK investors use roll-up funds that invest either in a single currency or in a managed currency vehicle, however. Richard Roberts, marketing manager of Barclays International Funds, comments: 'Single currency funds are one step removed from deposit accounts, and the main driving force is the interest rate. Managed currency funds are a further step up the risk spectrum, because returns are dependent on the manager's skill.' The deferral of tax is not the only reason for investing in a roll-up currency fund, as Graham Barker points out: 'There are two major uses for roll-up funds - currency management and tax planning. If you want to pay the bills on a holiday home in Spain, I defy anyone to find a better way to do it than through a money fund. You escape the banks' commission and electronic charging fees. Transfers at Fidelity are at unbeatable rates of exchange, and we cover 23 separate currencies.' Enthusiasm for roll-up funds has been muted of late, however. John Stephens, investment director of Hill Samuel Jersey, says: 'The problem is that, with interest rates so low, the returns are pretty meagre. The tax tail can start to wag the dog when interest rates are at these levels.' One suspects, too, that modest investors remain wary about placing money offshore, and nervous of the Inland Revenue's future intentions. The answer to the first worry is to stick to a household name. The pedigree of many of the financial institutions that offer roll-up funds is impeccable. Touche Ross's David Major says: 'It is a very competitive market. We are looking at all the major players.' For example, Rothschild Asset Management has Pounds 1.3bn invested in its two Guernsey-based money funds. The major part is invested in its roll-up vehicle, the Old Court International Reserves fund. Most managers also feel that roll-up funds have ceased to be an Inland Revenue target, as the two glaring loopholes have already been closed. It is no longer possible to convert income into capital gains for tax purposes or to switch within an umbrella fund without triggering a chargeable event. 'There is no word that the Inland Revenue is looking at roll-up funds,' says Major. 'While you could say that a deferred tax is a saved tax, in strict terms there is no Revenue loss.' Happily, the Revenue appears to agree. Roll-up funds were not touched in the November Budget.</p>

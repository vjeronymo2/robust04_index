			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Still hunting Tut tut. Geography's obviously not the strong suit of the tweed set. CGA Services, a Glasgow-registered company that owns Country, the magazine of the Country Gentlemen's Association, has caught its leg in its stirrup. Rural pursuits may be its strong point but figures obviously are not. Although its accounts for the year to April 1993 were due by the end of February, Companies House in Edinburgh is still waiting. So what is CGA - on whose board sit, for some reason, Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil as well as his old Glasgow chum Gerald Malone, a deputy chairman of the Conservative party - thinking of? Malone's office had a ready explanation. The company's accountants apparently sent the figures to Companies House in Cardiff rather than its equivalent north of the border.</p>

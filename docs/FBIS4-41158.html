			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Russian President Boris Yeltsin flew  from Moscow to Greece today. He will attend a meeting of heads  of state and government of the European Union on the island of  Corfu.    [Correspondent A. Dubnov] Before leaving for Corfu Boris  Yeltsin answered questions from journalists on relations with  European countries. According to the president, there was  discrimination against Russia in earlier times, quotas for our  goods were limited and our foreign economic proposals were  ignored, but now there is a whole package of proposals with  specific dates and figures. Boris Yeltsin noted the European  community had recognized the fact that there was a transitional  economy in Russia while the United States had refrained from  recognizing this.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] A most favored nation status in  trade has been given to Russia in Europe. This is very  important, too. Russia is only gaining from this. Finally, this  is, perhaps, the first practical step by which Russia truly  enters Europe and deservedly becomes a fully-fledged European  country. [end recording]</p>

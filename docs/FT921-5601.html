			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Government U-turn on plans for A1 THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced its conversion to the idea that the A1 road between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh should be upgraded to dual carriageway, James Buxton writes. The transport department and the Scottish Office previously said the section did not justify upgrading with only 20 per cent of traffic between England and Scotland using it - although there are plans to upgrade the A1 from London to Newcastle from dual carriageway to motorway. Yesterday Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Office roads minister, said they had concluded that 'it would be desirable for the A1 to be fully dualled from Edinburgh to Newcastle'. Work on the project is due to start in May but no date was given for completing it. The ministers pointed out that construction work on making a section near Berwick-on-Tweed dual-carriageway would begin by the end of May and that other such schemes were being developed. Four small projects to ease overtaking at blackspots on the Scottish section of the route are to be studied. The total cost of schemes in progress or under consideration is about Pounds 110m. Campaigners on both sides of the border who have recently highlighted the number of accidents on the single-carriageway road said that the statement was 'little more than a pre-election gimmick'.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Soros helps the dollar Mr George Soros, the influential US investor, yesterday helped the dollar and sterling retrace some of their recent losses, writes Philip Gawith. Comments from Mr Soros in a TV programme, warning about the dangers of a weak dollar, helped boost the US currency, and sterling followed in its wake. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5377, up from DM1.5309. Against the yen it was also firmer, finishing at Y98.45 from Y97.96. The pound rose by over 1 1/2 pfennigs to close at DM2.3893 from DM2.3729. The sterling index finished at 78.6 from 78.2. Little significance was attached to the moves which took place against the background of no fresh data or policy developments. With the dollar firmer, the D-Mark also lost ground in Europe. The most significant gain came from the Spanish peseta which finished at Pta 83.34 from Pta 83.73. Analysts said it was the beneficiary of better economic data and predictions of good figures in August. Mr Soros's comments, which were re-run from an earlier TV showing, cautioned against dollar depreciation. 'If you allow the currency to depreciate too much, that ..can be very destabilising because of its inflationary implications and its implications for the bond market,' he said. Mr Steve Barrow, international economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'The market seems to be so devoid of any ideas at the moment that it latched onto Soros.' There was little follow-through buying, however, and the dollar was trading weaker in the New York afternoon. The only fundamental development of interest was the recommencement, in Seattle, of US-Japan framework talks on access to each other's insurance markets. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, said in Tokyo that the two countries had made more progress in the insurance sector than in the other priority areas of government procurement and car and vehicle parts. Mr Takemura also said he regretted the recent rise of the yen. He said 'timely and appropriate' measures were necessary in order to achieve currency stability. Although progress in the trade talks would help the dollar, numerous obstacles appear to stand in the way of dollar recovery. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, offered a neat summary: 'The fundamental problem for the dollar is unchanged. Relatively robust economic growth means that trade and current account deficits are continuing to widen.' 'At the same time, investor appetite for Dollar assets is limited by the perception that the direction for short term rates is firmly upward and that this still poses risks for the bond and equity markets.' 'International diversification by US investors also appears to be continuing, and the net effect is to put downward pressure on the dollar, which is only periodically relieved by speculative buying.' An insight into how investors have shifted positions on the dollar comes from Merrill Lynch's August 1994 quarterly global investor survey results. These show how investors have continued to trim their dollar exposures in favour of the D-Mark. Historically there has been a clear positive correlation between shifts in investors' holdings, and the dollar's trade-weighted value. On a scale where 50 constitutes a neutral position, the net weighted average exposure to dollars fell from 53.25 on May 26, and 60.5 on March 3, to 51.25. The net weighted average exposure to the D-Mark rose from 54.25 in May and 42.25 in March, to 57.25. These figures represent the highest reading for D-Mark exposure since October 1990, and the lowest US dollar reading since November 1991. Investors remain significantly underweight in yen, where exposure fell from 38.5 to a low of 33.25. The outlook for German interest rates remains unclear following comments from senior Bundesbank officials. One unnamed official told the newspaper Handelsblatt that the central bank's decision last week, to leave all three of its rates unchanged, showed 'a conscious policy of the steady hand at a time of persistent interest rate uncertainty.' He said an official rate cut or a return to a variable-rate repo 'would have risked ending hopes of a rate cut prematurely.' Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank council member, was quoted in the Italian press saying that German inflation would continue to fall. These comments were insufficient to give the futures market much direction, with the December Euromark contract finishing at 94.85 from 94.84. German call money was unchanged at 4.85/4.95 per cent ahead of today's repo allocation. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 370m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 28m in the afternoon round after forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/2 and 6 1/2 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity]  considers that the threats to the security, autonomy, and  independence of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from the frequent border  incidents and activities of Serbian forces on the border with  Macedonia represent a serious problem, and that the urgent  protection of the sovereignty of the Macedonian state is  required, in conformity with the basic postulates defined by  international law and international agreements.    The pro-Serbian leftist government coalition, which fully  controls the Macedonian Assembly, has not yet proposed any legal  measures to define and support Macedonia's state border with  Serbia, as well as with other states, and thus respond to these  activities of our northern neighbor. Because of all this, the  northern state border is still being treated as an  administrative border.    The VMRO-DPMNE considers that the government of Branko  Crvenkovski and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov are most  responsible for not resolving this situation, because so far  they have not done anything to contribute to adapting the  Macedonian legislation to international law on state sovereignty  and the protection of territorial integrity. According to  VMRO-DPMNE, there can be no justification for this leftist  ruling coalition, which has not yet passed a new law on the  control of the state borders, on protecting the inviolability of  the entire length of the borders and thus defining a way for  solving border violations and incidents, which are occuring  increasingly frequently.</p>

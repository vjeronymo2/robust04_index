			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Denmark lifts interest rates to defend krone DENMARK'S central bank yesterday increased a key interest rate as the krone came under strong pressure on foreign exchange markets. Central banks intervened at several European centres to support the currency at its floor against the Irish punt, Dutch guilder and D-Mark. Pressure on the krone has built up since the Irish punt was devalued within the ERM last weekend. But Mrs Marianne Jelved, economy minister in Denmark's new Social Democratic-led administration, said the government would not waver in its support for the currency. She warned speculators: 'It will be expensive not to listen to what I am saying.' The Danish Nationalbank increased the rate at which it buys certificates of deposit from the commercial banks from 11.5 to 13 per cent. The Danish government yesterday presented a set of gloomy forecasts, predicting higher unemployment, lower growth and a larger budget deficit than predicted by the outgoing government. Alice Rawsthorn adds from Paris: The Bank of France made a slight reduction in the cost of short-term borrowing, cutting the overnight interest rate from 12 per cent to 11.9375 per cent. The five- to 10-day rate, suspended last month, has been reintroduced. It was set at 12 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in January. The central bank hopes that the commercial banks will interpret yesterday's slight cut in short-term rates as a signal that they should hold base rates steady in expectation of further reductions.

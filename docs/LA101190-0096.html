			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE DROPPED IN ASSAULT ON 2 MURDER  SUSPECTS  </P> <P> Prosecutors dropped their case Wednesday against a jail inmate who allegedly  assaulted two Northridge college students accused of murdering a Pacoima  pastor.  </P> <P> Felony charges against Thaddeus K. Bonner, 36, were dismissed after a San  Fernando Municipal judge ruled that Dana Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19,  would not be required to testify against Bonner at a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Singer and Dimenno argued that cross-examination of their clients  during the preliminary hearing could have hurt efforts to defend them against  charges that they murdered Pastor Carl White on July 28.  </P> <P> "We couldn't make anything without the testimony of the two witnesses," Deputy  Dist. Atty. Victor Minjares said, explaining the dismissal.  </P> <P> Dimenno and Singer were injured in an assault Sept. 11 in an inmate lockup area  of the San Fernando Courthouse.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE TITLE WITHIN REACH OF TALENT-LADEN VALLEY;  </P> <P> WOMEN: A BLEND OF EXPERIENCED PLAYERS AND STRONG NEWCOMERS COULD ENABLE LADY  MONARCHS TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP.  </P> <P> With three consecutive berths in the state final four, the Valley College  women's basketball team might finish off a fourth by cutting down the nets on a  state championship.  </P> <P> Sound sweet? That would be Valley's version of a string quartet.  </P> <P> Doug Michelson has combined the area's best recruiting class with several  returning players from a state semifinalist last season. He has built a team  that leaves other coaches quaking.  </P> <P> "They're just going to be awesome," Pierce Coach Rob Dimuro said. "They've got  to be a pretty good bet to win the whole thing."  </P> <P> Point guard Sylvia Castaneda (5-foot-9), who averaged 4.3 assists a game, and  forwards Ericka Miller (5-9) and Claudia Rocha (5-11) played extensively last  season. Sophomore guard Tisa Rush (5-6), a former All-City Section player at  Kennedy High, returns after sitting out a season.  </P> <P> "Those four are really high-quality sophomores," said Michelson, who has led  Valley to the final four in each of his three seasons.  </P> <P> Top freshmen include Falicia Stanley (5-5) of Kennedy and Stacie Toon (6-0) of  Van Nuys, a pair of first-team Times All-Valley selections. Second-team  All-Valley selection Katina Mines (5-9) of Sylmar also joins a Valley team that  was eliminated from the state semifinals last season in a double-overtime loss  to College of the Sequoias.  </P> <P> Mines is out with a hernia until Nov. 20, but Valley recently defeated Biola, a  four-year NAIA team, by 10 points in a scrimmage. Valley (30-6 overall and  Western State Conference champion at 13-2 last season) will open Friday at home  against MiraCosta.  </P> <P> "We've got 10 quality players," Michelson said. "We're going to go at a pace  where they can't play 40 minutes."  </P> <P> Valley likely will set the pace for teams in the region, but Canyons, Moorpark,  Ventura, Antelope Valley and Pierce should contend for state tournament berths.  </P> <P> * Canyons (25-8, 11-4 in the WSC) has three starters back from the team that  made the state final eight last season. Sophomore guards Keira Irwin (seven  assists a game) and Dee Dee Hinson (10 points a game) will be joined by Shannon  Solway, a transfer from Eastern Montana and a teammate of Irwin's at Simi  Valley High. The trio gives Canyons a deadly perimeter game.  </P> <P> "We're going to be tough to zone," Coach Jeff Dunlap said.  </P> <P> Kim Posey (6-0) returns inside but Dawn Coleman, second in the conference in  rebounding as a freshman, did not return. Canyons will play its first game, in  the Golden West tournament, next Thursday.  </P> <P> * Moorpark has a 44-8 WSC record in Coach Gary Abraham's four years. Starting  forward Angie Long (10 points, 9.5 rebounds per game) returns, and Amy Chandler  (5-5), who played for Cal Lutheran last season, will start at point guard.  </P> <P> Moorpark (22-9, 10-3 and the WSC Northern Division champion) will open Friday  with a road game against defending state champion Golden West.  </P> <P> "I think we've got probably more talent than we did last year," Abraham said.  "We're going to find out how bad or good we are from the start."  </P> <P> * Ventura (23-9, 10-4 in the WSC) qualified for the state tournament last  season. Marli Mactal, a 5-4 point guard who averaged 3.4 assists a game, is the  only returning starter.  </P> <P> Ventura will play its first game under new Coach Ned Mircetic on Saturday on  the road against Hancock.  </P> <P> * Antelope Valley (17-11, 11-1), for the first time, won a share of the  Foothill Conference championship with a late-season surge before losing in the  first round of the state tournament to Golden West.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Jackie Lott has two players, Anna Quiles (8.1 ppg) and Belen  Ocegeura (6 ppg), who played last season, and freshman Lu Lu Vasquez averaged  19 points a game for Rosamond High. Antelope Valley will tip off Friday with an  away game against Riverside.  </P> <P> * Pierce (11-17, 3-12 in the WSC) adds Valley transfer Lisa Little (6-1) to  three returning starters.  </P> <P> "We're going to be real tough," Dimuro said. "We think we're going to be one of  the top teams in the state."  </P> <P> Pierce's first game is Friday against Cypress.  </P> <P> * Glendale's new coach, Kathy Pudelko, takes over a team that struggled to a  3-20 record and a 1-14 WSC mark last season. Glendale will open at home against  Golden West on Nov. 21.  </P> <P> * Oxnard is attempting to bounce back from a 2-14 WSC conference season, 7-21  overall. Oxnard will open against Rancho Santiago on Friday at Santa Clara  High.  </P></p>

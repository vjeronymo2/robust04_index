			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Yard puts middle-aged on apprentice scheme Fifteen semi-skilled middle-aged workers at the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan shipyard on the Clyde have been saved from redundancy by the introduction for the first time of an apprenticeship scheme for older workers. The agreement between Kvaerner's management and unions gives semi-skilled workers whose jobs are redundant a chance to learn a range of skills, leading to better prospects of job security. Problems with state assistance for the scheme may also lead to a shake-up in the way re-training is funded in Scotland. Under rules governing Training For Work, the main training programme for the adult unemployed, Scottish Enterprise was unable to give the shipyard any money for the apprenticeships. It hopes to be able to change the rules soon. Mr Bobby Gordon, director of personnel at the shipyard, said: 'Scottish Enterprise, which welcomed the scheme, told us the men would have to be made redundant before they could give us any assist-ance. 'But unemployment would affect these men's pension rights and is also against the spirit of what we are trying to do in an area where there is 25 per cent unemploy-ment.' Mr Gordon said the company, which had been seeking up to Pounds 5,000 from Scottish Enterprise, was committed to the scheme but felt other employers might be deterred. Scottish Enterprise said rules for Training For Work did not cover an individual under threat of redundancy. It said it would 'support the relaxation of these rules in circumstances such as these and we will be encouraging the Scottish Office to be much more flexible in the application of the rules'. But it said local enterprise companies had the power to support such projects. Working practices at the yard have been radically changed since Kvaerner took over the yard in 1988. Mr Gordon said the principal component of the yard's competitiveness was its labour force and efforts had been made to support them, including better training.</p>

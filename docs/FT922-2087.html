			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy It looks suspiciously as though some manufacturers became a little over-optimistic about the economy around the time of the general election. While output of consumer goods industries rose by 1.5 per cent in the three months to April, retail sales actually fell by 0.1 per cent between March and May. The classification of consumer goods is not quite uniform from one statistical series to another, so there may be nothing behind this apparent discrepancy. The standard explanation is that increased production was going to rebuild stocks ahead of anticipated economic recovery. That is fine so long as the recovery actually takes place. If demand fails to grow, the 1 per cent rise in overall manufacturing output over the past three months is unlikely to reflect a lasting trend. Yesterday's retail sales figures did not, however, offer much reason to hope for solid growth in consumer demand. The further jump in clothing and footwear sales looks remarkable at first sight, but is probably no more than a response to the unseasonably warm weather. The depressing reality is that seasonally-adjusted household goods sales are back to their lowest level since January - another reminder that sustained recovery will require an upturn in the housing market, which is still distressingly remote. There was a further curiousity in yesterday's industrial production figures. Output of investment goods fell by 1 per cent over the three months to April, which sits oddly with recent sharp increases in imports of capital goods. The sinister interpretation is that when recovery does finally come, it will not be to the benefit of the UK investment goods industry, but to its foreign competition.</p>

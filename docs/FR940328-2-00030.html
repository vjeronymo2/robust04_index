Northern estimates the total cost of installing the delivery point to be $191,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 2, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

East Tennessee explains that it transports natural gas for Jamestown Natural Gas (Jamestown) and Middle Tennessee Utility District (MTUD) and delivers the gas at flow rates that exceed the flow rates that can be accurately measured by the existing metering facilities. East Tennessee states that to improve the measurement accuracy of the facilities, East Tennessee would replace (a) One of the existing 2-inch meter tubes with a 4-inch meter tube at the Jamestown Sales Station (Meter No. 75&hyph;9084) in Fentress County, Tennessee, and (b) two 4-inch meter tubes with two 6-inch meter tubes at Meter No. 75&hyph;9031, Monterey Sales Station in Putnam County, Tennessee, for MTUD. East Tennessee estimates that the cost of renovating each of the facilities is $10,000 for a total of $20,000 which would be absorbed by East Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 2, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Delay on issuing fire certificates THOUSANDS of businesses may have to wait years for their applications for fire certificates to be processed, the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, says in a report published today. Its study of the effectiveness of Home Office fire prevention activities says fire brigades had a backlog of 21,000 applications for certificates in 1990, a rise of 30 per cent since 1987. Nearly two thirds of outstanding applications were in large cities, with the biggest numbers in London, Tyne and Wear and the West Midlands. The audit office also says that arrangements for re-inspection are 'unsatisfactory', with a lack of firm guidance from the government. It wants the Home Office to encourage fire brigades to exempt low-risk premises from certification and to explore the scope for greater self-regulation by businesses. Fire brigades were called to more than 400,000 fires in 1990 compared with 120,000 in 1960. Deaths from fire rose from 430 to 700 a year over the same period, and insured losses exceeded Pounds 1bn in 1990. Fire Prevention in England and Wales. HMSO. Pounds 7.15.</p>

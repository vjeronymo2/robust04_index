			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CENSUS REPORTS LITTLE CHANGE IN POVERTY FIGURES  </P> <P> Nearly a quarter of poor people rise above poverty in a given year, but they  are replaced by an almost equal number of people who fall below the poverty  level, the Census Bureau said today.  </P> <P> "Although the majority of persons who were poor in 1985 were still poor the  following year, 23.8% of poor persons in 1985 were not poor by 1986," the  bureau said in a new report, "Transitions in Income and Poverty Status:  1985-86."  </P> <P> It said the figures for those moving out of poverty in 1986 were about the same  as the exit rate for 1984-85.  </P> <P> "Even though a significant fraction of the 1985 poverty population was able to  exit poverty in the following year, the total number of poor persons in 1986  was not significantly different from the 1985 figure," the study said.  </P> <P> The length of poverty "spells" and their causes -- changes in income, family  composition and other factors -- have been critical issues in the debate over  anti-poverty strategies.  </P> <P> In 1986, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $11,203.  </P> <P> The bureau said its study seems to indicate that "a substantial economic or  household composition change rather than a minor fluctuation in income was the  cause of the poverty status change for the majority . . . who entered and  exited poverty between 1985 and 1986."  </P> <P> The report also said that poor people who were white were significantly more  likely than blacks or Latinos to exit poverty between 1985 and 1986. About  28.3% of whites who were poor in 1985 rose above the poverty level in 1986,  compared with 16.5% of blacks and 14.8% of Latinos.  </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Unilever expands S American food side UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, is expanding its South American food operations with the planned acquisition of Cica SA of Brazil. The purchase is conditional upon Unilever's Brazilian subsidiary, Industrias Gessy Lever, receiving more than 90 per cent support from Cica's shareholders. Its largest shareholder, Cragnotti &amp; Partners, has already pledged support for its 67.5 per cent stake. A public offer will be made for the rest of the shares and is likely to close early in January. The offer values Cica at about Dollars 284m (Pounds 187m). Cica is involved in the production and sale of canned foods, tomato based products, mayonnaise and pasta. It employs about 3,500 people and sales this year are estimated at Dollars 270m. The acquisition will add to Unilever's Brazilian food operations which, through its Anderson Clayton subsidiary, is already involved in edible oils and fats. The company also has a joint venture ice-cream operation with Nestle. Gessy Lever also manages Unilever's consumer products business in Brazil and sales last year totalled Dollars 1bn, making Brazil one of Unilever's most important South American markets.</p>

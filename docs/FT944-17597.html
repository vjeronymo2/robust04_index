			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Hardy retires from Associated Murdoch MacLennan, 46, group operations director of the Mirror newspaper group, is to take over from Bert Hardy, 65, as managing director of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and Evening Standard. MacLennan, who joined the Mirror Group in 1992, is managing director of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail and has been heavily involved in the modernisation of the Mirror group's printing operations. Before joining the Mirror, he had worked for News International and had been a director of Associated from 1989 to 1992. MacLennan, who takes up his new post at the end of the year, is the second senior executive to quit the Mirror's Scottish newspapers in the past few months. In July, Endell Laird, 60, editor-in-chief of the Daily Record, announced that he was retiring after 35 years with the group. Bert Hardy, who will retire after his 66th birthday, started in Fleet Street in 1942 when at the age of 14 he became a copy boy at the Picture Post. From there he climbed the corporate ladder to top positions, including chief executive of the Mirror Group, News International and London's Evening Standard. It was during his reign at the Standard that he gained a reputation as a fighter, when in 1987 he slashed the price of sister paper the Evening News from 15p to 5p after Robert Maxwell's decision to cut the cost of the London Daily News.</p>

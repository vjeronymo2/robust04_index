			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: A new world that may be some time coming Prophets have seldom been popular. Since time immemorial, they have foretold change to audiences usually comfortable with the status quo. Modern seers tend to compound the problem by using language which obfuscates their message, so that its full significance takes time to be deciphered. Take Shoshana Zuboff. Five years ago, after studying in great depth the very varied human impact of information technology in American companies, she published a book called In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power. It argued that the competitive potential of IT would only be achieved if the knowledge and muscle which it can provide is shared with front-line employees, rather than guarded jealously by the traditional management hierarchy. In 1988 the business world was not yet ready for Zuboff's message. Her book had a remarkable influence on populists such as Tom Peters and on her fellow academics at Harvard and elsewhere; one leading professor, who teaches in a different field, said her work was the most influential to come out of Harvard since the early 1980s. Robert Reich, now the US labour secretary, called it 'pathbreaking'. But several obstacles stood in her way. The first was of her own making. The book was tough going, even for IT buffs and students of organisational behaviour. It was full of impenetrable concepts drawn from anthropology, sociology, psychology and philosophy, and riddled with terms such as 'imperative control' and 'intellective skills'. Its leitmotif was equally inelegant: that companies were doing themselves and their staff a disservice by using IT to automate front-line tasks, rather than to 'informate' them. The second barrier was that her message seemed overstated: at the time, many companies were still investing hell-for-leather in costly computer technology; the penny was only just starting to drop that, for IT to pay off, it was no good automating inefficient and outdated processes. Another two years went by before Michael Hammer, who has since become one of the chief prophets of re-engineering, hit an increasingly raw nerve with a Harvard Business Review article called Don't Automate, Obliterate. With recession starting to bite, his timing was far better than hers. Third, most of Zuboff's message in 1988 was extremely threatening to an executive world still wedded to the traditional management style of unvarying command and control and to the idea that automation was a substitute for employees' skills, no matter how drudge-like it made their jobs. At the time she was branded as a subversive for her argument that, if the capability of cheap IT was to be used to full commercial effect, then much of the information it provides must be handed to the front line. Yet this is just what has started to happen since 1990 at a growing number of companies, under the combined influence of recession, fast-moving competition from global rivals and pressure for higher white-collar productivity. From self-managed teams at Motorola, General Electric and other US corporations, to the learning culture that now permeates the Rover car group in Britain, companies are finding that shallow organisation structures, with front-line workers who are both responsive and responsible - are empowered - have become vital to their competitiveness. So Zuboff's time is drawing near - even if many managers are still resisting her message. Fortunately, she has become far better at conveying it in plain  -well, plainish - language, as she showed last month at an Economist conference on The Organisation of the 21st Century. Every previous generation of technology had simplified work, she argued: complexity had been removed from the front line and passed upward, for newly created levels of management to handle. But now IT was reversing this centuries-old process. Instead of resisting, she urged any enterprise trying to operate fast and flexibly against hyper-competition to welcome this challenge. No company could now afford the time or cost involved in shooting information up its organisation, she said. It must be allowed to flow better, both vertically and across the organisation. This meant most employees must become, to some degree, managerial. Like any evangelist, Zuboff overstates. By no means all front-line work can be rejuvenated by being reinvested with information content and complexity, as she puts it - nor would every employee welcome that. From assembling electronic products to working at a retail check-out, what she calls 'dumb' jobs will continue to exist, even if they are aided further by IT. Nor is empowerment always the promised land which she and others claim. As a senior banker muttered loudly at the conference, 'most examples of empowerment in Britain have been about shafting employees - dumping our problems on them, and expecting them to do six hours' extra work a day'. The answer is not merely, as the banker suggested, to agree clear levels of responsibility, resources and authority. As GE has shown, two other measures are also needed: many work processes must be redesigned, so that all needless steps are removed; and employees must be given as much freedom as possible to decide how to achieve their agreed objectives. Such freedom will always be relative, depending on the task involved. GE's dishwasher sales staff can be given more latitude than its aero engine inspectors. Regardless of the circumstances of each case, Zuboff is right in arguing that some redistribution of authority is needed if her 'informated' world is to materialise. That's why it may still be some time coming.</p>

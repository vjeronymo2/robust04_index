			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by </F> Bisharah Shirbil and 'Ali al-Ruzz in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] Those opposed to the regime talk  about a contradiction in the official political rhetoric  regarding the Army's preparedness. Sometimes you say it is  ready to fill the vacuum of Israeli withdrawal and other times  you stress that the Syrian presence is a necessity because the  Army's preparedness is not complete yet.    [Dallul] I confirm that there is no contradiction. The  Syrian Army is in Lebanon at the request of the Council of  Ministers. It has made great sacrifices in defense of Lebanon's  unity and Arabism. The Syrian presence is a fraternal and  helping presence. The Syrian military command has never turned  down any request submitted by us, whether regarding positions  and posts or with regard to deployment. I consider drawing a  comparison in this connection a deviation from patriotism.  [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] We are not comparing the Syrian presence with the  Israeli Army's presence. We are asking about the duality in the  rhetoric concerning the [Lebanese] Army's preparedness.    [Dallul] Brother, there is no duality. Who is going to  protect our back if we send three brigades to the south? When  we entered east Sidon, the Syrians wanted to evacuate the posts  in 'Aramun, so we asked them to stay to protect the Army's rear.  And when we entered the southern suburb [of Beirut], they set  up a big cordon in Beirut to facilitate our job. [passage  omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Have all arms been collected in the suburb?    [Dallul] The arms present in the suburb are individual arms  for the purpose of defending Hizballah cadres. We have agreed  with Hizballah on that for the sake of personal protection. The  picture of what Israel did to Hizballah leaders is still in  people's mind ('Abbas Musawi's assassination). I believe that  what is termed security spots is the right of the resistance.  We still avoid entering the camps lest such a step be  interpreted in various ways, so how do you expect us to deal  with a resistance party? Do you want me to deny it even escort  weapons, when it is engaged in confrontations with Israel?    At any rate, Hizballah does not apply the methods applied by  the Army in its operations, and resistance actions are a  legitimate right. Our problem with Israel is more a political  than a security problem. It has been occupying our territory  for 16 years and yet has not solved its security problem. If it  withdraws, the problem will end and the Army will take charge of  security in the south as a whole. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli said that resistance actions will continue even if  peace is achieved.    [Dallul] When Israel withdraws, no arms will exist except  [the arms of] legitimacy, and we pledge that.    [AL-HAYAH] You pledge and they pledge. Do you not think  that a confrontation may occur between the two pledges?    [Dallul] No confrontation will take place, because Hizballah  understands the circumstances. It is today talking within the  resistance framework -- which is its right. It may turn into a  political tendency when peace is established, in order to  continue its march. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] If the negotiation stage requires the  establishment of a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you  support that?    [Dallul] It is neither required nor proposed. In its  present structure Lebanon is the last state that would embark on  an action of that kind among Arab states. What is required is  coordination that is in Lebanon's interests. I say in Lebanon's  interests, because most of the agreements taking place are in  Lebanon's interests. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Are you prepared to guarantee the oppositionists'  security if they return to Lebanon?    [Dallul] We are willing to do that. Yesterday (the day  before yesterday) Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri contacted  Raymond Iddih and had a long conversation with him.    [AL-HAYAH] And General 'Awn?    [Dallul] There is an agreement stipulating that he should  stay abroad for a certain period. When this period ends, there  will be no problem. Besides, he is violating the agreement.  [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] What is your opinion of Lebanese Forces leader  Dr. Samir Ja'ja''s visit to al-Qardahah?    [Dallul] Excellent. I am one of those who contributed to  establishing a dialogue between Syria and the "Forces." The  first meeting took place between Brigadier Ghazi Kan'an and  Forces officials in my house in al-Biqa'. We want national  rallying around the national concept: to differ politically  over what Lebanon should be, not how to destroy Lebanon.    [AL-HAYAH] It is noted that there is greater involvement by  military courts in the arrests taking place.    [Dallul] And how many detainees do you think there are? Not  more than 12.    [AL-HAYAH] Political detainees?    [Dallul] There are no political detainees in Lebanon.    [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International said there is torture.    [Dallul] I challenge it to provide one proof or one name.</p>

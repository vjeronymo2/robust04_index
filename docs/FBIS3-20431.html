In recent years, weakened social controls or being  out of control in some areas have been a major cause of  consistently high juvenile deliquency.    1. The weakened internal control function of the party and  government organizations has brought on rampant corruption,  causing many youths to be antagonistic toward social production,  a key reason for delinquency. As everyone knows, for a long time  now there have been no effective control or check on party and  government organization corruption. Many officials use authority  to seek private gain, accept bribes and dinner invitations, seek  high class enjoyment, or even gain items by force or trickery.  The 8 April 1993 edition of WENZHAI BAO said that China spends  more than 100 billion yuan of public funds annually on food,  drink and travel. It may not be an exaggeration to say that, at  present, in general, dinner invitations and gifts are a common  occurrence -- not at all strange. Direct monetary or high-class  commodity gifts are nothing new. In some departments, it has  practically reached the stage where nothing gets done unless  favors are given. Although the party and government have  repeatedly punished such actions, corruption is always  prohibited to no end and even gets stronger. The masses have  reacted strongly to this.    Party and government corruption and degeneracy are the  source  of social impropriety. Internal party and government corruption  is always a visible or invisible example or suggestion to  youths. It makes them feel that they can get money by any means  and that there is nothing that money cannot do. Directness and  malleability are characteristics of the juvenile socialization  process. In this process, the role of social examples often  precedes all others. In particular, the behavior of those in  authority who dominate society is directly perceived and  important in affecting youth.    2. A major cause of rising juvenile delinquency is weakened  judicial control functions, meaning the loss of legal weaponry's  proper deterrence.    The principle requirement of implementing China's socialist  laws is the stipulation that all citizens must equally be  responsible for executing the constitution and legal  regulations; no citizen is permitted to have special powers  superseding the constitution or law. "There are laws which can  be obeyed, and there are laws which must be obeyed; they must be  enacted strictly and transgressors of the law must be  investigated." However, for various reasons, in recent years  some judicial departments have disobeyed the law, not enacted it  strictly, not investigated transgressors and even bent the law  for relatives and friends. A weakened judicial control function  has made some of the masses, in particular, those who have been  harmed, opposed to those departments which implement the law.  This has helped engender juvenile delinquency and dampened the  enthusiasm of the masses to struggle against transgressing  criminal elements.    3. Discipline is commonly lax in various social  organizations. Organization is slack, meaning constituent member  law abiding consciousness is not properly strengthened. Some  even take the criminal road. The evolutionary process of many  juvenile delinquents proves that crime always begins by  disobeying disciplinary constraints. In China in the 1950s and  early 1960s, management was orderly, discipline tight, and  ideological and political work deeply entered people's thinking  nationwide at all levels of party, government and social  organization. This transformed many negative elements and  constrained some illegal crimes. The current situation is very  different. In some departments management is lax, discipline is  slack and managment systems are weak. Bad things are listened to  without being heard and perceived without being seen. This  provides some youths with conditions for illegal crimes.    4. Weakened social and moral control functions bring on a  more faint public opinion atmosphere for censuring bad people  and bad things. It instigates some youths to lawless and wild  illegal criminal behavior. Morals are social standards. In a  certain sense, their constraining role on people's behavior is  broader and stronger than that of the law. When some bad action  encroaches on another person or the interests of society yet  does not constitute a crime, morals can use powerful public  opinion to intervene and condemn it, containing some who carry  out or plan to carry out bad acts to have some scruples under  positive mass pressure. In recent years an undeniable result of  the development of a commodity economy has been social  prosperity and wealth. It has greatly enhanced the vitality of  the entire society. However, another undeniable aspect is that  people really feel bitter hatred regarding society's morals. It  seems that the entire society puts money above all. Isn't money  always exciting someones nerves? To get money by any means, some  can cheat, swindle, ignore national and personal dignity and  morals and disregard national laws. In such soil, the  propagation and spread of juvenile delinquency toxins is  unavoidable.  5. Weakened family educational and control functions over  children is the first lost line of defense against juvenile  delinquency. The family is a social cell. Parents are a child's  first teachers. When most youths leave family supervision and  prior to living on their own, most of their time is spent  alongside their parents. The family is their main living space.  Therefore, parental teaching and the influence of the family are  of utmost importance to their growth. In particular, the  family's restraining and correcting role when a child first has  a tendency to do bad are irreplaceable by any other organization  or individual. At present, the function of family teaching and  control clearly are weakened and hindered under conditions of  youth's earlier physiological maturity and a great number of bad  enticements in the external society. In some families, children  grow up getting everything they want. They neglect character  training and only look at test scores, pampering their children  who become spoiled or are simple and rude. When children act bad  they are beat instead of taught, are treated overleniently or  winked at to shield their shortcomings. Some parents only worry  about earning money and do not care a bit about the children's  education or studies. Some parents or other family members have  poor schooling themselves or behave improperly. This directly  affects and instigates children and siblings to delinquency.  Some families only blindly grumble about poor social mores while  neglecting or casting off their restraining responsibility over  children. The bad thinking and behavior of some youths have  reached a certain stage due to such weak family training and  control that it is hard to avoid overstepping the limits of the  law and becoming delinquent.

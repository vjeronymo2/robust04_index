			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (March 30) TURAN -- Yesterday by majority of  votes Milli Majlis voted for preliminary approval of the  resolution "On the events of 20 January."    The Chairman of the session, Rasul Guliyev, said that Milli  Majlis will discuss the final variant of the resolution on 31  March at 1200.    However, the deputies were against this resolution.  Prime-Minister, Suret Guseynov, was irritated by the position  of his opponents and said "I feel sorry because last summer I  did not hang you at Baku's central square."    Deputy Etibar Mamedov addressed to President Aliyev: "You  and your supporters as well as those who headed Azeri government  in 1990 bear responsibility for the events of 20 January."    Under the resolution, only Moscow, the former leadership of  Azerbaijan and the Popular Front are responsible for those  bloody events. But President Aliyev's supporters, which  actively participated there, are not guilty.    "The time will pass and those who will come to power in Baku  will annul this resolution since it does not serve Azerbaijan's  interests but the interests of the present authorities", said  one of the deputies to the speaker of Parliament.</p>

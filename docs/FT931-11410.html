			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Israel, EC agree on investment ISRAEL and the European Community have agreed to lift obstacles to direct EC investment in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Peres said the EC was becoming a world leader in foreign and humanitarian aid and the accord would allow the EC to invest in housing, hospitals and businesses in the West Bank without dealing with the Israeli authorities. Israeli-EC relations improved this week after the Rabin government unveiled an initiative aimed at bringing back about 100 of the Palestinian deportees stranded in no-man's land in Lebanon and shortening the terms of the 300 others. Mr Peres said the compromise cleared the way for talks to update a 1975 bilateral trade accord with the EC, but EC officials were more cautious, describing it as a 'very good step' only. Israel wants to free the movement of capital and services with the EC and upgrade technological co-operation.</p>

Aznar justified this decision in  terms of the need to achieve tangible results in the talks with  the Socialist group and, especially, of the advisability of  setting limits to the public dialogue with the Socialists in  order to avoid reaching the preliminary campaign for the  European and Andalusian autonomous community elections in June  with the leaders of the two major parties "taking photographs of  each other." Nevertheless, the People's Party leader emphasized  that this decision involves no change of tactics; rather, it  means adjusting them to different political situations.    The decision to end the negotiation for the present, until  after the June elections, was presented by Aznar in the Canary  Islands, in a secret conversation prior to the meeting held by  the People's Party National Executive Committee in the islands  17 January. The People's Party chairman convened what some  leaders know as a "sanhedrin" or "conclave," and what Aznar  himself calls "the usual meetings."    These meetings, which are devoted to reflection at decisive  moments but at which no decision is ever taken, are attended by  the main national leaders, the parliamentary spokesmen, a select  group of Executive Committee members, and some people who do not  belong to any party body, such as Pedro Arriola, Aznar's adviser.    The People's Party chairman argued at that meeting that it  would not be intelligent to allow the PSOE to prolong the  democratic impetus negotiations indefinitely. It would be  tantamount, he said, to giving the public the impression that  there is a basic consensus between government and opposition and  that, essentially, the government is conducting the only policy  that the situation allows, given the absence of a serious  alternative.    Aznar, who is rather disappointed by the results of the  democratic impetus, from which he was hoping for more, gave  precise instructions to continue to negotiate, but only until  the end of February. During that period, he demanded, every  effort must be made to secure the greatest possible agreement,  then the democratic impetus of which the Socialists speak or the  democratic regeneration -- the term which the People's Party  prefers -- will be wound up, at least by the People's Party.  <H5>  Strategy Review </H5>   Aznar tried to make it clear that this decision to suspend  any dialogue with the PSOE from March does not mean a change of  course. He is prepared to continue to hold talks with Felipe  Gonzalez when they both see fit, and remains convinced that he  should not return to all-out opposition because it would serve  only to exacerbate the country's situation, according to  People's Party leadership sources.    Since last year all Aznar has personally curbed the PSOE's  attempts to extend the democratic impetus to areas other than  the central government, the Congress of Deputies, and the  Senate. For instance, the Socialists' offers to attempt  parallel negotiations in autonomous communities were interpreted  from the outset as a mere attempt to eliminate or blur his  opposition role.    The review of the party's overall strategy will come, as  Aznar himself has explained, after the European elections and  with their results on the table. Reviewing does not necessarily  imply changing. Party leadership sources state that no attempt  will be made to hasten legislative elections, even with a major  victory for the People's Party over the PSOE.    When Aznar says that he wants the legislative term to be  completed he "is telling the truth," the same sources stress,  because what the People's Party should seriously consider is  whether it wishes to win in order to govern for three or four  years or in order to stay in the Moncloa Palace for 10 or 12  years. According to this semiofficial analysis circulating in  the party's upper echelons, an election victory before the  municipal and autonomous community elections scheduled for May  1995 could prove suicidal, because it would confront the central  government with a dense network of municipal councils and  autonomous communities in the Socialist Party's hands.

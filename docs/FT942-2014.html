			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar declines sharply The dollar struggled to keep off its lowest level against the D-Mark in eight months yesterday after negative market sentiment forced it through technical and psychological barriers, writes Motoko Rich. The markets held a grudge against the dollar after its downward performance on Friday when an independent think tank in New York said the US currency could drop by 10 per cent against the D-Mark within the next 18 months. Traders flirted with the dollar's lows against both the D-Mark and the yen, and awaited concerted central bank intervention, which was not forthcoming. In London the dollar closed at DM1.5986 from a previous DM1.6299, and at Y101.970 from Y103.495. It finished New York trading at DM1.5995 and Y101.90. Meanwhile, the D-Mark was gaining strength on a fall-out in the European bond and equity markets and optimism that Germany's economy is in recovery. The US currency extended its Friday losses against the D-Mark as bearish traders rattled at central bankers' doors and pushed the dollar through new technical support levels. The dollar also slid against the yen on the back of its downturn against the D-Mark. 'There was no news to trigger the dollar's fall,' said Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank. 'When you have a large fall like last Friday, you would expect to see some profit-taking, and that is exactly what happened. It rallied a little bit, but not much, so the traders sold it again.' By the close of European trading there had not been concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar. Earlier in the day, Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer declined to comment on the US currency, dampening expectations of Bundesbank action. Mr Cocker said the US currency will need central bank intervention before it will rally. 'To see a turnaround in the dollar, you need to see the Fed raising rates above the short-term German rates,' added Mr Cocker. 'To say we do not have an active devaluation policy is not enough. They need to talk the dollar higher.' Attention today will be turned towards the US trade balance. Analysts expect that if the figures are bad, traders will continue to sell off dollars. 'The US trade figures will take on an importance not justified by itself,' commented Ms Alison Cottrell, senior international economist at Midland Global Markets. 'The markets are nervous and thin and the trade figures are the only thing to look at.' While the market has been shunning the dollar, the D-Mark has come into favour. 'The market is rerating prospects for the D-Mark,' said Citibank economist Mr Neil MacKinnon. 'We have seen many indications that the German economy has turned the corner.' He said the markets have sensed that German interest rates have bottomed out and are forecasting that the next rate move will be upwards. With generally disappointing economic indicators emerging from the US in the last few weeks, the market has also trimmed its expectations for Fed tightening. A blood bath in European bonds, fuelled by Friday's fall in US Treasuries, rising commodity prices and fears of inflation, gave the D-Mark a further boost as investors fled to cash. 'Of course they could be buying any currency, but investors seem happiest to be in D-Marks,' said Mr Cocker. German call money stayed steady at 5.00 to 5.05 per cent. The dollar's weakness also benefited the Swiss franc, which closed higher against the US currency. The dollar fell through the SFr1.3500 level, its lowest since Oct-ober 1992, finishing yester-day at SFr1.3488/3498 from SFr1.3740/50. Swiss franc/D-Mark cross trading was thin, and the franc ended the day weaker against the D-Mark. The German currency closed at SFr0.843, from SFr0.841 on Friday. Sterling was unable to break away from its link to the dollar and was quoted below the crucial level of DM2.46 at some points during the day. 'The pound has weakened steadily against the D-Mark because people are buying D-Marks against the dollar, rather than sterling against the D-Mark,' said Ms Cottrell. UK statistics on M4 money supply and lending, as well as building society net new mortgage commitments, had little effect on the market as investor attention focused on the flailing bond and stock markets and the spiralling dollar. The pound closed down in London at DM2.4606 against the D-Mark from DM 2.4765 and up at Dollars 1.5393 from Dollars 1.5195. While remaining quiet in early sessions, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 78m at established rates and late assistance of Pounds 295m after forecasting a shortfall of Pounds 450m. The overnight lending rate traded between 6 and 4 1/8 per cent. In the futures market, trading volumes were high at 24,800 on the December short sterling contract, which closed at 93.70 from 93.75. The December Euromark contract saw 32,000 lots traded and closed at 94.78, from 94.81.</p>

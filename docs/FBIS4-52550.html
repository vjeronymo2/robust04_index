			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Withdrawal of U.S. Forces From S. Korea Urged" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Choe Yong-su, chief of  the Organisation of Korean Residents in Russia, demanded the  withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea in a statement  supporting the appeal of the Central Committee of the Democratic  Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland to the 70 million  fellow countrymen to avert the danger of a nuclear war and pave  the way for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification.    "The basic cause of the danger of war in Korea and national  division lies in the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK and  its domination and interference in South Korea," he noted, and  said: "The U.S. authorities must stop maneuvering to stifle the  DPRK and encouraging the South Korean authorities and  immediately withdraw from South Korea, taking along their forces  and nuclear weapons."    "The danger of war created on the Korean peninsula today is  an inevitable offspring of the treacherous policy of the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique which has sought only confrontation and  war, discarding independence, the life and soul of the nation,  and dreaming the anachronistic dream of `unification through  Northward invasion'", he stated, and said:    "The South Korean authorities blocked the progress of the  DPRK- U.S. talks by deliberately breaking up the working contact  for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the  South and are openly agitating a war against the North, crying  for `chastisement' and `an opportunity of unification'".    He called upon all the parties, groupings and people of  broad  sections in South Korea and overseas compatriots to rise up as  one in the struggle to remove the treacherous forces pursuing  the policy of depending on outside forces and defend the  independence of the nation.</p>

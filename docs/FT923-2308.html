			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Leading company pension schemes have workforce representatives trustee board THREE quarters of leading company pension schemes have workforce representatives on the trustee board, according to Incomes Data Services, the independent pay research group. One in five pension schemes has at least one pensioner as a trustee, according to the survey of 72 pension schemes published today. A 1983 government actuaries survey of all private-sector occupational pension schemes found that about a third had workforce representatives on their trustee boards. Mr Bryn Davies, actuary with Union Pension Services, said: 'This represents some progress but the debate over boards of trustees is bedevilled. We have seen Lord Hanson on television telling us he is an employee representative, which is not what most people mean.'

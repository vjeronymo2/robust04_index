In an interview with this reporter  some days ago, the person in charge of the Complaints Office of  the Central Discipline Inspection Commission responded to a  number of relevant questions raised by the masses.    When this reporter asked the official how discipline  inspection offices process accusations and complaints against  party members, he said: According to the "Regulations,"  discipline inspection offices have a duty to handle accusations  and complaints against party members or party organizations  which violate the party constitution, intra-party regulations,  and the party's lines, principles, policies, and decisions, and  against those party members who abuse their powers for personal  gain or corrupt the party's work style. Specifically, everyone  is allowed to send to discipline inspection organs reports  against those party members or party organizations that distort  or refuse to implement the party's lines, principles, and  policies in violation of political discipline; those who refuse  to follow the party's decisions or to accept the job assigned by  the party in violation of organizational discipline; those who  do not abide by the state financial laws and regulations in  violation of financial and economic discipline; those who do not  act in accordance with relevant policies in foreign-related  dealings in violation of the discipline relating to foreign  affairs; those who perpetrate economic crimes, including  practicing graft; and those who are overly bureaucratic, neglect  their duties, abuse their power for personal gain, bend the law  for the benefit of their relatives and friends, harbor evildoers  and cover up evil deeds, employ trickery, and are morally  degenerate. According to the "Regulations," the discipline  inspection offices also tackle appeals lodged by party members  or party organizations against party disciplinary punishment or  other punishment meted out to them by discipline inspection  offices. "Party disciplinary punishment" refers to five  disciplinary measures against individual party members and to  punishment of convicted party organizations by reorganizing or  disbanding them. In addition, the discipline inspection offices  as supervisory organs within the party also address problems  concerning party discipline and the party's work style including  opinions, suggestions, enquiries, and reports against the people  concerned.    Regarding the rights and duties of the persons involved, the  official said: The six rights and three duties stipulated in  the "Regulations" give, through the process of making  accusations and complaints, concrete expression to the citizens'  rights and duties stipulated in the constitution and to the  party members' rights and duties stipulated in the party  constitution and in the "norms [zhun ze 0402 0463]." No  organizations or individuals are allowed to prevent the persons  involved to exercise these rights; neither are any persons  involved allowed to refuse to perform their duties. As required  by the "Regulations," we must protect the accuser and earnestly  investigate and handle retaliation cases; on the other hand, we  must safeguard the accused's rights and interests and expose and  deal with frame-up cases.    When asked about measures taken by the discipline inspection  offices to protect informants, the official said: Discipline  inspection offices at all level take the following measures  according to the party constitution, the "norms," and the  "Regulations": One, keep the informant and his report secret.  The person to whom the case is assigned is required not to leak  the informant's name and his report to any irrelevant people,  and if he does, he will be investigated to determine his  liabilities. Two, no unauthorized attempts are allowed to find  out the anonymous letter writer. Support and encouragement  should be given to those informants who reveal matters as they  stand. Even if what they expose does not agree with facts, no  organizations and individuals are allowed to take disciplinary  action against them so long as they do not intentionally invent  a story to frame up others. No unauthorized efforts are allowed  to identify the handwriting of the anonymous letter. If the  accusation does not tally with the facts, we should find out  whether the accuser has made a mistake or has tried to frame up  others on purpose. In the former case, we should clarify the  facts among a limited number of people to eliminate the harm  done to the accused and exhort the accuser to make no more  similar mistakes in future; in the latter case, we must make  investigations, which should be conducted by the units handling  the accusation with the assistance of relevant party  organizations, to determine the accuser's liabilities.</p>

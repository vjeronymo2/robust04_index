			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In 1991, approval was given for several industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members to experiment with the SCC. Since then, a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry members have been given permission, pending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final outcome of the rulemaking process, to commercially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce reduced alcohol wine and dealcoholized wine using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SCC process under the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The SCC removal of any alcohol from the wine will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be done on DSP premises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Records will be maintained for each lot of wine put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the SCC and the fractions derived from such wine showing the date, quantity, and disposition of each fraction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In the production of reduced alcohol standard wines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the SCC, the same amount of essence will be added back  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any lot of wine as was originally removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Proprietors must contact their ATF Area Supervisor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the destruction of any alcohol or other fractions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from the SCC process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other persons wishing to use the SCC technology to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce low alcohol and/or dealcoholized wines, or to remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off flavors from wine, should submit letter applications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF requesting permission to do so. If it is determined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through this rulemaking process, that the use of the SCC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology is in accordance with ``good commercial practice,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SCC process will be added to 27 CFR 24.248 at which time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no further letter applications will be required for its use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Reverse Osmosis and Ion Exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> One industry member requested ATF to approve the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverse osmosis and ion exchange in combination to remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile acidity (VA) from bulk wine. The process combines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two technologies already widely in use in the wine industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process involves utilizing reverse osmosis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate wine into various components and then using ion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange to remove VA. The wine components, minus the VA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would then be recombined in-line to form the original wine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minus the VA. The whole process takes place in a closed system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations at 27 CFR 24.248 are currently broad enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow ion exchange to be used to remove volatile acidity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wine or from various components of wine. However, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of regulations does not currently authorize reverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osmosis to be used for anything other than to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethyl alcohol content of wine. The regulation change that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is being proposed in this document will allow reverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osmosis to also be used to remove off flavors in wine, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would enable it to be used as part of an overall process in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a closed system to remove VA from wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, reverse osmosis must be done on distilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spirits plant premises because it is considered a distilling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process resulting in a distilled spirits by-product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in this case, the various components of wine will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only be created temporarily in a closed system and will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately recombined in-line to reconstitute the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wine minus VA. ATF has concluded that this type of reverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osmosis may be conducted on bonded winery premises since no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate distilled spirits product is created as a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product or by-product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Absolutely no accumulation of ethyl alcohol outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed system will be allowed. Such accumulation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethanol solution on winery premises would subject the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietor to the distilled spirits tax of $13.50 per proof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gallon imposed by Section 5001 of the Internal Revenue Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Milan Cic, chairman of the Slovak Constitutional  Court, spoke to the Press Agency of the Slovak Republic about  his stand on today's events in parliament. He said that his  post as chairman of the Constitutional Court does not give him  the right to interpret the Constitution on his own. However, he  perceives the entire problem as predominantly a political  conflict. Therefore, it should be tackled using political means  and forms--first at a session of the cross-party standing  committee chaired by the chairman, at meetings of deputies'  clubs, through the cooperation of the clubs chairmen, at the  level of committees and political bodies--and only if this fails  should the issue be presented to a plenary session [of  parliament] or, if need be, to the Constitutional Court.    Milan Cic does not perceive the current situation in  parliament as a parliamentary crisis or even a constitutional  crisis. It is a misunderstanding that can be overcome provided  there is goodwill, the chairman of the Constitutional Court  stressed.</p>

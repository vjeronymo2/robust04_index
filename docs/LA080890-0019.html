			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY DROPS FIGHT OVER PROJECT;  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH: CITY COUNCIL HAS DECIDED AGAINST A LAWSUIT. IT SAYS L.A. AND THE  DEVELOPER HAVE EASED THEIR CONCERNS OVER SMOG AND TRAFFIC.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council decided Tuesday night not to file a lawsuit  against the city of Los Angeles to block the $2-billion Porter Ranch  development in Chatsworth because they said their concerns about increased  traffic and smog have been resolved.  </P> <P> The council, which had faced a Friday deadline for filing a lawsuit, announced  its decision not to take legal action after meeting in closed session for  nearly two hours.  </P> <P> Councilman Bill Davis said the council had been assured by the city of Los  Angeles and Porter Ranch Development Co. that a fourth lane on the Simi Valley  Freeway would be built before occupancy permits are issued for 4.5 million  square feet of commercial and retail space. Construction permits also would not  be issued for the same amount of commercial and retail space until the fourth  freeway lane is under construction.  </P> <P> Mayor Greg Stratton said the language guaranteeing these provisions would be  included in Los Angeles' district plan, which supersedes the Porter Ranch  development's specific plan.  </P> <P> The council, which voted July 23 to pursue a lawsuit against Los Angeles to  block the development project, had charged that the environmental impact report  on the Porter Ranch development did not adequately answer questions about how  and when Los Angeles and the developer would compensate for added traffic  congestion and smog that would be generated by the project.  </P> <P> The development, which would rank with Century City as one of the largest in  Los Angeles history, will include 3,395 residences and 6 million square feet of  commercial and retail office space. It would be built in the Chatsworth Hills  just north of the Simi Valley Freeway and less than five miles east of Simi  Valley.  </P> <P> According to the environmental impact report approved by the Los Angeles City  Council, the Porter Ranch development will generate an additional 150,602 car  trips per day in the area.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Porter Ranch area,  had blasted the council's decision to sue Los Angeles, saying that Simi Valley  officials acted rashly in their decision and suggested that they may be opening  themselves up to a countersuit.  </P> <P> Bernson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Stratton said that during the past two weeks, he and Assistant City Manager  Mike Sedell had met with Bernson and representatives of the Porter Ranch  Development Co. to see if they could reach some sort of agreement to avoid a  lawsuit.  </P> <P> "I think it worked out very well," Stratton said of the negotiations. "We  really wanted to see the freeway widened as quickly as possible. Now we can  move forward together.  </P> <P> Councilman Bill Davis agreed.  </P> <P> "I'm still concerned with the size of the project," Davis said. "But I felt we  probably got as much as we would have if we had proceeded with a lawsuit. We  did what we had to do. We held up a hammer and said, 'Hey, negotiate guys.' "  </P> <P> Davis said a lawsuit would have cost the city a tremendous amount of money and  time and "created a war between Los Angeles and Simi Valley that nobody  wanted." The council had come under attack from some residents worried that a  lawsuit would cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> "Our mayor did a great job and Mr. Bernson did," Davis said. "It shows that  cooler heads can sit down and work things out. It's a win, win for both sides."  </P> <P> Don Worsham, a member of PRIDE, a San Fernando Valley neighborhood group  opposed to the Porter Ranch project, said his group had scheduled a news  conference in front of Los Angeles City Hall at 2 p.m. today to announce  whether it will file a lawsuit against the city to block the Porter Ranch  development.  </P></p>

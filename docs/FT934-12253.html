			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD retreated from near the top of its recent trading range yesterday, but found support again above the Dollars 365-a-troy-ounce mark. Dealers said physical buyers and bargain-hunting investors were attracted by a fall towards Dollars 366, but the price still ended London trading with a net fall of Dollars 4.50 at Dollars 367.25 an ounce. Gold's performance undermine SILVER market sentiment and the junior precious metal closed in London at Dollars 4.36 1/2 an ounce, down 9 cents. 'Silver has run out of steam and some of its technical indicators have now turned slightly bearish,' one trader commented. The aluminium market collapse (see story above) knocked the stuffing out of other base metals. NICKEL fell away, with London Metal Exchange stocks continuing to rise and the market in need of further production cuts. But LEAD seemed to find some modest support near Dollars 400 a tonne for three months delivery, and with fundamentals not as depressed as other metals, closed only marginally lower on the day. The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market failed to live up to early promise and the March futures position closed Pounds 2 down at Pounds 969 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

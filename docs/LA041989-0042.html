			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESHAPING THE FUTURE;  </P> <P> WHEN MICHAEL MISH ASKED KIDS WHAT TO DO ABOUT POLLUTION, HE DIDN'T GET RECYCLED  IDEAS  </P> <P> Even Michael Mish was surprised at the passion of the response when he asked  7-year-old Matthew Andron how he felt about air pollution in Southern  California.  </P> <P> The first-grader didn't even pause: "Capture the people that do pollution!" he  demanded. "Put them in jail! That's what I think they should do."  </P> <P> Mish, actor/composer/producer/environmentalist, has been asking this question  and others like it over the past four months, dragging his tape recorder from  preschools to kindergartens to elementary schools, alternative schools and  Sunday schools, to talk about the environment.  </P> <P> "I've interviewed kids all over the place, from 3 to 9 years old," he said  recently. "They are very worried about what's happening to the environment.  </P> <P> "The killer for me," he continued, "was just last week at P.S. 1, a little  school on a residential street in Santa Monica. It was so poignant. The kids  were between 9 and 10 -- older than I had been interviewing -- and they were so  articulate.  </P> <P> "With my first question, 'What do you think of the air?' I nearly got  avalanched. Hands were waving all over the room. Some of them were telling me  more than I even know myself -- and I'm fairly well researched. They were  citing specific facts about the ozone layer. One little girl said the thing  that bothered her the most is that big companies that pollute will pay their  fine and go on as if nothing had happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advance Waivers From Parents  </P> <P> Mish, who launched his project by "just calling schools cold," gets advance  waivers from parents, records the sessions and lets each one take its own  course.  </P> <P> "I just ask a straightforward question and let the answers govern my next  question," he said.  </P> <P> "If they say they're unhappy with the way cars pollute the air, I ask how they  might make a smokeless vehicle. I try to keep all the discussions positive, not  negative. That's the underpinings of my project: to give them the idea of a  kids' coalition."  </P> <P> With the classroom interviews finished, he's now working from the notes,  writing rock-beat songs and a few ballads with titles like "The Air," "My  Electric Car" and "Recycle It." They are all solution songs ("What you gonna do  with all that trash? Recycle it, recycle it!").  </P> <P> The result will be a music casette for children, "A Kid's-Eye View of the  Environment," which Mish envisions as "an upbeat, uniting call to action."  </P> <P> "Children are wonderful visionaries," he said, "and they have ideas for  solutions -- but they feel powerless to do anything about it." And children  aren't alone, Mish maintains.  </P> <P> "I think most adults have this powerless feeling," he continued. "I feel  powerless. So do all my friends. This Exxon oil spill -- what a travesty! The  oil companies said unequivocally they would be ready to act in dealing with it.  They weren't. . . . We should let them know we don't like being treated like  this. We should do a month of boycotting. . . .  </P> <P> "Why don't people do that more? Because we have an overriding sense of  powerlessness. We have been trained since childhood to think some authority --  the government, or business -- will take care of things. I think change will  have to start from a grassroots level -- when we change that powerlessness into  the feeling that a vital individual can make dynamic change."  </P> <P> In fact, Mish had spent several years fuming about the environment before he  reached his own personal turning point.  </P> <P> Now 39, he grew up in Reseda, in a house tucked in between farms. "There were  beautiful alfalfa fields and you could always see the mountains," he recalls.  "Last Christmas I made a video for my parents and put together all our old  8-millimeter family movies. In one, my little brother and I were flying kites  in the front yard and I could see how blue the sky used to be."  </P> <P> Although Mish has lived the last 17 years at the beach in Pacific Palisades, he  suffers an increasing allergy to smog, which may eventually force him to leave  Southern California. "It was mostly clear in the Palisades -- you could count  the smoggy days on your fingers -- until about three years ago, when something  changed," he remarked with a touch of wistfulness. "My doctors said I am just  very sensitive to smog. I'm not sure I can continue to live here."  </P> <P> It's a depressing possibility for an  </P> <P> ordinarily cheerful man who has built a multifaceted career in Hollywood. As an  actor he is rarely seen but frequently heard in voice-overs for radio and  television commercials. ("I'm the guy promising quick delivery of Domino's  Pizza in their radio commercials.")  </P> <P> And though he is a bachelor, working with children would prove to be a natural  connection, partly because of his work in entertainment. Mish's show business  resume includes the TV cartoon voices of Turbo-Teen, Hop-Bug and Timothy on  ABC's "Dragon's Lair," and his last two recording projects have been for  children.  </P> <P> For Macmillan-Checkerboard Press he produced an eight-volume cassette version  of "The Real Mother Goose," and, having formed his own Mish Mash Music Records,  has created and produced an updated version, with music, of "Aesop's Fables."  </P> <P> Through the smog attacks, he continued to operate at full steam as a jingle  writer, singer, composer and voice-over actor. He also produces music tapes in  his home studio, an elaborate facility of computer-controlled tape recorders  and synthesizers. But he was beginning to get obsessed about air quality.  </P> <P> "Until last spring," he said, "I was concerned about my own unhealthfulness,  about being crippled by the smog. I was angry about it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed His Life  </P> <P> A tumbling accident changed his approach. Mish had been a competitive gymnast  at Hollywood High School and in college. (He attended Valley College and San  Jose State.) He kept up the sport, tossing off an occasional back flip to  impress friends and "fancying myself as a never-grow-old kind of guy."  </P> <P> Then last April, auditioning for a Toyota commercial in a Hollywood casting  office, he "pushed too hard," he said, on a series of back handsprings and  ruptured an Achilles' tendon. Four months of recuperation, he said, gave him  time to think and reposition his life.  </P> <P> "I decided only to do things that are important to me, and contributing in a  positive way to society." To Mish, that meant becoming an environmental  activist.  </P> <P> His first step was to become involved with Proposition O, the ballot measure  passed Nov. 8 that prohibited Occidental Petroleum Corp. from drilling for oil  in the Pacific Palisades. "I called (co-sponsor) Councilman Marvin Braude's  office and asked what I could do, and that's how I got active. . . ."  </P> <P> Mish's upbeat song, "Don't Drill Here," became the unofficial theme for the  campaign, says Karen Kelly, Braude's executive assistant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need the Activists  </P> <P> "Michael's terrific," she added. "He's very creative, and he digs right in.  That's what we need if we're going to make any difference. We have plenty of  lip service. We need the activists."  </P> <P> Mish also picketed for Proposition O with businessman friend Channing Clarkson  for a month before the election.  </P> <P> He has also involved himself in an informal educational program. With a friend,  Peggy Klein, he has been inviting friends to his house for a screening of last  September's ABC special, "The Poisoning of America," hosted by Hugh Downs.  "It's a very compelling look at the American environment," Mish said. "We watch  it, then talk about what we can do to change things."  </P> <P> But those were peripheral activities. As his central focus, he decided to do  something positive for kids. "For one thing," he explained, they have the mind  unfettered and they can see solutions far more clearly than we.  </P> <P> "For another, they are the generation we are handing this to."  </P> <P> That is what has sent him on a round of classroom interviews, sometimes  standing in front of a class, occasionally sitting in pint-sized chairs around  a grade-school table and asking such questions as: "What do you think of air?  What do you think of the water shortage? What do you think of cars?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Children Are Concerned  </P> <P> He was not surprised, he said, to find that children have spent some time  pondering the state of the planet's air, water and freeways.  </P> <P> "I almost anticipated them telling me what they did: I figured kids are  mystified, miffed and bereaved. . . . They are very concerned and very aware."  </P> <P> For example, among the schoolhouse suggestions:  </P> <P>  -- "Try to build a car that has a little container in the back of it that  catches the smoke and every 500 miles you take the thing out and get a new  one."  </P> <P>  -- "We could get drinking water from ice cubes."  </P> <P>  -- "It would be good to have a pesticide that's not bad for you, like a soap  and water spray."  </P> <P>  -- "We should have the ocean water going through a pipe, a net catches the  fish so they don't get hurt, then water goes into a steamy room where the salt  gets separated. We could use the salt for table salt and the water could go to  places with water shortages."  </P> <P>  -- "They should line the water pipes with a plastic, so no lead comes  through."  </P> <P>  -- "When I get old enough, I'm going to get myself an electric car, so I can  charge it up while I'm sleeping."  </P> <P>  -- "Maybe they could use cooking oil for an alternative fuel."  </P> <P> When Mish reminded a group of Santa Monica youngsters that they could air their  discontent in letters to elected officials, the children unanimously protested  that they were just little kids and no one would listen to them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refinanced His House  </P> <P> As a result, one of the songs on the cassette will be titled "Write Your  Senator."  </P> <P> Mish has refinanced his house to support his work on "Kid's-Eye View of the  Environment" and is totally consumed by it. The ruptured Achilles' tendon, he  thinks, was fate.  </P> <P> "I saw all the things I've done in the past as part and parcel of what I should  be doing," he said. "Singing in nightclubs for six years, composing, animated  voices, selling. . . .  </P> <P> "You have to be stopped dead to make a life-changing decision. We get so caught  up in the treadmill, we really don't make important decisions until somebody  smacks us down."  </P></p>

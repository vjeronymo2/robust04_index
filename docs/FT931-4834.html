			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mexican government changes channels - The forthcoming privatisations could usher in a media revolution THE MEXICAN government has ushered in a potential revolution in the country's broadcasting and media markets by announcing the terms of the privatisations of two state-owned television channels, dozens of cinemas and the El Nacional news-paper. Televisa, Mexico's dominant media company, will face real competition for the first time. The favoured bidders for the stations are all backed by rich partners, and most have long experience in Mexican radio and local television. All are aiming to take a slice of Televisa's audience share of around 90 per cent. Investors have to register their interest and submit business plans by the end of this month for all or parts of the media package under sale. The potential rewards are huge. Televisa's revenues from television were around Dollars 1bn last year, 27 per cent up in real terms on 1991. Growth prospects are favourable: advertising cost per thousand viewers is one-fifth of that in the US, while steady economic growth and a young population mean advertising demand should grow substantially. But much to the annoyance of advertisers, Televisa forces them to pay a year in advance. It has increased its advertising rates well beyond inflation: they more than doubled in 1990, rose by 40 to 60 per cent in 1991, and went up by another 30 per cent late last year. Televisa's heavy-handed support of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, including a recent pledge to give the party at least Dollars 25m, could become a handicap. One of the bidders for the state-owned networks says: 'Televisa is a very powerful company, heavily protected by the government. Nevertheless, it is a monopoly and people grow tired of monopolies.' There are four favoured bidders for the two state-owned channels: Mr Clemente Serna of Radio Programas de Mexico: Mr Joaquin Vargas Gomez, who runs the subscriber-only television company, Multivision: the Aguirre family of Radio Centro, with Mr Ricardo Salinas of the electrical stores group, Elektra: and Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, a rich businessman from Guadalajara, who owns Banca Cremi. Mr Gomez Flores may team up with whomever emerges as the winner. Mr Serna runs Mexico City's most successful radio station, Radio Red, and owns a local television channel in Guadalajara. He is backed by rich partners. He maintains: 'It will take three years to compete with Televisa, and will be very difficult - but we have the resources.' Mr Serna is buoyed by the success of his Channel 6 in Guadalajara, which has more than held its own against Televisa. 'They are very worried about losing their national monopoly because then their power evaporates,' he says. Televisa, however, will be a tough competitor. It is a successful programme maker, with soap operas hit successes from Moscow to Los Angeles. Second, Mr Emilio Azcarraga, its president, and reportedly Mexico's richest man, is a survivor, having fought off attempts of expropriation from former Mexican president Mr Luis Echeverria, and won practically all intra-family battles over control for the company. Mr Azcarraga's latest strategy is to turn Televisa into a international media empire, which dominates programming, broadcasting, distribution and advertising in the Hispanic world. Televisa has also been on a buying spree. The deals include a 25 per cent interest in Univision, the largest Spanish-speaking media group in the US, and a 76 per cent interest in Peruana de radio Difusion, a Peruvian television and radio station. The group has bought American Publishing Group - the world's largest Spanish language publishing house, with more than 80 magazines - for Dollars 130m, and has 70 per cent of Oviacones, a tabloid-style newspaper in Mexico. Earlier this year Mr Azcarraga bought PanAmSat, giving him control over satellite distribution of his programmes across the world. Televisa already owns radio stations in Mexico, record labels, football teams and a bull-fighting stadium. It is also set to control a third national network in Mexico. The Mexican government has announced it will give concessions for 62 local repeater stations, and Televisa has all but declared it will be given the stations, enabling it to turn Mexico City's Channel 9 into a national network. Televisa's market dominance gives it an edge when dealing with advertisers. It has, for example, signed big advertisers - such as Pepsi-Cola and Colgate  -in a three-year advertising deal. It also offers free spots to companies that promise not to advertise elsewhere. A government official in Mexico's trade ministry said such restrictive practices would probably be illegal once Mexico's anti-monopoly law comes into force later this year. However, at least one bidder was nervous that the government would be unwilling to enforce the law against its long-time supporter.</p>

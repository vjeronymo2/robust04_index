			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Russians stop uranium theft Two unemployed Russian men have been arrested trying to steal low-grade uranium from a weapons plant in central Russia. The two men were caught on Saturday in possession of almost 10kg of uranium-238 at the Arzamas-16 plant near Niznhy Novgorod. The arrests followed a joint investigation by the counter-intelligence service, the interior ministry and local security officials. Nuclear experts said that although the material was dangerous it was not of sufficient quality or quantity to make a nuclear bomb. The Russian authorities said that the arrests showed the effectiveness of current security measures and attacked the western media for tarnishing the reputation of their nuclear industry. The Russian counter-intelligence service said the country 'almost certainly' had nothing to do with the trade in contraband nuclear materials. The illicit international trade in nuclear materials was highlighted recently when three batches of weapons-grade plutonium were found in Germany. Following talks in Moscow at the weekend between Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence co-ordinator, and the Russian authorities, both countries have promised a greater exchange of intelligence information and co-operation to counter contraband plutonium. But the issue is taking on an increasingly multinational dimension. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said yesterday he would raise the matter at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers next month. He suggested the United Nations Security Council should also debate how to stop plutonium smuggling.</p>

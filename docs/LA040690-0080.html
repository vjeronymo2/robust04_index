			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL ORDERED TO INSTALL GAS RETRIEVAL  SYSTEM  </P> <P> Regional air-quality officials have once again ordered the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department to install a gas-retrieval system at a garbage dump at the  department's jail farm in Castaic.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District hearing board refused Wednesday  to grant the Sheriff's Department permission to operate the small landfill at  Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho without installing equipment to siphon off  methane gas generated by rotting garbage.  </P> <P> The AQMD said state law mandates such equipment at all landfills.  </P> <P> Technically, the department had sought a "temporary variance" that would have  allowed the department to operate the dump legally until the hearing board  could consider a request for a permanent variance on May 9.  </P> <P> The board's action Wednesday makes it highly unlikely that a permanent variance  will be granted next month.  </P></p>

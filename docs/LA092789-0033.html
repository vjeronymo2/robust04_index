			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: A TEAMSTER'S GIANT STAKES OUT HIS TURF  </P> <P> It was in all the papers. A mobster told Playboy magazine that Jimmy Hoffa, the  former Teamster Union boss, was buried on the 20-yard line at the Giants'  stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands.  </P> <P> The thug, a government-protected witness, stated that after Hoffa was  dispatched in Detroit, his remains were placed in an oil drum and shipped east.  The drum was laid in the soft Meadowlands ground as support for the artificial  turf.  </P> <P> The news came as a surprise to some sports fans who hang out at Clyde's in  Georgetown.  </P> <P> Don Rogers said, "I thought Hoffa was buried on the highway between Grand  Rapids and Kalamazoo."  </P> <P> "Nah," answered Steve Wells. "A friend of mine assured me his remains were  under the starting gate at Hialeah. Hoffa liked horses."  </P> <P> Bob Boyd added, "The thing that makes me doubt the Playboy story is that Jimmy  Hoffa was a Detroit Lions fan. Why would he want to be buried in New Jersey?"  </P> <P> "Maybe he didn't have any choice," Jim Norton suggested. "Perhaps they buried  Hoffa in New Jersey to punish him."  </P> <P> "I never thought of that. Teamster gorillas can be insensitive. But why the  20-yard line?" I asked.  </P> <P> Rogers explained, "That's where all the action is. It's much more lively than  the end zone."  </P> <P> Wells was shaking his head. "It just doesn't figure. The Giants are not that  good a team."  </P> <P> Bob Boyd said, "There could be other factors. Don't forget that at the time  they buried Hoffa in the Meadowlands Stadium, they were installing artificial  turf. By burying him there, look at all the money the Teamsters saved on upkeep  of the grave. The Teamster enforcers are always looking for ways to put a  little extra into their pension fund."  </P> <P> "Is it possible that the Playboy story is a red herring, and Hoffa is really  buried in Yankee Stadium at home plate?" I asked.  </P> <P> "That doesn't make any sense. Why would they bury him there?" Rogers wanted to  know.  </P> <P> "That's where George Steinbrenner buried 4,600 Yankee managers. So the Mob  might have thought that no one would look for Hoffa in that location," Wells  told him.  </P> <P> "It's too farfetched. I believe the mobster's story that Hoffa is now in a drum  in the Giants' ballpark," Boyd declared.  </P> <P> "If that is true, it gives new meaning to the phrase 'sudden death,' " Wells  said.  </P> <P> "You know what would be nice. If we all went up to the Meadowlands and strewed  flowers on the Giants' 20-yard line," I suggested.  </P> <P> "While they were playing!" exclaimed Norton.  </P> <P> "It would be more touching," Rogers said.  </P> <P> "You've got to show me something other than the Playboy article before I'll  believe that Jimmy Hoffa is resting in the Meadowlands. He could be anywhere --  even under the Dallas Cowboys' locker room," Norton told us.  </P> <P> "They would never bury Hoffa in Dallas," Rogers asserted.  </P> <P> "Why not?" I asked.  </P> <P> "The Cowboys don't have a pass defense."  </P> <P> There was no consensus at Clyde's that evening on whether or not Hoffa was  really buried in the Giants' stadium. The problem, as we saw it, was that since  everything else is buried in New Jersey, why not him?  </P></p>

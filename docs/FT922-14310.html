			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Accountants greet EC report with muted approval REPRESENTATIVES of the leading international accountancy firm networks reacted yesterday with muted pleasure to the news that they appeared to have been cleared by the European Commission of anti-competitive practices. But questions remained over whether UK firms were charging excessive fees compared with other parts of Europe, and whether additional regulation was required to ensure auditor independence. Mr Roy Chapman, national managing partner of Arthur Andersen in the UK, said: 'This is rather a good thing. It does reassure us, but it really confirmed what we already know. There is absolutely cut-throat competition.' The reaction followed details of a report produced by National Economic Research Associates (Nera), a London-based economic consultancy, on behalf of DG IV, the EC competition directorate. The study showed that the networks of the 'Big Six' firms - KPMG, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse and Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu - dominate the audit work of large European companies. The firms rely on the same companies for much of their non-audit income. In spite of a statement from DG IV that accountancy was not a high priority, figures in the report show the firms in each EC member state as highly 'insulated', with little evidence of harmonisation in the spirit of the single market. That might lead to calls for further action to break down barriers to trade in accountancy services. The UK partner rates were the highest in any EC country at 1.4 times the European average, and almost twice the rate in Portugal.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Economists predict growth will remain weak: Conservative election victory fails to brighten forecasts - National Institute says government expectations may not be met ECONOMIC growth in the UK will continue to crawl along at a weak level for the rest of this year and next, according to the latest Financial Times survey of forecasts on the UK economy. In spite of the Conservative party's election victory in April and a supposed renewal of confidence, economists have scarcely altered their growth forecasts since the election. Economists expect gross domestic product to grow 0.8 per cent this year. Even next year, GDP growth will not quite recover to the so-called 'trend' rate of about 2.5 per cent - the level at which the economy is thought to be able to grow without stretching productive capacity and provoking inflation. Forecasters project that growth will hover at about 2.4 per cent next year. The consensus from economists at 22 universities, intergovernmental institutions, independent think-tanks and City investment houses is that unemployment will continue to grow over the next two years, rising to 2.75m by the end of this year and to just under 3m by the end of next. Eight of the economists surveyed forecast that the number of jobless would reach 3m next year. Most are confident that the continued pressure on employment will bring down average earnings growth to below 7 per cent and reduce unit-wage-cost inflation. Projections for output this year are particularly gloomy. The consensus among the City economists is for output to fall by just less than 1 per cent. The overall average, at an increase of just under 1 per cent, is only slightly more cheerful. Investment is forecast to fall substantially this year but to rebound with force next year, consensus growth rate of about 4 per cent. Forecasters do not expect inflation to wither greatly from present levels. The average forecasts for this year and next, at well over 3 per cent for both years, are a long way off the Chancellor's desired rate of 2 per cent. The UK's trade deficit remains a big concern. Nearly all the economists surveyed predict a worse current-account balance this year than the Pounds 6.5bn deficit projected by the Treasury in the March budget - the consensus is for a deficit of Pounds 8.4bn - but their forecasts might be too benign in the light of the most recent current-account data. Figures for the first four months of this year, released earlier this week, may be revised substantially in mid June, when more detailed calculations of the first-quarter 'invisibles' are available. Goldman Sachs takes the rent-account balance. It predicts a deficit of Pounds 16.7bn next year, more than twice the size of some of the other forecasts. The forecasts for interest rates reflect the continuing constraints of the UK's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The average forecasts do not suggest that Britain will be able to cut its interest rates below German rates, although the idea is entertained by some economists. Mr Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston says: 'I see no problem in UK interest rates falling below German, although this would be accompanied by sterling's being a little weaker within the ERM than it is now.' The gloomiest forecasts come from UBS Phillips and Drew and Professor Wynne Godley at Cambridge University. Prof Godley is the only economist to forecast negative GDP growth this year and has the lowest projection for growth next year. He predicts a PSBR of Pounds 33bn this financial year and sees unemployment surpassing 3m next year. UBS sees no growth this year, rising to 1.4 per cent next year. A much more bullish outlook comes from Mr Michael Knapp at BZW. He forecasts growth of 1.5 per cent this year and is the only economist to forecast that unemployment will fall next year. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney believes that the bottom of the economic cycle was in the middle of the last year, with a pause before the election. 'I think the recovery will surprise people by its strength,' he says. Since the last FT compilation of forecasts in January, Hoare Govett is no longer included in the panel and Charterhouse Tilney and Yamaichi have been added. The OECD forecast has been included as a memorandum item only because it dates from last December and is therefore out of date. The OECD secretariat has prepared a new UK forecast but refuses to release it until the publication of the next OECD Economic Outlook at the end of June, by which time it will also be out of date.</p>

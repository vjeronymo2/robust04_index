			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / People: Biwater ripples Kenneth Gardener, recently appointed chairman of Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water companies, has been appointed chairman of East Worcester, the third supply company in the stable of privately-owned water contractor Biwater. Consequently, Anthony Marris relinquishes the chairmanship he has held since May 1991 and becomes deputy chairman, replacing Martin Copp who has resigned. Marris has been on the board since 1985, before Biwater took a stake in East Worcester. At the same time, Colin Ryder, who has been chief executive since January 1991 but did not previously have a seat on the board, has been made managing director. Biwater has effected the same change at Bournemouth and West Hampshire; hence Tony Cooke is also made managing director and goes on the board of the two companies, which are to be merged. The appointments follow the three companies' recent conversion from statutory to PLC status. Robin Cadbury, a director since 1975, has retired, to be replaced by Douglas Benfield, who is a main board director of Biwater and chairman of the supply subsidiary, Biwater Supply (Holdings).</p>

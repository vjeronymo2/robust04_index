			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Wu Jinglian (0702 2417 </F> 8834), [executive director of] and researcher at the State  Council Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research  Center: "Reform and Incorporation of Large and Midsize State  Enterprises"]  <H5>  [30 Jan pp 12-14] </H5>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    As to what constitutes a modern enterprise system, there is  a  sharp lack of consensus. Since the mid-1980s to the present,  opinions on this have varied in an ever more confusing trend.  While the current "Resolution" ["CPC Central Committee  Resolution on Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a  Socialist Market Economy"] explains the rules for a modern  enterprise system, laying down the civil obligations of a  company's overall corporate assets, which is a crucial  breakthrough in reform theory and policy, each has his own  formula as to what actually constitutes a corporate-assets  system. So while we have made a great breakthrough, to a  modern enterprise system, we need to clarify fully what this  actually means. In brief, a modern enterprise system is a  modern corporate system, which involves two essentials: 1) It  is a corporate system, established on the grounds of a  corporate-assets system. A corporation [legal person] is a legal  concept in contrast to a natural [ziran ren] person, with a  corporation being not a person, but rather an organization.  Such an organization is an independent legal subject, with the  same rights and obligations as a natural person, having the same  civil rights and liabilities, and the ability to sign contracts  and bring and respond to lawsuits. 2) It is operated and  managed by a corporate-administered structure (in the West  called administration, or control and management). The functions  of controlling and managing an enterprise can be undertaken only  by a natural person with awareness and will, while a corporation  is an abstract concept without awareness and will, which can be  administered only by a natural person governed by an  organizational structure. This organizational-structure system  is called by Western economists a corporate administrative  structure. This structure is composed of the three parts of  shareholder meetings, a board of directors, and an executive  body (generally an executive committee of executive officers  headed by the president [general manager]). Shareholder  meetings entrust assets to the board of directors, which  operates them through management personnel. This is the  so-called "tripartite" system. Executive personnel are  restricted by the board of directors, which exercises supreme  decisionmaking power, as well as being restricted by shareholder  meetings, which are the corporation's supreme organ of power.  These two points are the most crucial features of a modern  corporate system. [passage omitted]  <H5>  [15 Feb pp 14-16] </H5>   [Excerpts] In light of our experimental shareholding-system  experience over the past decade, the establishment in China of a  modern enterprise system, or a modern corporate system, has  encountered several difficult problems. 1) The first difficult  problem is the difficulty involved in property-rights  demarcation. Changing our former system of nationalization to  unify the whole country to a corporate-assets system involves  ideological and technical difficulties, as well as the real  difficulty of changing while considering vested interests. 2)  The second difficulty is that involved in the process of  establishing a corporate administrative structure. If we do  not dovetail well our current cadre structure with a corporate  administrative structure for companies, things will remain as  before, making it impossible to establish relations of  respective obligations and rights with mutual restrictions among  shareholder meetings, boards of directors, and general managers.  I once went to a foreign trade company, where I was told that  cadres above the department level all needed higher-level  authorization. This is not the case in a corporate  administrative structure. 3) The third difficulty is how to  deal with the historical-burden issues that have been unresolved  for so long. Our historical burdens are mainly three: A) The  loan problem, with execssive-debt operations unable to repay  debts owed to banks. Debt burdens from previous contract  periods are carried over and hung onto following contract  periods, accumulating to the point where they are hard to  resolve. B) Another is the social security matter, with social  security actually being a type of savings. In our past big-pot  system, social security costs were turned over to state revenue  through profits and taxes, then converted to state capital for  reinvestment, to form certain new factories. It should be  pointed out that as part of current state-enterprise assets were  established on the grounds of state liability to elderly  employees, they should be returned to their ownership in a  suitable form. Enterprises now conducting assets appraisals  have not considered this part. So once social security is  socialized and foundationed, former employees will not receive  social security payments, which the state will be unable to  assume either. C) In addition, there is the issue of an  enterprise-run society. So we need to find ways to solve these  problems.    The first problem is how to establish a  public-ownership-dominated corporate-assets system.    1. How are former state assets to be converted to  state-share  property, and what agency will represent this share property?  The State Council representation as stated in the "Resolution"  is too abstract, and we will eventually need a very specific  agency as executor. The poor resolution of this matter shows  up as our corporate-system transformation not having "bosses" to  take charge, leaving the "working" plant managers and factory  directors in charge, which is called "role reversal." 2) Current  state assets are generally all undervalued due to existing  problems in our current assets-appraisal theory, such as some  being assessed at original value, others at net value, and  inaccuracies in fact even when assessed at replacement value.  An enterprise's asset value should be based on its  profitmaking capability. This, of course, involves certain  difficulties, as our lack of a capital market makes evaluation  hard. We do not have enough professional agencies to do this  work, with these agencies subject to existing problems in  assets-organization form. U.S. law stipulates that legal and  accounting agencies may not run companies, at most being allowed  to form partnerships, to have unlimited liability. While lawyers  and accountants earn much money, once they make a mistake, they  can lose a family fortune in paying for it.    I hold that our State Administration of State Property  should  assume a function similar to the German Trusteeship Office,  acting as the representative of former owners, with all  unconverted-system assets belonging to it, and it being in  charge of the system conversion from state ownership to a modern  corporate system. The system conversion could be done in a  simple or complex way. The simple way would be after evaluation,  to transfer state share rights to certain newly established,  mutually competitive state holding companies. The complex way  would be through auctioning, with the former bosses'  representative (the trusteeship office) selling their share  rights to other parties (holding companies). The money would all  be transferred within national limits, with the purchasing money  being provided by the state, and the sale money also having to  be turned over to the state. The competitive process would  make assets appraisals more accurate, bringing share prices  nearer to real prices. This would differ from that in East  Europe and the CIS, where the auctioning was to individuals,  using instead a public-to-public approach, with this public  being new property owners, such as holding and investment  companies. While the "money" used in the auctioning process  could also be separated from the existing monetary system, using  stock-rights certificates as in East European countries, the  stock-rights certificates would be issued not to individuals,  but rather to newly established companies.    This is all about how to deal with the state-property  problem  in the incorporation, system-conversion process, or to resolve  the matter of the part combined between the government as the  public-ownership representative and enterprises. In which case,  how to deal with the issue of debt-formed enterprise assets is  actually also one of dealing simultaneously with overevaluation.  All who have learned double-entry bookkeeping tenets know that  assets = liabilities + capital, or assets - debts = net assets =  capital. This takes care of the state-share part. But  another problem is that it includes debt, some of which needs  turned into stock rights, with bank debt becoming stock rights.  So when evaluating assets, while it may seem that the  evaluated assets equal overall capital, this is not so.    The money previously paid by former employees has turned in  government hands into enterprise assets. So if this debt is  not separated out in the current assets appraisals, where will  these former employees go to get their money in the future?  And who will be able to assume this debt? So while this part  of state liability to former employees will certainly have to be  separated out from assets in the incorporation process, who will  it be separated out to? It will be given to foundations, with  both stock rights and liabilities being given to foundations and  stock rights being salable and purchasable, as they are a part  of funds anyhow.    In addition, the current situaton of industrial and  commercial enterprises being generally short of registered  capital, so dependant on bank loans to get by, also needs  resolved. This needs to be dealt with by the former owners'  representative (as suggested above, the trusteeship sector--the  State Administration of State Property). I hold that three  methods based on respective circumstances can be used to deal  with it: some assets have absolutely no impact, so should be  appraised and sold. The remaining debt-formed assets could be  dealt with in two ways: some could be maintained as bank debt;  some bank creditor rights could be turned into bank stock  rights, to become bank holdings. This would involve mainly  whether banks chose the British-U.S. system or the  German-Japanese one. While banks cannot hold stocks in the  British-U.S. system, they all can in the German-Japanese one,  with Japanese banks being the most important shareholder, called  the host bank. While we currently do not allow banks to hold  stocks, which is clearly stipulated in the current tightening of  macroeconomic control, we need to decide which system we will  finally choose. The current general trend in the U.S. is that  not allowing bank shareholding is wrong. Of course, bank  shareholding has its own problem, that if the holding capital  funds are not separated out from bank credit capital funds, they  may affect bank assets quality. So while allowing banks to  hold stocks, bank working capital--loan capital funds, need  separated from holding capital funds.    Once we accomplish the abovementioned two reforms to make  stock rights of creditor rights, many new forms of public  ownership will appear. 1) All types of social security funds.  While their ultimate owners, beneficiaries, will be  individuals, these individuals will be not decentralized, but  rather joined together. Should such funds jointly established  by many individuals be called public or private ownership? They  are of course public ownership. The amount of such funds in a  modern society is extremely large in scale. Shares held by U.S.  pension and common funds make up over one-half of the capital of  large corporations. 2) Bank shareholdings. Bank shareholding is  the same in nature as mutual shareholding by other enterprises,  in that if the bank itself has mostly public shares, its nature  per se is the public economy. So after reform, the public form  will no longer be the same, being mainly not public ownership,  but rather publicly organized shareholding within definite  limits by diverse representatives of all types.    A current view in academic circles is that corporate  shareholding cannot solve the problem, as using one's own money  differs from using others' money, so that it is only the  division to the individual that makes shareholders pay attention  to capital operations. I hold that this view is too simplistic.  In the development of all countries throughout the world to the  present, in no country has natural-person shareholding become  dominant. Of the major countries with market economies,  pension and common funds dominate in the United States and  Britain, accounting for 60 percent, while other corporate  shareholding dominates in Japan and Germany, in which banks play  a great role. In Japan, over 70 percent of major corporate  stocks are controlled by other companies. When in Tokyo,  Geoffrey Sachs, a Harvard University privatization advisor to  East Europe and the CIS, responded to questions in this area.  He said that turning all large corporations into individual  shareholdings is certainly not the ultimate aim of or ideal  model for reform. But to break the state monopoly on property  rights, the best method is to divide up the cards. Any  division method can be used to cut the Gordian knot. Once  divided, markets will naturally help to form a good structure.  Decentralization from state monopoly to shareholding by every  natural person is a transition, in which stock rights will be  gradually pooled. I hold that if we can move directly from our  current state to a corrporate system in which corporate  shareholding dominates, supplemented by individual  shareholding, this will minimize the social impact, not  necessarily going through the individual transition. If a  particular method is most efficient, more suited to our social  ideals, and more publicly sustainable, what could be wrong with  it? Of course, if we do not have the skills or are ineffective  at making a smooth conversion from public ownership to corporate  shareholding companies, economic development laws will force us  to the detour of first dividing up public assets to individual  pockets. This is because the establishment of a modern  enterprise system is not subject to shifts of will, to operate  in a conscious or guided way, but rather occurs spontaneously.  In fact, state assets are now being converted every day, with  many being shifted to individual pockets. Of course, we cannot  say that the disintegration of the former public ownership to  unify the whole country is necessarily a bad thing. "Erosion"  is not judgmental, occurring in each case according to  respective laws. But I am very concerned that the current  erosion might cause social problems. This is because increasing  numbers of people, particularly grass-roots comrades, perceive  that public assets are flowing to those with power and  influence, while they are becoming a so-called "nouveau-pauve  class." A comrade who works in a central research institute  tells me that if this goes on, three to five years will bring a  tiny group of rich millionaires along with hundreds of millions  of paupers. While this may be overdoing it a bit, we need to  note that a large gap betwen rich and poor can touch off social  and political problems.    If property and stock rights are not clearly delimited,  corporate assets are not established, and these problems are not  resolved, we will remain all eating out of the one big pot, with  our management personnel not subject to the ultimate restraint  of the owners, and a modern enterprise system impossible to  establish. Even if we establish corporations, it will be  impossible to operate them very well. As stated above,  property-rights restraint is the ultimate restraint, without  which things do not work, and even good management personnel  turn bad in just a few days. [passage omitted]    The second incorporation difficulty is the conflict between  our current personnel appointment and dismissal system and the  establishment principles for a corporate administrative  structure. The international standard for corporate  organization is that the owners (shareholders) transfer assets  to the trusteeship of the board of directors, which represents  the shareholders in managing assets. While the board of  directors has full decisionmaking power from general policies  and principles to executive personnel, such as presidents, when  there is dereliction of duty or betrayal of trust, any  shareholder can take action against the board of directors.  Boards of directors appoint chief executive officers [CEOs],  including presidents and vice presidents, with it being  alright at times for board chairmen to serve as presidents.  While boards of directors in the United States generally meet  once a month, they meet less often in Europe. The chief duties  of boards of directors are to formulate general policies and  principles and oversee CEOs, such as presidents. While these  executive officers have obligations and rights, deciding  everything from investment to production, they are also subject  to strict restraints, basically in three areas: 1)  product-market competitive restraints; 2) capital-market  competitive restraints (the most recent studies have come to the  conclusion that share price changes have little restraining  impact, while takeovers and buyouts have slightly more); 3) the  established most effective restraint is the management-market  competitive restraint. Regretably, this is a market that we have  not established. Should we choose managers from the management  market or appoint them from the organizational or personnel  sectors? I hold that as a corporation is not a government  organization, but rather an enterprise, management personnel  appointments should firmly follow international standards for  the corporate system. A current concern is that without  control, there will be no future political control, which is not  necessarily so. For instance, in Singapore, while the ruling  party controls the government very well, senior responsible  appointments in large corporations are completely according to  international practice, with government control of boards of  directors. But to strengthen appointment of directors for  all-government-funded corporations, the government has a  bureau-level director-appointment commission, chaired by the  finance minister, and whose first member is Deputy Prime  Minister Li Hsien Loong. Appointments of subordinate-company  directors is left to shareholding corporation boards of  directors, with certainly no signs that this method weakens  ruling-party leadership. Strengthening party leadership, by  adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, and separating  the party, the government, and enterprises, are two principles  adhered to by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This matter needs  discussion by all.    In addition, making stock rights out of creditor rights  discharges certain burdens, while creating new forms of public  ownership. This merits much attention. If the socialist system  is to stand, it must recreate its property-rights system, so  that it conforms to the property-rights socialization principle,  while not being hampered by traditional public-ownership  concepts. As how to establish a modern enterprise system  grounded in the dominance of public ownership is a theoretical  and policy matter of fundamental significance, it needs joint  study by all.</p>

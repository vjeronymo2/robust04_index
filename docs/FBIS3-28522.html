			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dili, Feb 8 (ANTARA) -- East Timor Governor Abilio  Jose Osorio Soares said on Monday that the proposal by  Australia, Britain and Canada to the UN secretary general for  Indonesia to withdraw its troops from the province should not be  taken seriously. "The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) play a very  important function in the welfare of the people," said Soares  before leaving for Denpasar to attend the inauguration of the  new Bali-based Udayana regional military commander. He said  ABRI's territorial operation in East Timor was different from  those in Europe which was mostly aimed at military purposes.    Noting that several western countries have often misjudged  ABRI's role in the province, the governor said, "They view the  presence of the troops as a violation of human rights."  According to him, the East Timorese in fact welcome the troops  stationed there in order to maintain security and train the  residents in skills needed to develop the province.    He believed the Western countries would be very surprised to  learn that ABRI soldiers did not carry any weapons but a mattock  instead. "The troops work with the locals to build roads, farms,  churches, mosques and other places of worhip." The governor  stressed that the provincial administration and residents have  never objected to the presence of ABRI troops. "It is always the  Westerners that like to create an issue," he added.    However, Soares also said the troops would be pulled out  gradually unless the locals wanted otherwise. "If they are still  needed, they will stay," he said, adding that the troops would  be withdrawn completely by 1995, on condition that the province  showed progress.</p>

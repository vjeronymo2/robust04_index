			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 26 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received a delegation of Russia's State  Duma headed by General Nikolay Maksimovich Bezborodov, deputy  president of the State Duma defense committee.    In their open and cordial talks with Slobodan Milosevic the  representatives of the Russian parliament expressed support for  Serbia's peace efforts and voiced their unanimous stand that  economic sanctions against the FRY should be lifted  unconditionally, according to a statement released by the office  of the Serbian president. These sanctions are essentially an  expression of discriminatory policies, something that is at odds  with the principle of equality in international relations. The  economic blockade of the FRY imposed by the international  community is in deep contravention of modern and democratic  commitments to integration in the worldm, since it is one of the  most inhumane actions taken against a people at the end of the  20th century, it was said at today's meeting between President  Milosevic and the Russian parliamentarians.    In the opinion of the members of the Russian parliament,  Russia should help, with its principled and objective attitudes  to the parties in the Yugoslav crisis, to find a just political  solution, something that is totally incompatible with the  continuation of the unreasonable economic blockade against the  FRY. Stressing that Serbia holds in high regard Russia's  balanced and impartial attitudes, as well as its peace efforts  aimed at bringing an end to the civil war in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and establish a just  and stable peace in these lands, President Milosevic pointed out  that in this context it is of great importance to restore the  impartial role of the United Nations in the peace process in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and to abandon the policy of pressures,  threats, and imposed solutions on the part of the international  community. During the talks it was stressed that Serbia  advocates an end to all hostilities and a political solution  secured through a negotiating process.    FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part in  today's talks between President Milosevic and the Russian  parliamentarians.</p>

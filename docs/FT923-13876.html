			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Tory unease on economy spreading TORY backbenchers stepped up pressure for a change in the government's economic strategy yesterday in spite of a renewed effort by ministers to calm markets by insisting there would be no 'quick fixes' or policy changes. At question time, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, dismissed the notion of devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism as 'pure fool's gold' that would do nothing to turn round the economy. Questioned from both sides of the Commons, he insisted that the only means by which Britain would increase its exports was to keep a firm hold on inflation and raise competitiveness. But the Treasury's steady-as-she-goes strategy is coming under increasing criticism in the Commons as MPs voice concerns over high interest rates, sterling's exchange rate and the general health of the UK economy. It is also clear that the sluggish state of the economy is now spreading disquiet well beyond Conservative Euro-sceptics and into the mainstream of the party. As the Treasury and Downing Street insisted that the government remained 'firm and resolute' on holding sterling's DM2.95 central ERM rate, unease was fuelled by reports that Baroness Thatcher had warned of an imminent 'financial accident' if policies were not changed. Although Lady Thatcher's remarks at a private dinner with businessmen last week were dismissed by her office as 'nothing new', they provided fresh ammunition for Labour. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, seized on the government's unease to highlight an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast predicting that UK manufacturing investment would fall 3.8 per cent in the current year. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, countered that 30 per cent investment growth between 1986 and 1989 meant that Britain was starting from a high base with first-quarter figures showing a marked improvement. For the government, however, the more worrying criticism is coming from its own backbenchers. Yesterday Sir Peter Tapsell, Tory MP for Lindsey East, asked why the government had to have 'its hand held' by German bankers. Outside the chamber, Sir Rhodes Boyson, MP for Brent North, said good businesses were under intense pressure because real interest rates were far above those of European competitors.</p>

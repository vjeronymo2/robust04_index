Earlier, until Nikolay Golushko's resignation  this week, Stepashin had held the post of FCS first deputy  director. Informed sources say that there were also other  candidates for the post of new director. But, the sources said,  the other aspirants "have opted out."    The FCS press service issued a brief statement by the new  FCS  chief. Among his department's priorities he mentioned work "to  expose, prevent, and curb intelligence-subversive activity by  foreign special services and organizations, and illegal  encroachments on Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and defense capability." Sergey  Stepashin is convinced that the Russian president needs "strong  and effective special services."    According to Mr. Stepashin, there are plans to hold an  all-Russian conference of territorial counterintelligence chiefs  in March which will consider concrete measures and define  optimal forms of FCS activity. In an interview with INTERFAX he  said that yesterday's Russian Federation Security Council  session, which examined the federal program to fight organized  crime in 1994-1995, specified the FCS' tasks in the area of  combating corruption, including in the upper echelons of power.  Therefore this Russian special service has retained the  functions of countering criminals inside the country, which  earlier belonged to the ministry, without confining itself only  to fighting the external threat. At least for the time being  there are no plans for another reorganization of the FCS.   <H5>    Stepashin, Sergey Vadimovich </H5>   Was born on 2 March 1952 in the city of Port Arthur (PRC).

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL up on BAe bid move British Aerospace raced ahead following the announcement of the long awaited agreed bid for submarine maker VSEL, with analysts taking a favourable view of the trading, balance sheet and fiscal implications of the proposed takeover. The stock advanced throughout the day in heavy volume to close 12 higher at 471p on a turnover of 12m shares. VSEL finished at 1310p, up 85 on the day and 15 above the notional value of the share exchange portion of the offer. Analysts felt that the takeover was Defence Ministry driven. By yesterday afternoon, speculation on the possibility of a potential counter-bid had begun to flag, although in some quarters GEC was still being promoted as the most likely potential rival to British Aerospace. If it goes ahead, the deal stands to widen BAe's defence capability and bolster its balance sheet. VSEL brings in net cash of Pounds 288m plus tax benefits that allow profits to roar through to BAe effect-ively tax free in both 1995 and 1996.</p>

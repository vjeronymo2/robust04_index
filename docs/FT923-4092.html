			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Baseball troubles boil over as chief throws in mitt THE resignation on Monday night of Mr Fay Vincent as Commissioner of Baseball threatens to turn America's national sport into an industrial relations battlefield in the months ahead, even to the point of putting at risk next year's season. He was ousted by the owners of the 28 leading league teams, who saw him as too independent. They voted last week by 18-9, with one abstention, to ask him to go. Mr Vincent resisted voluntary departure for a few days before issuing a statement noting that 'sometimes decisions have to be made that are not in the interest of some owners'. Baseball's problems, real in spite of its great popularity, are complex and rooted in labour relations law, which over 20 years has generally given the players greater rights over their own destiny. One consequence, however, has been escalating salaries, which this season for the first time exceeded Dollars 1m (Pounds 502,500) a player. Most clubs are not publicly quoted companies but it is said that half are now operating at a loss. From the owners' perspective, Mr Vincent's mistake was to intervene in the 1990 pre-season contractual dispute. Mr Tom Glavine, the Atlanta pitcher and player representative, said Mr Vincent ended the lock-out and 'that was to our benefit'. Mr Richie Phillips, head of the umpires' union, predicted that the owners would seek a pretext for another confrontation and would close the sport down 'for a very long time'. The owners are a disparate lot. Their ringleader in disposing of Mr Vincent was Mr Jerry Reinsdorf, who owns the Chicago White Sox, the Chicago Bulls basketball team and the Chicago Tribune media group. Mr Reinsdorf had made it clear in countless interviews that he faulted the commissioner for not taking on the players' union. Mr Vincent, a corporate lawyer with a long involvement in baseball, had been appointed with the necessary consent of the owners in 1989. He saw his job as representing all baseball's various elements - the owners, the players, the umpires and the fans. In this respect he was acting in the tradition of the first commissioner, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was brought in to clean up baseball after the Chicago White Sox gambling scandal more than 70 years ago. Mr Vincent also irked Mr Reinsdorf, whose Tribune group owns a super-station beaming games across the country, by insisting that television revenues be shared among all clubs, including those with poor local markets. He upset others by decreeing that the Chicago Cubs should move to the western division of the National League, a decision now rendered moot. The image of Mr Reinsdorf and some of his more powerful colleagues conjured up by the US press yesterday was that of 19th century mill owners. Their choice for a permanent replacement will not be easy, although some powerful candidates for what has always been a high profile job have been mentioned. Among them are Mr James Baker, now White House chief of staff who would be out of a job if President George Bush loses the election race in November, and Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic party and a friend of Mr Reinsdorf. However, if the owners want to curb the independence of the commissioner they may have to appoint a lesser luminary, perhaps Mr Lee Macphail, a former head of the American League.</p>

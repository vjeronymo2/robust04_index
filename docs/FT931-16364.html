			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Choosing a new governor THE DEBACLE over the ERM has not led to a serious review of the role and structure of the Bank of England. It has led, instead, to gestures in the direction of greater openness that mask what amounts to a prompt return to business as usual. What matters, it appears, is not what the Bank of England is to do and how it should do it better, but who is to be responsible for doing whatever it is to do. It is all too typically British. In the view of both Whitehall and Westminster, the governorship is more a dignified than an efficient part of the constitution. The Bank may be more palatial. Its staff may even be better paid. But it is the Treasury that is supposed to have the brains and certainly has the power. It is hardly surprising therefore that the choice of a replacement for Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton is being discussed more as if it were just another horse race than as a matter of real policy importance. It need not be this way and certainly should not be this way. Lord Justice Bingham's scathing report on the supervision of BCCI raises pressing questions about the Bank of England's management and its role as a banking supervisor. The ERM saga raises still more questions about the Bank's role in the formulation of monetary policy. The appointment of the new governor should, above all, send a signal about how such questions are to be answered. The starting point must be the Bank's mission. 'Its core purposes are,' it says, 'to maintain the value of the currency and the integrity of the financial system and to promote the efficiency of financial markets.' This may look logical enough, but the present Bank of England is, in fact, more an historical accident than a logical construct. Obvious task Maintaining the value of the currency is, indeed, an obvious task for a central bank. Yet the Bank of England has never held sole responsibility for that function. It has either operated within a fixed exchange rate regime or under Treasury tutelage. This needs to change, not for merely theoretical reasons, nor because central bank independence is at the heart of the Maastricht treaty to which the government says it is committed, but because past monetary policy has been so awful. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system, the pound has lost 85 per cent of its internal value and the economy has passed through three agonising go-stop cycles, for each of which monetary policy mistakes were principally responsible. Calls for a more independent central bank are a fully justified response to such failures. While the Bank may not have responsibility for monetary policy, it has collected several others, instead: as lender of last resort, as banking supervisor and as the voice of the City. Yet there are potential conflicts among these roles. Was one of the reasons for tolerating BCCI not the assumption that the more institutions there are in London the better? Do naive depositors not view supervision by the Bank of England as implying a parallel commitment in its capacity of lender of last resort? Managerial failures If the Bank's functions need to be rethought from outside, it also needs to be restructured from inside. If it is to have greater responsibility for monetary policy, for example, it will need a new Court of Directors, one with far greater policy-making expertise. The new governor himself must be capable of representing and defending the Bank's policy views both in the UK and abroad; he should be able to contribute to a national debate on the proper functions and structure of the Bank; he should be open to new ideas; and he should be able to tackle the managerial failures of the Bank that have been revealed so starkly in the case of BCCI. If such a paragon is not available in the UK, the government should look abroad. Yet too much must not be made of the appointment itself. Far more important is the government's own attitude to the formation of monetary policy. It has shown itself resolutely determined to persist with a structure in which there are at most two votes that matter, those of the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister. What the UK needs, instead, is a central bank that is responsible for monetary stability and a governor who is accountable for failure to achieve it. It would need that if sterling were to rejoin the ERM. It would need it still more if it were not to do so. The question, this time, must not be who sits in the Bank of England. It should, instead, be what he will be responsible for doing.</p>

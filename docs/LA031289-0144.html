			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO IRANIAN COMMUNITY FEARS RETRIBUTION  </P> <P> Members of San Diego's small Iranian community say they fear retribution for  Friday's suspected terrorist bombing here.  </P> <P> The fiery explosion destroyed a van driven by the wife of Capt. Will Rogers  III, who directed the July, 1988, missile attack that mistakenly downed an  Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Friday's bombing, which left Sharon Rogers uninjured, has stirred speculation  that the attack was to avenge the deaths of the 290 people aboard the civilian  jetliner. The attack is under investigation by federal authorities.  </P> <P> "People blame us for everything the Ayatollah (Khomeini of Iran) does, from  book-burnings to hijackings," said Sara Ahamadianfard, who came to the United  States in 1975 with her husband, a student at United States International  University here.  </P> <P> "So it won't surprise me if people assume Iranians had something to do with  this," she said.  </P> <P> Adeeb Nozar Ahmadi, who works at a San Diego grocery store, said he worries  that someone angered by the van bombing might take out their frustration on him  or his young son.  </P> <P> "I can tell when some people come into the store that they don't think I  deserve to be here, that I am somehow a terrorist because of the actions of  people I don't even know," he said.  </P></p>

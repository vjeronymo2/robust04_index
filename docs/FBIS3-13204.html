			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, controller </F> general of the Muslim Brotherhood, by an unidentified reporter  in Amman; date not given]    [AL-SABIL] We have learned that some arrests were made  within the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. How true  is this and what is the reason for the arrests?    [Khalifah] I do not believe there are any intentions or  designs against the Muslim Brotherhood on the part of the  Jordanian Government. After many years of experience, it has  become evident to all unbiased and informed people that the  stands of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has existed and worked  in Jordan for more than half a century, are noble stands aimed  at spreading a feeling of security, tranquility, and safety.  This is with the exception of some minor incidents fabricated  by a handful of evil people who are hired by parties hostile to  security in this country.    As for the issue of arrests, it is not even worth  mentioning.  What we know so far is that one of the brothers in the Suwaylih  branch of the Islamic Brotherhood was arrested. His name is  'Abd-al-Majid Dayah and he is an engineer. Everything I know  about him is good.    Another person, named 'Abd-al-Majid Ibrahim al-Majali, is  one  of the brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood of al-Qasr in  al-Karak. He was questioned a few months ago when he wanted to  leave Jordan in order to join the ranks of the mujahidin against  the communists in Afghanistan. He was held for some time on  charges of carrying an amount of money to help the mujahidin in  Afghanistan. At the time, he was not a regular member of the  Muslim Brotherhood. He was released a few months later. I do  not remember how long he was detained.    I am totally surprised by those who are trying to create  intrigue and level false accusations against this Islamic  organization. It has been established in Jordan for more than  half a century, since the era of the late King 'Abdallah  Bin-al-Husayn, through the era of the late King Talal, and now  in the era of King Husayn. Each of them has known that the call  of the Muslim Brotherhood continues to be that of a reliable aid  to achieving tranquility and concentrating on Islamic education.  It is concerned about the security of the country and our  standing within one solid rank against the enemies inside and  outside the country.    It has been proven through investigations that plotters  against Islam and its people were behind the cinema  explosions--attributed to Islamists--and the previous explosions  in some liquor stores in Jabal Amman and al-Salt. Indeed, this  is because the method of the Islamic message is in line with  Almighty God's saying: "Invite all to the way of thy lord with  wisdom and beautiful preaching." [Koranic verse] It is not the  method of Islam to attack the defenseless by planting explosives  in cinemas, coffee shops, and public squares, which only harms  innocent women, children, and the elderly.    The fair investigation of these incidents proved the  innocence of those from the Muslim Brotherhood who stood accused.    Moreover, the investigation proved to all logical people  that  these methods are far from the methods of the Muslim  Brotherhood, which continues to criticize officials and urges  them to stop all illegal practices, including the spread of  immoral entertainment, and other violations that could encourage  the spread of vice. We continue to search for people who will  listen to these complaints and adopt a stand that limits these  immoral actions.    [AL-SABIL] In light of this, do you believe that there is a  conspiracy against the Muslim Brotherhood seeking to sow a rift  between them and the regime in this country, in preparation, God  forbid, to dealing a blow to democracy in it, particularly since  the Muslim Brotherhood has an explicit stand on the peace  process in the region?    [Khalifah] The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and in the other  Arab countries have not changed their clear policy toward the  Palestinian cause since the establishment of their call,  although in Islam one greets another by saying: peace be upon  you. We can never believe that the Jews want peace with the  inhabitants of Palestine or with the other Arabs. The Muslim  brothers clearly know this fact, and are also aware of the Jews  wickedness, machinations, and enmity toward Islam and its  followers.    From this premise, if Palestine is not purged of the filth  of  the Jews, it will remain a Trojan horse the colonialist  countries in Europe and America will use to return colonialism  to the Arab countries in general, and the Islamic countries in  particular. The United States has succeeded in arming the state  of the usurper Jews in Palestine and has transformed it into an  aircraft carrier to subdue the Arab and Islamic countries.  Conceding any part of Palestine to the Jews is banned by Islam.  The jurisprudence based on the Koran and the Sunna stipulates  the following: If the enemy steps on a single inch of Muslim  land, every male and female Muslim is duty bound to carry out  jihad. The woman can even leave her husband's house without his  permission and the slave without his master's permission. The  Muslim Brotherhood and others who preach Islam will be  renouncing their religion if they agree to give any part of  Palestine to the Jews or the other enemies of God. Palestine and  Jerusalem can be liberated only if the Arab countries unite and  adopt a cohesive stand with the other Islamic countries. The  Jews know this.    Therefore, any rumor or machination against the Muslim  Brotherhood cannot but originate from the Jewish enemy, its  agents, and its partners in Europe and the United States.    King Husayn, who has always called for Arab solidarity and  Islamic cooperation, and has cautioned against and confronted  all outside conspiracies against this homeland whose safety he  has secured thanks to his wise policies and alertness, should  not pay any attention to any slander campaign or rumor against  the Islamic movement in our steadfast country. God knows  intentions.</p>

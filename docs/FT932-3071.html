			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke appeals for end to Conservative infighting TORY backbenchers should put the recent infighting behind them, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, urged yesterday as he welcomed the - albeit conditional - support for Mr John Major from Baroness Thatcher. He also appealed to Conservative MPs to stop giving him daily advice on the November Budget and to stop airing different views about what changes he should make on taxation and public spending. Also helping Mr Major was Lord Tebbit, former party chairman and Euro-sceptic. 'The party doesn't want a leadership election of any kind. Indeed the country doesn't,' he said on BBC television. Mr Clarke sounded relaxed about the suggestions that Lady Thatcher's intervention was intended to weaken his own position rather than bolster Mr Major. He said her motivation was immaterial. In a sharp comment on the volatility of Tory MPs Mr Clarke said: 'I ask my colleagues not to have these doctrinal rows about whether they feel in favour of tax or less spending today.' After Downing Street's attempts to quash suggestions that the government might not be able to keep to its election manifesto, Mr Clarke restated his own commitment to the pledges it contained. 'I was elected on that manifesto and insofar as I need to be reminded of it, it merely reminds of me things that I know I don't want to do,' he said.</p>

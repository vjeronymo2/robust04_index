			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRACTICAL MIND: DAYDREAMING: YOUR HIDDEN RESOURCE FOR SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND  CREATIVITY BY ERIC KLINGER (JEREMY TARCHER: $18.95)  </P> <P> This is the most seductive kind of self-help book, because it talks about a  shared secret, daydreaming, that as yet hasn't been exploited to death on the  afternoon TV talk shows. We all daydream -- and, given the amount of time  Angelenos spend trapped on one roadway or another, we probably have more time  to do it than most people. Klinger's book appeals to the narcissist and the  neurotic in all of us: He's prepared to talk about our personal fantasies as  though they were the most important thing in the world; he's also quick to  reassure us that other people have waking dreams, too.  </P> <P> Klinger manages a nice balance between his research and the inherently amusing  nature of his subject, so the book is a bit more accessible than a more  academic treatise might be. He sets the tone with the daydream report that he  quotes at the opening to Chapter 1: "I am married to Harrison Ford or William  Hurt. We are both medical doctors. We have six gorgeous, talented and  well-behaved children. We are filthy rich."  </P> <P> Don't you feel less nuts already? From there, he tells us everything we ever  wanted to know about our conscious fantasies but were afraid to ask -- what  daydreams say about us, how we can use them to learn about ourselves, what the  benefits are of a little mental meandering, and how to address obsesssive  dreams.  </P> <P> And he is careful, always, to keep one foot firmly planted in reality. His  section on sexual daydreams, and the minefield of rape fantasies, is cautionary  and honest. Klinger acknowledges that such fantasies exist and tries to analyze  their elements, while making clear at every opportunity that such thoughts are  not a literal expression of the desire to commit, or experience, sexual  violence. He offers insight for the recreational daydreamer, and, for the  dreamer more troubled by the private world that he or she creates, he offers  the best antidote to despair -- information.  </P></p>

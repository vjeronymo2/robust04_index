			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITYHOOD BACKERS SUE TO FORCE MALIBU VOTE  </P> <P> Impatient backers of Malibu cityhood filed suit Tuesday in an attempt to force  county supervisors to set an April election for voters to decide whether to  incorporate the seaside community.  </P> <P> "We think we've done the only thing left for us to do," said Walt Keller,  co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation which, with the Malibu  Township Council, filed the Superior Court complaint. It accuses the  supervisors of violating a state law that gives them 60 days from the time they  begin hearing a cityhood matter to conclude the hearing, before setting an  election in another 30 days. The supervisors took up the issue Oct. 19, and  voted 4 to 1 last month to postpone a decision until construction permits are  issued for a Malibu sewer system the county wants to build.  </P></p>

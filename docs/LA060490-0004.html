			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 115: RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND CRIME VICTIMS' REFORM ACT  </P> <P> This is my first letter to the editor and I am writing in hopes that maybe this  will reach people who are not aware of how important Prop. 115 is to all of us.  Five years ago before my son was murdered I would not of known or really  thought about how important this one proposition was.  </P> <P> Many who have not suffered the devastation of losing a loved one should be  angry enough about the price that lengthy trials cost us the taxpayers let  alone having a torturous rapist set free to live among us because he has served  his sentence. Those of us who have had to deal personally with the system have  had our eyes opened to the reality that it is not only our sorrow that makes us  suffer. This is our chance to make our system more fair.  </P> <P> Prop. 115 is the most important criminal justice reform measure to be put  before the voters in 15 years. It will speed up trials by shortening  preliminary hearings and the jury selection process. It will create a new crime  of torture.  </P> <P> Prop. 115 changes California law so that those accused of crimes would have the  rights already guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, but no more.  </P> <P> If Prop. 115 passes, the scales of justice may even out a little more instead  of swaying so heavily for the criminals.  </P> <P> HAZEL BROWN  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

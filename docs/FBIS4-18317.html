			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Irish Government officials made no attempt today to  disguise a deep sense of frustration over the IRA decision to  limit a post-Easter ceasefire to just three days.    After further consideration of the terrorist's move -- and a  meeting between Dublin Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and his  deputy Dick Spring -- a senior source said: "To say we are  disappointed is putting it mildly. Ministers are really annoyed  that the IRA did not come up with something more meaningful."    Mr. Reynolds, in particular, was understood to have been  partcularly angered at the brief length of the ceasefire. Mr.  Spring reported after the ministerial exchanges in Dublin's  government buildings: "The prospect of people not being killed  in Belfast for three days is to be welcomed.    ``But at the same time, it is very disappointing. We have  been working with the British Government in the context of the  Downing Street-Northern Ireland peace declaration to bring about  a permanent cessation of violence, and that is not happening."  Unless there is a permanent cessation of violence there cannont  be any negotation between Sinn Fein and either government.''    Mr. Spring, also the Irish Foreign Minister, said the best  chance of progress might now lie with the communities of  Northern Ireland: "If people can see over three days what  happens without it, they can convince the men of violence it  should come to an end."    Irish Goverment aides made it clear that Dublin felt there  was little more they could now do in response to last night's  IRA statement.    Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern  Ireland committee, said: "We're not interested in ceasefires...I  don't think that a tactical pause in murder is something to be  welcomed."    Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the IRA move  "represents  an important initiative" and urged Mr. Major to authorise  immediate talks with his party.    Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, said: "This is a tactic that has to do with placing the  IRA and Sinn Fein in a stronger position than they are presently  in."    John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said: "It's a  very  risky road but it's a worthwhile road if the ultimate objective  is a total cessation of violence and therefore no stone should  left unturned."    Prime Minister Albert Reynolds called it "a very small step  in the right direction."</p>

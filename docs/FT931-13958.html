			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: ERM target currencies recover from attacks ALL THREE currencies - the French franc, Irish punt and Danish krone - are now under much less pressure inside the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) than they were two weeks ago, writes James Blitz in London. The French franc closed last night at FFr3.3800 against the D-Mark, some 5 pfennigs above its ERM floor. Earlier in the day, it had been at FFr3.3770, its highest level since November 19 last year. The Irish punt was also stronger, less than a fortnight after it had been trading below its ERM floor of 2.95100 against the Dutch guilder. At the end of European trading yesterday, the punt was seen as high as 2.9805. The Danish krone has also strengthened. The krone was yesterday trading well away from its ERM floor of DKr3.901 to the D-Mark, at DKr3.8373. French money market rates have risen all this week, in spite of the stronger currency, with 3-month french francs rising yesterday to 11 15/16 per cent from a previous close of 11 3/4 per cent. In Dublin, the overnight lending rate for the punt is well down from the 100 per cent seen in the first week of this year. But the cost of borrowing punts for 11 months was at around 17 per cent last night. Earlier this week, Denmark's central bank cut its key lending rate by 1 percentage point, to 12 per cent. However, 3-month krone were still trading nearly 500 basis points above 3-month D-Marks yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MCPHEE LEADS CANADIENS TO 5-3 WIN  </P> <P> Mike McPhee, one of the key players for the Montreal Canadiens for several  seasons, has battled injuries this season.  </P> <P> He returned just in time to lead the Canadiens to a 5-3 victory over the Boston  Bruins Saturday night at Montreal.  </P> <P> McPhee, playing in only his fifth game of the season, scored his first two  goals to help end the Bruins' unbeaten string at nine games. It also kept the  Canadiens in a tie with Buffalo for first place in the tight Adams Division  race.  </P> <P> The Bruins have not won at the Forum since Dec. 13, 1986. During that period  the Canadiens are 11-0-1 against them.  </P> <P> Goals by McPhee, who has been nursing a strained abdominal muscle, and Stephane  Richer in the first three minutes gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> But Cam Neely scored his 16th and 17th goals to get the Bruins even.  </P> <P> McPhee put the Canadiens ahead to stay at 4:01 of the second period.  </P> <P> Washington 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Back-to-back victories against a good team are  difficult. Even though they came home after beating Washington at Landover,  Md., Friday night, the Penguins had little chance.  </P> <P> Washington goaltender Don Beaupre, sent to an early shower after giving up six  goals in barely half the game Friday night, came back to play brilliantly in  Pittsburgh. He stopped 15 shots, losing a shutout with less than 12 minutes  remaining when Mario Lemieux scored a short-handed goal.  </P> <P> Beaupre was hurt on the play in which Lemieux scored and had to leave a few  minutes later.  </P> <P> Geoff Courtnall set up three goals as the Capitals dominated from start to  finish.  </P> <P> With 17 seconds remaining, the teams engaged in a free-for-all involving all  the players on the ice except the goaltenders.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, Calgary 3 -- The Flames led, 3-1, with five minutes to play at St.  Louis.  </P> <P> But Adams Oates scored on a deflection at 15:02, and Rony Hrkac tied it with  1:45 left in regulation. The tie gave Calgary's Stanley Cup champions an 0-5-4  record in the last nine games.  </P> <P> Edmonton 7, New York Islanders 2 -- Normand Lacombe, benched for 12 games after  going scoreless in eight in a row, was ready when he was reinstated for the  game at Uniondale, N.Y.  </P> <P> Lacombe scored his first three goals and had an assist to lead the Oilers to an  easy victory over the Islanders, who fell to 5-17-3.  </P> <P> The Oilers are 4-1-0 in their last five.  </P> <P> Buffalo 3, Quebec 2 -- Pierre Turgeon scored with just 16 seconds remaining in  regulation at Quebec to keep the Sabres in a tie for first place in the Adams  Division with Montreal.  </P> <P> Turgeon took a pass from Dave Andreychuk and beat goalie Ron Tugnutt for his  11th goal.  </P> <P> The Sabres built a 2-0 lead but couldn't hold it.  </P> <P> Hartford 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Ron Francis and Scott Young scored power-play  goals less than five minutes apart in the second period at Hartford, Conn., to  break open a close game.  </P> <P> Goaltender Mike Liut stopped 18 shots, lowered his goals-against average to  2.31 and ended the Whalers' three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Toronto 7, New York Rangers 4 -- Gary Leeman scored twice at Toronto to help  the Maple Leafs end a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Rangers lead the Patrick Division by five points.  </P> <P> After scoring four times in the first two periods against Bob Froese, the Maple  Leafs scored three times off John Vanbiesbrouck in the final 20 minutes.  </P> <P> New Jersey 3, Winnipeg 1 -- John MacLean and Sylvain Turgeon scored  first-period goals and the Devils held on to win at Winnipeg and move into a  tie for second place in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> A late onslaught enabled the Jets to outshoot the Devils, but goalie Chris  Terreri was superb, stopping 38 shots, 18 of them in the last period.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / October retail sales show small increase in volumes A SMALL rise in UK consumers' spending in shops triggered some optimism yesterday that Britain may be moving slowly out of its two-year recession. Expectations about the faltering recovery were helped by small cuts in interest rates in Belgium and the Netherlands, which suggested that Europe as a whole may be able to move towards easier borrowing conditions over the next few months as a result of signs of economic slowdown in Germany. News that retail sales volumes rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in October compared with September surprised the City, which had been prepared for a small downturn. In the three months to October 30, retail volumes increased by 0.9 per cent compared with the previous three months. The figures from the Central Statistical Office suggest that consumers took a relatively sanguine view of the run of bleak economic news since the summer, including Britain's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. On the London stock market, investor sentiment was also buoyed by hopes of a further cut in UK base rates, now at 7 per cent. Buying by institutional investors boosted the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks by 24.8, to a close of 2,704.0. Buying pressure was supported by a strong tone to dealing on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.05 to 3,207.37. Sterling was affected little by the day's events, closing in London in quiet trading unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.43, and a tenth of a cent up against the dollar at Dollars 1.5210. In New York it closed at DM2.4257 and Dollars 1.526. The central banks of the Netherlands and Belgium moved to take advantage of the recent signs of weakness in the D-Mark, making limited cuts in their dealing rates. While the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 8.70 per cent from 8.80 per cent, Belgium reduced its overnight rate to 9.20 per cent from 9.25 per cent. The figures for UK retailing, which accounts for about a quarter of the economy, showed sales volumes in the latest three-month period were up 1.6 per cent on the equivalent period last year. Sales of household goods were 6 per cent up on a three-monthly basis measured over the past year, while food retailers saw an 0.7 per cent increase in volumes over this period. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, seized on the rise in retail sales as among several 'hopeful indicators' pointing to economic revival. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body, was less impressed. It said that consumer confidence remained fragile in spite of the rise in sales volumes, and more government action was needed to boost the economy. Manufacturers' stocks of semi-finished products fell in the three months to the end of September by a provisional Pounds 154m at 1985 prices, after falls of Pounds 1m in the second quarter and Pounds 550m in the first quarter, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Stocks of finished products in factories increased by Pounds 306m. Wholesalers' stocks were down by Pounds 207m, compared with a fall of Pounds 237m in the previous quarter.

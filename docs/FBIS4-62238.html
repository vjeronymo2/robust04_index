			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the </F> Russian Border Troops, by Dmitriy Kholodov: "A Border Is a  Relative Term. Border Troops Commander Andrey Nikolayev:  "`Keep Out'-- an Absolutely Incompetent Approach" -- place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] As he left the post of first deputy chief of  the Russian Armed Forces General Staff "to become a border  guard," Nikolayev is said to have "coaxed" many of his former  subordinates to follow him. There are about 40 of them, who are  called "watermelons" because they are green as border guard  shoulder boards on the outside, but inside they are as red as  army shoulder boards. They have brought along lots of new things  to the border troop service. Nikolayev has tested new methods  of command and control of the border troops by setting up a  "mini-general staff," particularly the central command post,  something hitherto unheard of in the border troops.  Coordination between the army and the border troops has been  established on the Tajik border. The practice of publishing  intelligence reports on the eve of mujahidin assaults helps  maintain a more or less peaceful existence.    Of all newspapers, the commander in chief of the Russian  Border Troops has given MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS his first  interview.    [Kholodov] Andrey Ivanovich, one of these days marks  precisely nine months since you were placed in command of the  border troops. This is a period sufficient even to give birth to  a baby. Have you managed to push through any changes in the  border service?    [Nikolayev] Even recently the Russian Border Troops have  been merely a main service of the Security Ministry. It has  been for four months now (from 1 December) that they turned into  a federal service that, according to its status, is not simply a  ministry, but an agency that shapes state policy in the area of  border protection. Now the border is not merely a line where a  border guard in uniform fulfills his service duties, but a  frontier from which the state begins. [passage omitted]    [Kholodov] Are you subordinate to the Federal  Counterintelligence Service director? Can he, say, "summon" you?    [Nikolayev] I report only to the president.    [Kholodov] In addition, you have become a member of the  Security Council and your agency has turned from a command into  a main command...    [Nikolayev] Not quite so. We are "the Federal Border  Service -- the Main Command of the Border Troops." [passage  omitted]    [Kholodov] The length of the Russian state border is  60,932.8 km. Of them, 14,000 km (more than 80 percent of the  land border) are new borders that have effectively not been  formalized from the point of view of international law. In  1993, 43 million people crossed the Russian border, which  amounts to a 21-fold increase against previous years.    [Nikolayev] The very concept of border protection has also  changed. The old "compression concept" said that Russia should  draw back into its territory. It has a border and the border  must be protected. But a question arose: Where do Russian  interests lie? Where should its security be protected? We say:  We must ensure Russia's security along its national borders and  also along advanced lines within the Commonwealth. Why should  we set up a new border with Kazakhstan that is over 6,500 km  long? There is no infrastructure there. But everything we need  is on the old border. Then why shouldn't we protect it jointly,  defending Russian interests THERE? Internal borders within the  CIS, however, should be made transparent. They tell us: You  want to restore the borders of the USSR. But first of all we  want to ensure Russia's national interests. The Russian state  spent ages to reach those borders to throw them away overnight.    [Kholodov] Then, a question. Why should borders be  transparent only within the Commonwealth? For instance,  wouldn't Azerbaijan like to have a transparent border with  Turkey or Iran?    [Nikolayev] Everyone says: We are sovereign. But Russia is  also a sovereign state. We have presented Azerbaijan with a  choice: Either it takes part in the joint border protection  system that includes Russia, or we will close the  Russian-Azerbaijani border, something we have actively been  doing at present. They say: We want this border to remain  transparent. Then ensure our interests on the "external"  border, and we will not erect this one. We have already signed  treaties with Armenia and Georgia. Russian border guards  protect the border there and are financed on a shared basis --  50:50 with Armenia and 60:40 with Georgia, including soldiers,  officer personnel, and contractees. Moreover, in the Caucasus  we had to build a border in an unconventional way -- in two  lines. The first one is drawn along the former USSR border.  But owing to civil wars the Caucasus is currently oversaturated  with arms and drugs; because of an open border between  Azerbaijan and Iran everyone may walk there whichever way he  likes. This is why we are setting up the second line of border  control in the North Caucasus. This is not a troop line --  there are no fences there, only border checkpoints and  operational units, including troops, that ensure control in  between these points.    [Kholodov] Can you estimate how much money Russia will  have to throw away on restoring the border?    [Nikolayev] Finances are for the most part Azerbaijan's  problem. We, too, can take part by providing technical  assistance. We are interested in having the border patrolled by  aviation. And, of course, the Caspian Sea. If we fail to draw  a clear line there at this stage, say, Gasan-Kuli-Astafa, then  there will be a free zone inside the sea and everyone will be  able to set up rigs even outside Astrakhan.    [Kholodov] And another "Putina" [anti-poaching operation  launched this year in the Far East] will have to be launched?    [Nikolayev] I do not think we will wait for a situation that  has necessitated "Putina" in the Far East to come about.  Starting the second half of May, or in June at the latest, we  will start combating poaching in the Caspian, Black, Azov, and  Barents Seas.    [Kholodov] A global "Putina?"    [Nikolayev] "Putina" is not at issue. For instance, in the  Kaliningrad area there are contentious matters with regard to  drawing our sea border with Lithuania. According to  international law, it must be drawn perpendicularly to the  coast. The Lithuanians interpret this provision in a different  way. So, a divergence angle is emerging. There is oil and gas  within the angle. Large deposits at that. Today we sent a  joint note with the Foreign Ministry to notify the Lithuanian  Foreign Ministry that our ships will carry out border protection  there. They are protecting not only biological reserves -- fish  or crabs, as "Putina" does -- but mineral resources as well.    [Kholodov] As a matter of fact, the Baltic border has  already become a legend. They say that Estonia ranks nearly  first in the world in nonferrous metal exports that are taken  out of Russia. Can't a stop be put to this?    [Nikolayev] When a civilian says -- "Close the border" -- he  should bear in mind that currently 1 km of it costs 1 billion  rubles. As for the Baltics, we must have a tight border with  them.    [Kholodov] With dogs and a fence?    [Nikolayev] I would not say so. The form will be different,  but some sectors will be covered by artificial obstacles and  radar equipment. The dogs will be there, too, because at  present a dog virtually cannot be replaced with anything else.    [Kholodov] But the Baltics, too, have once been a zone of  Russian interests, haven't they?    [Nikolayev] A zone of interests is not only where our troops  are present on another state's territory. For instance, in  Belarus we do not have our border guards at all. But there is  an agreement whereby Belarus, represented by its border troops,  undertook to ensure Russian interests on its western border.  [passage omitted]    [Kholodov] How do you see the future of the border troops?    [Nikolayev] I see them as a civilian agency that will  include a military structure. The military function will not be  of key importance. The main thing will be cooperation -- in the  protection of borders with neighbors, checkpoints, operational  work, including the exposure of criminal groups.    [Kholodov] Why shouldn't we set up a civilian agency at  once? An agency that will include a customs service. After all,  you are protecting the same thing -- the border -- aren't you?    [Nikolayev] I think that in the long run, in 5-10 years or  so, their convergence is possible. But this is not a mechanical  process. This won't do -- you, you, and you will work together.  In the customs service, they have a different area of  expertise. Although -- in exceptional cases -- we sometimes do  take over customs control.    On the other hand, the struggle against smuggling. "Putina"  -- the struggle against unauthorized fishing -- is a concern of  the fisheries committee. But the committee does not have the  money -- an entire fleet has to be deployed for this purpose.    [Kholodov] Does it pay, I mean what you have already  deployed there?    [Nikolayev] It is even hard to estimate how much it pays.  We are working for the long-term prospects -- to restore the  reserves of salmon, crabs, and so forth. The border has to be  protected anyway, whether they try to sneak in or not. But now  we need to be economical -- we may well sell fishing licenses  where the situation allows. I have told Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin -- people should see the results. We should earn  money. It's no use striking an attitude of a dog in the manger  -- neither eat ourselves nor let others eat.</p>

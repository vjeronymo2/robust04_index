			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Share consolidations Share capital consolidations have accompanied both the special dividend payouts made by regional electricity companies - first East Midlands and now Yorkshire. The effect of the measure is to reduce the number of shares in issue, thus mimicking the effect of the share buy-backs which have been another popular way for the companies to slough off surplus cash. The chief reason given for the measure is a little odd: it is designed to ensure that the share price moves back to where it would have been had there been no special dividend in the first place. But a fall in the share price after the payout is announced is nothing to worry out, unless it is for more than the value of the dividend: it is a simple arithmetical adjustment to take account of the outflow of resources from the group. That companies go to the trouble of making the change implies limited faith in shareholders' intelligence. Total return should be the main investment yardstick, and that is the combination of the dividend and the share price. It also shows scepticism about investors' ability to make comparisons between the performance of companies in the same sector. True, all the regional electricity companies had the same share price when they were privatised. But they had different yields. So a simple comparison of share prices is specious. By contrast, share capital consolidations may prove useful when companies seek to raise capital from shareholders, rather than as a cosmetic adjunct to giving it back. There is a dearth of deep-discounted rights issues, even though these eliminate the need for costly underwriting. This may be because companies fear shareholders' reactions to the reduced share price and dividend which can follow such issues. The falls in price and dividends are technical in nature. But they could be avoided altogether if companies consolidated their capital as part of the rights issue process.</p>

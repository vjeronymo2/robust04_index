			<p>BFN     [Text] Outgoing Police Commissioner Rafi Peled says there  is no Palestinian police activity in Jerusalem. Peled was  reacting to East Jerusalem Arabic press reports submitted to the  Knesset Internal Affairs Committee by chairman Yehoshu'a Matza.  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that according to Peled,  the pictures that appeared in the newspapers were staged for  photographers. The commissioner added, however, that the  activity of Palestinian groups organized for dealing with  ethical and drug-related matters in Jerusalem has been stopped.</p>

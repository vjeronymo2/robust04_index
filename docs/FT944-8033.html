			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Biotech patents under threat - Technically Speaking The fate of the European Union Draft Directive on the legal protection of biotechnology inventions will be known shortly. An EU Conciliation Committee is due to meet on November 28 to see whether differences between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament can be worked out. Unfortunately, if the Parliament's amendments to the directive are adopted, the impact on biotechnology in Europe will be worse than being left with the uncertainty of a patchwork of national legislation. Industry research, medical science and the prospects of finding new medicines will be worse off than they are today. First introduced in 1988 with the intention of defining, clarifying and harmonising patent law for the biotechnology industry in Europe, the draft directive has recently undergone a number of mutations, mainly stemming from a well-intentioned but under-informed concern with bio-ethics. While no one would disagree that patenting parts of the human body in situ should be banned, it is vital that patent protection be available for isolated products derived from the human body if new biotechnology-derived medicines are to be developed. In the pharmaceutical industry, products will simply not be developed if R&amp;D costs cannot be recouped during the period of exclusivity that the patent system provides. The European Parliament does not seem to have realised the importance of this distinction and has voted in an amendment (Amendment 3) which would effectively reverse the original intention of the directive. The amendment means there is now a grave danger that isolated human genes, proteins and enzymes could be rendered unpatentable in Europe. This would be a retrograde step compared with current patent laws. More important, Europe would be placed at a competitive disadvantage with respect to other countries with a major biotechnology industry, especially the US and Japan. The consequences for investment in Europe would be devastating. The fault - and the solution - lies with the European Parliament. By February of this year, most of the issues raised by the directive had been addressed, and the Council of Ministers had reached a 'common position' which was acceptable to industry. However, a committee of Members of the European Parliament proposed a number of amendments, many of which the European Commission agreed with industry would be potentially lethal for biotechnology development in Europe. It is universally felt within the industry that adoption of the directive in its present form would have far-reaching consequences, creating an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to leave Europe rather than invest here. Equally serious would be the impact on the development of new biopharmaceuticals and on the treatment of genetic diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, Huntingdon's chorea, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, arthritis and atherosclerosis. The membership of the Conciliation Committee, which meets on November 28 to try to find a way round the problem, consists of 12 MEPs and 12 members of the Council of Ministers. The Council has made it clear that it refuses to accept Amendment 3 and wants to establish a legal framework that enhances Europe's competitiveness in this important field. Therefore, the ultimate outcome will depend largely on the attitude taken by the MEPs. It is still possible that these MEPs and the European Parliament as a whole can put the directive back on track before it is too late. If not, industry is unanimous in its feeling that it would be better to have no directive at all.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cai Fang (5591 2499) of the Rural Village </F> Development Research Institute of the China Academy of Social  Sciences: "A Trend Worth Noting in Rural Villages: Rural  Farmers' Income Gap Widens"]    [Text] During the past several years at the same time that  rural village economy was experiencing a swift expansion, the  growth of rural villagers' income was slowing down. Statistics  show that in the average villager's income in 1980 was 191.33  yuan; by 1985 this had climbed to 343.32 yuan, for an average  annual increase of 12.4 percent. However, from 1988 to 1990  there was a decrease in income. In 1991 income recovered and  reached 374.33 yuan, but between 1985 and 1991 the rate of  annual increase was only 1.8 percent.    At the same time this was taking place, the disparity in  incomes was also increasing.    A. Viewed nationwide, the disparity in incomes between rural  households has increased. In 1980 the Gini coefficient for rural  village income 0.2366; the multiple between the lowest and  highest levels of income was 3.16. By 1988 the Gini coefficient  had risen to 0.3024 and the multiple between high and low had  risen to 4.68, and this trend has become even more obvious in  more recent years. (Statisticians commonly use the Gini  coefficient to represent the degree of inequality in the  distribution of income; the greater the Gini coefficient the  more unequal the distribution.)    B. The disparity in villager incomes between regions has  increased. Using the national average villager's income as 1,  then in 1980 the index of income for the eastern, central and  western sections respectively was 1.303, 0.964 and 0.887, while  in 1990 it was respectively 1.431, 0.890 and 0.822.    C. The disparity between urban and rural incomes again  increased. The relevant materials show that urban residents'  income has increased from the 1984 ratio of 1.7:1 to the 1990  ratio of 2.2::1. This has caused a relative decrease in the  rural villagers' standard of living, with urban residents'  consumption ratio climbing from 2.3:1 in 1984 to 2.8:1 in 1990.  Causes of the increased disparity in incomes stemmed primarily  from the fact that changes in the prices of agricultural  products were not favorable to agriculture. In 1989 the  agricultural product procurement price index rose 15 percent but  the rural industrial product retail price index rose 18.7  percent. In 1990 the agricultural product procurement price  index suffered an overall decline of 3.5 percent while rural  village industrial products prices rose 4.6 percent. In 1991  agricultural product prices again fell by 2 percent, while rural  industrial product prices rose 3 percent. This exacerbated the  disparity in urban-rural incomes. Other major factors creating  the imbalance in incomes between rural households and between  rural districts were the tremendous changes which had taken  place in the relative ratios of agricultural and industrial  enterprises in the villages of each locality and the relative  ratios between agricultural and non-agricultural enterprises  taken up by the rural households. Still another important  problem was the ruthless assessment of payments from rural  villagers. According to rough statistics from the Ministry of  Agriculture, nationwide in 1991 in cases where statistics could  be compiled, villagers involuntarily paid out administrative  fees amounting to some 1.77 billion yuan, fines of all kinds  amounting to some 2.31 billion yuan, collective assessments of  4.1 billion and miscellaneous other expenses of 3.81 billion, or  an average of 13.8 yuan per person. On the one hand, these  expenses were not levied according to one's level of income, and  thus increased the discrepancies in incomes. On the other hand,  the economic expansion in each locality was uneven, and so in  the more developed eastern sections a large portion of the  various impositions were borne by the town and township  enterprises, while in the central and western sections of the  country where township enterprises were not so well developed,  the burden was borne by the individual households.    The discrepancies in rural incomes brings with it some  serious problems we cannot overlook.    First of all, it effects the amount of hope that the masses  hold for the reforms. The final success of the economic reforms  depends upon the support and cooperation of the broad masses of  the people. However, the amount of support the people will give  and the fervor with which they cooperate are determined by the  amount of hope they place in the reforms, that is, what are they  going to get out of the reforms. If the inequality of income  situation worsens exceedingly, there is the possibility that our  nation's broad masses of farmers will lose their faith in  economic reform.    Second, it intensifies the blind outflow of labor from  under-developed regions and the outflow of investment capital.  If the motive force for the movement of the factors of  production comes primarily from the difference in remuneration  for the factors of production in different localities, then, if  this difference is overly large, it can cause this movement to  become excessively severe and it could become a blind movement.  For the past several years, because of the difference in  development between the eastern and central and western sections  of the country, the differences in farmer incomes was  exaggerated, and created the "flood of workers" which exerted  tremendous pressure upon transportation and basic facilities of  some cities: this should not be overlooked. Another problem to  which attention should be paid is the flow of large amounts of  capital from the central and western areas to the eastern  coastal regions, creating a "vicious cycle of poverty" in the  central and western areas.    Third, it has restricted agricultural production, especially  grain output. Within the overall trend of enlarging differences  in income, the ones' whose income situation changes for the  worse are commonly the households engaged in agriculture and the  agricultural areas, especially the grain farmers and grain  producing regions. This situation harms agricultural investment  capabilities and the enthusiasm of those working agriculture.  The most alarming aspect is that there has been a tremendous  overall decrease so far this year in the amount of capital  inputs such as agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Because  of inadequate demand, the agricultural machinery industry is in  serious decline, and agriculture's production capacity will of  necessity suffer corresponding harm.    The following policies are formulated to solve the problem  of  the overly great differences in farmers' incomes.    1. Sped up the progress of market oriented reforms. At the  present time, the income disparities between farming households,  between regions and between urban and rural is mainly created by  the disparity in income between the agricultural and the  non-agricultural production sectors. Thus, we must utilize the  market mechanisms to reduce the differences, and thus we must  let the market play its role to the fullest extent, and raise  the earnings of those engaged in agriculture. Within the short  term, while the grain market is gradually opened up, the price  of grain can be allowed to rise to the level of the  international market. Over the long term, our nation should  avoid a long term situation in which our grain prices are higher  than international market levels. This is say, we should  maintain an appropriate level of grain imports, allow our  farmers to plant economic crops. This is the basic method of  solving the farmers' low income problem.    2. Continue to encourage the expansion of town and township  enterprises under all forms of ownership systems. We must  employ legislation to promote and protect the establishment and  growth of private enterprise, turn the income of the high income  levels into savings, to create employment opportunities for the  rural excess labor forces. The most pressing need is to  establish legislative protection for the property rights of  private enterprises.    3. The state and all levels of society must support the  growth of village and township enterprises in the central and  western regions. The state should truly focus on investments and  credit for the village and township enterprises in the central  and western regions and at the same time organize the various  governmental departments to cooperate with these regions within  the limits of their mission and establish village and township  enterprise development zones. 4. In macroscopic terms, we  must begin to implement a redistribution policy. That is, we  must speed up the reform of the tax collection system, create  better tax legislation, and begin collecting individual income  taxes in those areas where the conditions are right. The  principle of this sort of redistribution of income policy is to  increase equability on the condition of not harming efficiency  and to effect the common enrichment of the rural villages while  admitting the existence of differences.</p>

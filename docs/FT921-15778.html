			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / EC employers warn on social policy dangers EUROPEAN social policy threatens to become 'a two-headed monster', which could damage EC business, as a result of last month's Maastricht summit, European employers said yesterday. The UK agreed to the Maastricht treaty on European Union only after its 11 partners consented to keep existing social clauses and pursue their more ambitious aims in labour law through an unprecedented protocol, allowing them to legislate through the Community and exempting Britain. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary-general of Unice, the Europe-wide employers' organisation, said this was the worst of both worlds. First, the retained social chapter - which will still be the basis for laws applying to all 12 member states - should have been tightened. This would have prevented the European Commission from introducing laws like the controversial directive limiting the working week to 48 hours by using health and safety rules, which require only a qualified majority vote rather than unanimity. Second, the protocol on social policy was full of legal holes. It left unclear, for instance, whether measures passed by the 11 become part of the body of EC law (the acquis communautaire). If they do, as France and Germany insist, then the diluted form of majority voting envisaged for the protocol could mean six countries legislating not only for all the EC, except the UK, but also for the seven European Free Trade Association countries which will fall into line with EC law once the European Economic Area is set up in 1993. Mr Tyszkiewicz also pointed out contradictions between the protocol - which allows positive discrimination in favour of women, for example - and the treaty, which does not. The protocol excludes 'pay' from EC competence, but does not define exactly what it includes. This, he suggested, might lead to loopholes, such as that which led the European Court to rule that pensions for men and women had to be equalised retroactively - the so-called Barber case, the financial costs of which Maastricht also diluted through a protocol. Moreover, Mr Tyszkiewicz underlined, Unice and the European Trades Union Confederation, empowered by the protocol to negotiate agreements instead of the Commission bringing forward laws, were almost certain to negotiate as 12, not 11. Patrick Blum adds from Lisbon: Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said yesterday that Britain was 'not closing with a bang' the idea of a social dimension in the community. 'We believe there is a considerable range of measures which could and should be pressed ahead under the Portuguese and British presidencies,' he said in Lisbon, where he had talks with the current Portuguese presidency of the EC.</p>

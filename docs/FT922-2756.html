			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (6): Surplus? What surplus? The view is rather different from Beijing, writes Alexander Nicoll. According to Chinese statistics, China has a trade deficit, not a surplus, with the US. Last year, it was nearly Dollars 2bn. The large discrepancy occurs because of differing treatment of goods exported from China to Hong Kong. China views them simply as exports to Hong Kong, but the US views goods which are shipped on to the US as imports from China. However, China has apparently taken US strictures to heart and the focus of its trade policy is on reform of the import regime. Zhu Mincai, at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, says the reforms are necessary in order to speed China's entry into Gatt. Some tariffs - for example on cars and televisions - have been reduced this year and cuts on other items are planned. A list of 1,751 items which were effectively banned from import has been abolished, so that manufacturers may import them without finding domestically produced substitutes. The number of items for which import licenses are necessary is being reduced. Previously secret regulations are to be either published or cancelled. Related measures include a plan to move to a single floating exchange rate; and relaxation of the ban on foreign investment in retailing and financial services.</p>

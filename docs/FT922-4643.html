			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Bonn anxious that German doubts on Emu may grow THE Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty was greeted in Germany yesterday with horror and consternation at the consequences - both for the European Community as a whole, and for the German debate on Europe in particular. Government officials seeking to guide the German ratification process through parliament said uncertainty over the treaty could delay and complicate the German debate. They could see no legal way the Maastricht treaty, or parts of it, could be approved and enacted by just 11 member states of the EC. The treaty amounts to a substantial amendment to the Treaty of Rome, and that is bound by Article 236 of the treaty, requiring unanimous approval by all member states. 'Someone might get the idea that we could charge ahead with European economic and monetary union (Emu) alone,' said one official. 'I have been through the text again today, and there are so many references of all kinds to Treaty of Rome institutions - the Council of Ministers, the Court of Auditors and so on - that you cannot hope to divorce the two. 'The deeper you get into it, the more you realise what a quagmire we are in.' Another said: 'We are in big trouble. We have to work something out which will allow the Danes to go back to their parliament and if need be, to the Danish people.' Yet Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the German cabinet yesterday that renegotiation of the treaty was out of the question. Political leaders from all the major parties expressed shock and sorrow at the Danish vote, and urged that the ratification process should press ahead regardless in the other countries, in the hope of finding some way out of the impasse. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the Bundestag, said that it was time for 'small-minded haggling' over the details of the European integration process to stop, and concentrate on getting the basic guidelines in place. To that extent, the shock of the Danish vote could help concentrate minds in Germany, where the ratification debate has turned into a struggle for future power between the central government and the 16 German lander (states). The two sides are still locked in negotiations about constitutional amendments to give the states an effective veto on future transfers of sovereignty to Brussels. The underlying fear in the political establishment is that the confusion will stoke growing German doubts about the wisdom of pressing ahead with Emu and allowing the Deutsche Mark to be subsumed into a single European currency. Although those popular fears are scarcely represented in Bonn, they have been a factor in the drift from mainstream political parties to right and left in recent local elections. 'One factor in the Danish vote was a general disappointment with the politicians,' a senior official said. 'It was the people who rejected the politicians. This is typical of other countries in the Community - including Germany.' The official line is clear. 'Now it's up to us,' said Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, summing up a joint statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand. The two leaders expressed their determination 'to realise European union consistently and without wavering,' calling on other member states to ensure ratification by the end of the year. However the German government's draft law on ratification has still not been presented to the cabinet, because of the negotiations with the 16 states. Mr Vogel said yesterday that differences remain. At the heart of the debate is the extent to which the government will give away effective control over future foreign policy to the states. The 16 states have the power to block ratification of the treaty if they do not get their way. The German constitution must be amended, and that means winning a two-thirds majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat, where the states are represented. Hence the need to do a deal. 'The Danish vote certainly changes things,' says one political adviser. 'We are negotiating with the prime ministers about some very fundamental changes in the structure of the state. Some people may argue now that if Maastricht is in doubt, why should we go so far to change our constitution.'</p>

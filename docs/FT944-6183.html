			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Recovery of duty on business cars Businesses are to be able to recover VAT paid on the purchase of cars bought wholly for business purposes - primarily leasing - from August 1 1995. In these cases, businesses will have to charge VAT when they sell the car. Customs and Excise said it was proposed to introduce a provision that only 50 per cent of the VAT applying to car leasing charges can be recovered where there is any use of the car for private motoring.</p>

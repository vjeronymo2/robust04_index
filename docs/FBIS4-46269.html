			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MTH/YLS: "Security Stepped Up in Foreign </F> Embassies in Algiers"]    [Excerpt] Algiers, 3 Jun (BELGA) -- In light of the  increased frequency of attacks by armed Islamic fundamentalists,  foreign diplomats based in Algiers have "barricaded" themselves  in, fearing that they may be targets of hostile actions.    In this regard, the staff at the Belgian Embassy has been  reduced to a minimum. Two gendarmes have acted as bodyguards  for the ambassador and have protected the premises for six  months now. An armored car is eagerly awaited and should arrive  in the next few weeks.    To reduce the risk of shots from the outside, the embassy  wall has been raised almost a meter and fenced off. All  entrances are being closely guarded.    In the visa section, people are kept under strict  surveillance by a guard until one of the two counters becomes  free. For several months, no more than five people have been  permitted in the room at any one time. The other applicants  have to wait outside and come in one by one to submit their  applications.    Suspicious movements have been observed in recent days  around  a number of embassies, and rumors are circulating that the  terrorists intend to attack foreign representatives. [passage  omitted]</p>

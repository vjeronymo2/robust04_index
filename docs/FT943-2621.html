			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / US blocks extradition A US federal judge blocked the extradition of an escaped Irish Nationalist and ordered his immediate release. James Joseph Smyth escaped from Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1983, during the biggest jailbreak in British history. US District Judge Barbara Caulfield rejected the extradition request after finding that Smyth would be punished on the basis of his political opinions if returned to Northern Ireland. Smyth, 40, was released without bail. Federal prosecutors representing the British government are expected to appeal against the decision.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Partnership with Intel is updated Intel and IBM have updated their long-standing technology partnership which established Intel microprocessors as the standard for personal computers, writes Louise Kehoe. Under the new agreement, IBM will expand its own production of Intel-designed 486 microprocessors, the 'brains' of most PCs. However, IBM has elected not to manufacture Pentium, Intel's latest microprocessor. The companies also extended a patent cross-licensing agreement that expired last year. Intel will pay an undisclosed 'non-material' sum to IBM 'to regain exclusive manufacturing rights for Pentium and subsequent microprocessors,' Intel said. IBM's decision not to make the Pentium chip raises questions about its commitment to the Intel microprocessor technology. IBM is about to launch a new generation of computers based on PowerPC microprocessors, co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer. 'There is no question that PowerPC will compete directly with Pentium,' acknowledged Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president. However, he stressed that IBM plans to continue to develop products based on Intel chips and said the timing of the announcement, coming shortly before the expected introduction of PowerPC computers, was coincidental. Intel is 'a vital IBM partner and supplier of technologies that fuel a significant part of IBM's business,' said Mr Cannavino. 'We have a very large and growing business in Intel-based computers.' Mr Cannavino said IBM would have had to invest 'hundreds of millions of dollars' in new production technology to produce the Pentium chip.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (5): More sell-offs expected next year - The stock exchange: on-screen trading has proved broadly reliable It seems to have been a good year for the Italian stock exchange, if not for the Italian stock market. The Comit index of leading Italian stocks stands at roughly the same level as at the beginning of the year. Equities began a tiring climb up to new highs in March, fuelled by optimism about the new government, only to come tumbling down during the summer and autumn because of uncertainty about the cohesion and resolve of the same administration. Mr Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Milan-based Italian stock exchange council, is philosophical about the fluctuation of the market: 'In the first six months of the year, the Italian market was the star of Europe  - it rose to unthinkable levels, due mainly to the activity of foreign operators. In the second half, they realised good gains and are waiting to come back when the conditions are right.' Mr Ventura's principal concern is to ensure that when that moment arrives, foreign and Italian investors are not deterred from trading on the Italian equity market because of technical or bureaucratic deficiencies, illiquidity or a lack of suitable products. In that respect, he is convinced that Milan has made progress this year. Milan moved to full on-screen trading in April, adding to its computerised system the few stocks still traded on the floor of the exchange by open outcry. The borsa was unlucky in that the switch coincided with one of the busiest periods in the exchange's history - at the height of optimism about the new government's prospects - and the 'little bang' was postponed for 24 hours as special measures were put in place to relieve pressure on the system. Since then, the system has proved broadly reliable, although there was a hiccup early last month when a technical hitch blacked out computer trading just after the country's justice minister had announced his resignation, interrupting a sharp fall in the value of equities. After an investigation, the exchange authorities declared themselves broadly satisfied that the cause was a technical fault and not sabotage, but small investors have called for a judicial inquiry. A five-day rolling settlement system, to replace the monthly account trading system, is also being phased in, but Mr Ventura says it could be 'a few months' yet before full cash settlement is introduced for all stocks. As far as liquidity is concerned, market operators and stock exchange authorities alike are optimistic about the impact which trading in new equity derivatives should have on the underlying equity market. The first futures contract on the revamped MIB 30 index of heavily traded stocks should begin trading next week and once the market is under way, the exchange is expecting to add an option on the index and, in the first half of next year, options on single shares. Liquidity has also improved as a result of the privatisation programme launched in 1992. In the past 12 months, the government has turned from private sales to public offers, injecting more shares into the market in the case of the banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano and IMI, which were already quoted, and listing shares in Ina, the insurer, for the first time. Under the new government, partly because of inexperience, the privatisation programme has slowed, and concern has been expressed about the appetite of the Italian public for further large sell-offs. Nevertheless, within the next 12 months, the state should sell more of its shares in Stet, the telecoms holding company which is one of Italy's biggest companies by market capitalisation, and bring to market Enel, the electricity company, and all or part of Eni, the chemicals and energy conglomerate. At the same time, the government has introduced new rules to protect minority shareholders and bring taxation on share investment into line with other forms of investment, such as bonds, which have traditionally occupied more space in the ordinary household savings portfolio. The stock exchange itself has responded to small investors' demands by introducing a regulated system for the trading of small quantities of shares, which fall below the threshold for on-screen trading. Privatisation has not been the only stimulus for the market. The overall amount of new capital raised during 1994 had already reached nearly L11,500bn in mid-September, much of that from opportunistic rights issues during the first half of the year. That compares with L16,192bn for the whole of 1993 and only L3,027bn and L4,854bn in 1992 and 1991 respectively. The difficulty for the Italian authorities is persuading some of Italy's small and medium-sized companies, the real motor of the Italian economy, to finance future growth with equity issues, rather than with bank debt. Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of Akros Finanziaria, an expanding Italian financial-services company, says many family-owned companies are reluctant to seek a listing on the stock exchange. 'The advantage of being quoted isn't absolutely evident for those companies which generate enough cash-flow to develop the business adequately,' he points out. As director of a company involved in the development of investment and pension funds, Mr Roveraro believes more entrepreneurs might be persuaded to take part in the market if the number of such funds increased, and it became obvious that there was an appetite for new equity. To help this process, the Berlusconi government is already preparing regulatory changes to encourage the launching of private pension funds. At the same time, the stock exchange, securities houses, banks, industrialists and chambers of commerce are making plans for the establishment of a second market, for small and medium-sized companies. Sceptics are worried that such a market would experience the same difficulties as equivalents in France and the UK, but advocates point to the success of Nasdaq in the US as a reason for pushing ahead with the plan. However, even the backers of the Italian second market agree that this will be a difficult task, requiring the co-ordination of investors, intermediaries, regulators and the companies themselves. 'The potential is there, but it could still be a very difficult market,' admits Mr Ventura.  --------------------------------------------------             DOMESTIC COMPANIES LISTED  -------------------------------------------------- US                                         7,607 Japan                                      2,155 UK                                         1,646 France                                       472 Germany                                      426 Italy                                        210  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Italian Stock Exchange Council  --------------------------------------------------</p>

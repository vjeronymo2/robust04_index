			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CHILD-CARE POLICY ADOPTED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday unanimously adopted a child-care policy with the  goal of ensuring "quality, affordable care for children of all ages."  </P> <P> To solve an "infant-care crisis" in Monterey Park, the policy suggests that the  city promote parental leave, flexible work hours and job sharing in the private  and public sectors. The city itself will "work to become a model employer"  regarding child care for its employees.  </P> <P> The policy was drafted by the city's Child Care Task Force, which the council  created last year.  </P> <P> The policy recommends that the city support state and federal legislation to  make child care more readily available, eliminate city regulations that may  adversely affect child-care facilities and encourage a "team effort" among  schools, city agencies and community groups to care for school-age children.  </P></p>

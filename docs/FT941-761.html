			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Imro to end Pounds 1m fines ceiling The Pounds 1m upper limit on fines imposed under informal disciplinary proceedings by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is to be abolished as part of its proposals to streamline discipline procedures. The move is set out in a consultation paper published by Imro yesterday. The limit was increased last October from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 1m and the new proposal brings the informal procedures into line with the formal process, where there is no ceiling on fines. The plans include merging the investigation and disciplinary committees into an enforcement committee to oversee investigations and agree settlements of disciplinary cases. Mr Dan Waters, Imro's enforcement director, said that the drive behind the proposals, which are due to come into effect on 1 August, had come from Imro's decision to introduce individual registration, and from a general need to make the disciplinary procedures more effective. He emphasised that the heaviest fines would be directed at cases where there had been a loss to investors or a systemic failure of compliance arrangements, but that smaller Imro members would not 'be fined out of existence'. Twice last year Imro imposed fines of more than Pounds 700,000, with the record of Pounds 750,000 being imposed on Invesco MIM, the fund management group.</p>

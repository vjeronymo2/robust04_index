			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: WAY U.S. COUNTS JOBLESS MAY BE OUTDATED  </P> <P> A top U.S. economic official, speaking privately at a recent luncheon, was  worried by an eerie silence. Amid evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing,  unemployment has remained steady for almost a year, said the official. "That  unemployment rate may take a leap upward one of these months and give us all a  shock."  </P> <P> Yet the latest figures released last Friday belied the official's fears.  Unemployment remained at 6.6 million, 5.3% of the labor force, while hiring  rose dramatically -- 372,000 new jobs created in February to bring total  employment to 118 million.  </P> <P> True, unemployment figures can be deceptive; economists call them lagging  indicators. "One of the last things companies do when the economy turns down is  get rid of employees," says economist Pierre Rinfret, of Rinfret Associates. In  1981 unemployment figures remained fairly low even as the economy slid into  recession. But then they leaped to 9.5% in 1982 and stayed at that high level  through 1983 despite economic recovery.  </P> <P> Today there may be impending unemployment in industries such as  aerospace-defense. But nothing is happening yet, says Patricia Straugh of Data  Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm. "Defense companies aren't laying  off because they're working on long-term contracts, and waiting for Congress to  decide which weapons programs to cut." Those congressional decisions could come  in a month or two, she explains. "But even after that, layoffs may not be  severe. The companies are trying to keep their employees together and look  around for other work."  </P> <P> So what's the story -- will there be a sharp rise in joblessness this year?  </P> <P> Probably not. The truth is, the national unemployment figure is out of date  because the economy has changed so much in the last decade or so -- for reasons  both positive and negative.  </P> <P> In the positive sense, "we don't have a national economy anymore," suggests  Daniel Mitchell, head of the Institute of Industrial Relations at UCLA.  </P> <P> Regional differences took over in the 1980s, when the Northeast prospered while  the Southwest and Midwest suffered. Today, to some extent, the wheel has  turned. The Northeast is slowing, and New Englanders are worried -- even though  the region's overall unemployment is only 5%.  </P> <P> In Texas, meanwhile, the unemployment rate has gone down to 6%, yet everybody  is positive because things are turning up after a devastating decade. And the  Midwest, an area that was battered by competition from imports for much of the  1980s, is now doing a lot better taking advantage of export markets for  machinery and for grain.  </P> <P> But the Midwest is not doing well because big companies are firing their  furnaces. "It's no longer an economy of big companies, big unions and  government wage guidelines," says UCLA's Mitchell.  </P> <P> Instead the pattern is one of diverse, smaller firms -- even smaller towns.  David Birch, the industrial consultant who noted almost a decade ago that big  companies were eliminating jobs and smaller firms creating them, is now looking  at "boom neighborhoods" -- local areas of intense economic activity, whether in  the heart of major cities such as Los Angeles and New York or in their suburbs.  In Melville, on New York's Long Island, for example, a company of four  full-time employees named Qosina makes medical and cosmetic packages for  customers in England, Germany and the Netherlands.  </P> <P> But regional differences explain only one aspect of the new economy, says Kevin  Murphy, of the University of Chicago School of Business. Education has become  the big divider, with educated people enjoying abundant opportunities and high  school dropouts falling out of the active labor force altogether.  </P> <P> The unemployment and employment figures count only those in the active work  force -- those who are working or looking for work. Where 66.8% of adult  Americans are in that work force, participation by the less educated poor is  often below 50%.  </P> <P> The upshot is the unemployment figures don't tell the full story. Some  unemployed people keep looking but have little prospect of finding jobs in  today's economy because they lack the skills. Others have given up looking.  </P> <P> "So the unemployment figure remains steady because many of those who are  counted cannot work, and many others are no longer counted," says Murphy.  </P> <P> The point, of course, is that to see what's really happening one must look  beyond the figures. In that respect, the short-term outlook is a tossup. Yes,  unemployment could rise if profits decline. Yet on the other hand, new job  figures could continue to look dramatic -- swelled by auto workers returning  from layoff and the government hiring 400,000 temporaries to take the national  census in April.  </P> <P> But long term, over the decade of the '90s, there's no doubt: The U.S. will  have a labor-short economy, with fewer than 20 million new workers entering the  labor force, compared to almost 26 million in the last 10 years. That will mean  opportunity and high pay for skilled people, as is already evident in  $28,000-a-year starting pay for accountants and $35,500 beginning salary for  nurses in big-city hospitals.  </P> <P> Lest we forget, however, there is also a challenge -- to bring the 6.6 million  and more unemployed into full participation in the U.S. economy through  education and job-training. A labor-short nation cannot afford to do less, on  strict economic grounds -- not to mention those of social justice.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOLEHILL CLUB?  </P> <P> The Sierra Club without rock climbing or mountaineering? As well the Audubon  Society without birds, or the Wilderness Society without trees. Climbing has  been the heart and soul of the San Francisco-based organization founded by  naturalist-mountaineer John Muir and others in 1892. Generations of  Californians learned to love the Sierra Nevada through the club's wilderness  trips. Muir's concept was to get people into the mountains so that they could  really come to know them. By knowing the mountains, club members would fight to  save the wilderness.  </P> <P> Thousands have learned to climb rock, ice and snow safely through club  programs. But now the club's directors have voted to ban club-sanctioned  climbing because of soaring insurance rates. As reported by The Times' Bettina  Boxall, the Los Angeles-area chapter has dismantled part of its mountaineering  course and dropped about 300 trips from its outing program. Protesting members  are threatening to run a pro-climbing slate of candidates for the board.  </P> <P> But supporters of the ban argue that the club no longer can afford the luxury  of an insurance rate increase of at least $325,000 a year in behalf of a  minority of members, out of a national roster of nearly 500,000, who want to  engage in roped climbing. Ironically, those who supported the ban include  former executive director David Brower, a pioneer of rock climbing in Yosemite  and the Sierra. Brower said that members can go climb on their own while the  club works to save "the damn mountains they want to climb." There still will be  wilderness trips, but none onto the heights where ropes or ice axes are  required, and no instruction courses for beginners.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club no longer is just a California society, of course. It has  broadened its environmental horizon to national and global issues, particularly  since Brower's tenure as executive director, and has developed lobbying clout  in Washington and state capitals. The climbing decision is regrettable, but  understandable.  </P> <P> Club members were at the center of the development of high-angle, roped rock  climbing in the West in 1931 when Harvard's Robert L. M. Underhill brought his  Alpine training to the Sierra at the invitation of Francis Farquhar. The  summer's highlight was the Aug. 16 first ascent of the east face of 14,495-foot  Mt. Whitney by Underhill, Norman Clyde, Jules Eichorn and Glen Dawson. Not  difficult by today's standards, the east face remains a classic route. The  club's Rock Climbing Section was soon formed, and the club later published  "Belaying the Leader," the primer and bible for a generation of California  climbers who ultimately took their Sierra-learned skills to the summits of the  Alps, the Cordilleras of South America, to Canada, Alaska and the Himalayas.  </P> <P> The ban will not eliminate the club's presence in the Sierra heights, however.  Every major Sierra peak has a metal box stamped with the Sierra Club seal and  containing a summit register to be signed by all who make the top. But on the  most difficult, and best, peaks in the Sierra that no longer will include  official Sierra Club groups.  </P></p>

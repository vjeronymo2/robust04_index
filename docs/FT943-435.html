			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Logic in targeting logistics Sir, We couldn't agree more with Charles Batchelor's assessment (Survey of Logistics, September 21) that corporations must apply the same cost-control efforts to their logistics operations as they do to their other business functions, if they wish to remain competitive in the 1990s. Just one glitch in the distribution, inventory or customer delivery networks can mean the loss of millions of dollar in profits and, perhaps just as important, of customer confidence. At my company, where costs associated with getting our products to customers have increased in recent years relative to other costs, we've undertaken what we call a 'Pathfinder' project to find more direct pathways to customers and simplify logistics. We've set a target of reducing costs by up to Dollars 80m by 1996. We will do this by applying to our logistics operations the same work process analyses that helped us overhaul our maintenance operations during the last four years, with expected savings of about Dollars 60m a year. Early results from the Pathfinder have been equally encouraging. By the end of the summer we had identified 26 projects to improve our operations, and have already realised annualised savings of nearly Dollars 5m. Through this effort we expect to improve loading, scheduling and inventory control and provide better customer service.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although District 2 producers and handlers usually face competition from non-regulated areas during much of their shipping season, it is important that handling requirements apply to shipments from that district to protect the good quality image enjoyed by South Texas onions in the marketplace and promoted by the committee's market development program. In the absence of quality and inspection requirements, low quality onions from District 2 could be shipped. Such shipments could negatively effect the South Texas industry's market development efforts and quality image. Also, in the interest of equity and uniform regulation application, it is desirable that handlers from District 2 pay assessments in support of these activities. Assessments paid have helped to provide an on-going production research program that has benefitted the entire industry with the development of new onion varieties and new cultural techniques, as well as an effective market development program that helps increase sales. Therefore, these comments are denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three remaining comments were from the South Texas Onion committee, Mr. John R. Bearden, and Mr. B. L. Lackey. These comments stated that if the rule is not adopted by April 1, the anticipated beginning of the red onion harvesting and shipping season, poor quality red onions will be dumped on the market, thereby diminishing consumer confidence and depressing the market for South Texas onions. After evaluating the comments, the Department has decided to implement the committee's recommendation as proposed, and make the final rule effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality or maturity requirements are in effect for onions under a domestic marketing order, imported onions must meet the same or comparable requirements, subject to concurrence by the United States Trade Representative. Because this rule establishes grade, size, quality and maturity requirements on red onions and changes the regulatory period under the South Texas onion marketing order, corresponding changes are needed in the onion import regulation. Such changes have been addressed in a separate onion import rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0074.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the proposal submitted by the committee, comments received, and other information, it is hereby found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this section until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because (1) the shipping season for onions has already begun and for maximum effectiveness this rule should apply to as many shipments as possible; (2) the proposed rule was discussed at an open public meeting, and all interested persons had an opportunity to voice concerns; and (3) there are no special preparations required of the handler that cannot be completed by the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 959  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Onions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 959 is hereby amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

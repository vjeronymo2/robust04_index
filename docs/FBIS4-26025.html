			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The round-table  meeting on peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia ended  Thursday [16 June] with the royal government and the Democratic  Kampuchea Party (DKP) failing to reach agreement on a cease-fire  and a minimum political principle.    After the meeting, a spokesman for the royal government  admitted that nothing came out of the meeting but added that it  was "not a failure."    The spokesman said that during the meeting, the royal  government side offered a deadline of noon on June 30 for a  cease-fire to be imposed, while the DKP wished to discuss the  details of establishing a monitoring committee.    The DKP criticized the government side for refusing to  discuss in depth the problem of monitoring a cease-fire and  refusing to discuss the minimum political principle on peace and  national reconciliation.    The round table meeting opened on Wednesday and although  neither side has decided whether to hold another, the  possibility of further talks depends on King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>

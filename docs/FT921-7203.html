			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Tories keep tax options open: Opposition attacks stepped up on rumoured 'give-away' budget THE GOVERNMENT refused yesterday to rule out an increase in borrowing to finance pre-election tax cuts as opposition parties stepped up their claims that the Conservatives are planning an 'irresponsible' give-away Budget. Under close questioning in the BBC's On the Record programme, Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insisted that the government intended to keep firm control on public expenditure. But when asked if the government would raise the public sector borrowing requirement above the levels needed to compensate for the recession, Mr Mellor evaded giving a direct reply. Emphasising that the government remained determined to balance the Budget over the economic cycle, he said: 'You have to take a judgment as to what is in the best interests of the country.' His cautious reply was clearly intended to calm fears on the Tory right of an imprudent Budget while leaving the door open for tax cuts. It came after Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, gave the clearest indication yet of an April 9 poll. He told TV-am: 'We have now reached the stage where you begin to clear the decks and the government comes out firing its guns and starts campaigning.' With the Tories on the defensive over their tax and borrowing plans, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, drew attention to a newspaper report claiming Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had been told by the Treasury that the PSBR could reach Pounds 30bn. 'I now have no doubt that the government is embarking on an all or nothing gamble - nothing to help the economy - and all they care about is the general election,' he said. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat economics spokesman, also took up the charge, accusing the government of 'gross economic irresponsibility'. Tory officials dismissed the Pounds 30bn PSBR claim. In a separate development, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, wrote to Mr John Major protesting that the prime minister had misled the Commons by saying British growth had exceeded that of Germany between 1981 and 1991, when, in fact, it had not. As speculation grew about the scale of the expected tax cuts, it also appeared that the Tories had maximised their room for manoeuvre. One party official suggested that the Treasury might be intentionally talking up the PSBR figure to allow Mr Lamont to cut taxes but also appear prudent on Budget day. 'The Budget has to be seen as responsible and relevant to economic needs,' the official said. Similar comments have led some observers to speculate that the Budget will also include some measures to relieve recession-hit industry. A time-limited rise in tax breaks for investment might also be backed by concessions for small businesses including VAT relief and reductions in the uniform business rate. Labour campaign organisers, meanwhile, are convinced that the Tories' Budget dilemma has handed them an issue that could be election-winning. Appearing on the same programme as Mr Mellor, Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary, said: 'What we have always said is that borrowing for investment is okay. Borrowing to spend for today for consumption is totally wrong.' She highlighted as inadequate Mr Mellor's replies ruling out a value added tax rise. While he had denied any plans for a rise in the short term, she claimed he had failed to take the opportunity to rule out any extension of the coverage of the tax. In fact, Mr Mellor had said that while there was 'no need, no plans and no requirement to widen VAT' a sensible chancellor was always aware that 'circumstances can alter down the years'. The report, in the Independent on Sunday, that the Treasury has warned Mr Lamont of a Pounds 30bn budget deficit in the next financial year - even without a tax-cutting Budget - was treated cautiously by some City economists. Economic growth of less than 1 per cent this year would cause the PSBR to rise substantially in fiscal 1992-93. But City forecasts which allow for some tax cuts in the Budget are averaging less than Pounds 25bn. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Montagu, said the Pounds 30bn figure was 'way over the top'. He said: 'To go from Pounds 12bn to Pounds 30bn in one year would be fairly amazing.' Last week saw a steady escalation in estimates of the possible size of next year's PSBR and the amount of tax cuts in the Budget.

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Wrestling with a knotty problem: Dominic Lawson confesses to an increasing affliction - clothing cowardice This week I received a visit from a man from the Iranian embassy, or rather, as his card specified, The Islamic Republic of Iran. He was not wearing a tie. They do not, in the Islamic Republic. I believe it is something to do with the tie being a Christian symbol, crosses and all that, which keeps the Iran of the ayatollahs an open-necked zone. Open-necked is not quite accurate. The man from Tehran had his white shirt buttoned (on a very hot day) to the top. Now, I do not want to argue that I would have been friendlier to my visitor if he had been wearing a tie: we opinion formers are never so superficial, even after a good lunch on a hot day in the City. But the emissary's strict adherence to the dress code of a regime we tend to regard as a fanatical alien theocracy was not designed to put me at my ease. Clearly the man could not have been a spy. But what must he have thought of me? Here, in an office lacking air-conditioning with the windows bolted shut against the noise of passing traffic, sat the Englishman in a suit and tie, drinking hot tea with milk. Which of the two men could be said to have the odder customs, at least as far as dress is concerned? The encounter set me thinking. Why should I not come to work in the summer dressed in the open-necked style which pleases me, rather than some unfathomable code of etiquette. This tie business is a particular problem. I like my existing range of shirts, but in the past, while the sleeves have kept their length nicely, the collars have mysteriously shrunk in the wash. Every weekday morning there is an awesome, asphyxiating struggle to lock the tie into place. The blood supply to the brain is impaired, and the ideas which I woke up with, dwindle in direct proportion to the diminished supply of oxygen. There is no excuse for this. It is not as if there was some senior figure in the office who could tell me that I was not properly dressed without a jacket and tie. Nor would I have any trouble getting into restaurants. With the exception of the Savoy Group and the Ritz, I can think of few places of executive entertainment where the traditional dress code is rigidly enforced. And even there the staff will gladly lend the casual diner a temporary jacket and tie. I suppose it all boils down to that awful disease of the middle-aged: the desire to be taken seriously. I am frightened to be mistaken for an advertising copywriter or a member of the bohemian intelligentsia - my office is dangerously close to The Guardian's. At weekends too, I am increasingly afflicted by this clothing cowardice. When I am in Gloucestershire, solid farming country, I do not want the passing men of the soil to realise, before I open my mouth, that I am an interloper, a man from the 'smoke', as they call London. So I must wear a Barbour jacket, old corduroy trousers, and uncleaned green wellingtons. I am still, of course, betrayed by the speed with which I drive my car around their narrow lanes, but there are sacrifices my temperament is not prepared to make, even for social acceptability in the shires. There are certain people, back in the City, who think they have found the answer, who have developed an item of dress which is meant to proclaim: 'Yes, I have a good and responsible job, but I am more witty and imaginative than the rest of you bores.' This item is called the bow tie. But, while I have one or two friends who perpetrate this sartorial statement, I think we can all agree that, on the whole, bow-tie wearers are wrong 'uns: the circumstantial evidence is compelling. Indeed, had the man from the Iranian embassy come into my office wearing a bow tie, I would have been even more undiplomatic over the matter of Salman Rushdie. You will have noticed that I have touched only on the matter of male dress codes. And unavoidably so. While it is true that the public dress of women in the Islamic Republic of Iran is not strong on variety, over here only a book could scratch the surface of so deep and mysterious a social issue.

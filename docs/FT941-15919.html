			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Disease hits Geest Disease in Costa Rica and market oversupply forced banana group Geest to issue a profits warning. The shares plummeted on the news, closing 87 down at 276p. Analysts, concerned at not being warned of the potential damage to profits of the disease at a round of meetings with the group in December, rushed to chop profits forecasts. Strauss Turnbull, which was expecting profits of Pounds 12m, has reduced its forecast to a Pounds 4m loss. However, some food specialists said the low share price could encourage a bid, possibly from one of Geest's US admirers. The profits warning also hit Fyffes, although the stock recovered to close 5 off at 100p. Television group LWT Holdings receded 23 to 673p as it continued to throw up barriers to the recent bid by Granada. It predicted a rise of more than 40 per cent in its 1993 profits and expected to pay a final dividend of 14p a share. However, one leading securities house is today advising clients to accept the offer, arguing that Granada will not raise it and there are significant benefits for LWT shareholders. Granada declined 8 to 572p. Other perceived television takeover targets Yorkshire Tyne Tees TV and Anglia moved forward 7 to 188p and 5 to 479p respectively. Bank shares, among the market's best performers last year as institutions focused on the benefits that would accrue from falling interest rates and their impact on the economy, tumbled yesterday in the wake of bearish notes from two stockbroking houses. Hoare Govett was said to have wrought the biggest damage, telling its clients that the sector was 'fully valued on all measures', and weightings should be 'selectively reduced'. Robert Fleming Securities was also said to have been advising a bearish stance. Hoare told clients to use strength in the run-up to February's full year figures to reduce weightings in HSBC, National Westminster and the Scottish banks, but remained bullish on long term dividend prospects at TSB and Barclays. Lloyds dropped 17 to 620p, Barclays 12 to 597p, NatWest 13 to 597p and HSBC 10 to 916p. Standard Chartered fell 30 to 1179p. There was heavy trading in TSB, scheduled to announce preliminary figures tomorrow, and the shares slipped 9 to 250p on turnover of 9.4m. Eurotunnel fell sharply after surprising the market with a pricing structure in line with rival ferry operators, against expectations that the Channel tunnel operator would announce a more competitive pricing structure. The shares tumbled 17 to 608p, though the poor market trend was said to have played a part in the slide. Eurotunnel's pricing structure cheered investors in ferry operator P&amp;O. The stock was up 12 at best before relinquishing the rise in the poor market trend to end a net 3 lighter at 630p. Volume was 2.7m. BAT Industries weakened 17 to 538p after US house Morgan Stanley joined a downbeat mood surrounding the tobacco to insurance group, downgrading the stock and lowering its 1993 forecast to Pounds 1.84bn from Pounds 1.88bn. Reuters Holdings closed 9 higher at 1872p, with NatWest Securities marking out the company as its favoured stock in the sector. The rise built on sharp gains last week following talk that Reed International was lining up a bid for the group. Reed fell 17 to 882p. Mining group RTZ appreciated 6 to 853p as chart analysts at agency broker James Capel predicted that the shares could reach 900p soon. Leading pharmaceutical stocks benefited from US buying on Monday night. Gains were eroded in late trading, leaving Glaxo just 2 up at 682p, Wellcome 8 ahead at 696p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' a penny harder at 407p. British Gas declined 4 1/2 to 347 1/2 p as the market fretted about the company's dividend potential. Adding to the stock's discomfiture was a cautious note from Hoare Govett, the company's stockbroker. Courtaulds Textiles climbed 8 to 517p after the group announced that it had agreed to buy a French weaver and lace manufacturer. Magellan Industries plummeted 44 to 168p after the swimwear and lingerie group reported that production problems had hit 1993 sales. Merchant banks attracted flurries of strong support, with most stocks advancing to all-time highs as turnover in the stock market and from new issues continued at record levels. Hambros forged ahead 15 to equal the stock's peak of 403p, while Kleinwort Benson, which topped the 1993 mergers and acquisitions league table, moved up 11 to 607p and threatened its pre-October 1987 high of 615p. Singer &amp; Friedlander was 3 1/2 firmer at 92p. Good results from Stakis saw the shares advance 4 to 75p. NatWest Securities has pencilled in a forecast of Pounds 18m for 1994. The same broker advised caution ahead of Rank Organisation's results, expected tomorrow. The shares surrendered 20 to 993p. Storehouse jumped on the news of a 13 per cent increase in trade in the six weeks up to Christmas, against analysts' expectations of around 7 per cent. However, the shares fell back to finish 3 down on balance at 239p as analysts digested the detail of the statement and worries were expressed about slightly weaker margins. Laura Ashley's announcement on trading was better received and the shares put on 7 at 85p. Hillsdown Holdings was lifted by its trading statement, the shares gaining 7 at 178p. Chemical distribution group Ellis &amp; Everard improved 4 to 245p as Hoare Govett published a buy recommendation and upgraded its 1994 and 1995 forecasts.</p>

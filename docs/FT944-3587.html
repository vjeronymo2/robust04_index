			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Bosnia dominates Islamic conference The crisis in Bosnia is expected to dominate the summit meeting of the Islamic Conference Organisation which opens in Casablanca today, but disputes over Middle East issues are already threatening to sour the atmosphere. Bosnian representatives were confident yesterday that the 52-member organisation would adopt a strongly worded resolution, including a call for the dispatch of military aid. Mr Nerkuz Arifhodzic, the Bosinian ambassador to the Maghreb states, said the draft resolution also outlined a plan of diplomatic, political and economic action. 'I have no doubt that it will meet with a very good response at the summit and help define a concrete and effective programme of action,' he said. The ambassador added that there was a determination among the member states to help Bosnia 'in its legitimate self-defence and to give it the right to resist'. Members of the ICO have been urging the west to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, although few have advocated breaking it unilaterally. Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said yesterday that it was immoral to prevent the Bosnians being given the right to defend themselves. He added that the conference would repeat its previous offer to send peacekeeping troops to the area. However, rows between Iraq and Kuwait, and between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation over their roles in the future of Jerusalem, have proved difficult to resolve in the preparatory ministerial meeting. Kuwait is pressing for a strongly worded resolution confirming that sanctions against Iraq should not be lifted, while the Baghdad government was demanding a reference to the suffering of its people as a result of the sanctions. Jordan is meanwhile asking the conference to affirm its historic role in administering the Islamic sites in Jerusalem until such time as the Palestinians 'are able to assume their sovereignty over the city'. Representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation have countered that such a declaration would jeopardise their claim to the eastern half of Jerusalem.</p>

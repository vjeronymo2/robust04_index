			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on selling by investment trusts ARBITRAGE-RELATED activity dominated trading yesterday, and share prices posted marginal losses after fluctuating in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 63.23 at 21,936.37, failing to remain above the 22,000 level which it had recovered in the morning session. After hitting the day's low of 21,844.67, the index regained strength from a rise in the futures market. The 225-issue average advanced to the day's high of 22,135.58 in early afternoon trading, but later fell on selling by investment trusts. Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 180m. Advances led declines by 484 to 451, with 179 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 2.81 to 1,626.05 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.13 to 1,249.18. Despite the lack of investor activity, traders said that sentiment had not soured. Fears that the Nikkei would plunge below 20,000, previously dominant among market participants, have subsided. 'We've cleared the danger level and there is a feeling of stability,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Buying orders around the 21,900 level from foreign investors and life assurers also supported the optimism. Light foreign buying in companies with firm earnings was also noted. QP, the leading mayonnaise maker, rose Y70 to Y1,330 on prospects of higher earnings due to a fall in egg prices. Other food stocks were also firm with Kikkoman, the soy sauce maker, up Y30 to Y1,060 and Ajinomoto Y10 better at Y1,380. Daiichi Pharmaceutical rose Y90 to Y1,690 on reports that a drug developed by the company was found to be effective against leprosy. Nissan Fire and Marine Insurance fell Y100 to Y1,980. Rumours that a leading speculator who held Nissan shares was in financial trouble spurred the selling. Investors looking for quick profits sought highly-priced, small-capital stocks with low liquidity. Nippon Television Network rose Y300 to Y20,400 and Sega Enterprises added Y300 to Y14,000. Coca-Cola bottling companies firmed on prospects of higher earnings due to a planned increase in beverage prices. Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling rose Y60 to Y2,630 and Chukyo Coca-Cola Bottling gained Y30 to Y1,700. Paper issues lost ground on earnings concerns. Jujo Paper fell Y35 to Y600 on reports that an affiliated paper company would post sharp falls in profits for the current year to March. Oji Paper declined Y15 to Y850 and Kanzaki Paper lost Y12 to Y650. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 33.12 to 23,589.47. Volume surged to 124.9m shares from 84.5m on cross trading before the March book closing. After the close, the Osaka Stock Exchange announced measures to dilute the impact of Nikkei-225 stock futures and options trading on stock prices in an attempt to support the stock market, agencies report. An exchange official said that the move reflects the exchange's concern about the continued thinness of the stock market, in which volatility caused by futures- and options-linked trading has scared off investors. Effective today, the exchange will close futures and options trading 10 minutes earlier at 0600 GMT, the same time as stock trading. The decision is in response to criticism that speculative futures trading after the stock market closes often affects prices on the following day. Other measures: Trading details of the 20 most active exchange members in both instruments will be disclosed on a daily basis, and the open interest held by the top 15 members disclosed on a weekly basis. Options exercises will be limited to once a month on expiration day, instead of the current once a week on Thursdays, starting with the June contract. The exercise price for options on expiration day will be the special quotation price, calculated from the opening price of all 225 issues in the Nikkei average on the following day, starting with the June contract. Roundup AUSTRALIA continued to be nervous ahead of the economic statement due on February 26. Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Taiwan remained closed.

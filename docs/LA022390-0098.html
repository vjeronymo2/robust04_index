			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN PACT COULD DOUBLE CLOTHES EXPORTS;  </P> <P> TRADE: A NEW AGREEMENT, OPPOSED BY MANY U.S. MANUFACTURERS, ELIMINATES OR  INCREASES MOST QUOTAS. EXPERTS SAY FEW U.S. JOBS ARE AT RISK.  </P> <P> Mexican clothing and cloth exports to the United States could double to $1.3  billion over the next two years under a new pact that a U.S. trade official  called "the most liberal agreement we've ever negotiated in textiles."  </P> <P> The U.S.-Mexican agreement eliminates quotas on more than half of Mexican-made  textiles and increases most remaining quotas by one-fourth. Mexico also will be  allowed to request increases in its export limits as needed.  </P> <P> In disclosing details of the agreement Thursday, Mexico's chief foreign trade  negotiator, Miguel Angel Toro, said that, if Mexico can take full advantage of  the new two-year agreement, exports to the United States could double from the  1989 level of $646 million.  </P> <P> Although many U.S. textile producers and apparel manufacturers have opposed the  trade pact, which was signed last week, a number of experts said there would be  few, if any, jobs lost at American companies because of the agreement.  </P> <P> Bernard Z. Brown, president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries in  California, said apparel makers are reluctant to do business in Mexico because  of product quality and transportation problems in the past. Nor does he expect  attitudes to change quickly.  </P> <P> "No one I know is trying to get more production out of Mexico," Brown said.  </P> <P> Experts also noted that Mexico is not one of the top textile and apparel  exporters to the United States, shipping far less than China, South Korea,  Taiwan and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> William Kay Daines, general counsel to the National Retail Federation, said  that any domestic business lost by textile companies would be offset by  increased shipments to Mexican apparel makers.  </P> <P> Daines, who said he helped U.S. trade officials craft the agreement with  Mexico, also maintained that the extra apparel exports from Mexico would tend  to be inexpensive merchandise that generally would replace imports from other  nations rather than domestic goods.  </P> <P> Moreover, Daines said, the agreement should bring consumers lower prices on  apparel. He explained that it is much cheaper to ship merchandise by land from  Mexico than by air or sea from Asia.  </P> <P> Still, some observers regarded the agreement as a bad omen for two domestic  industries that already have been battered by increasing imports.  </P> <P> Lawrence Mishel, research director for the labor-backed Economic Policy  Institute, said the agreement was a "short-sighted" measure that will eliminate  jobs for immigrants, minorities and others who have struggled to break into the  U.S. labor market.  </P> <P> "We need our own industry in order to provide employment to Third World people  here. Government should stop giving away the industry," Mishel said.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Edward P. Schrum, president of the American Textile  Manufacturers Institute, called the agreement "one of the biggest concessions  made by the U.S. government in the entire history of the U.S. textile/apparel  import program."  </P> <P> "In only four years' time, between 1985 and 1989, textile and apparel imports  from Mexico have more than doubled . . . This apparently is not enough for  Mexican exports; they want more. The new agreement assures that they will get  it," Schrum added.  </P> <P> According to the textile manufacturers group, the share of the U.S. apparel  market garnered by imports rose from 28% in 1980 to 60% last year, when imports  hit a record high of $26.5 billion. Over that period, apparel industry  employment dropped from 1.26 million to 1.09 million, and further declines are  expected in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Despite the nationwide job declines, apparel and textile employment climbed in  Los Angeles during much of the 1980s, and it currently is the county's  second-largest manufacturing employer.  </P> <P> The United States regulates imports of clothing and other textiles by assigning  quotas to more than 40 countries. Mexico, which ranks sixth among the countries  exporting textiles to the U.S. market, has protested that the quotas are  protectionist, particularly given the increased access U.S. garment makers have  to the Mexican market.  </P> <P> "They made a good case," said U.S. chief textile negotiator Ron Sorini. He  called the arrangement "the most liberal agreement we've ever negotiated in  textiles."  </P> <P> "It is a recognition that we are exporting significant amounts of textiles to  Mexico," he said in a telephone interview from his Washington, D.C., office.  </P> <P> The changes are expected to be especially helpful to apparel-manufacturing  maquiladoras, plants in Mexico that make garments from U.S.-made cloth.  Maquiladoras account for 85% of Mexico's textile exports, according to Alfonso  Bustamante, president of the Mexican Maquiladora Assn.  </P> <P> More than one-third of the 278 garment-making maquiladoras are concentrated in  Tijuana, he said, with the rest scattered among cities on the border and in the  interior of Mexico.  </P> <P> Just as important as the 86% increase in garment quotas, he said, is the  greater flexibility that will allow garment makers to respond to changes in  fashion and demand.  </P> <P> That will help prevent situations such as that which occurred last year when  Mexico used less than three-fourths of its overall quota. Quotas for some  products were filled early because of high demand, while others were not filled  because products did not sell well.  </P> <P> Non-garment textile categories, which account for a smaller portion of overall  exports, will be allowed a greater percentage increase. Cloth exports, for  example, would be allowed to rise 150% and exports of miscellaneous textiles  could triple, Toro said.  </P> <P> However, Rodolfo Garcia Muriel, president of the Northern Textile Chamber,  whose members produce almost one-third of Mexico's cotton cloth, said Mexican  manufacturers will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity unless they  have funds available to invest in modernizing their plants.  </P> <P> Juanita Darling reported from Mexico City and Stuart Silverstein reported from  Los Angeles.  </P></p>

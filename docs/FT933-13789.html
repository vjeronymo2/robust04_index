			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Bonn denies European bank site picked: Monetary Institute is main prize in the elaborate division of Euro-spoils THE German government yesterday firmly denied a report that European Community leaders have reached a secret agreement to base the new European Monetary Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in Frankfurt. 'This report is too good to be true,' said a German government spokesman. 'There has been no such agreement yet. We do not yet have the agreement of all our partners.' German officials made it clear they believe that Britain remains the only EC member state opposed to Frankfurt, but they also recognise the political difficulty for Mr John Major, the British prime minister, should the bank be sited there. There was considerable embarrassment in Bonn yesterday over the report, confidently published by Handelsblatt, Germany's business newspaper, that Frankfurt had won the battle for the EMI. They fear that, by reviving the question just as the British parliamentary debate on Maastricht is coming to its climax, British capitulation will be less likely. The decision of EC heads of government on the location of the Monetary Institute, which is supposed to be in operation by next January 1, merely requires a country to be chosen. It will then be up to the government of that country to choose the precise site - taking into account the views of all member states. Britain has strongly resisted Germany's equally firm determination to promote Frankfurt, on the grounds that it could undermine the city of London's position as Europe's main financial centre. The Bonn government believes that only by siting the bank in Frankfurt, home of the German Bundesbank, will sceptics - especially Germans  - be reassured that the new institution will be as independent and stability-conscious as the German central bank. In any case, it is clear that negotiations have reached an end-game. The negotiations are part of an elaborate division of the Euro-spoils which involves more than a dozen new agencies and institutions. Each brings the promise of jobs, prestige and a hole in taxpayers' wallets. The European central bank is the most valuable prize. Other agencies include Europol, a mini-European FBI which would replace Interpol, a European environmental office, a European trade-mark office, a European drugs agency and a European plant and vegetable office. After the recent upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism, and amid popular doubts in Germany about giving up the D-Mark, the Bonn government's claims have grown stronger. Uncertainty over Maastricht ratification has damaged market confidence in European monetary union. The Belgian presidency of the EC is therefore pressing for a deal on the EMI, possibly at a special summit in the autumn. This would allow stage two of EMU to start on schedule on January 1 1994. Another factor appears to be the race to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Under an earlier deal, France won the EBRD presidency and the UK won agreement to put the bank in London. The question now is whether Mr Attali's high-rolling habits have made it impossible for a Frenchman to keep the post. Mr Henning Christopherson, EC commissioner for economics and a strong candidate for the EBRD job, has let it be known there should be 'no more Sun Kings'. If the Danish-born Mr Christopherson wins the EBRD job, what will become of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and a rumoured front-runner for the post? The French are not saying; but some believe the de Larosiere candidacy is actually an elaborate bluff to increase leverage in negotiations on who should be the president of the EMI.</p>

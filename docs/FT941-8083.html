			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Equities react to unexpected A series of largely unexpected political and economic developments in Japan, Europe and the US provided the impetus for equity markets last week. Most European markets managed modest advances over the week, although Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid were exceptions, but the FT-Actuaries World index dipped as sharp falls in south-east Asian markets took their toll. In Tokyo, a higher yen in the aftermath of the breakdown in trade talks with the US left equities sinking. Kleinwort Benson, which sees very little possibility of a trade war, comments: 'The real worry for Japanese equity markets is that the administration will talk the yen higher. A higher yen means lower profits. With the market always having been earnings, rather than interest rate, driven through the current economic malaise, lower profits mean lower equity prices.' Conversely, Nomura, which was surprised by the speed and extent of the rise in the yen, remained bullish on the outlook for the Japanese stock market. 'The impact of an overvalued currency (and possible trade sanctions) and the full force of domestic reflation could see the trade surplus shrink with surprising rapidity,' the bank says. 'A further cut in the discount rate in Japan, and rise in the US, should also help. The pace of corporate restructuring, moreover, could well accelerate, increasing visibility of a dramatic profits recovery as and when the recovery gets under way.' Europe, meanwhile, had interest rates on its mind, although in the event the Bundesbank's decision to act on Thursday took most analysts by surprise. UBS notes that after innumerable false dawns the Bundesbank's decision to lower the discount rate by 50 basis points represented the first reduction in German official rates since early October. 'The nature of the reduction - lowering the discount rate and keeping the Lombard rate constant while maintaining the repo rate fixed at 6 per cent - gives the Buba plenty of room to manoeuvre over the coming months. European rates are now firmly back on the agenda and a return to last year's 'salami slice' reductions in the repo rate is now in prospect.' UBS adds that the German move paves the way for the Banque de France to cut its rates after its council meeting on Thursday, although perhaps by less than the German 50 basis points. 'The (French) central bank's continued dogged attachment to relatively high interest rates remains a source of puzzlement. The central bank alternates between exchange rate concerns and credibility worries to publicly justify its obstinacy,' UBS notes. At the same time, the debate over the relative attractions of Europe and Asian markets for equity investors continued apace. A Smith New Court-Gallup poll revealed that 18 per cent of UK fund managers planned to reduce their exposure to continental European equities - the biggest negative balance since the survey began in the middle of 1990 - in favour of Japan, although the broker notes that the worries for Europe seemed to be mainly short term. James Capel, however, takes an opposite view, saying that there remained a huge weight of money to be invested in equities, and while the Far East needs longer to simmer down and Japan to return to the boil, Europe was expected to be a major beneficiary. By the end of last week, attention had turned to the sell-off in US bonds after bad news on the business outlook and inflation from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. European equities and bonds felt the pinch on Friday as Wall Street tumbled, but investors were adopting a cautious attitude yesterday, awaiting new clues when Wall Street resumes trading after the long holiday weekend.</p>

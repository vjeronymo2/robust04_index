			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ion Iliescu, president of Romania, at a news </F> conference jointly held with Vaclav Havel, president of the  Czech Republic, at Bucharest Cotroceni Palace -- live]    [Text] I would like to begin by emphasizing the political  significance of this first visit of the president of the new  state, the Czech Republic.    I believe that above all, this visit marks the evolution of  the relations between our states by crowning the constant  evolution of our exchanges, relations, and contacts in the  political and economic fields, thus, the consolidation and  furthering of our bilateral relations, as well as our  cooperation on the international plane within various  international bodies.    Second, this visit outlined the political will of the two  states to give a new impetus to the furthering of the  traditional relations existing between our countries and to our  mutual interest to diversify and further those relations on all  planes. This will is also expressed by the political document,  which we signed today, the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty  between Romania and the Czech Republic.    There is no need for me to detail the traditional, old,  abundant, and eminently positive character of the relations  between Romania and Czechoslovakia, or the ample history of our  friendship relations, our feelings of sympathy and solidarity,  which marked the relations between our peoples. There have  never been and there are no elements, whatsoever, that could  cause discord or disagreement between our countries. On the  contrary, during the difficult, hard moments in the history of  our nations, the two peoples were always side by side. During  our talks we also evoked the time of 1968, the unanimous way in  which Romania's people expressed its solidarity with the  Czechoslovak people during the Soviet invasion and that of the  troops of the Warsaw Pact.    Thus, both during our talks and in the treaty we signed, we  registered our will to strengthen those traditional relations  and to elevate them to a new level within the context of the  transformations both our countries are currently undergoing.    Together we evoked the international problems currently  facing our countries. We assessed as positive the cooperation  of our countries within various international bodies, our joint  actions and our mutual support and interest to further the  processes of general European integration, and our common will  to continue to act jointly to promote the general-European  integration processes on the political plane, to ensure equal  security conditions to all European states, and to achieve  economic integration.    I believe that President Havel's visit, although short,  offered him the opportunity -- as this is his first visit to  Romania -- to personally discover, in the talks he held with  political and cultural figures, regardless of political  orientation, the durable feelings of friendship and solidarity  of the Romanians, of the Romanian people, for the Czech people.    It is my conviction that this visit marks an important  political moment in the history of Romanian-Czech bilateral  relations.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / London Tube seeks cable help abroad London Underground yesterday appealed for technical help from big UK cable manufacturers and international subway train operators to repair its crippled system. Managers turned to companies such as BICC as engineers struggled to locate faults in the 50-year old power supply cables for the Central Line. Independent observers say commuters annoyed by this week's power failures should blame the government rather than staff. After three days of disruption, consultants who have worked with Underground engineers said they were doing the best they could with available equipment. 'If you've got cables that old it's reasonable to expect some problems,' said one consultant. 'I don't think it's fair to lay the blame on the managers or engineers. At the end of the day it comes down to funding.' Management systems have been tightened, and in 1988 managers were given responsibility for a particular line. This has led to an improvement in the quality of the service, the Underground says. Senior management reviews are conducted after incidents such as this week's breakdown. Procedures for dealing with passengers trapped in carriages in tunnels have been improved following previous shutdowns and worked much better this week, the Underground said. It has been keen to emphasise funding shortages. Earlier this year it published the details of an Pounds 8.5bn spending programme - nearly Pounds 900m a year over the next 10 years  -which it said would be needed to create what it called 'a decently modern metro' after decades of neglect. This week's problems were the result of a 1,000-to-one occurrence which the Underground's traditional 'belt-and-braces' approach to power supply - and other safety-related equipment - was unable to address. The same cable that takes the power supply from the substation to the track is also used for the back-up substation, London Underground said yesterday. So, in the rare event of a fault in the cable, neither the main substation nor the back-up can be used. One consultant said it was 'bad luck' that such a fault should occur, although the age of the equipment increased the chance of a problem. The Underground cannot afford the luxury of having hundreds of miles of back-up cabling. The short-term effect is that, following further power failures yesterday, the Central Line east of Liverpool Street will remain shut this weekend. The power failures raise the broader issue of government funding for the Underground and whether financial cuts are making it difficult for managers to spend adequately on 'behind-the-scenes' investment when more high-profile spending is also needed. One observer said: 'When money is tight it is a fact of life that it is easier to get money for things that have a profile, such as new or refurbished trains and stations. Preventive maintenance tends to suffer in that situation . . . there's no kudos in replacing cables.' London Underground said yesterday that the cabling, some of which is 70 years old, should have been replaced 15 years ago. The equipment had served it well, and there was no reason to believe it was about to fail. But it would not compromise on safety if it thought that using old cables was a risk.</p>

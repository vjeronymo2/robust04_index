			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ROWLAND HEIGHTS;  </P> <P> DRIVER'S ED PROGRAM STALLS  </P> <P> A fee-for-service plan to revive driver's education has stalled in the Rowland  Unified School District.  </P> <P> If 200 students had enrolled, the district would have offered behind-the-wheel  training for a fee of $200 per student.  </P> <P> Because only 35 students signed up by mid-December, the district canceled the  program and will refund students' money, said Diane Ho, the district's public  information officer.  </P> <P> Like the majority of districts across the state, Rowland Unified canceled its  behind-the-wheel driver's training program when Gov. George Deukmejian and the  Legislature eliminated money for the program from this year's budget.  </P> <P> Rowland and other districts still offer the classroom portion of the program.  Without on-the-road training, however, students are not eligible to take  licensing tests until they turn 18.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE MIGHT BE A COURT, BUT SOME READERS SAY SHE SHOULD NOT JUDGE  </P> <P> I was amazed that you dignified Margaret Court's homophobic remarks about  Martina Navratilova by printing them as a news story. Would you publish such a  story without editorial rebuttal if Court were commenting on race, ethnicity or  religion? Martina has gained the respect of players and fans because she is so  very talented, intense and disciplined. The fact that she is at ease in her  personal life and is in a loving relationship is far from a "bad example for  younger players" or anyone else.  </P> <P> RITA SCHERREI  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

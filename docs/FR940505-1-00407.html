Any owner or operator complying by means of paragraphs (m)(3)(i) (C) or (D), (3)(ii), and (3)(iii) of this section shall demonstrate compliance by submitting to the Administrator and the local Air Pollution Control District the results of an initial compliance test performed in accordance with the applicable requirements of paragraph (m)(7) of this section. The owner or operator shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of the compliance test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. As a part of the certification, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator and the local Air Pollution Control District a written report of the results of the compliance test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Engine operator inspection plan. By the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (m)(5) of this section, any owner or operator of a unit rated at equal to or greater than 50 brake horsepower and less than 300 brake horsepower that chooses to comply with the requirements of paragraph (m)(3) of this section by means of paragraphs (m)(3)(i) (C) or (D), (3)(ii), and (3)(iii) of this section shall submit an Engine Operator Inspection Plan to the Administrator and the local Air Pollution Control District. The owner or operator may request a change to the plan at any time. On and after the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (m)(5) of this section, the plan shall be updated and submitted to the Administrator and the local Air Pollution Control District prior to commencing any change in operation. The Plan shall include the following for each engine: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The manufacturer, model number, rated brake horsepower, combustion method (i.e., rich-burn, lean-burn, or diesel), and company identification number and the location of the engine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) A description of the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control system installed on the engine (if any), including type (e.g., selective or nonselective catalytic reduction, ``clean-burn'' combustion, etc.) and manufacturer, as well as a description of any ancillary equipment related to the control of emissions (e.g., automatic air/fuel ratio controller, fuel valves, etc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Establish engine operating parameters (e.g., timing, manifold vacuum pressure, valve set points, etc.) using the results of the initial compliance test required under paragraph (m)(6)(i)(C) of this section. In addition, the plan shall establish engine exhaust oxygen concentrations in accordance with the test data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) A specific emission inspection procedure to assure that the engine is operated in continual compliance with the requirements of this section. The procedure shall include an inspection schedule requiring that inspections be conducted every calendar quarter or after every 2,000 hours of engine operation. In no event shall the frequency of inspection be less than once per calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The plan shall require that a portable NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  analyzer be used to take readings during any quarter in which source tests are not performed. The instrument readings for each parameter in the inspection plan, a description of the corrective actions taken, a determination of whether or not the engine is in compliance, and the name of the person recording the measurement shall be recorded in the inspection log. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Each preventative or corrective maintenance procedure or practice that will be used to maintain the engine and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control system in continual compliance with the provisions of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Any owner or operator of a unit rated at equal to or greater than 300 brake horsepower that chooses to comply with the requirements of paragraph (m)(3) of this section by means of paragraph (m)(3)(i) (C) or (D) and paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section shall comply with the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) By the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (m)(5) of this section, install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) in accordance with the applicable requirements of Appendices B and F of 40 CFR part 60 to demonstrate continuous compliance with the requirements of paragraph (m)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. The CEMS shall be installed and operational before conducting the initial compliance test required under paragraph (m)(6)(i)(C) and paragraph (m)(7) of this section. The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator documentation that the CEMS is in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Each owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report, in accordance with the requirements of &sect;60.7(c) and &sect;60.13, to the Administrator within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Any owner or operator of a unit rated at equal to or greater than 50 brake horsepower and less than 300 brake horsepower that chooses to comply with the requirements of paragraph (m)(3) of this section by means of either paragraph (m)(3)(i) (C) or (D), and paragraphs (m)(3)(ii) and (m)(3)(iii) of this section, shall comply with the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Complete an emission test at least once every 24 months in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (m)(7) of this section. If the results of an emission test indicate that a unit is in violation of the applicable NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, and/or VOC emission standards specified in paragraphs (m)(3)(i)(C), (m)(3)(i)(D), (m)(3)(ii), and (m)(3)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall make any adjustments to the operating parameters of the unit and/or associated control equipment necessary to bring the unit into compliance as demonstrated through an emission test. If it is necessary to adjust the operating parameters of the unit and/or associated control equipment that are different from those specified in the Engine Operator Inspection Plan to bring the unit into compliance, the owner or operator shall revise the Engine Operator Inspection Plan to reflect the changes made to the operating parameters, and shall submit the revisions to the Administrator and the local Air Pollution Control District. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent EPA from bringing an enforcement action for violation of the applicable emission standards in paragraphs (m)(3)(i)(C), (m)(3)(i)(D), (m)(3)(ii), and (m)(3)(iii) of this section or for failure to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

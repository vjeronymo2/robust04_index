			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The floor leaders of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party and main opposition Democratic  Party on Wednesday agreed to investigate for 20 days alleged  irregularities in the Defense Ministry's Sangmudae project where  military facilities in Kwangju were moved to the city's  outskirts in 1990.    The project was undertaken in August 1990 and completed in  November 1992 by Hyundai Construction Co. and Chongwoo  Construction Co.    In the process, Chongwoo President Cho Ki-hyon embezzled  part  of the payment, prompting the main opposition Democratic Party  (DP) to charge that some of the embezzled money may have flowed  into the political sector.    The DP has formed its own investigative team, led by Rep.  Chong Tae-chol who first "exposed" the irregularities. It found  that Cho embezzled 22.7 billion won out of the total payment of  65.8 billion won.    The DP claims that part of the 22.7 billion won may have  been  used as political funds by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party  during the 1992 presidential campaign.    The problem would be simpler if it ended there. But  suspicions began to snowball when Cho told the prosecution that  he had donated 8 billion won out of the embezzled money to  Tonghwa Temple in Taegu and another 4.5 billion won in the form  of various contributions to the Chogye Buddhist order.    Although the opposition party could not substantiate its  claim that part of Cho's donations had seeped into the political  sector, it wants to invoke parliament's right to probe the uses  of the slush fund.    Rep. Chong claimed that out of the 22.7 billion won, Cho had  spent only 2 billion won on purchasing a villa.    There is a strong possibility, he said, that the rest of the  money may have gone to "officials of the present administration  as well as those from former President No Tae-u's government."    The DP is pointing the finger at one ruling party official,  a  former Army chief of staff, a former director of the Agency for  National Security Planning and the chief of the Presidential  Security Service as the men who channelled the money into  political funds.    The DP has even identified the men by supplying the initials  of their last names.    In addition, the opposition party claims that during the  1992  presidential campaign, ruling party campaigners visited major  Buddhist temples around the country and "handed envelopes  stuffed with millions of won" at prayer meetings of a highly  political nature.    The suspicions have doubled since the Rev. Mukong, chief  monk  of Tonghwa Temple, said he had not received a penny from Cho,  who told authorities he had donated 8 billion won to the temple  to build a huge image of Buddha.    As a result, the DP believes that most of Cho's embezzled  money may have gone to the political circle through officials of  the Agency for National Security Planning or then-Army chief of  staff Gen. Yi Chin-sam, who was reported Wednesday to have  suddenly left the country for the United States last Friday.    Alternatively, the money could have been used as bribes by  Cho, the DP said.    This is what the opposition party wants to find out if the  National Assembly invokes its investigation right. It says the  initial results of the probe by the prosecution are insufficient  and suspicious points remain.    The DP also wants to determine the relationship between Cho  and the Chogye Buddhist order, whether the order's chief  executive, the Rev. So Ui-hyon, was involved in the possible  scandal and how Chongwoo Construction Co., which was but a small  builder, received a share of the project.    The Democratic Liberal Party, however, describes the DP's  charge as "a vague suspicion" and says the opposition party only  wants to use "the unsubstantiated theory" as a weapon in its  political offensive against the ruling party.    Yet the DLP is not opposed to a National Assembly  investigation into the allegation. "Let us uncover what we can  if there is indeed anything," it says.    Both the presidential office and the DLP have already  pointed  out that the Sangmudae project was carried out by the No  administration and that Chongwadae has received none of the  alleged 8 billion won.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KCSN SWITCHES FROM COUNTRY TO CLASSICAL FORMAT  </P> <P> Responding to the recent shake-ups among classical music stations in Los  Angeles, KCSN-FM (88.5), a tiny public radio station licensed to Cal State  Northridge, switched formats Wednesday from country music to classical music.  </P> <P> "The opportunity in the marketplace obviously is the reason for the change,"  KCSN General Manager Ken Mills said. "There are very few windows of opportunity  such as this for a small public station to take on a major format. The recent  demise of KFAC (which changed to a rock format) and the fine-tuning and  fluctuations at KUSC (91.5) have made it possible for us to consider -- and now  do -- a classical format."  </P> <P> KCSN made the switch to classical music at 1:05 p.m. Wednesday with the playing  of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  </P> <P> KCSN serves a 25-mile area that covers most of the San Fernando and Santa  Clarita valleys, and Mills said he is considering attempting to expand the  station's signal power.  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Restoring US labour's voice: Robert Taylor on the chief of Washington's industrial relations board For a man who is so closely watched, some would say Bill Gould is remarkably misunderstood. It took Congress more than seven months to ratify his appointment as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, the five-man federal labour agency that enforces the country's basic labour law. Even after a deal had been cut with the Republicans, 38 voted against him, the highest level of recorded opposition to any Clinton nominee. Much of US business believes him to be too pro-union, a black New Deal liberal who once worked for the United Autoworkers union and intends to shift the power balance on the board against the interests of employers. His prolific writings have been widely scrutinised for pro-labour bias. His new book, Agenda for Reform, that calls for changes to help union organisation and collective bargaining, 'was exhibit number one at the hearings', he says. Those who regard him as at least controversial are unlikely to be disappointed during a four-year term that ends in 1998, two years after the next presidential election. At an industrial law conference in Oxford this week Mr Gould spoke up for a more activist board that would in a 'fair and even-handed' way encourage the spread of collective bargaining. After all, he says, that is what the board's statute has required since it was established as an independent federal agency in 1935 during Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. The board employs 2,100 staff across 33 regions and has a modest Dollars 175m (Pounds 113m) annual budget. The quietly-spoken Mr Gould, who holds a law chair at Stanford University in California, does not come across as a partisan firebrand. Nor is his record that of a radical. A graduate of the London School of Economics, where he studied labour law, he advised the British Conservative party nearly 25 years ago on their Industrial Relations Act designed to regulate the unions. Lord Geoffrey Howe, former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, remains a friend from those days and he cannot understand why the Republicans are so worried about him. But during the Reagan-Bush years, Mr Gould says, the board was 'not abolished but trashed'. One chairman of that time even admitted in public he did not approve of collective bargaining. 'My opponents had it all their own way for 15 years. They don't like or want impartiality,' he says. He wants to try to restore what he sees as the board's lost authority and vigour. Whether this can stem the remorseless decline of organised labour in the US, which now covers little more than 11 per cent of the private sector workforce, is another matter. 'It is possible we could play a role in enabling the unions to regain lost ground by actively promoting collective bargaining,' says Mr Gould. But in his book even he admits changes in the market economy have been 'far more important than the law itself' in explaining the drop in union membership. While he regrets the recent refusal by Congress to support President Bill Clinton's bill to prevent employers replacing strikers with new workers, he also argues 'the enactment of labour law reform will not necessarily reverse the process of decline'. He hopes that under his chairmanship the board can 'foster a more co-operative environment between labour and management'. Mr Gould has already established advisory panels from both sides of industry to help him in that process. Mr Gould stresses that he will administer the law without bias or favour. 'We will enforce the statutes against all wrong-doers,' he insists. In his first six months in the job he secured 60 injunctions, mainly against employers to stop them carrying on alleged unfair labour practices. But he has shown he is no poodle of organised labour by initiating contempt proceedings against the United Mine Workers union for violation of a board decision. Mr Gould has attracted criticism from employers for his executive decision to hold only postal and not workplace secret ballots of workers in union recognition cases. Some companies believe this shift will give an unfair advantage to trade union organisers who will be able to visit the homes of workers to influence them. But the board believes holding such ballots inside the company can open them up to undue employer pressure. Mr Gould has also speeded procedures to cut the back-log of cases and prevent wasteful litigation. He points out that he alone cannot restore the fortunes of the American labour movement. 'We cannot do it for them,' he says. Well aware of his precarious position, he also realises he could find himself in a minority on his own board after the mid-term congressional elections. At present he holds a three-to-two balance but if there is a Republican triumph - as expected - a new nominee could shift the board once more into conservative hands.</p>

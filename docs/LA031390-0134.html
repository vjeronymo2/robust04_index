			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Beach Boys Fuel Up for Concert Tour: Texaco is sending out good vibrations to  "Beach Boys" fans by sponsoring a free 10-city concert tour starting May 1 at  the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> No tickets will be sold for the concert; instead, those who want to attend can  try to win tickets by playing a scratch-off game at Texaco stations. The Second  Harvest National Food Bank Network will also give away tickets in exchange for  donations of perishable food. The tour makes stops in Phoenix, Seattle and New  York. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

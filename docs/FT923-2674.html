			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: First Treuhand deal divides London and Frankfurt contracts THE FIRST bond issue of the Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with privatising former East German assets, yesterday forced a sharp divergence between the prices of Bund futures in Frankfurt and London. At one point during the afternoon, the gap between the rival contracts reached more than three quarters of a point, with the London contract at 90.53 compared with the Frankfurt on 89.77. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange had decided not to make the new Treuhand bonds deliverable into its Bund contracts which expire up to March 1992, making them less attractive for investors to hold. The Deutsche Terminborse, on the other hand, last month ruled that the bonds would be deliverable into its March 1993 contract. The new Treuhand bonds will be the cheapest to deliver into the futures contract, helping to push down the price. Yesterday's issue of DM4bn of bonds, expected to be followed today with an auction of a further DM6bn, was launched with a 7 3/4 per cent coupon and priced at 101, to give a yield about 13 basis points higher than 10-year bunds. At that level, the bonds, which carry a full guarantee from the Federal government, were considered attractively priced by traders. 'If the unity fund is deliverable, then the Treuhand should also be,' said one economist, adding that to include it would not undermine the quality of the Liffe contract. Liffe said it was reviewing whether the bonds should be deliverable into its contracts from next June onwards.</p>

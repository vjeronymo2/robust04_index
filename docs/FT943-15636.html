			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Indicators differ over economic prospects The shorter leading index, designed to reflect trends in the UK economy five months ahead, fell in May, according to the Central Statistical Office, Philip Coggan writes. The shorter cyclical indicator dropped for the fourth successive month. The CSO said May's decline was caused by share price falls and consumer borrowing. However, the longer leading index, which aims to pick up trends in the economy 13 months ahead, rose in May. An increase in housebuilding starts and a rise in the corporate sector's financial surplus contributed to the change. The coincident index rose in April and has been climbing since 1992's second quarter.</p>

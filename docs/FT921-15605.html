			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Appointments: Olympian ambition Dixons, the electrical retailing group chaired by the veteran Stanley Kalms, is to restructure its senior management team. John Clare (above), the 41-year-old managing director of the Dixons Stores Group, becomes managing director of the entire group, replacing Mark Souhami who becomes deputy chairman. Clare, who has rapidly climbed the Dixons management tree since joining from Ladbroke Group in 1985, is credited with the successful integration of the Dixons and Currys chains and with introducing more effective management information systems and controls. He will chair an eight-man team of senior managers with responsibility for all the group's retail interests. One of their most pressing concerns will be to stem the losses at Silo, the group's US business. Clare says he has learned a lot of lessons about retailing from Kalms and Souhami. 'They are masters of their trade, founders of 'the retail is detail' school of management,' he said yesterday in what sounded like a farewell eulogy. But Kalms emphasised that neither he nor Souhami was about to retire. Kalms once said he came in to business at the time of the London Olympics in 1948 and would like to retire when London next hosted the games. But given the capital's lack of success in winning the venue, his future must be seen to be in the lap of the gods.</p>

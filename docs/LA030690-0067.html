			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL ASSN. REFUSES TO OPPOSE SPRAYING  </P> <P> Leaders of the California Medical Assn., lending their voice to the debate over  efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, on Monday rejected  overwhelmingly a resolution calling for a moratorium on malathion spraying  until the pesticide's health effects can be studied further.  </P> <P> The vote came at the CMA's annual House of Delegates meeting in Anaheim. While  it was interpreted by some association leaders as a declaration that malathion  spraying is safe, proponents of the resolution said it failed because of  political, rather than medical, considerations.  </P> <P> "There is no demonstrable danger from spraying of malathion," said Charles M.  Hair, past president of the association. "We accept the fact that our  agriculture is severely threatened and this does not propose a danger to our  patients."  </P> <P> Added Dr. Mitchell S. Karlan, a member of the CMA's scientific board: "We are  taking a step that to our knowledge, malathion is safe."  </P> <P> But Dr. H. Rex Greene, a Pasadena oncologist who in three days of committee  meetings led opposition to spraying, disagreed that the vote meant the  association had endorsed the safety of spraying malathion over infested  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "I think CMA really doesn't want to take a position," he said. "We're not  saying malathion is safe. We're not saying malathion is unsafe. We're afraid of  stirring up the public and causing undue fears."  </P> <P> Greene noted that most of the members of the 353-member House of Delegates are  from agricultural areas not being sprayed.  </P> <P> He contended that studies so far do not prove malathion safe. "I tell my  patients I don't know, but I hope they don't have any children in the next five  years," he said.  </P> <P> Declaring that current studies of the chronic effects of malathion are  "deficient scientifically and must be repeated," the resolution had asked for  an immediate halt to aerial spraying. An amendment to the resolution, which  also failed, had asked that CMA's Scientific Board review the safety of  malathion spraying. It was rejected by an overwhelming voice vote.  </P> <P> Dr. L. Rex Ehling, Orange County's health director and a CMA representative for  California Family Physicians, said a 1980 study of spraying in Santa Clara  County found "no significant health risk."  </P> <P> In a related development, a bipartisan group of 36 state Assembly members on  Monday jointly voiced their support for the spraying, which since an  infestation was discovered in August has become a biweekly ritual for vast  sectors of Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> The lawmakers, who represent primarily rural districts and who are seeking to  maintain legislative support for the use of malathion, stated that spraying is  safe and insisted that the campaign to control the Medfly should continue,  despite the hardship for Southern Californians.  </P> <P> The legislators predicted a wide range of devastating effects if aerial  spraying is halted, including severe economic losses for growers. They  maintained that if the Medfly made its way into agricultural fields, the result  would be more farm use of pesticides, higher food costs, threats to worker  safety, embargoes and loss of jobs.  </P> <P> "As Californians, we are all in this together," the legislators said in a joint  statement. "Malathion bait spraying is not for the benefit of California  farmers at the expense of Southern Californians, but must be continued for the  environment, public health, and economic good of the entire state."  </P> <P> The pro-malathion contingent emerged on the eve of a session before the full  Assembly to take testimony from Deukmejian Administration officials and  scientific experts on the use of malathion.  </P> <P> Representatives of the state's farm regions are concerned that urban  legislators are gearing up to block the spraying program.  </P> <P> In at least three Southern California cities, concerns about malathion have  prompted city governments to attempt to ban low-flying helicopters over their  borders.  </P> <P> This novel attempt to keep out the Medfly eradicators has proven to be largely  symbolic, and on Monday the Federal Aviation Administration issued a general  but pointed reminder that it was responsible for policing aircraft.  </P> <P> FAA Regional Administrator Jerry Chavkin issued a statement saying that  Congress has passed laws, which have been upheld by the courts, limiting to the  federal government the power to control the flight of aircraft, including  helicopters engaged in aerial spraying to eradicate the Medfly.  </P> <P> Chavkin said he hoped "reason would prevail over emotional responses if the  airborne dissemination of malathion is resumed."  </P> <P> Despite Chavkin's warning, the Azusa City Council was contemplating both a  legal and aerial challenge to the renewed spraying in the East San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> The city planned to rent a helicopter from Pasadena, which earlier had tried to  shadow and cite a state squadron of malathion-spraying copters, and do the same  thing by sending an Azusa police officer aloft. Azusa is among nearly a dozen  communities in Los Angeles and Orange counties that has opposed aerial spraying  either by passing ordinances or threatening to file lawsuits.  </P> <P> Spraying was to resume Monday night in Azusa, Irwindale, Glendora and the  Brea-La Habra Heights area, but the operation was canceled because of strong  winds.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard C. Paddock contributed to this story from  Sacramento.  </P></p>

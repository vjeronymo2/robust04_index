			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> QUOTAS COUNT US ALL OUT;  </P> <P> THEY DENIGRATE AND STUNT EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S DISTINCT PERSONALITY, HOPES AND  ATTITUDES.  </P> <P> The progress of individual liberty in the United States has been the progress  of replacing skin color, ethnicity or gender with accomplishment as the  touchstone for political or professional success. The nation is now  retrogressing on that laudatory historical path and promoting community  enmities.  </P> <P> California's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Dianne Feinstein, has pledged  administrative, executive and judicial appointments according to gender, racial  and ethnic quotas reflecting population percentages: 50% women, 25% Latino, 7%  black and 7% Asian and other minorities. Feinstein's pledge echoes the voice of  President Jimmy Carter, who championed the appointment of federal judges based  on comparable nationwide gender and minority quotas. The Democratic Party rules  for selecting delegates to national conventions similarly insists on female and  minority quotas.  </P> <P> The assumptions behind the quotas are both false and pernicious: that women and  minority groups consist of fungible individuals whose interests, aspirations  and sympathies are unique and permanently divide them from non-group members;  that female and minority groups can be satisfactorily represented politically  only by individuals who share their gender, race or ethnicity, and that such  ascriptive characteristics are and should be decisive in the electoral process,  the administration of justice and qualification for government office.  </P> <P> But the diversity of aspirations, interests and viewpoints within female or  minority groups is enormous and overlaps those of non-group members. For  instance, women sharply divide over abortion, as do men; the most fervent  champion of abortion rights on the Supreme Court is Justice Harry Blackmun,  whereas a strong critic is Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Sens. Edward M. Kennedy  (D-Mass.) and Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) are enthusiasts for gender and  minority preferences in employment or contracting; opposing views are held by  scholars Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams.  </P> <P> Blacks and whites divide over desegregation of traditionally black colleges,  court-ordered busing, drug legalization, the lyrics of 2 Live Crew and  countless other issues.  </P> <P> The happenstance of a shared sex, racial, or ethnic status is neither necessary  nor sufficient to the fair representation of individuals within those groups.  Indeed, the contrary notion is absurd. Are whites not fairly represented in Los  Angeles because Tom Bradley is the mayor? Are female judges incapable of fairly  presiding over a criminal trial of a male defendant? Would the election of  Dianne Feinstein leave California's males unfairly under-represented? It  denigrates and stunts every individual's distinct personality, hopes and  attitudes to suggest that all are the inevitable proxy of the congenital  accident of sex, race or ethnicity.  </P> <P> To reduce invidious stereotyping and prejudices, laws and practices should  teach that such characteristics are no more important in appraising individuals  than are their shoe sizes. Thus, laws should strictly proscribe the use of  race, ethnicity or gender in political, economic or educational  decision-making.  </P> <P> No ascriptive characteristics deserve any consideration in medicine, law,  teaching, professional sports or other lines of employment. That is a major  reason why the Supreme Court in 1964 held unconstitutional racial designations  of candidates on ballots.  </P> <P> Yet the Voting Rights Act now encourages racial bloc voting and demands that  district boundary lines be drawn to ensure a proportional representation of  minorities in legislative bodies and elected judgeships. Scores of states and  municipalities dictate racial and gender quotas in public employment and  contracting that shower advantages on individuals never victimized by  discrimination. Federal civil-rights laws smile on racial and gender  preferences in both employment and education and, at present, Congress is  edging toward employment quotas. Also, the Supreme Court fueled racial  stereotyping last month by endorsing minority preferences in broadcasting to  promote "minority viewpoints," a concept that degrades minorities as fungible  and defies definition.  </P> <P> Racist and sexist enmities are never alleviated by practicing racism or sexism.  Indeed, the practices foster antagonisms and the types of interracial crimes  recently witnessed in Howard Beach, Bensonhurst and New York's Central Park.  </P> <P> The animosities scourging nations split by gender and ethnic prejudices --  South Africa or Romania, for example -- should daunt the United States from its  wrongheaded civil-rights course.  </P></p>

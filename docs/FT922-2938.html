			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Names should fight levy Sir, Despite all the adverse publicity and the personal ruin of thousands of Names, the Council of Lloyd's has found a way out of its problems by increasing the central fund by levying Names. There is no suggestion that underwriting agents, members' agents or brokers should suffer a levy themselves. It would appear that the 'cannon fodder' can be relied upon to 'cough up' still more money for the excesses, incompetence and ineptitude of the underwriting agents, members' agents and brokers. Central fund levying may be appropriate if these bodies were also asked to contribute significantly; instead we read that many underwriters' pay at Lloyd's is in the many hundreds of thousands of pounds and syndicate expenses have been frozen. I believe Names should fight this central fund levy proposal with bitter determination. Steven A Parnes, 21 Sheldon Avenue, Highgate, London N6 4JS</p>

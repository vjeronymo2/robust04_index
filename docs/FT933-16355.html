			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Lady Chatterley's trial - Radio ON MONDAY, to go with the television addicts' Lady Chatterley, Radio 4 repeated the transcript of the trial of Penguin Books for publishing the book. It was alleged to be liable to 'deprave and corrupt'. The script was compiled by Jack Emery, presented by Helena Kennedy and directed by John Theocaris; the legal and literary experts were played by actors. The verdict of Not Guilty was momentous; but the trial seems less interesting today than it did then. It was a simple case. For the defence, Gerald Gardiner QC (Frederick Treeves) called nearly 20 witnesses, who between them agreed that the book was of literary merit and profound social advantage. Words like 'sacred' and 'holy' were used. No subtleties arose about the value of the different manuscript versions, now being discussed in connection with television. For the prosecution, Mervyn Griffith-Jones QC (John Shrapnel) called no witnesses at all, simply drawing attention to the passages describing what he reckoned was indecent behaviour. The jury, nine mature men and three mature women, found that Penguin had committed no offence. Sunday evening brought another repeat on Radio 4, Paul Schlesinger's Falstaff - A Voyage Round His Belly, last heard on Christmas Day, when we were possibly busy watching something less intellectual. It is not a voyage of discovery, only of appreciation. Everyone taking part knows Falstaff like a neighbour and has only to point out some specific quality. It was grand to hear some of the lines spoken by Donald Sinden, who has not, so far, played it on stage; his encomium on 'good Sherris sack' sent me straight to the pub. Falstaff can take on various guises - the ambitious courtier, the useless braggart and dishonest soldier, the old man in Shallow's garden, rejected suitor, the helpless invalid we hear of but do not see. He is no clown, simply the spirit of fun, yet always consistent - even in Boito's lines for Verdi. I suspect he is the most immortal of all Shakespeare's people, more universal than Hamlet, even. That wise old critic Kenneth Tynan specified one attribute - always he was 'first a gentleman.' A most enjoyable programme. The Sunday Play on Radio 3 was Michael Wright's Mrs Klein, with three characters, all women psychiatrists - Melanie Klein (Sarah Kestelman), her daughter Melita (Juliet Stevenson), and Paula (Deborah Findlay), Melanie's stand-in. They all have dreams, and are as ready to talk about these as the real events of their lives. Melanie's son, Hans, has been killed climbing, perhaps intentionally. There is much mutual dispute and earnest psychotalk. Even with such able playing, I could not arouse much interest. The author directed. 'You smell, madam,' said the precise Dr Johnson, 'I stink.' Radio 4's The Joy of Smelling (Wednesday, first of three) told us how the lady might stink  -of lavender for example, but also how we should smell her. Tiny particles carry different scents; they are of varying size and shape, and are absorbed only where they fit, so separating the assorted niffs. Naturally, we end up with a special part of the brain. Michael Collie and Dr George Dodd, who told us all this, had other, less pleasing, things to say. We smell - I mean stink - of what we eat, which for the average Britain means meaty, cheesy, sweaty odours that other peoples, with different diets, may find horrid - although they will no doubt have problems of their own. Dealers in such items as tea, coffee and especially wine, must keep their smelling keen, and can practise in places such as the London Underground. We shall never know, unless someone tells us, if we have bad breath; the brain gets used to it. While we are on the senses, on Monday Radio 4 will give us Questions of Taste, but this is not scientific, just a culinary quiz.</p>

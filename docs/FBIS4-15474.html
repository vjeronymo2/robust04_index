			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin has  urged the Russia's Choice parliamentary group to support the  government's decision to join NATO's Partnership for Peace  program.    Russia's membership in the program would "determine a model  on the basis of which relations between Russia and the West will  be built in future" and would mean that Russia had opted for  cooperation instead of isolation, Churkin said at a meeting of  the group, to which he was invited to give the Foreign  Ministry's position on the current developments in the former  Yugoslavia.    Parliament this week put on its agenda a motion for lifting  economic sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, Croatia's Serb  Krajina and the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion  was made by the parliamentary group of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Asked whether the LDP group's pro-Serb line had any impact  on  the Foreign Ministry's position, Churkin said the ministry "has  had to pursue its political line under considerable political  pressure since the times of the former Supreme Soviet." But  internal political struggles have no effect on the ministry's  course, which enables Russia to make active efforts to settle  the Yugoslav crisis "together with the world community and  without conflicting with the world community," Churkin said.    He said unconditional support for Serbia would mean support  for Serb extremism, which would be "dangerous for the entire  Serb people." All parties to the conflict are southern Slavs,  so Russia is not interested in the Serbs alone, Churkin said.  Besides, Russia is a "multinational and multireligious state,"  something the Foreign Ministry took into account when sending an  additional contingent for the Sarajevo peacekeeping force. Part  of the contingent were members of Muslim communities in Russia,  he said.</p>

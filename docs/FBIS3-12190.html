			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj in </F> Bethlehem by Muhammad al-Aswad in Cairo; date not given; from  the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, we welcome you to Voice  of the Arabs.    [Frayj] Thank you.    [Al-Aswad] We start this dialogue by asking you to fill us  in on any of the new dimensions regarding the incident at the  al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn on Friday.    [Frayj] The criminal act that took place at dawn on Friday  at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron can only be explained by the  fact that it is based on racists who hate the presence of the  Arabs. Killing worshipers who are kneeling in prayer to God  Almighty indiscriminately and without prior warning is an  organized crime with very dangerous political significance. It  did not take place in a vacuum. All the sons of the West Bank  and the Gaza Strip have been terribly hurt and shocked by this  act. We are now demanding international protection. We are  demanding that the criminals in the Israeli settlements be  disarmed. We are demanding that all worshipers--Muslim, Jew, or  Christian--be prevented from entering any holy place carrying  weapons. Under no circumstances should any person be allowed to  carry weapons in a place of worship.    Second, we are demanding that a high-ranking judicial  committee be formed to investigate the circumstances of the  crime. This has cast dark shadows on the peace process. How  can there be peace when the settlers tamper with security as  they please? The successive Israeli governments for the past 26  years have not tried to curb the belligerence of the settlers or  their attacks on Arab citizens. The settlers all over the West  Bank are trying to occupy Arab lands to expand the territory  they have. [passage omitted]    [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, what, in your opinion, should the  scope of Palestinian action be at the United Nations to secure  international protection for the Palestinian people?    [Frayj] We ask the Security Council to provide protection  for the Palestinian Arab citizens in the occupied territories  from the attacks of the settlers and the army, which take place  repeatedly without any deterrent. For example, over 15  Palestinian youths were killed by the army under false pretexts,  while not a single Israeli soldier was injured.    [Al-Aswad] In light of these circumstances, Mr. Ilyas Frayj,  who has responsibility for the security of the Palestinian  citizens?    [Frayj] I believe that security is the responsibility of the  present authority, the responsibility of Israel. Since Israel  does not provide us with the basic minimum security required, we  demand that the United Nations and the Security Council form an  international force to keep the peace and provide security.    [Al-Aswad] You noted in this interview that Israel is  responsible for what happened. What are the limits of this  responsibility? And is it true what is being said -- that 20-50  Israeli armed men participated in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre?    [Frayj] Israeli sources claim that only one person carried  out the operation. I doubt that. I hold Israel fully  responsible for the total security of the Arab citizens and  residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip so long as it  controls the situation there. Either the Palestinian police  should be allowed to enter the West Bank and Gaza Strip  immediately, or an international force should be deployed to  protect the citizens. However, I insist that the settlers  should be disarmed and prevented from entering places of worship  carrying arms.    [Al-Aswad] How do you see the general atmosphere in the  occupied territories after the recent massacre? And will it  affect the credibility of the current peace process?    [Frayj] The vast majority of citizens now do not believe the  peace negotiations are useful since they do not include the  issue of the settlers. The vast majority are now confused.  What is the use of having talks while 120,000 settlers romp and  kill people in the West Bank for no reason whatsoever? The  Israeli Army sometimes helps them but it often turns a blind eye  and does nothing. The settlers are very spoiled and behave like  cowboys [preceding word in English] in the occupied territories.  The Israeli settler who committed this crime did it because he  thought he was a cowboy dealing with Red Indians.    [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, thank you for this dialogue on Voice  of the Arabs.</p>

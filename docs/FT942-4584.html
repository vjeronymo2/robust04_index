			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Rail sell-off plans hit by resignation of rolling-stock chief The government's rail privatisation plans face further delay after the decision by the managing director of one of the three rolling-stock leasing companies to step down. BR confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Roche, whose appointment as managing director of the Eversholt Train Leasing Company was announced on April 21, has left after just over a month for a more senior position at British Rail. When he was appointed Mr Roche was described as having played a key role in the creation of the companies that have been set up to lease locomotives, carriages and wagons to the train-operating companies. The managing directors of the two other rolling-stock companies have come from the leasing sector. Mr Brian Hassell is to take up his appointment this month while Mr Sandy Anderson will start in July. Two of the rolling-stock companies are based in London and the other is based in Sheffield - the government has allocated to each a mixture of BR rolling stock. The leasing industry expects the government to put the companies up for sale next year, though this imposes a very tight timetable on the programme. One leasing specialist said that if the government insisted on buyers bidding on the basis of the current replacement value of the companies' assets it may have problems finding buyers. Replacement value could be as much as three times the book value of the assets, put at about Pounds 1.6bn. The first few weeks since the break-up of British Rail have brought higher ticket-prices, cuts in services and a reduction in the amount of information available to travellers, Labour said yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said a round-up of complaints by passengers to regional rail users' consultative committees revealed that companies were pricing some lines out of existence, reducing passengers' choice of journey routes and ceasing to recognise each others' tickets. BR said there had been some 'anomalies' following the introduction of the new timetables last month, but that these had been put right.</p>

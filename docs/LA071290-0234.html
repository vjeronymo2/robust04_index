			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO TO GET PITCH ON STADIUM FUND  </P> <P> Unable to line up financing without a professional baseball or football team,  Gregg Lukenbill will ask Sacramento residents in a televised appeal tonight to  kick in up to $30 million to help build a stadium.  </P> <P> By paying a one-time fee ranging from $250 to $1,250 per seat, fans would  reserve tickets if a professional baseball or football team moves to  Sacramento.  </P> <P> The reservation fees, refunded only if the $120-million stadium isn't  completed, would be on top of ticket prices.  </P> <P> "We're calling a spade a spade," said Lukenbill, who makes his pitch in a  26-minute Sacramento Sports Assn. video scheduled for about 8:30 p.m. on a  local television station after tonight's San Francisco Giants game.  </P> <P> "If we get solid community support behind a stadium at the moment that  major-league baseball and football are considering expanding, it will make a  very material difference in our ability to attract either an expansion team or  an existing team.  </P> <P> "If we don't get that support, I think we'll really be hurt. But you really  need the stadium to be able to make a lightning strike deal if one comes  along."  </P></p>

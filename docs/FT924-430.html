			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Inflation reaches six-month high in west Germany INFLATION in west Germany rose to its highest rate for six months in December, further damping hopes of a rapid relaxation in the Bundesbank's strict monetary policy. Preliminary estimates of the December rate published yesterday by the Federal Statistics Office put the price rise at 0.2 per cent against November, and 3.8 per cent compared with December, 1991. The figure contrasts with relative optimism expressed by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, on Tuesday, when he expressed confidence that inflation would fall to around 3 per cent next year, compared with an average of about 4 per cent in 1992. However, he also insisted that the central bank's monetary policy would remain tight until inflation was under control. The increase in inflation comes in spite of declining import prices, thanks to the strong D-Mark, and the continuing high interest rates maintained by the Bundesbank, to combat the inflationary pressures in the economy. Some economists had hoped for a reduction in the rate, reflecting the sharp slowdown in economic activity in recent months, before an inevitable increase next month. There will be a one-point increase in the rate of value added tax, from 14 to 15 per cent, from January 1, which is expected to push the inflation rate up above 4 per cent. However, the German economy is expected to continue to contract for at least the first two quarters of next year, and unemployment to grow steadily, putting the trade unions under severe pressure to keep their pay demands modest in the annual wage round. That, and the effect of low import prices, are the main factors behind the cautious optimism for a clear downward trend later in the year. Mr Peter Stihl, head of the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce, warned in a newspaper interview, however, that he saw the spectre of stagflation - inflation and simultaneous economic stagnation - descending on the German economy next year.</p>

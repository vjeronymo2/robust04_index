			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Fletcher: "Hospitals Cut Waiting Times"] </F>   [Text] No patients wait more than two years for hospital  in-patient care or day surgery, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Health  Secretary, announced yesterday.    This was in contrast to April, 1992, when more than 1,600  patients were in two-year queues for hospital treatment, she  said.    Her claim was challenged by Labour who said official figures  showed there were 412 people listed as waiting more than two  years -- a claim later confirmed by the Department of Health.    Mrs Bottomley said that nearly 75 per cent of patients were  seen within three months and 98 per cent within a year. Even  better progress was being made in some parts of the country such  as Merseyside where no patients waited for more than a year.    She was welcoming the second Citizen's Charter report which  compares NHS performance in the three months up to Dec 31 with  performance in the three months up to March 31, 1993.    It shows cuts in waiting times for urgent cases in accident  and emergency units. Patients assessed immediately on arrival  rose from 74 per cent to 83 per cent. The first NHS tables will  be published in the summer highlighting how each hospital and  ambulance service performed.</p>

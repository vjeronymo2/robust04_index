			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Time may resolve data enigma - Paul Taylor considers the prospects for a market that has so far failed to live up to expectations WHILE THE growth in mobile voice telephony has at times been spectacular, the market for mobile data remains something of an enigma. Everyone agrees it will be huge one day, but so far it has stubbornly refused to live up to early expectations. As a result, most mobile data operators have been scaling back their subscriber projections, and in some cases their investments. The latest casualty in the UK has been Hutchison Mobile Data which recently ceased 'actively marketing' its fledgling dedicated data service and now plans to offer mobile data services on its Microtel digital personal com- munications network, which is expected to begin operations next April. the shortfall between expectations and reality may be that most services are still in their infancy. Another reason may be that customers are confused by the bewildering array of delivery systems and equipment. Mobile data ranges from one-way pager traffic and short alert messages to more complex two-way data exchange and electronic mail. Excluding pager traffic, mobile data services are offered in the UK by Vodafone and Cellnet, the two cellular operators, surviving dedicated mobile data network operators such as Ram Mobile Data, Cognito and Vodafone's Paknet, specialist network operators such as Securicor Datatrak, and over private and public access mobile radio networks including National Band Three - all using incompatible standards and equipment. Unlike the cellular telephone network operators, who have attracted more than 7m sub- scribers for their voice services in western Europe alone, the demand for data services has been disappointing. But despite being characterised as the Cinderella of mobile services, data transmission has several key advantages over voice telephony. In particular, data transmissions take up much less air time than voice communications. For example, a 35-word exchange between a dispatcher and a vehicle driver takes more than 21 seconds when spoken but just 1.3 seconds even at the very slow data exchange rate of 1,200 bps (bits per second). Data is generally cheaper, quicker and more accurate than voice and while pagers and cellular phones play an important role in communicating short messages, they have limitations when it comes to transmitting complex or large volumes of information. Typical applications for mobile data involve transferring information to and from portable computers or retrieving information from mobile data terminals such as meter readers or updating information on the office computer systems. Mobile data can provide a corporate salesforce with up-to-date customer information or keep track of emergency services, like truck fleets or railway wagons. Other potential users in the future include the owners of a new generation of hand-held devices called 'personal digital assistants' such as Apple's recently unveiled Newton The case for digital or dedicated data transmission services is, on the face of it, a strong one. Generally, transmitting data over a non-dedicated service means sacrificing transmission quality, coverage or compromising in other areas. Transmitting data reliably over an analogue cellular system is considerably more difficult than over the public switched telephone network. Nevertheless, research shows that many customers require a combination of voice and data communications. One solution is to build the specialist electronics into dedicated equipment or use a special cellular modem. For example, Vodafone's Mobile Data Service uses a special cellular data link control modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data over its cellular network which also provides automatic standards conversion. Another option is to use a public access mobile radio service such as National Band Three in the UK, which is now owned by Geotek Industries of the US and has 35,000 subscribers according to Mr Andrew Robb, its managing director. Using a simple modem mobile data - both status data and so-called freeform data - is currently free on National Band Three and therefore provides a flexible and very cost-effective option for users wishing to mix voice and data. 'We probably have more data subscribers than Vodafone,' says Mr Robb. Mr Callum Mackie, who runs Protocall Ventures, an independent specialist in trunked moble radio networks, argues that PAMR offers the best available combination of voice and data. Protocall can provide a complete package of terminals, software and network services enabling a fleet controller to send and receive voice and data transactions over the airwaves using a PC running a Windows-based fleet management and communications programme. For those disinclined to use modems, another alternative is to wait for digital cellular telephones based on the pan-European GSM or PCN standards. Vodafone has already demonstrated a feature called the short message service centre which enables messages of up to 160 characters to be sent to a GSM handset and displayed on its LCD screen. However, the GSM specification also includes a facility which will eventually allow any terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer - to be plugged directly into the handset. This could bring the GSM phone into more direct competition with the dedicated packet-switched mobile data networks which were licensed in the UK in October 1991. Five 25-year licences were awarded to Cognito, DMC, Hutchison Mobile Data, Motorola and Ram Mobile Data. But of these original licence-holders DMC and Motorola, which has invested heavily in the Ardis data service in the US, a joint venture with IBM, did not take up their licences. Paknet, now owned by Vodafone, was subsequently awarded a mobile licence in addition to its existing fixed data licence. Cognito was closed after the sale of its parent, Dowty Group, last year, but was relaunched last autumn following its acquisition by Sonnaire, a Swiss investment company. Cognito's service provides customers with a mobile two-way text messaging system using a hand-held communicator called a Messenger which has a small screen and keyboard and operates via the group's nationwide data network. Hutchison based its nationwide data network on Motorola's RD-LAP technology, which has proved less successful than Ericsson's rival Mobitex system. It has recently stopped promoting the network, which had no commercial subscribers. However, Ram Mobile Data, a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues, is using the Mobitex system which is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard in Europe in the absence of an official standard from the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is not now expected before 1996 at the earliest. So far, Ericsson has won contracts in connection with seven of the 10 European mobile data licences awarded. Ram has also taken a lead in developing applications software for the mobile data market - seen by many as the key to future growth. Mr John Jarvis, Ram's chief executive in the UK, says the group is encouraging the development of new vertical and horizontal applications, and the migration of existing applications running on private data networks. Already, more than 100 application projects are in trials with Ram. Among the users of Ram network in the UK are the Next retail chain which uses the service to speed up credit card transactions, reduce fraud and improve customer service and DSL, a national maintenance organisation which use the data network to provide field engineers with far more accurate and timely customer details while they are on the road. The system also enables the control staff more accurately to track its engineers and improve the overall management of its fleet. Working with Microsoft, the US software group, Ram has also introduced a personal computer-based electronic mail package which allows new and existing users of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows to send an receive E-mail messages from the field via a Mobitex radio modem without connecting to a telephone line. Even though mobile data has had a sluggish start and suffered a number of significant setbacks, most analysts still expect dramatic growth in the mobile data market over the next five years because, as Insight Research, a New Jersey-based research organisation notes in a recent report, 'the technology solves a real problem: it allows people to transmit and receive information where they find it most convenient.' Insight predicts that advances in digital electronics and battery and display technologies, coupled with liberalised regulatory environments will result in the 1990s in 'a new era in wire-less wide-area communications,' with the total global market for equipment of Dollars 2.4bn in 1993 growing to Dollars 5.3bn in 1998. The US researchers also predict that the world market for wide-area data services will grow from Dollars 3.6bn this year to Dollars 9.2bn in five years' time, a 20.7 per cent compound annual growth rate. Eventual market size estimates vary wildly but Arthur D. Little has identified 3.8m potential users for wire-less data services in the US within the next decade and Booz Allen Hamilton expects the market to be even bigger with between 12m and 15m users by the turn of the century. Meanwhile, PA Consulting has predicted that there will be 2m users of two-way mobile data in the UK by the end of the decade. By then it should be clear which mobile data technologies have matured and survived the inevitable shake-out.</p>

He  stressed: Our propaganda and ideological work calls for arming  our people with scientific theories, guiding them with the  correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and  inspiring them with outstanding works so that new generations of  socialist-minded people who are endowed with lofty ideals, moral  integrity, a sound education, and a strong sense of discipline  can be continuously trained and fostered to provide a powerful  ideological guarantee and to play a supportive role in forming  public opinion in the great cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    Jiang Zemin said: Propaganda and ideological work has a  bearing on the overall situation in our undertaking to build  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all  levels must attach great importance to this task; they must  strengthen their leadership and earnestly shoulder  responsibility in this regard.    The conference was held at the Great Hall of the People this  morning. Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding  Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren  Jianxin, and other comrades attended the meeting, which was  presided over by Ding Guangen.    Jiang Zemin's speech consisted of three parts: first, the  importance of strengthening propaganda and ideological work in  the new period; second, the fundamental principles and main  tasks of propaganda and ideological work; and third, efforts to  strengthen and improve the party's leadership over propaganda  and ideological work.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin said: This national conference on  propaganda and ideological work, which is being held in the  crucial period of building a socialist market economic structure  and of the modernization drive in our country, is a meeting of  overall importance. The main tasks of the meeting are: to  implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress  and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the  party's basic line; and to study and arrange ways and means to  strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological work in  accordance with the principle of "simultaneously and strictly  carrying out two tasks without relaxing efforts to attain either  of them."    Jiang Zemin said: In the current year, the basic policy of  the work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively  implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress,  as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market  economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy; to safeguard political  stability, and promote all- round social progress. The overall  mission of the whole party is to seize the opportunity to deepen  reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development,  and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this  mission of overall importance, submit to and serve this mission,  and do a good job in accomplishing the relevant tasks in all  fields.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: The propaganda and ideological  front is of immense importance. The history of past decades has  shown that be it in revolutionary wars or in socialist  construction, great victories are inseparable from propaganda  and ideological work. This is a basic experience of our party.  Attaching great importance to giving full play to the powerful  role of propaganda and ideological work represents a major  tradition and a major superior feature of our party.    He said: The departments in charge of propaganda and  ideological work shoulder a vital mission. To sum this up, we  may say that this mission is to correctly publicize the party's  theory, line, principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly  the great practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive  factors, to turn all negative factors into positive factors, to  unite all forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish  the magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. He pointed out: The new situation has made  greater demands on the propaganda and ideological front. The  party's theory, line, principles, and policies need to be  publicized more penetratingly and widely so that they can be  understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new  measures taken by the party and the government to push forward  reform must be convincingly explained in simple terms to the  masses. New experiences created by the masses must be summarized  and popularized; outstanding figures and their lofty spirits  emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and propagated. The  masses' increasing demands for spiritual civilization must be  satisfied through all efforts. The multitude of problems  arising in practice must be seriously studied and solved;  ideological conceptual problems pertaining to the readjustment  of interests which crop up in the course of reform must be  redressed and resolved; and the negative tendencies prevailing  in social life must be overcome. Our efforts to push forward  reform and opening to the outside world and the modernization  drive require China to better understand the rest of the world  and the rest of the world to better understand China. All these  facts point to the importance of propaganda and ideological  work. We can accomplish great things as long as we pay greater  attention to various problems, and we must not overlook them in  any way. We must intensify our efforts and must not slacken  them one iota; we must keep on improving and upgrading, and we  must never stand still.    Jiang Zemin said: Comrades on the propaganda and  ideological front have made vigorous efforts and done a  tremendous amount of work. On the basis of investigation and  research and after summarizing our experiences and the new  practices, we have developed a basic idea about carrying out  propaganda and ideological work in the new situation and have  further clarified the basic guidelines and principles, as well  as the primary tasks and work arrangements. Now that the  general policy guiding propaganda and ideological work has been  laid down, the key lies in implementation, in doing our work in  a down-to-earth manner, and in continuing to summarize our  practical experience and to advance in a pioneering spirit.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the  fundamental principle guiding all party work. The propaganda  and ideological front must firmly adhere to this basic guideline  and use it as the guide for all of its work. Only by doing so  can we ensure a correct orientation in propaganda and  ideological work and the successful accomplishment of all our  tasks. All party comrades, especially leading comrades at all  levels and those engaged in propaganda and ideological work,  must earnestly study Comrade Xiaoping's works, further enhance  their consciousness and determination in carrying out propaganda  and ideological work, and strive to use what they have learned  in practical work.    He said: The propaganda and ideological front is an extended  front shouldering arduous tasks. It must uphold the ideological  line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts,  earnestly carry out its work in all fields by focusing on the  central task of economic construction, and actively push forward  the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization.  At present and for some time to come, we must pay special  attention to the work in four respects. First, the most  important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm  the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Party committees at all levels must earnestly organize and  guide party members and cadres to study this theory. While  continuing to successfully hold seminars for principal leaders  at the provincial and ministerial level, we will train within  two to three years, by groups and in stages, all cadres with  party membership at and above the county and regimental level.  We must make full use of the press, radio, television,  publications, and other media to publicize this theory  thoroughly. We must bring into play in studying this theory the  backbone role of the five research centers established by the  Central Party School, the State Education Commission, the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the People's Liberation Army  National Defense University, and the Shanghai Academy of Social  Sciences. Second, we must persist in implementing the party's  basic line and in properly guiding public opinion. Persisting  in properly guiding public opinion means creating a type of  public opinion conducive to further reform and opening up and to  the establishment of a socialist market economy and the  development of social productive forces. It means creating a  kind of public opinion that helps strengthen the building of  socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal  system; that encourages and inspires people to make arduous  efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity,  people's well-being, and social progress; that helps people  distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and  beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; that promotes  national reunification and unity; and that helps to bring peace  of mind to the people and social and political stability.  Third, we must strengthen ideological work to bring up a new  generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with  lofty ideals and moral integrity. We must strengthen  ideological and ethical education centering on patriotism,  collectivism, and socialism; carry out education in the spirit  of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building  the country through thrift and diligence; and carry out  education on professional and social ethics and on national  conditions. We must do a good job of mass ideological work.  Fourth, we must adhere to the course of serving the people and  socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers  blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, foster the  main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and  art. Upholding the principles of serving the people and  socialism and letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred  schools of thought contend are basic requirements for producing  spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of  propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme  and advocating diversification reflect in a concrete way the  orientation of serving the people and socialism and the  principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred  schools of thought contend. Fostering the main theme means,  under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line,  vigorously advocating ideas and spirits conducive to fostering  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conducive to reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization; conducive to national  unity, social progress, and the people's well-being; and  conducive to seeking a happy life through honest labor.    Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In the course of  carrying out propaganda and cultural work and promoting  socialist spiritual civilization, it is necessary to give  priority to social benefit [she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400  4135]. Under this basic precondition, we must integrate  economic returns with social benefit. It is important that we  build spiritual civilization and strengthen its management.    In discussing strengthening and exercising effective party  leadership over propaganda and ideological work, Jiang Zemin  said: We must solemnly place the question of giving equal  emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both before the whole  party; we must place this question high on the agenda of party  committees at all levels. We should make it clear that the  responsibility for a region's or department's propaganda and  ideological work and progress in promoting spiritual  civilization lies primarily with its party committee. Party  committees at all levels, and their principal officials in  particular, must conduct in-depth research and investigation,  sum up experience, and improve propaganda and ideological work.    Jiang Zemin said: Building a contingent of cadres who are  upright, well versed in policy, and professionally competent to  implement propaganda and ideological work. The key to  strengthening the building of this contingent of cadres lies in  successfully building its leading body. Party committees at all  levels should demonstrate concern for such a contingent in terms  of politics, ideology, operations, and material benefits and do  a good job in building such a contingent. We must  conscientiously implement the policy of respecting knowledge and  talent, bring into full play the intelligence and wisdom of the  vast number of intellectuals on this front, and do our best to  bring up in force experts in all fields who will make an impact  at home or even internationally. As for those making  outstanding contributions, we especially care for and treasure  them.    He said: We must treat comrades on this front with  understanding and support. We should passionately help them sum  up experience and encourage them to go down to the grass-roots  levels, to go deep among the masses, and to go into the  realities of life so that they can draw nourishment from the  creative and history-making activities of the masses to  replenish and improve themselves.    Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: There is a large collection  of men of talent on the propaganda and ideological front. The  vast number of comrades on the propaganda and ideological front  are loyal to the cause of the party and the people. The Central  Committee trusts them and the party and people have high  expectations of them. It is hoped that all of us will, under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make the  country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy, and  make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work to  new heights.    Present at the conference were responsible comrades and  propaganda department directors of party committees of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government, and responsible comrades in charge of  propaganda and ideological work from the various central  departments and committees.    Also present at the conference were comrades attending the  working conference of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of  Radio, Film, and Television; the State Council Information  Office, the State Press and Publications Administration, the  General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army,  and RENMIN RIBAO, the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, and other departments  and units.</p>

While certain politicians described it as sad  development for democracy, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called it  running away from the elections.    This is how the politicians assessed the DEP's withdrawal  from the political arena so close to the elections and when it  had fielded its candidates all over Turkey:    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: I was expecting such a  decision. This is running away. I always said that the  elections will be held in a secure atmosphere. Everyone will  vote freely for whomever he wants. This is what they feared  most.    CHP [Republican People's Party] leader Deniz Baykal said: I  hope that this decision will not turn into a protest, for then a  difficult situation will arise. The DEP should reconsider its  decision.    Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: This is cowardice. It  was impossible for them to win in the elections. They were  looking for a pretext not to take part in the elections.    Nihat (Marka), deputy leader of SHP [Social Democrat  Populist  Party] parliamentary group, said: They should have run in the  elections for the sake of democracy. From the viewpoint of  democracy, this decision is deplorable.    Sevket Kazan, deputy leader of the RP [Welfare Party]  parliamentary group, said: The DEP made this decision fearing  that it will not be able to win the elections. It had lost its  hope on the elections.</p>

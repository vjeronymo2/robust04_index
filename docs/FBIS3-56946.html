The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday  that "certain positive shifts have been registered in Iraqi  approach to fulfilment of decisions of the UN Security Council.  This mostly concerns disarmament aspects which is acknowledged  by the world community and was reflected in the latest document  of the special commission on Iraqi disarmament".    Russia actively supports the idea of establishing a deadline  for Iraq before which the efficiency of the system of control  can be proved, as well as the honesty of Iraqis in fulfilling  their pledges.    "In case after the deadline expires, and it should not last  for more than six months, it is confirmed that Iraq honestly and  fully implements the disarmament aspects of the Security Council  resolutions 687 and 715, Russia will be ready to consider the  issue of lifting the oil embargo according to item 22 of  resolution 687", the document said.    Russia resolutely and invariably stands for the fulfilment  by  Iraq of all other resolutions of the Security Council on the  post-crisis settlemenmt in the Persian Gulf, including the  resolution 833 on the demarcation of Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Only  in this case can the issue of lifting all other sanctions  imposed by Security Council against Iraq can be raised, the  statement said.    The Russian position strictly corresponds to the terms and  criteria fixed by decisions of the UN Security Council, it added.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Weighed down with debtors - Banks have no easy remedy for bad lending The Pounds 780m provisions against UK property and construction losses that Barclays announced yesterday is a reminder, if one were needed, of the scale of the banks' property lending problems. As the largest lender to UK property, Barclays has suffered the severest damage from bad property loans. But with a total of Pounds 38bn of outstanding loans to the UK property sector, few banks have escaped heavy write-downs. The question of how the banking industry deals with property companies that cannot repay their debts is of paramount importance to the property industry. In the past year, there have been many high profile receiverships or administrations, such as Rosehaugh, Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. But the failures are eclipsed by the much larger number of companies that banks are attempting to keep afloat. Banks have been increasingly reluctant to put companies into receivership, the exceptions usually being cases where the banks have lost patience with the management. The reluctance partly stems from a fear that property in receivership plummets in value. However a company that needs cash to stay afloat may sell more cheaply than a receiver. Faith in the powers of receivers has been dwindling. 'Receivership is only helpful to the accountants. It does not maximise values,' says Mr Richard Millward of Kleinwort Benson's asset recovery unit, which is marketing its services to other banks with too few staff to cope with problem loans. Receivers are also accused of being slow and expensive and of knowing little about property. Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young defends his profession. 'If there is no market for property then no insolvency procedure will do anything for it,' he says. Receivers can improve prospects, he says. He cites Butlers Wharf, Sir Terence Conran's mixed development on the banks of the Thames which went into receivership in 1990, as an example of what can be done. 'When we came here, there was a feeling of dereliction,' he says. In the past two years, Ernst &amp; Young has sold most of the residential apartments in the Cardamon Buildings and has sold the freehold of the Butlers Wharf buildings to a Danish pension fund for more than Pounds 20m. Even the delays in taking decisions are not the fault of receivers, says Hamilton. The problems stem from getting a large banking syndicate of maybe 20 or 30 banks to take decisions. The presence of large banking syndicates is one reason why this property recession is harder to deal with than that of the 1970s. But the main reason is the scale of the problem. The total debt to the property industry is, in real terms, three times that of 1974. Moreover, the work-out will not be aided by the surge in inflation which assisted during the 1970s or by investment from the institutions, which used to be enthusiastic buyers of property. This time, demand for property is weak. The banks' loans to property companies fell by 4.2 per cent last year, but the rate of decline slowed by the end of the year, reflecting the limited appetite for property from investors and the capital markets. The absence of any obvious answers to the banks' problems has prompted calls for innovation. Debt-for-equity swaps, debt trading and securitisation are all under consideration. The most common of these is debt-for-equity swaps, whereby a bank takes an equity stake in a company that cannot repay its debt. The principle was taken to its logical conclusion when Barclays took on the beneficial ownership of Imry at the end of last year (on which it yesterday took a Pounds 240m provision) and when Citibank took over Randsworth Trust earlier this week. These deals were unusual because the banks were the sole lenders to the companies; and they are unlikely to herald a trend, since UK banks are unwilling to take on the responsibility and potential liabilities of owning companies. Secondary trading of debt evolved in connection with the third world. The trading of debt in companies such as Brent Walker, Mountleigh and Heron is considered by lenders which may prefer a short-term loss to being locked in for several years. The Bank of England has expressed disquiet. 'In the majority of workout situations, debt sales will impede progress,' said Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, last year. 'It is not in keeping with London Approach, namely that banks should be supportive of a company which has announced that it is in financial difficulty.' Securitisation is a way of increasing the property market's liquidity by repackaging property so that it appeals to the capital markets. It has been used several times in the UK, most recently when Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments raised Pounds 100m in the US commercial paper market to refinance a building in its Broadgate office complex in the City of London. Securitisation is likely to be feasible only with well-let properties, which are the kind of buildings that are most likely to find buyers anyway. None of these innovations is a panacea. There will be no easy solutions to the problems that excessive property lending has brought the banks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES IN PROPERTY VALUES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Retail                 Office                       Year to   Month of     Year to   Month of                        Jan 92    Jan 92       Jan 92    Jan 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -3.3     -0.3        -17.7      -1.8 Capital growth           -3.1     -0.4        -14.3      -1.0 Total return              4.5      0.3         -6.1      -0.1 Current yield levels      9.0                  10.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Industrial                 All                       Year to   Month of     Year to   Month of                        Jan 92    Jan 92       Jan 92    Jan 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth            -9.7     -0.6        -10.1      -0.9 Capital growth           -9.0     -0.3         -8.5      -0.6 Total return              0.3      0.5         -0.2       0.2 Current yield levels     11.4                  10.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD monthly index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

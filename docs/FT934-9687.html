			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (15): Rules of the frequent flyers' game - The points are an important weapon in the airlines' armoury THERE ARE so many frequent flyer programmes (FFPs) on offer to the airline passenger that it is easy to get the impression that carriers are falling over themselves to give away free flights in an effort to drum up business. In practice, some airlines are more generous than others and how much you gain from buying a ticket will also depend on where you live and what time of year it is. An address in the US will confer more points-earning power than one in Europe or Asia. A US resident can earn rewards from frequent flyer schemes on just about any ticket, even at deeply discounted prices. The rest of the world usually has to buy a full-price ticket to benefit. A BA passenger living in the US who buys a discounted economy fare ticket from San Francisco to London, for example, will earn FFP points. The buyer of the same-priced ticket bought by a UK resident flying from London to San Francisco will not. The reason for the discrepancy lies in the history and evolution of FFPs. They were born and raised in the US during the 1980s as a means of creating and maintaining loyalty to a single airline or group of airlines. The principle is that the buyer of a ticket earns points which can be accumulated and eventually exchanged for free flights or other benefits. Over the last decade, airlines have joined forces with other companies in the travel industry and points can now be earned by staying in hotels, using car rental firms, and buying things with certain credit cards. The awards can include upgrades to business or first class on aircraft, holiday weekends and even hot-air balloon trips. The scope of FFPs has been extended to help airlines fill aircraft at slack times. For most of the 1980s, airlines outside the US watched the growth of FFPs with a mixture of disdain and fear. There was disdain because they seemed to be a fad unconnected with service quality and more associated with savings-stamp schemes once used to persuade motorists to buy petrol. But there was also fear because the US airlines were both demonstrating the effectiveness of the schemes and racking up huge liabilities in flights owed to passengers. When, in the 1990s, European and Asian carriers were finally forced into the game, they changed the rules to limit the give-aways: hence the variety of schemes under which tickets can earn points. Logic, as well as fear, prompted the rule changes. The goal for any airline is to attract the regular business passenger, not the penny- pinching leisure traveller who flies once a year. FFPs have shown themselves to be effective in capturing business traffic. This month's survey by Official Airline Guides of European business travellers shows that 70 per cent said that, given a choice of carriers on a route, they would choose the one to which their FFP belonged. UK residents were the most swayed, with 74 per cent saying it would determine their choice. But the leisure traveller is at least as much swayed by simple price discounting, argue the airlines. 'It is not commercially viable to offer miles on the low cost fares. It is not worth doing it if it can possibly be avoided,' says Ms Sue Moore, BA's general manager, relationship marketing. Cut-throat competition pushed US carriers into using FFPs to compete even for discount ticket sales and BA has reluctantly joined in for the US market. Late arrivals in the FFP business such as BA, Air France and Lufthansa have also improved on the US experience by imposing deadlines for the time by which accumulated points must be cashed in. This once again favours frequent travellers, who fly often enough to earn free flights quickly. By targeting the FFPs at regular business customers, the airlines have generated some useful spin-offs. Members of FFPs have their flying habits tracked. The more a passenger spends with a particular airline, the more the passenger is likely to be the target of marketing drives and market research. British Airways, for example, has four levels of frequent flyer membership. New recruits are at the blue level, with a few benefits such as priority on a waiting list for overbooked aircraft. The next two levels are silver and gold, which provide higher waiting list priorities, access to executive lounges and free travel insurance, for example. At the top is a select group of about 1,000 holders of a blue-grey card who include BA's most important cus- tomers: chairmen, chief executives and finance direc- tors responsible for spending at least Pounds 1m a year with BA. They have all the benefits of a gold-tier member plus the option of being met at airports and personally ushered through the airport. Customer service staff single them out for individual attention. The FFP is now one of the most important weapons in the airlines' armoury. There are tens of millions of FFP members in the US alone. Those numbers seem destined to grow further and rapidly over the next few years as European and Asian carriers join in. If FFPs are a fad, it will be a long time before they are seen as passe.</p>

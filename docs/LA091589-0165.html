			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> FILIPINO JUSTICES UPHOLD MARCOS BAR  </P> <P> The Philippine Supreme Court today narrowly upheld a government decision  barring former President Ferdinand E. Marcos from returning to the Philippines.  </P> <P> It voted 8 to 7 to dismiss a petition by the deposed ruler seeking to return  home.  </P> <P> "(President Corazon Aquino) did not act arbitrarily or with grave abuse of  discretion in determining that the return of Marcos and his family . . . poses  a serious threat to national interest and welfare," the court said.  </P> <P> Marcos, 72, overthrown in February, 1986, and now in critical condition in a  Honolulu hospital, has repeatedly asked Aquino to let him come home to die.  Aquino has barred his return, dead or alive, for security reasons.  </P></p>

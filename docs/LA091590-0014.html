			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS FACE 28 INITIATIVES IN NOVEMBER  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian is running around the state pitching his pet project of  putting prison inmates to work in outside industry. He says it's a great way to  make prisoners productive and also would help in their rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Don't be fooled.  </P> <P> What the Deukmejian proposal (Prop. 139) would really do is put felons in  direct, unfair competition with the regular work force. Employers would be  favorably disposed to hire them because of the tax incentives included in this  measure, not to mention the advantages of having a cheap, submissive labor  pool.  </P> <P> There's no evidence that this program would save taxpayers a dime. In fact,  administration and enforcement of the law could be very costly, because each of  California's 58 counties would be free to devise its own set of rules for using  and supervising inmate labor. Prisoners would be exploited and workers who  haven't committed a crime would be severely penalized if this amendment were  adopted.  </P> <P> THOMAS J. VANDEVELD, President  </P> <P> United Food &amp; Commercial Workers  </P> <P> Union, Local 135, San Diego  </P></p>

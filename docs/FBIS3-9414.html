			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Mar. 24, IRNA -- The gratuitous arrest of  over 400 Muslims and the widespread use of torture in the  Sandzak region of the former Yugoslavia is a source of grave  concern, the Humanitarian Law Fund said in Belgrade Wednesday.    At a press conference in Belgrade, Chairwoman Natasha  Kandich  urged that all allegations of inhuman behaviour be impartially  investigated by parliamentary bodies, and members of the police  found responsible sent before the courts.    In particular, the responsibility of members of an  investigatory commission of the Serbian Ministry of Internal  Affairs should be established for their participation in a  cover-up of police misconduct, fund representatives said.    The situation in the Sandzak, a region covering parts of  Serbia and Montenegro, is now dangerously similar to that in  Kosovo, where almost 2 million Kosovo Albanians live in severe  repression by the Serbian authorities, Kandich said.    The main difference is that Albanian Muslims frequently die  in prison, whereas no deaths in detention have as yet taken  place in the Sandzak, she added.    Between January 27 and February 22, the discriminatory  arrest  of members of the Party for Democratic Action (SDA), which  rallies Muslims was carried out by the Serbian-Montenegrin  authorities.    Investigating individual cases of brutality, the fund  established that torture of Muslims is systematically applied,  in contravention of the constitution and international covenants.    Detainees were forced to testify against themselves by  beatings, sometimes with heavy metal bars, electric shocks,  beating on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, the use  of truncheons on the testicles, strangulation, strong light and  deprivation of food and water.    Police make no effort to hide their Serbian extremist  allegiance, Kandich said, and threaten prisoners with the names  of Serbian terrorists such as Vladislav Seselj and Arkan, a  well-known criminal. Both names are linked to atrocities  against the non-Serb populations in Croatia and Bosnia.    Some of the prisoners were blind-folded and taken to places  in Bosnia, the fund stated. Prisoners were kept in excess of  the 72 hour legal limit and their families were not informed of  their whereabouts.    The arrested were charged with illegal possession of arms,  but charges were exaggerated in order to point to a conspiracy  to secede from Serbia Montenegro, lawyers said. The true  reason, in the fund's opinion, is twofold: One, to prevent the  functioning of a legal political party (the SDA) and secondly to  terrorize the Muslim population in order to carry out "ethnic  cleansing" of the region.    No action has been taken against Serbs, Montenegrins or  other  nationalities in the area, who openly boast of being armed,  representatives said.    According to the fund, most of the arms were acquired in a  wave of fear in 1991 when war broke out between Croats and  Serbs. "The only difference," a spokesman said, "is that Serbs  acquire their weapons from their army in Bosnia, while Muslims  buy them."    The present trial of 25 Muslims in Novi Pazar is a rigged  political process, representatives said, where all legal rights  of defence have been set aside. Admissions extracted under  torture are being used in evidence against them, while the  accused have already been condemned in the press without trial.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / City watchdog will review trading rules THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, is to look into the way professionals in the securities industry trade to see if tougher rules are needed to prevent market manipulation. The SIB said yesterday that Mr Jonathan Agnew, former chief executive at Kleinwort Benson, is to act as a temporary adviser heading the review of wholesale market regulation. The SIB also announced the departure of two of its longest-serving officials, Ms Colette Bowe and Mr Martin Vile, as part of an internal shake-up by Mr Andrew Large, chairman, aimed at tightening controls over the self-regulatory bodies which it oversees. The SIB is searching for a head of a newly formed securities division and has established three other divisions; enforcement, policy and legal affairs and operations. Under the new structure, the roles of the heads of the retail and wholesale market supervision were abolished. Ms Bowe and Mr Vile, who headed those divisions respectively, 'will be making a career change'. Aside from activities such as insider dealing, current regulations are vague on the trading practices which are genuinely manipulative. Businesses can manipulate the market by selling blocks of shares ahead of flotation to drive share prices down and then buy these more cheaply. The absence of guidance led recently to a well-publicised row over the government's auction of the third British Telecom stake. Mr Large, in his review released in May, targeted the development of derivative products and their increasing integration with cash markets as a matter which might need further regulatory review. A derivative is effectively a futures contract to sell or deliver a future share at an agreed price. In particular, the SIB has been concerned about whether all market users get to see the price at which a security was last traded in order to ensure that the price of derivatives accurately reflects the underlying price of securities.</p>

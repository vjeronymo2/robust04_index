			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Disruption on way out of Italy - Travel Advice Italian air traffic controllers are expected to strike today and tomorrow for a couple of hours early each morning. Flights leaving Italy are likely to be disrupted before midday, but airlines expect few delays for in-coming journeys. BELGIUM: Difficulties caused by the general strike last week, which involved air traffic controllers, have now been solved. Flights of TAT, British Airways' French regional carrier, are expected to be back to normal following last week's delays caused by pilots' union meetings. NIGERIA: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says the political situation remains uncertain. There is a high incidence of street crime and armed robberies, especially in Lagos and southern states. Travelling outside cities after dark is unsafe. El SALVADOR: Although the civil war has ended, there is still lawlessness. Many victims are being murdered in the course of robberies, especially where they resist. Travel after dark should be avoided. Outbreaks of cholera occur periodically. Travellers are advised to contact the British Embassy (98-1763, 98-1769 or 98-1455) for the latest news. CHINA: China remains generally a safe place, but muggings in the main cities and sexual harassment are increasing. Visitors should guard their money and valuables in public areas. Women travelling alone should be careful. Our limited representation and the poor local communications make it hard to guarantee quick help for citizens in difficulty outside Beijing (especially in Tibet). Those travelling outside Beijing should make a note of the full address, telephone and telex numbers of the British Embassy, Beijing, and the British Consulate General, Shanghai. MONGOLIA: Visitors travelling through or to Mongolia must have a valid visa and register with the police authorities after their arrival. Street crime is rising. Visitors should remain vigilant and not travel alone off the main streets of any town. Wherever possible use regular taxis. Domestic flight schedules are uncertain because of shortages of aviation fuel and a lack of advance booking facilities. There are also doubts as to aircraft safety because of poor servicing.

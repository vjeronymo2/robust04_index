			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Another explosion has rocked the Western Transvaal,  this time on a farm belonging to a white member of the ANC  [African National Congress], Mr. Jan Serfontein. An explosive  device ripped a hole in the wall on Mr. Serfontein's farm,  Boskop, near Potchefstroom. Explosions occur almost daily in  the area and so far the police have not made a breakthrough.  The police have not yet revealed the type of explosives  involved.    The ANC, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and  other trade unions which have suffered damage because of the  explosions believe commercial explosives are being used. COSATU  said earlier that the police should do more to protect its  offices and catch the extremists. COSATU is to ask the  Transitional Executive Council Subcouncil on Law and Order to  give urgent attention to the matter.</p>

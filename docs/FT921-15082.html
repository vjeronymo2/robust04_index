			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (17): Arms cuts intensify the difficulties - Defence / The process of concentration has become becalmed OPTIMISTS can still be found in the defence industry but they are having a hard job convincing investors. Restructuring was already under way in the European defence sector by the time the Berlin Wall was breached two years ago. It had become apparent that national defence spending was becoming tighter, that there were in many areas too many companies competing for a decreasing number of contracts, and that even the bigger ones were ill-equipped to compete with US rivals unless they pooled efforts to develop new weapons and systems. But if difficulties were anticipated, they descended on defence companies much faster than anyone could have expected. The ending of the Cold War, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the erosion of Soviet military power have provoked a rush of military expenditure cuts by governments throughout western Europe, outstripping the pace of negotiated arms reductions. Equipment purchases are being reduced or cut short and some projects abandoned. The remaining growth markets for exports, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, are increasingly competitive. The process of concentration that was already under way in the industry  - aimed to secure markets and cover the spiralling cost of remaining in high-technology military sectors - should logically have accelerated. Instead it has become becalmed. So sharp has the setback to the business been that there are few willing buyers for defence businesses. All this is not immediately transparent from changes that have taken place in the FT500 listings. Defence cuts affect a wide range of companies, most of which carry out the bulk of their activities in other sectors. The single exception to this in this year's FT500 is Thomson-CSF of France, which has 80 per cent of its turnover in defence. But then, only that quoted company is listed, rather than the state-owned Thomson group, its majority shareholder. Many companies have been trying to reduce their reliance on military sales. The Netherlands-based Philips group has almost withdrawn from defence, selling the bulk of its military interests to Thomson-CSF in early 1990. Racal and Thorn EMI of the UK both tried to sell their defence activities without finding a buyer willing to meet their price. Thorn went on to take over Philips's British subsidiary MEL and then to sell MEL's communications division to Thomson-CSF. At the other end of the spectrum from Philips, Thomson-CSF is resigned to staying in defence, even if the business declines. 'Lower sales are not really a cause for concern,' Mr Alain Gomez, its chairman, said recently. 'What counts isn't so much market size as market share.' He believes that defence activity will pick up by 1995 and that by then 'there will have been a shake-out in terms of competition.' Conversion into civilian sectors is no easy proposition for defence companies, although groups such as GEC are trying to build on the non-military applications that have already been found for defence-related technologies such as microwave systems. Aerospace companies were counting on growth in the civil aviation market to reduce their dependence on defence, but were hit by the fall in airline activity at the time of the Gulf crisis. British Aerospace's recent troubles stemmed from difficulties in its civilian activities rather than in defence, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of sales. It slipped from 210 to 266 in the FT500. Daimler-Benz's subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace - formed in 1989 to include the airframe company MBB - has a similar reliance on defence, expected to take up 46 per cent of sales this year. But it aims to reduce the figure to 25 per cent by 2000. The concentration of German defence interests under Daimler-Benz is the most pronounced example of a European trend over the past four years. Takeovers and mergers have taken place principally within national borders. These include GEC's absorption of Plessey's naval and avionics activities and a large part of Ferranti International, and the pooling of avionics businesses between Thomson-CSF and France's state-owned Aerospatiale . There have been some cross-border initiatives such as the step-by-step creation of a Franco-German helicopter company, Eurocopter, between Aerospatiale and MBB. On the other hand, an ambitious joint missile venture between Thomson-CSF and British Aerospace failed to materialise. The industry remains fragmented along national lines. Up to now defence supplies have fallen outside the scope of European Community rules. Although international competition in the main European markets has increased, it principally affects components rather than whole weapon systems such as tanks or warships. The number of defence contractors in the FT500 has shrunk. Several companies have dropped out, including Saab-Scania (taken back into private ownership) and Nobel Industries of Sweden, Matra of France, the Swiss armaments company Oerlikon-Buehrle, the German frigate maker Bremer Vulkan, Dowty of the UK and the Anglo-French software group Sema, which has placed its defence interests in a joint venture with BAe. Twenty companies remain in this year's FT500 with significant involvement in defence. But only three have made marked improvements in their rankings by stock market value: Thomson-CSF, moving from 209th to 164th, the avionics producer Smiths Industries (up to 342 from 401), and - a company with more of a tradition than current activity in defence - Hawker Siddeley, recently prey to a takeover by BTR. Alcatel Alsthom, another group with only marginal defence interests, GEC and Thorn EMI have moved up a few places. The other 14 have all slipped. These include Daimler-Benz, Siemens (which bolstered its defence side by buying parts of Plessey). Fiat, Ericsson, Philips, Mannesmann (which controls the German tank maker Krauss-Maffei) and Thyssen. British defence suppliers that have dropped in the rankings are Rolls-Royce, Pilkington (which has sold a half stake in its military electro-optical activities to Thomson-CSF), British Aerospace, Lucas, GKN, Smiths Industries, Racal and Vickers. To what extent any of these changes are a reflection of companies' defence prospects is hard to know. But there are certainly no defence contractors among the new entrants to the list.</p>

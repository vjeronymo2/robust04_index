			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO LEADERS TAKE CONTROL OF FOUNDATION  </P> <P> Leaders of the nation's largest and oldest Latino civil rights organization  wrested control of its charitable foundation from the foundation's board of  directors Friday in a continuing dispute over a failure to account for as much  as $88,000 in donations.  </P> <P> "This should be a lesson to all of us that we shouldn't be so loose with public  money and the public trust," said Ruben Sandoval, special legal counsel to the  president of the 140,000-member  </P> <P> "A lot of those checks were payable to cash," Sandoval said. "We have no idea  where the damn money went."  </P> <P> By a vote of 14 to 10, LULAC's national executive board ratified a slate of  seven members that will operate a new charitable foundation intended to take  the place of the existing LULAC Foundation. The vote came on the first day of a  two-day national board meeting at a Capitol Hill hotel.  </P> <P> Eduardo Morga of Huntington Beach, a past president of LULAC who heads the old  foundation's 10-member board, suggested that his group may fight the plan to  create a new foundation.  </P> <P> "Our position is that the (general membership) is the only body that can undo  the present foundation," Morga said after the vote.  </P> <P> Later, however, Morga said the boards of the old and new foundations may  negotiate a compromise, in which some of the old board members would be seated  on the new board.  </P> <P> The old board is composed entirely of past presidents of the organization,  which is based in San Antonio, and includes three Californians: Morga, Hector  G. Godinez of Santa Ana and Mario Obledo of Sacramento.  </P> <P> "I just feel very satisfied with the outcome of this," said Jose Garcia De  Lara, president of LULAC for 15 months. "I think we're on a trajectory of  resolution."  </P> <P> The controversy over the unaccounted-for funds, which Sandoval said passed  through a secret bank account controlled by former LULAC President Oscar Moran,  deeply split the Latino group. During a day of acrimonious debate, members  loudly traded charges and countercharges in a meeting that was closed to the  public.  </P> <P> Moran, who has served on the foundation's board for the last year, has denied  that any of the money was improperly used.  </P> <P> "Where the money went was for normal LULAC operations," Moran said in an  interview after the vote. "It was a contingency account . . . a rainy-day  account."  </P> <P> Although the account was opened in August, 1985, when Moran became LULAC  president, its existence was not discovered by LULAC's executive board until  last March, Sandoval said.  </P> <P> He said Moran had control of the account at Plaza National Bank in San Antonio  during his presidency and maintained it when he left office and joined the  board of the charitable foundation.  </P> <P> Sandoval said about $88,000 passed through the account, which currently has a  balance of $179. The money came almost exclusively from corporate benefactors.  Some of the money was intended for the charitable foundation, while the rest  was to support regular LULAC activities, Sandoval said.  </P> <P> He charged that foundation members failed to investigate what happened to the  foundation money when they were told of the existence of the account last  spring.  </P> <P> De Lara also said in a public meeting last month that the Internal Revenue  Service has launched a criminal investigation of the matter. Morga and Godinez,  however, said they have not been contacted by any investigators. An IRS  spokesman in Los Angeles, Robert Giannangeli, said the agency cannot confirm or  deny any investigation in progress.  </P> <P> At stake, both sides agree, is the credibility and political strength of an  organization that was founded in 1929 and now claims 140,000 members across the  nation. They said the victims of the battle will be those who rely on LULAC's  charitable services.  </P> <P> Moran, Morga and other members of the old foundation board have strongly  rejected allegations of impropriety, saying that De Lara and his officers are  pursuing a personal campaign to silence their critics. They complained that De  Lara is operating outside of LULAC's established procedures.  </P> <P> "These people are bent on usurping 60 years of LULAC history . . . for  political reasons and reasons of vendetta," Morga said in an earlier interview.  "The hate is there. These people really don't know how to behave in terms of  the LULAC constitution and they really don't care."  </P> <P> "The LULAC organization is the one that has the problems, and not the  foundation," Godinez said in an earlier interview.  </P> <P> De Lara, Godinez added, "ought to take care of his own dirty linen on his own  side of the house."  </P> <P> Godinez, president of LULAC in 1960-61, is a prominent Republican activist in  Orange County and manager of the U.S. Postal Service office in Santa Ana. Morga  was LULAC president in 1977-78 and is a financial consultant in Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> Obledo, who declined to comment to The Times, was California's secretary of  health and welfare under Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> Other foundation members who were asked to resign are Manuel Gonzalez of Waco,  Tex.; Oscar Laurel of Laredo, Tex.; Ed Pena of Washington; Roberto Ornelas of  Dallas; Pete Villa of Seattle and Paul Garza of Laredo.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION FIGHT RETAINS ITS HEAT ;  </P> <P> TEMPERS ARE STILL FLARING AS THE DISPUTE OVER A 1987 INGLEWOOD CONTEST MARKED  BY CHARGES OF VOTING INTIMIDATION REACHES THE COURT OF APPEAL  </P> <P> During an hourlong hearing before a state appellate panel this week, opposing  lawyers painted vastly different pictures of the 1987 election of Inglewood  Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas and its subsequent annulment by a Superior Court  judge.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Thomas and the city depicted Judge Leon Savitch's decision to  throw out 31 votes for Thomas and hold a new election as a travesty that denied  the city due process and will lead to a wave of frivolous, expensive election  lawsuits.  </P> <P> "We don't care who is the councilman," said Edward Lascher, an appellate  specialist representing the city. "We do care, to the ultimate extent possible,  that the electing goes on in the ballot box, including the absentee ballot box,  and not the courtroom. The voters of Inglewood are being punished for  irregularities, blunders and human shortcomings in some of their voting."  </P> <P> Mark Borenstein, who is representing Thomas' opponent Garland Hardeman, tore  into the notion that Judge Savitch's decision in October, 1987, was based on  technicalities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Essence of the Process'  </P> <P> He said: "Is it a mere technicality when the court believes that five people  did not live in the district? Is it a mere technicality when the court finds  that numerous voters did not cast their own votes or sign their own absentee  ballot applications? These cases go to the essence of the electoral process."  </P> <P> The hearing had more heat than substance, since the three-judge panel of the  state Court of Appeal will decide largely on the basis of filed written  arguments. And the justices asked only two questions, making it hard to gauge  their reaction to the complex case that has left a cloud over the Inglewood  City Council for 20 months.  </P> <P> But the questions that the panel did ask addressed one of the most explosive  issues of the case: Savitch's ruling that Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent was  involved in intimidation of voters and other Election Code violations during an  aggressive absentee ballot drive by the Thomas campaign.  </P> <P> Vincent energetically backed Thomas, a merchandising analyst for 7-Up, against  Hardeman, a Los Angeles police officer.  </P> <P> Judge Savitch threw out a total of 58 votes, most of them absentee ballots,  because of testimony that relatives or campaign workers punched ballots for  voters, some of whom were not present; that voters -- including Thomas' three  adult stepchildren and two voters who gave their address as Thomas campaign  headquarters -- did not live in the district, and that some absentee ballots  were not delivered by the voter.  </P> <P> Savitch found that 31 of the votes had been for Thomas, and that the  beneficiary of other 27 invalid ballots was inconclusive.  </P> <P> Thomas remains on the council pending appeal. Hardeman also appealed the  decision, saying that instead of holding a new election, he should be declared  the winner because the ruling left him with 16 more votes than Thomas.  </P> <P> Some of the most dramatic testimony during the trial concerned four votes that  Savitch declared illegal on the grounds of intimidation and invasion of voter's  ballot secrecy. Witnesses testified that Mayor Vincent solicited those votes at  voters' homes. He has denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> That testimony came to the forefront at Tuesday's appellate hearing when  Justice Ronald George interrupted Lascher to question his description of  various irregularities as essentially "harmless." George cited witnesses who  said they had been rushed or pressured into voting by campaign workers,  including the case of Nancy Armstrong, whose vote was thrown out along with the  vote of her daughter Pamela.  </P> <P> The Armstrongs testified that Mayor Vincent came to their home and punched  their absentee ballots. Savitch later threw out those votes on the grounds that  the voters were intimidated and their ballot secrecy violated.  </P> <P> "There are a number of things that are somewhat bothersome," Justice George  said. "(Nancy Armstrong) said he abridged her rights because she didn't have  time to study the literature. Doesn't that go beyond hurrying the voter?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evidence Disputed  </P> <P> Lascher responded that evidence in this and other cases was not conclusive and  that Savitch based his ruling on "assumption after assumption" by Hardeman's  lawyers.  </P> <P> In an interview afterward, Lascher said of the Armstrong case: "That wasn't a  great vote. But are we after perfection?"  </P> <P> Lascher also told the court that evidence did not show voters would have voted  differently if their absentee ballots had not been solicited by the Thomas  campaign.  </P> <P> In his response, Borenstein argued that the voter's intent is irrelevant if the  vote is cast illegally. He cited cases in which relatives cast ballots for  absent voters.  </P> <P> "You can't walk into a polling place and say, 'Hey, I want to vote for my wife,  she said it was OK,' " Borenstein said.  </P> <P> The lawyers also clashed over whether Savitch allowed the city enough time and  information to prepare its case during the hectic trial. In such proceedings  many normal rules governing the hearing of civil lawsuits are suspended because  of the need to resolve the case quickly.  </P> <P> Thomas' attorney Robert Stroud alleged that Hardeman's attorneys, with  Savitch's approval, did not specify which votes they were challenging until the  trial.  </P> <P> Borenstein said the other side received the information required by law.  </P> <P> Borenstein and Lascher also differ on the 27 ballots that Savitch said were  illegal but could not be subtracted from either candidate's total because it  was unclear who they were for.  </P> <P> Borenstein said precedents indicate the court should subtract those illegal  ballots in proportion to the number of absentee ballots received by each  candidate. That method would give Hardeman the victory, since he received only  65 absentee votes to Thomas 395.  </P> <P> Lascher disputes the existence of such precedents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Election at Issue  </P> <P> Another issue the justices will consider is Savitch's decision to order an  election rather than declare Hardeman the winner.  </P> <P> Hardeman's attorneys cite Election Code Section 20087, which states: "If in any  election contest it appears that another person than the defendant has the  higher number of legal votes, the court shall declare that person elected."  They say that language does not allow the discretion that Savitch claimed when  he ordered a new election.  </P> <P> Lascher dismissed that argument, saying that Hardeman's attorneys recognized in  their written arguments that Savitch had that option. "The very least that  should be done is that the judgment (calling for a new election) should be  affirmed in its entirety," Lascher told the court. "But I hope we don't even  get to that point."  </P> <P> But Borenstein said his arguments specifically requested that Savitch declare  Hardeman the winner, and only presented a new election as an option if the  ruling did not leave Hardeman with more votes.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel has 90 days to issue a written ruling, but lawyers and  court personnel say they expect a ruling sooner because an election is  involved.  </P> <P> "I'm confident about the outcome," Hardeman said after the hearing.  </P> <P> Thomas said he hopes the court will rule in his favor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Frivolous Things'  </P> <P> Of Hardeman's case, he said: "A lot of frivolous things were brought into  court. This has cost me a lot of money. It has put me and my family to a  disadvantage. Mr. Hardeman hasn't paid a dime."  </P> <P> The law firm of Tuttle &amp; Taylor is representing Hardeman at no charge  because of the public interest questions involved.  </P> <P> Tension was evident between lawyers at the hearing.  </P> <P> During the appellate process, Borenstein has complained about Lascher's  characterization of Hardeman's attorneys as "limousine liberals" with a  patronizing attitude toward Inglewood's predominantly black voters. Recently,  there have been angry words over Lascher's request to delay Tuesday's oral  arguments until April because Lascher had surgery for stomach cancer in early  January. That request was opposed by Borenstein and denied by the appellate  court.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, City Atty. Howard Rosten criticized Borenstein's opposition to a  delay. "That lawyers would treat anybody like that, much less another lawyer,  is incredible," he said. "It reaches new lows in the legal profession."  </P> <P> Borenstein repeated his contention that someone other than Lascher could have  presented the oral arguments if necessary since written arguments, the primary  basis for the court's decision, were already on file.  </P> <P> "I'm very sorry he's ill," Borenstein said. "I wish it weren't so, but it  shouldn't interfere. The fact is there is a person sitting in a seat where an  election was annulled. This must be resolved."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the state Fair Political  Practices Commission opened investigations into the election in 1987. Both  agencies say they are still investigating.  </P></p>

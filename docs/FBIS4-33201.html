			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara has asked the members of  the Rio Group to accept Panama's full reincorporation into the  forum, which expelled Panama during the former regime of Manuel  Antonio Noriega.    Endara explained that the conditions that led to Panama's  expulsion are a thing of the past and that the country now is  involved in a democratic process that became stronger with the 8  May general elections -- elections in which opposition candidate  Ernesto Perez Balladares was elected.    Endara's petition was expressed in a letter he sent to the  Rio Group. In the letter, Endara stressed: I feel an era is  ending with this last diplomatic effort I am making today. With  your support, my country and people will again occupy a place of  honor which, because of a lack of democracy, was suddenly  snatched away from them, and which now, thank God, is being  returned.</p>

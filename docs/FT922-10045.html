			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates shaved again THE BANK of England yesterday gave what many dealers regarded as a clear signal that it wants to see a  1/4 per cent cut in UK base rates next week. For the third successive day, it shaved dealing rates at the long end of the discount market, triggering corresponding falls in rates in the interbank and futures market. In early operations, the Bank bought bills in Bands-3 and -4 at rates 1/16 lower than those agreed the previous day. It bought Pounds 2m of Band-3 bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent and Pounds 8m of Band-4 bills at 9 31/32 - 15/16 per cent. On the two previous days, the Bank had also reduced the rates at which it bought bills at the long end. After posting a shortage of Pounds 2.01bn in the morning, the Bank also bought Pounds 2bn of repurchase agreements for resale to the market on 8 May at 10 13/32 per cent. Rates in the interbank market fell as the market discounted a  1/4 per cent cut in base rates next week. The rates for 3-month money fell from 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent on Thursday to 10 3/8 - 1/4 yesterday. Rates for overnight money also fell to 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent. In the futures market, the June Short sterling contract ended at around 89.86 having closed on Thursday at around 89.72. That closing figure suggests that the market believes that interest rates in June will be at around 10.14 per cent. Many dealers saw these reductions yesterday as a process by which the Bank might get the foreign exchange market accustomed to a gradual decline in trading rates in the UK's money markets. 'The authorities are leading money rates gradually down while at the same time keeping an eye on sterling's position within the ERM,' said one senior dealer at a discount house. However, some city economists believe that a cut in rates next week may be a risk. 'In Germany, the Bundesbank may increase rates in the near term and there is speculation that they will do so at the Bundesbank General Council meeting next Thursday,' said one city economist. There is also a fear that the retail price index in Britain due out on May 15 may show a rise in inflation, undermining any interest rate cut. In Frankfurt, the money market was closed yesterday for the May day holiday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi March 31 TASS -- Since an unauthorized rally  staged by supporters of Georgia's ousted President Zviad  Gamsakhurdia outside his house in Tbilisi and timed to coincide  with the 55th birth anniversary of the late ex-president, the  political and social situation in the Georgian capital has got  aggravated considerably.    A crowd up to one thousand demonstrators marched on Thursday  along the city's central street, Rustaveli Prospekt, passed the  parliament building without meeting any resistance from  law-enforcement bodies.    Local observers link the march to today's incident in  Georgian parliament, when city police chief David Zeikidze and  his officers tried to force their way into the conference hall  in order to prevent lawmakers from approving Shota Kviraya as  Georgian interior minister.    Major-General Zeikidze is known to be an implacable foe of  late Gamsakhurdia and his supporters. He has repeatedly used  force to disperse unauthorized rallies amd demonstrations in  support of the ousted president. But this time, feeling  insulted by the actions of the parliament's and Eduard  Shevardnadze's guards who kept him off the conference hall, he  pointedly refrained from breaking up the demonstration.    Today's protest action by Gamsakhurdia supporters coincided  with the 3rd anniversary of the national referendum which  declared Georgia's sovereignty and thus triggered the collapse  of the former Soviet Union.</p>

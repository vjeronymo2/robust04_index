			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: German-Romanian gas venture - Ventures and contracts Wintershall, the gas subsidiary of BASF, Germany's largest chemical group, will today sign a joint venture with Romgaz, the state-owned Romanian gas company, in an attempt to tap the country's growing gas sector. Wintershall, which has tried to break the Ruhrgas gas monopoly in Germany, will import and sell Russian gas on the Romanian market. Romania, which is dependent on Russian gas deliveries, imports about 3bn cubic metres of gas a year. Although oil is Romania's primary energy source, Wintershall believes that gas will become a competitor for environmental and cost reasons. Wintershall has been seeking markets in eastern Europe for some time. It has a 5 per cent stake in Europol, the Polish state-owned gas company.</p>

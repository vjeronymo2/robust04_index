			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IN PHILADELPHIA;  </P> <P> RECYCLING CENTER ALL TRASHED OUT  </P> <P> So many people are obeying a new recycling law that newspapers were piled to  the ceiling and trucks had to wait in line to drop trash at the local recycling  center. The city finally closed the center.  </P> <P> The National Temple Recycling Center, the main one in the city, was inundated  with newspapers, cans and plastics after the city expanded its mandatory  curbside pickup program, which began this spring, from 49,000 households to  97,000 in northwestern Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The response amazed recycling officials, who thought it would take much longer  to educate people about the ordinance requiring them to sort recyclables and  leave them at the curb.  </P> <P> "Previous experiences led us to expect about 30% participation," said Tom Klein  of the Philadelphia Recycling Office. Instead, unofficial surveys place it at  close to 90% in the new recycling zone.  </P> <P> "We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation," he said. "We just  weren't ready for that response."  </P> <P> Neither was the recycling center. Almost within days, the 'Previous experiences  led us to expect about 30% participation (instead of the 90% who joined the  effort). We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation. We just  weren't ready for that response.'  </P> <P> Tom Klein  </P> <P> Philadelphia Recycling Office  </P> <P> amount of recycled materials received at the plant jumped from 12 tons a day to  35 tons.  </P> <P> Newspapers reached the ceiling. Bottles and cans gathered in mounds. A  fenced-in area outside the plant, once a parking lot, became a storage area.  Lines of recycling trucks waited to drop their cargo.  </P> <P> On June 16, the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections closed the plant  because of dangerous, unhealthy conditions.  </P> <P> Since then the backlog has eased, except for newspapers. They are a special  problem, because there is a newspaper glut on the recycling market, said Mjenzi  Traylor, head of the plant. "It's costing us $15 to $17 to bail a ton," he  said. "And for the most part, we're getting $5 or less per ton."  </P> <P> A recycling center in nearby Bucks County has volunteered to take some of the  excess, but Traylor said that is only a temporary solution.  </P> <P> "We're in a fortunate position because we have a number of major users of  recycled paper here in the community," said Klein.  </P> <P> Klein said the problems will not affect plans to expand the mandatory recycling  program into the northeastern part of the city July 24.  </P> <P> He said the city has contracted with a separate recycling company, Waste  Management, to handle the additional 45,000 households.  </P></p>

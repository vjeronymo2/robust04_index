			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States  Friday [25 March] denied support of Pakistan on Kashmir issue  and claimed it support India to pursue a political process in  the region.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel told a  selected gathering here that "we vigorously oppose outside aid  to the militants." The people in the valley were "tired of  fighting and want some kind of reconciliation," she added.    Asked about her questioning of Kashmir's accession to India  recently, she said, "our focus is not on how the kashmir problem  started, but on how it can be ended."    A large number of activists from Indian controlled Kashmir  staged a demonstration Thursday near the U.S. Embassy to protest  against her five-day visit to India, describing her recent  statements amounted to interference in India's internal affairs.    She expressed her concern over "credible" reports of human  rights violations in the region. But she emphasised that U.S.  always acknowledged that the militants shared responsibility for  violations with the security forces.    She said the costs of continued confrontation vastly  exceeded  efforts of those associated with compromise and peaceful  negotiation in the region.    The violence in the region has claimed 8,912 lives including  3,794 militants and 2,432 civilians till February this year.    She felt the foreign secretary-level talks between India and  Pakistan in January were a positive step and hoped they would  continue.    Raphel also said the U.S. would like India and Pakistan to  address the problem of nuclear non-proliferation bilaterally.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / People: UAP's chairman - a very strong taste for privatisation There are few better connected businessmen in France than Jacques Friedmann, the newly-appointed head of Union des Assurances de Paris, the country's largest insurer and one of the stars on the government's privatisation list. The UAP chairman has the ear of the two most powerful political figures in France - he is a childhood friend of Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR party and a front-runner to be the next president, and a trusted adviser to prime minister Edouard Balladur. This is largely the reason for his appointment. Although regarded as a shrewd manager while he was head of Air France between 1987 and 1988 and at previous posts such as his chairmanship of the Compagnie Generale de Maritime, he has never worked in insurance. At 61, he may have little taste for the intricacies of premiums, risk analysis and reinsurance. Day-to-day management tasks could therefore fall to Didier Pfeiffer, the respected number two at UAP. But Friedmann does have a taste, a very strong taste, for privatisation. As adviser to Chirac when the latter was prime minister in 1986-88, he helped draw up the government's privatisation programme. When Balladur and the right returned to power in March, he found himself performing the same function, albeit on a bigger scale. His close links with the top Gaullist politicians will make him a central figure in French industrial policy and the execution of the state's plans to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. His first task will be to see to the privatisation of UAP itself. He inherits a company in fairly good shape following the effective management of his predecessor, Jean Peyrelevade. In October, Peyrelevade concluded a long-running dispute with Suez, the industrial and financial holding company, which gave UAP control of Colonia, the German insurer. Shortly afterwards, UAP announced first half profits of FFr1.09bn (Pounds 120m), a rise of 15 per cent over the first six months of 1992, and evidence that the company is on the road to recovery after a dismal performance last year. With its results on the mend, privatisation of UAP is expected to take place in the first half of next year.</p>

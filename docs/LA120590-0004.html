			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA CNN TOLD TO SHARE NORIEGA TRANSCRIPTS  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, in Miami, ruled that transcripts of  prison-taped conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and his lawyers, which led  to a showdown in court between the defense attorneys and Cable News Network,  are public property.  </P> <P> Hoeveler's decision answered other news organizations' demands for access to  the transcripts. The Miami Herald, Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station  WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today had claimed that the public  has a right to the facts behind a case that tested 1st Amendment protection  against restraint of the press. CNN lawyer Terry Bienstock said the network had  not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling.  </P></p>

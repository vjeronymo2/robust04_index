			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Payson report in the "Armaments" column: "Russia's </F> Missile Technology Passes Under International Control. The  Russian Federation Government Is Leaning Toward This Decision"]    [Text] Among the many peculiar things shaping the  present-day picture of missile technology proliferation are a  number of international protocols and memoranda which apparently  have no legal force but which nonetheless are actively being  used to bring pressure to bear on those "falling" out of this  picture. It would seem a good cause to restrain the  proliferation of missile nuclear technology, limit the number of  states possessing means of mass annihilation, keep the so-called  "threshold" states at the threshold.... Yet not infrequently  proliferation control, with respect to its initiators --  primarily the developed Western countries and the United States  -- becomes a kind of tool to maintain the competitiveness of  their domestic high technology companies and limit infiltration  of Russian and other firms into capacious arms/space markets.    At the Russian-U.S. Information Center in Moscow journalists  met with participants in a session of the Missile Technology  Control Regime (MTCR) Expert Group: B. Dluzhnetskiy, A.  Pikayev, G. Pike, W. Potter, and Chen Yong-pin.    The missile technology proliferation control regime was  established in 1987 by seven leading Western powers with the  dominant role belonging to the United States. It primarily  concerned limiting the export from developed countries of  various know-how which could be used to create combat missiles  and, naturally, also noncombat rockets, because it is quite an  uphill task telling one from the other.    The MTCR was also tested on Russian rocket producers. In  October 1993 Russia and the United States signed a bilateral  memorandum on observing the basic control regime principles, and  its results were not slow in coming. The contract between the  Indian Space Research Organization and the Main Space  Administration for the delivery of cryogenic missile boosters  was in the end "revised" under U.S. pressure; true, the United  States will partially compensate Russia for corresponding  losses, but the damage to Russian-Indian relations and the  commercial reputation of Russian firms has already been done.  Moreover, the Salyut scientific and production association has  been left without a lucrative order. At present the Russian  Government, as mentioned earlier, is closely examining the  question of full accession to the control regime.    Still, it is believed that the MTCR "pluses" for this  country  outweigh its obvious "minuses." On one hand, who knows where --  God forbid -- missiles sold in violation of the regime to more  or less aggressive states will fly? Considering the "half-life"  of the former Union's single air border control system, the  consequences could prove catastrophic. Furthermore, it is  thought that the signatories to MTCR agreements, having thus  recorded their commitment to the regime's ideas, can enjoy  certain export privileges and breaks -- "in the working  process"....    "We are against," it was stated at the press conference,  "the  control regime's being used by certain states to obtain  commercial advantages." In place of sanctions, expert group  participants propose cooperation: primarily in creating an  international orbital station (it is another matter that Alfa is  not a panacea, and that the engine makers themselves will hardly  find a worthy place in this international program). Meanwhile  the U.S. AEROSPACE DAILY from time to time publishes selections  of commercial propositions opening with such "teasers" as: "A  Russian space scientific and research organization with  extensive experience of work during the days of the Cold War  offers...." -- and offers you name it. What about a strict  technology control regime? Oh, come on! As long as  achievements by scientists and designers remain unclaimed in  their own country, no control regime will be able to stop  "cooperation on the threshold." Except, perhaps, the personal  responsibility and good will of the missile workers who  understand what can and what cannot be offered to the new  "tigers" and "dragons" seeking to supplement their economic  accomplishments with missile-nuclear and space "toys."</p>

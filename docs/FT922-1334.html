			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Arrests in Exxon kidnap case fail to clear mystery THE mystery over the abduction of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's international division, has deepened, despite the arrest last week of a former Exxon security guard and his wife in connection with the case. A team of more than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement officials followed a trail across the US before charging the couple with the April 29 kidnapping. Yet police still do not know where Mr Reso is or whether he is alive. The FBI is searching for a third suspect, on the assumption that at least one other person is holding Mr Reso. Some light has been shed on the case by court documents filed in connection with the arrests in New Jersey early last Friday morning of Mr Arthur Seale and his wife Irene. The couple were refused bail during a hearing in a Newark, New Jersey, court yesterday. Mr Seale, 45, worked on security matters for Exxon until 1987, having served previously as a policeman in a New Jersey town. The court documents say Exxon received the first ransom demand from the Seales within a day of Mr Reso's disappearance, when his car was found abandoned at the bottom of the driveway to his New Jersey home. The kidnappers then requested that Exxon set up a cellular telephone so that future messages could be phoned in. A series of calls and letters continued to arrive in recent weeks, with one call two weeks ago from a Georgia telephone about 30 miles from Hilton Head, South Carolina, where the Seales had owned a yacht. Police following the trail of the Seales went as far as Vail, Colorado, where the Seales lived for a time after Mr Seale resigned from Exxon. Last Tuesday, as Mr Reso's wife Patricia made a televised appeal for the return of her husband, the Seales allegedly used a tape recorded message, phoned in from a New Jersey phone box, to alert the authorities to a ransom letter that would be delivered to a local sheriff's office. The letter demanded millions of dollars of ransom, to be paid in used Dollars 100 bills and placed in laundry bags. By Thursday evening, after FBI agents had placed the Seales under surveillance, more phone calls gave instructions for the ransom. Nearly an hour after midnight on Friday, the Seales were arrested when they returned an Oldsmobile sedan to a car hire agency in New Jersey. The police who arrested the couple found a 1985 directory of the home addresses of Exxon executives, along with rubber gloves and laundry bags. The arrests mark the first break in the long-running case, but the FBI says the Seales, although questioned at the weekend, have refused to speak about Mr Reso's whereabouts. The FBI has meanwhile confirmed that the Seales are the same people who sent a note in early May claiming to be members of an ecological extremist group called the Rainbow Warriors. But they doubt that the Seales have any ecological affiliation. The Exxon case, according to Mr Joe Rosetti of Kroll Associates, private investigators, 'looks like a classic, almost textbook, kidnapping of the kind you normally see in South America'. Exxon is declining to comment.</p>

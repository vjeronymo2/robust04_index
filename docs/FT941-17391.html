			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / New Japanese party to support reform The political hand of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, was strengthened yesterday by the formation of a small political party pledged to help his coalition. Five rebel members of the lower house of parliament, most of whom left the opposition Liberal Democratic party last month, yesterday formally founded a party, Kaikaku-no-kai, or Reform Group. It aims to support the coalition's attempts to reform the discredited political and electoral system. Yet the new group offers little immediate advantage to Mr Hosokawa, as political reform plans are currently blocked by LDP delaying tactics in the upper house, where the new group has no members. This does, however, nearly double the coalition's slender majority in the lower house to 10 to 11 seats. It can now count on the support of 266 out of 511 lower-house members. The coalition has a five-to-six seat majority in the upper house, with 131 of the 251 seats there. Mr Takeo Nishioka, a former education minister who heads the Reform Group, said it would co-operate with, but not join, the coalition and would seek support from LDP upper house members. The four reform bills passed the lower house in November and need to get through the upper assembly before the extended session ends on January 29. This is the latest small stage in the break-up of traditional political groupings, which began with last June's collapse of the former LDP government, after a rebellion by members disillusioned over LDP failure to achieve political reform. The general trend of this seemingly chaotic fragmentation is towards two groups of parties, Japanese political commentators believe. There are liberals, similar to US Democrats, grouped around Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's behind-the-scenes power-broker and former LDP heavyweight; and centre-right groups, similar to US Republicans, aligned around Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the moderate stream of the Social Democratic party, the seven-party coalition's largest partner. This follows the formation last month of a study group by 40 Social Democratic party parliamentarians, accounting for about a third of the upper- and lower-house seats held by the coalition's largest member. The study group, called the Democrats, aims to distinguish itself from the left wing, and is seen as the precursor of a new party. It is now courting as a possible leader Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, governor of Hokkaido and a former Social Democrat member of parliament.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Channel tunnel project facesfurther increases in costs EUROTUNNEL, the embattled Channel tunnel group, yesterday announced a further big rise in the cost of the project and confirmed it was in technical breach of loan covenants. This will prevent it drawing cash without special permission from its bankers. The group has also started proceedings which it says would allow it to set aside a ruling that it must triple contractors' monthly progress payments to Pounds 75m. Mr John Neerhout, project director, said the decision to begin arbitration proceedings with the Industrial Chambers of Commerce in Brussels would make unenforceable last month's payments ruling by an independent disputes panel. Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive, said at the announcement of Eurotunnel's annual results in London that the estimated cost of completing the project - due to open next year  - had risen since last autumn from Pounds 7.37bn to Pounds 8.1bn. The final cost would be even higher because the project was not expected to break even until 1996. The uncertainty over the project's costs will lead to added complications in Eurotunnel's attempt to persuade banks to allow it to continue to draw down funds following the breach in loan covenants. The breach was caused by an increase in the forecast of cash outflow during the first years of the tunnel's operation because of delays in providing a full train service, higher costs and economic growth at a lower level than expected. As a result the group must have the permission of banks - in the form of a waiver of the relevant covenant - to allow it to continue to draw down the next tranche of loans due in June, when Eurotunnel will run out of cash. The 19 leading lenders to the company, known as the instructing banks, were briefed yesterday by Sir Alastair. Under its borrowing contracts, Eurotunnel needs agreement from 65 per cent of banks as measured by the value of their loans. Bankers, led by four agent banks - National Westminster and Midland from the UK, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris from France - say receiving that support is not assured. Eurotunnel says it is confident of receiving it. Eurotunnel has equity and banking facilities of Pounds 8.9bn which it says is enough for it to complete construction. Nevertheless borrowings will continue to rise after the tunnel is open and will exceed the group's previous estimate of Pounds 8.05bn of maximum indebtedness, taking it close to the limit of its resources. Sir Alastair said there were no plans for a rights issue before next autumn but he would not rule out a refinancing after trains started operating through the tunnel.</p>

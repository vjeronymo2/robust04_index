			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: News Round-up Hungary acts to curb insider trading Hungary's stock market authorities have acted to curb insider trading and boost the confidence of investors drawn to the Budapest bourse since it began to take off in the new year, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The state securities supervisor, in an unprecedented step, has asked the police to conduct a criminal investigation into a suspicious rise in the share price of Novotrade in late 1993. The supervisory authority is also conducting an investigation into heavy trading - 20 times the normal volume - in Danubius Hotels shares on January 27. The wave of buying anticipated the announcement that three US institutional investors were paying Dollars 23.6m for 29 per cent of Danubius. The share price leapt 120 per cent on the next day of trading. The stock exchange authorities reject accusations that half of all activity is fuelled by inside information and officials say that Budapest is no worse than any other market. Nevertheless, the stock exchange is aware that there is a problem and is putting new emphasis on enforcement of trading rules. 'These cases show that the regulators are not sleeping,' said Mr Jozsef Rotyis, chief executive of the Budapest stock exchange. Hungary last month also instituted stricter penalties for insider trading. The use of privileged information to make a profit through securities trading now carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The BSE hopes that a new system of automatic computerised trading, introduced this month to handle growing volume, will also serve to curtail market manipulation. Action against stock market malpractice is all the more vital for Budapest's reputation now that the market has attracted the interest, and the scrutiny, of western funds. Budapest has been one of the best performing emerging markets so far this year with its IFC index rising 43 per cent in dollar terms since last December. The collapse last month of Lupis, one of the largest domestic brokerages, has also spurred the authorities to supervise financial markets more firmly. Lupis allegedly diverted clients' funds to its own account in a vain attempt to stave off bankruptcy. WARSAW Mr Marian Rajczyk, president of Bank Slaski, resigned on Thursday. The bank has been in the news recently following criticisms over the pricing of its offer for privatisa-tion. The country's finance minister has already resigned, partly over the contro-versy. INDONESIA Moody's, the international rating agency, has assigned an investment grade rating of Baa3 to the foreign currency debt issued by the Republic of Indonesia. Moody's said the rating reflects the marked economic progress that Indonesia has made and the government's strides in fostering free market principles. The agency said the rating also takes into account that Indonesia still has a debt service ratio of nearly 30 per cent, along with a modestly high level of foreign currency debt. Some Dollars 97m of Dollars 300m worth of floating rate notes issued by Indonesia in 1986 and due in 2001 is still outstan-ding.

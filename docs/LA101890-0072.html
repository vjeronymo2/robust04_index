			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> In a game dominated by big offensive plays, Rodgers' 75-yard interception  return might have been the most entertaining touchdown in the Marauders' 43-7  Foothill Conference victory over East Los Angeles on Saturday night.  </P> <P> The play occurred late in the fourth quarter when Antelope Valley linebacker  Lester Larry grabbed Oscar Tavera's jersey and spun the quarterback around in  an effort to sack him.  </P> <P> Tavera tried to dumped the ball off to a teammate but hit the unsuspecting  Rodgers instead.  </P> <P> Rodgers has played an instrumental role in the Marauders' season -- at 5-0-1  the team is off to its best start since 1954 -- anchoring a defense that has  given up 52 points in six games. He has a team-leading 11 sacks and ranks third  with 38 unassisted and assisted tackles.  </P> <P> Daron Rodgers: Antelope Valley  </P> <P> Football: Defensive end  </P> <P> Freshman: 6-foot-3, 210 pounds  </P></p>

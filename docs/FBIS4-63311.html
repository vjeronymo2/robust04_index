			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] The Russian-Moldovan talks on the status and  pullout of the 14th Russian Army called for mid-May have been  moved back. There are substantial changes in the composition of  the Moldovan delegation, primarily connected with the  resignation of its head, Anatoliy Taranu, extraordinary and  plenipotentiary ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Russia.  He is supposed to be replaced by Nicolae Osmochescu, deputy  foreign minister of the Republic of Moldova and international  law specialist, who has been asked to lead a group of experts  from Chisinau at the talks with Tiraspol.    The Moldovan delegation decided to make some concessions in  the latest round of talks. Backing down on its previous demand  that the Army be withdrawn by 1 July 1994, it suggested that the  withdrawal be carried through during one or two years. In the  opinion of Anatoliy Tiranu, it is not ruled out that Moldova  could decide on even greater concessions: from approving a  longer duration of the Army's stay on its territory to assigning  it the status of a military base.</p>

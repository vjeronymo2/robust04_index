Santosa said here Friday. For this  purpose, he said, a Telkom engineer is now already in Cambodia,  he told the press on the occasion of the current visit of  Cambodian Telecommunication Minister [title as received] So Khun  to Indonesia.    He said Telkom is drawing up a plan for the 120 channels on  the leased transponder which would be serve as a  telecommunication transmitter between the different towns in  Cambodia. Telkom has also been asked to assist the operation and  maintenance of various telecommunication means in that country.    The lease of a Palapa B-4 transponder by Cambodia was not  the  first one. Previously, Cambodia leased a Palapa B-4 transponder  through Telstra, the Australian Telecommunication Corporation,  according to an official of the Satellite Telecommunication  Region (Witelsat), who preferred to stay anonymous.    But the lease through Telstra ended in December 1993, and  now  the project is directly handled between Cambodia and Witelsat  which operates the Palapa B-4 satellite.    So Khun is currently in Indonesia since Thursday for signing  a lease of one-eighth of the transponder (equivalent to 120  channels) at a rate of 283,712 U.S. dollars per year.    The contract was signed in Cibinong, West Java Friday with  So  Khun acting for Cambodia, while Indonesia was represented by  head of Witelsat Bambang Setiawan. So Khun said his country is  currently very busy with development, including of  telecommunication. In this context, his government is enhancing  the quality of Cambodia's human resources in the field of  telecommuncation.    With regard to cooperation between the countries in  Southeast  Asia, Setyanto said Indonesia also plans to establish a  telecommunication cooperation with Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma]  which now have good prospects.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCELING EGYPT'S $7-BILLION DEFENSE DEBT  </P> <P> America is now taking on the dubious mantle of maintaining the status quo in  the Arab world that was once the exclusive domain of the leading European  colonial powers. Due to the diminishing role in the recent past played by these  same powers, we are now assuming the role of "hired gun" to preserve that old  order.  </P> <P> For the millions of impoverished Arabs, the rise of Saddam Hussein to military  and economic power is seen by them as a chance to redress the wrongs so long  endured. Much as we may deplore the tactics deployed by Hussein, he appears to  these same Arabs as a charismtic leader. Much in the same tradition of Mao  Tse-tung, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Ho Chi Minh: leaders in their respective  countries who threw off repressive foreign domination.  </P> <P> Certainly the Saudi and Kuwait governments are hardly the type of regimes that  the Western world endorses. But that is exactly what we are being asked to  uphold. Divested of the high-flown rhetoric, principles and lofty ideas, cheap  Persian Gulf oil is the catalyst that triggers the action we are about to take.  </P> <P> M. H.

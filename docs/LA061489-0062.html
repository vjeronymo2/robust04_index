			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Soldiers heading down a tree-lined path into battle will be a key element of  the $6-million Korean War veterans' memorial in Washington, according to  sources familiar with the plan. A one-eighth scale model of the Korean memorial  is being unveiled today at a White House ceremony. Architects of the project,  to be built across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam War Memorial, also  contemplate a wall containing inscriptions about the war. Sources described the  project as a combination of sculpture, architecture and landscape design  embracing a succession of granite or bronze soldiers intended to collectively  depict a transition from the anxious but brave entrance into war and combat and  the return home.  </P></p>

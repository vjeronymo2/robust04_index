			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (3): High standards, high prices - Ian Rodger explores the city's hotel scene and offers advice to the would-be visitor Hotelkeeping could be called a Swiss art. Cosar Ritz, 'hotel-keeper to kings and king of hotelkeepers', as Edward VII is said to have called him, was Swiss. And the Ecole hoteliere de Lausanne is still the most respected institution in its field. Its graduates, most of them Swiss, run many of the world's best hotels, so it is only to be expected that hotels in Zurich have very high standards. Unfortunately, prices also tend to be rather grand. The city's most famous hotel is, undoubtedly, the Dolder Grand, perched spectacularly on top of a hill of the same name, overlooking the city and its lake. The Dolder has its own nine-hole golf course and tennis courts. Nearby are an outdoor pool in summer, an ice rink in winter and a funicular railway to take you down to Romerhof near the city centre. The Dolder, which wears its grandeur heavily, is fine if you have lots of time and your Zurich contacts are content to come to you. But if you have to be out and about in the city, it is inconvenient. The city has five other luxury hotels, all of which are more in the swing of things. The Baur (pronounced bore) au Lac at the bottom of Bahnhofstrasse is probably the second ranked, and it combines the convenience of being in the centre of the city with lush gardens overlooking the lake. Le Pavilion restaurant in the garden is extremely pleasant, especially in summer, but the atmosphere around the hotel otherwise is rather solemn. The Savoy Baur en Ville, a short walk up the Bahnhofstrasse at Paradeplatz, was founded by the same Austrian immigrant, Johann Baur, more than a century ago, but is now controlled by Credit Suisse and run by Mr Manfred Horger with style and warmth. The Hotel Zurich on Neumuhlequai on the Limmat is the closest thing Zurich has to a large, downtown, luxury, convention hotel. Housed in a nondescript skyscraper, it comes complete with the inevitable piano bar and a medley of interesting restaurants - a suave brasserie, a Thai emporium and a highly rated Italian restaurant, Scala. The Zurich is a bit of a trudge from the banks and boutiques of the Bahnhofstrasse and Niederdorf, both physically and spiritually. Its upstream neighbour is a pornographic cinema while 100 metres downstream can be found the hard drug scene. Among the several three- and four-star hotels in the downtown area, the Storchen is much appreciated for its setting on the Limmat among the boutiques of the old town. The Glockenhof in Sihlstrasse is close to all the big department stores and the Seidenhof, also in Sihlstrasse, is teetotal.</p>

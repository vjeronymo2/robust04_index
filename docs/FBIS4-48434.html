			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty the king has encouraged unflinching  partnership between the European Union and the African,  Caribbean, and Pacific countries, ACP, even beyond the year  2000, saying the challenges ahead call for stronger bonds.    Officially opening the 19th session of the ACP-European  Union  Council of Ministers at the Convention Center in Mbabane this  afternoon, the king commended the cooperation that has been  existing, saying it helped a great deal in ensuring a healthy  economic evolution among a host of ACP member states.    He paid special tribute to the EEC for having been the  biggest contributor towards the development of Swaziland in the  fields of personnel training, agriculture, and the improvement  of the kingdom's road network.    The king hailed the latest developments in South Africa and  Mozambique. He hoped that Malawi will also be able to attain  the peace that now prevails in South Africa after the democratic  elections, and the tranquility that is expected of Mozambique  after the signing of a cease-fire between the rebel Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance] and the ruling Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front].    He expressed concern about violence in Rwanda and Bosnia,  saying everybody should pray for an end to the killings. A  total of 82 countries are represented at the meeting. Most  speakers echoed the king's speech of the political changes in  South Africa, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Bosnia.</p>

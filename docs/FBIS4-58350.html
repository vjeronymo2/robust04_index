			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Was the Sultan's Dagger?"] </F>   [Text] While people in south Lebanon offer their blood as  they stand fast against Israeli aggression, the Sultanate of  Oman hosts a water conference with the participation of a large  Israeli delegation, as if the sultanate has fought against the  aggression just so it can discuss normalization today.    While Syria leads the steadfastness against aggression and  occupation and while our people in the West Bank face the  fiercest kind of persecution and murder, the Gulf Arabs' clear  treachery is emerging. Qatar wants a gas project with Israel;  Oman receives an Israeli delegation for a water conference;  there is another conference in Bahrain tomorrow; and the Gulf  Arabs' obvious treachery continues.    These conferences are nothing but conspiracy itself and a  stab in the back. They have nothing to do with the Arabs'  traits, chivalry, and loyalty. They have nothing to do with  lifting injustice from the oppressed and helping a brother.  Instead they represent treachery.    If Washington believes that through the Sultanate of Oman  and  the emirates of Qatar and Bahrain it can achieve normalization  between the Arabs and Israel and, in turn, encircle steadfast  Damascus, it is seeking a false peace, seeking to support and  perpetuate the occupation, and seeking support from nominal Arab  parties who will collapse at the first encounter.    Neither the dagger of the sultan of Oman nor the bondmaids  of  the Qatari amir and the mercenaries of the Bahraini amir will  have any effect on the conflict with Israel. All this is no  more than a cartoon show that will disappear in the first round  of the conflict.    The conflict is over Syrian land. It is between Syria and  Israel, between Lebanon and Israel, between Palestine and  Israel, and between the Syrian people and the Israeli occupier.  The Gulf Arabs have no right to decide on any measure  concerning the Syrian- Israeli conflict; rather they should  provide every support for Damascus, Beirut, and the intifadah,  because those form a real shield against Israeli ambitions in  the whole Arab world.    Israel wants to devour and divide the Arab world; it wants  to  deal with certain parties unilaterally and flirt with others.  All this is part of an Israeli plan to control the future of  Syria and the Arab world.    Every nationalist and every Arab is today urged to  contemplate and read the Israeli policy and get to know its  dangers. There are two ways to do this: First, to defend the  rights and prevent Israel from enslaving us; or secondly, to  accept Israeli enslavement. In that case all Arabs will have to  subject their fate to the Jewish evil which seeks to govern us  and dominate our future and wealth.    If only the Arabs would realize the danger of the Israeli  serpent sneaking into the best part of their house. Then they  would chop its head off instead of giving it a warm welcome, as  is happening in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain.    We are engaged in a fierce conflict with Israel, which is  occupying Palestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon. The essence  of the conflict is the land and until this land is recovered,  things like this have no description but betrayal.    It remains for us to ask: Where was Sultan Qabus' dagger  during the Arab-Israeli conflict?</p>

The two-day seminar was jointly sponsored by the  International Economic Cooperation Development Fund (IECDF) and  Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research.    Participants included officials from the IECDF, Foreign  Ministry, World Bank and foreign envoys. The foreign guests  came from the United States, France, Japan and Latin American  countries.    Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said at the opening  ceremony that the Republic of China [ROC] is dedicated to  helping friendly foreign nations establish small and medium  enterprises.    Chiang added that foreign aid is a mutually beneficial  program which develops foreign friendship as well as boosts  bilateral economic links.    Taiwan received foreign aid from the United States and Japan  during 1970's, and now the two countries are Taiwan's major  import sources, Chiang said.    Therefore, Taiwan's current economic aid to the Southeast  Asian countries will eventually benefit Taiwan itself, Chiang  said.    Chiang also said he hopes the foreign aid fund, currently  set  at NT [New Taiwan] $10.5 billion (US$396 million), can be  increased to NT$30 billion (US$1.13 billion).    Since the government set up the IECDF in 1988 as an  organization in charge of the ROC's economic assistance to  friendly developing countries, a total of 17 loans worth over  US$247 million have been approved.    In addition, the fund has given out technical assistance  worth some US$11.8 million.</p>

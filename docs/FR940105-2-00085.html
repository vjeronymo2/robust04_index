All comments and requests for hearing were due by December 20, 1993. The Department received over 100 telephone inquiries from interested persons who expressed concern over the effect, if any, of the transaction on their pension benefits.

Questions about the correct value of Cummins Stock, including a question about the discrepancy between the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) price quoted in the Notice and the price quoted in a national newspaper on December 2, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Concerns that the restrictions on the Stock make the Stock less valuable and increase the risk that the Plan will not be able to dispose of the Stock in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Concerns about the wisdom of investing this much of the GEBT's assets in one company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Assertions that Tenneco would not be able to stand behind its obligation under the Contribution Obligation based on its history of financial troubles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

A request that Tenneco fully fund all of its pension liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A request that Tenneco guarantee the value of the Stock to be contributed to the GEBT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F> by Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given: "Berlusconi?  Maroni for Prime Minister"]    [Text] Milan -- What a strange couple, [Northern League  leader] Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, the two  roosters of the "pole for freedoms." They are so different as  to seem like opposites -- and not only politically.    [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, has this contrast not been deliberately  studied in order to create a great force? Are you and  Berlusconi playing a game? An attack Monday [7 March], a reply  and an explanation Tuesday, so that all the newspapers and  television talk about is you?    [Bossi] Definitely not. What is at stake here is clarity  with respect to the voters. We are not selling washing powder.  We have to clarify what the League is, what Forza Italia is,  and what the pact means. True, there are some good things,  because they emerge when revolutions take the right direction.  But while some people want to move directly to the new, some  would take the first side turning.    [Da Rold] People are confused after the things that you have  said about Berlusconi. The opinion polls show you in a strong  position. But further questions are arising, for instance about  the next prime minister.    [Bossi] Not Berlusconi. And I will add nothing further to  that. Even he should realize that. I repeat: It must be  [League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni, a League  member. Somebody asked me whether Berlusconi belongs to P2  [outlawed Masonic lodge]. I said that that is what I read in  the newspapers. Then I was asked whether a P2 member can become  prime minister. And I said, and I still say, "no."    [Da Rold] But how much trust is there among you allies?    [Bossi] Let us be clear: Berlusconi is smart. But he is  also unscrupulous, as I am, for that matter. So unscrupulous as  to use different and conflicting tactics in order to win.  However, the point is this: In the long term, Berlusconi is  part of a blueprint for freedom. But only as long as the League  is at the helm of change.    [Da Rold] What is your opinion of Berlusconi's promises? For  instance, his pledge to create a million new jobs?    [Bossi] Well, we never make such promises. I am talking  about selling detergent. Of course, it can be done on certain  conditions. But to create a million jobs in such a disastrous  situation seems to me definitely an old-fashioned way of waging  the electoral battle.    [Da Rold] Are you, as a "pole," sure of being able to  guarantee the country's governability?    [Bossi] Yes. The League's men who are governing in the major  cities are demonstrating a great sense of commitment. They are  honest people. We have a great contribution to make:  pragmatism.    [Da Rold] So please be pragmatic too on the subject of trust  among allies. Would you buy a used car from [Forza Italia  economist] Antonio Martino?    [Bossi] I do not know him personally. So I cannot answer  that.    [Da Rold] But would you sell Berlusconi a used car?    [Bossi] Well, yes... I am fairly honest in such matters  relating to ordinary life.    [Da Rold] How will you succeed in "selling" Berlusconi  federalism, the League's precious merchandise?    [Bossi] If in the proportional vote the North votes for the  League, then there will be genuine economic liberalism. Within  the "pole" there will be those whose task will be to moderate us  with regard to the kind of federalism. But we must set the pace.    [Da Rold] Would you use the same argument with [National  Alliance leader] Fini?    [Bossi] No, not Fini. The fascists can have no place in the  country's future. They come from the darkness and obscurity of  history.    [Da Rold] Tell me honestly, Senator. Do you think that  Berlusconi has dimmed your political image? Do you feel like  you have been scaled down?    [Bossi] I engage in politics because I believe in a certain  ideal. I am not concerned about power. Berlusconi was born to  attack the League and to join with the DC [Christian Democratic  Party] and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. And thus to form the  moderate pole. Set against the left-wing pole, that pole could  permit itself to recycle the entire political class of the past.  He has failed in this plan. They therefore tried to present us  with a project involving Segni and Forza Italia and to force us  into a corner. So first we pretended to form an alliance with  Segni, then we returned him to sender, to the DC. Thus  Berlusconi was left in a strait jacket, because of the 70  percent of seats due to us. No, Berlusconi does not bother me.    [Da Rold] But is it true that you will soon be appearing on  television partly because Berlusconi suggested that you do so?    [Bossi] Berlusconi cannot make any suggestions to me. I  think that television is useful until the election campaign  comes. Then the die is cast. It is the public, direct contact;  people must experience you at close quarters in order to grant  you their votes. It is not enough to make appearances covered in  makeup, amid blue skies and clouds, like God Almighty, in order  to gain votes. People will give you their votes if they can  touch you and see that you are sincere.    [Da Rold] You are two strange people, you and Berlusconi --  different, but both with failed marriages behind you. And yet  you both talk about the family in your programs and speeches.    [Bossi] I do not consider myself perfect. Not everything  turns out perfectly. But I now feel that I have a wonderful  family. And I am happy.    [Da Rold] Would you send your children to private schools?    [Bossi] I would indeed. They can play a major role in a  modern state. I am thinking about the American universities,  with a foundation next door. I am not thinking about state  money, public money, for private education. I have in mind a  qualitative role for private education.    [Da Rold] But would you go to a public hospital or to a  private clinic?    [Bossi] There is no question. I am an expert on the subject.  I would choose a public hospital.    [Da Rold] What awaits you at Pontida [League rally venue] on  10 April, after the elections?    [Bossi] If nobody wins, a constituent legislature will  inevitably be established. But I do not think that this will  happen, so it could be a long legislative term. Pontida will be  an occasion for celebration. Because the League will score a  great victory.</p>

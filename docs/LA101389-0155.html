			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OILERS GET ENJOYABLE VICTORY  </P> <P> As if to underscore the moment, George Pascoe let out a loud "whoooooooop!"  </P> <P> Huntington Beach High School had just defeated Edison, 24-14, in front of 5,000  Thursday at Orange Coast College and it was a victory worth screaming about.  </P> <P> The celebration raged all around Pascoe, Huntington Beach coach. Players  hugged, coaches hugged players, fans hugged, all savoring the moment.  </P> <P> "It was nice, it was fun," said Pascoe, trying to translate his feelings into  the King's English. "I went to Fountain Valley. It's always fun to beat  Edison."  </P> <P> In this case, a victory gives Huntington Beach a slight edge in the Sunset  League championship race. Huntington Beach is 5-1 overall, 1-0 in league play;  Edison is 3-3, 0-1.  </P> <P> Doug Cunningham, Huntington Beach's senior running back, said he hadn't been on  an Oiler team that had defeated Edison since he playing on the freshman team.  </P> <P> "We won in the last five seconds," Cunningham said.  </P> <P> Thanks to Cunningham, Huntington Beach didn't have to pull out a last-second  victory Thursday night. He rushed for 82 yards in 18 carries and caught six  passes for 98 more. He scored on a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff  Gibson in the second quarter that helped Huntington Beach to a 14-6 halftime  lead. He added a three-yard touchdown run for a 21-6 lead in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "I feel like I've been through a war," Cunningham said. "But it's worth it.  It's pay-back time."  </P> <P> Cunningham certainly played as if past failures against Edison were fresh in  his mind. Every time Huntington Beach needed a big play, he came up with one.  </P> <P> His diving catch along the sidelines for a 24-yard gain set up his scoring pass  from Gibson.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, his 48-yard run set up a 30-yard field goal by Tony  Canini that clinched the victory.  </P> <P> The Oiler defense allowed just one touchdown and two field goals, one that had  to be seen to be believed. They slowed Shane Sherman, Edison's running back who  gained a school-record 308 yards last week in a victory over St. John Bosco. He  had 108 yards in 22 carries, but just five gains of five yards or more.  </P></p>

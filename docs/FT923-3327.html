			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Glaxo has the last laugh - The Bottom Line 'DON'T SELL Glaxo' was the deathbed advice given in an Anita Brookner story by a father wanting to give his daughter the benefit of his accumulated wisdom. Last year, fund managers would have done well to heed his words. Shares in Europe's largest drugs' group doubled, driven upwards by American enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks. In 1991, the results of any fund underweight in Glaxo looked pretty sick. This year, Glaxo's ride has been bumpier. From a peak in January of 916p, the shares fell to 658p by the beginning of July. One reason was selling by US investors, who believed the recession was coming to an end and, therefore, sold defensive companies such as pharmaceuticals while buying more cyclical stocks. The move out of the pharmaceuticals was assisted by various problems at a number of American drugs groups. In addition, money allocated by fund managers for the drugs sector was soaked up by the Wellcome secondary offer. The economic upturn expected by US investors has failed to materialise. Meanwhile Glaxo, which reported its full-year results on Thursday, continues to power ahead, able to generate sales growth (excluding currencies) of 18 per cent as well as a profits increase of 11 per cent. Sir Paul Girolami, the chairman, pointed out that the Pounds 700m increase in turnover was greater than the group's entire sales less than 10 years ago. For a company with a turnover of more than Pounds 4bn, that is a remarkable achievement. It is a particularly outstanding result when compared with results in other sectors. Since July, Glaxo's shares have risen more than 100p and closed yesterday at 768p The question is whether the consistency of Glaxo's earnings' growth will make it irresistible to fund managers, especially if the recession continues. Many were caught short last year and will not want to be burnt again. Glaxo's defensive qualities are not in doubt: Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals' analyst at County NatWest, describes the group as Europe's strongest company. It has superb marketing expertise and sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment and the world's best-selling drug, grew 13 per cent in 1992 despite premature predictions that the product had matured. Sales of Zofran, a drug used to prevent nausea in patients receiving radiation and chemotherapy, increased from Pounds 181m to Pounds 259m. Ernest Mario, the chief executive, said he could think of no medicine which had achieved sales of Dollars 500m in only two years. Future growth also looks assured. Glaxo has been building up its sales force over the past 12 months in preparation for the world-wide launch of two more potential blockbusters - Imigran, a migraine drug, and Serevent, a long-acting asthma treatment. About 1,500 representatives have been added which, Plag says, makes Glaxo's sales force the largest in the world. Margins squeezed by the additional costs of this marketing build-up and greater research and development spending, are now likely to expand. So, what doubts are there about Glaxo? The first is Imigran, which is still awaiting the licence from the US Food and Drug Administration which the company had expected earlier this year. Doubts have been expressed about the product's safety. The delay is disappointing, says Guy Wood-Gush, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. But, he adds, it is reassuring that the authorities have not asked for more data. Nevertheless, if Imigran fails to gain a licence before January, he plans to reduce his 1993 sales estimates. The other question mark is the dollar. BZW estimates that for every 10 cents the dollar loses, Pounds 30m is knocked off Glaxo's pre-tax profits and 2p off its earnings per share. Despite such risks, Wood-Gush believes Glaxo's shares look cheap. Fund managers despairing of a recovery may look at the group's continuing earnings growth and increase their weighting. Brookner's heroine will surely not have sold her Glaxo shares. But if she has looked after her legacy, she might well consider buying more of the stock.</p>

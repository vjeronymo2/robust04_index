			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Santa Cruz businessman wants to build a center in Alameda that uses  California red worms to recycle organic waste. The worms eat their own weight  in waste each day and "show a strong preference for paper mill and sewage  sludge," David Eagle of Earthworm Technology said in a letter to the Alameda  City Council. According to Eagle, one ton of worms can multiply into 1,000 tons  in a single year.  </P></p>

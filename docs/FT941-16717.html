			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dance scene Sir, In the introduction to his lively article, 'Find the dancers a home' (January 1), Clement Crisp assumes the Arts Council has 'arranged' to scale down London Contemporary Dance Theatre and increase the size of Rambert Dance Company. It is in fact the artistic directors of the Contemporary Dance Trust and Rambert, not the Arts Council, who have determined the future direction and size of each company. It is a pity that Mr Crisp's very cogent plea for the establishment of a dance house is marred by factual inaccuracy and a limited view of our diverse and innovative contemporary dance scene. Susan Hoyle, dance director, The Arts Council of Great Britain, 14 Great Peter Street, London SW1P 3NQ</p>

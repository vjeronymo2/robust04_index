Dowd, the  Washington lawyer heading the inquiry, would submit his findings to Giamatti,  who will then decide if any action will be taken against the Cincinnati Reds'  manager.  </P> <P> There was no indication as to when Giamatti would make a decision.  </P> <P> Rose, who has refused to comment on whether he bet on baseball, missed two  games against Montreal because of flu and returned to Cincinnati Wednesday  rather than go to New York with the team.  </P></p>

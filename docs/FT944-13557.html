			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: 'Impossible' improvement to fuel efficiency rejected The motor industry yesterday rejected as 'technically impossible' one of the commission's main recommendations - that fuel efficiency of the typical family car should be increased by 40 per cent over the next 11 years. It also insisted that the commission's depiction of roads jammed with up to 48m vehicles by the year 2025 - double the present number - was misleading. 'We agree that car ownership will increase but this does not necessarily mean that usage will do the same,' the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Mr Roger King of the society said: 'In the next century we will see more families with perhaps three cars for different reasons - an electric vehicle for city use, an inter-city car and a weekend leisure vehicle. But they will not be all on the road at the same time.' The industry also expressed concern at the commission's proposals to modify further the Inland Revenue's new company-car tax regime, to abolish mileage thresholds and increase taxation of the private fuel benefit 'to remove the incentives for environmentally damaging behaviour'. Business cars now account for 70 per cent of the UK new-car market. Any significant shrinkage of the business car market could have adverse implications for Britain as a car manufacturing base, the industry warned. There was less concern over the call for a ban on the sale of super-unleaded petrol because of its high content of benzene and other octane-boosting 'aromatics' linked with cancers. In spite of claims that a 40 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency is technically impossible, something close to that could be achieved - but at what the industry believes would be an unacceptable penalty for the consumer. For every 10 per cent reduction in a car's weight an improvement of roughly 7 per cent in fuel consumption is obtained. A weight reduction of about one-third, most industry engineers maintain, could be achieved by using aluminium or lightweight steel bodies and dispensing with complex accessories such as stereos and electric windows.</p>

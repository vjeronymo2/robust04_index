			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: Coming out in the wash - Worth Watching A technique similar to that used in the production of bath oil capsules has been developed by chemists in Northern Ireland to produce the latest home laundry convenience product - sachets of laundry liquid. The developers, SB Chemicals, of Lisburn, Co Antrim, believe the product reduces the amount of unnecessary chemicals used in domestic washing machines. A measured dose of the anhydrous (waterless) washing liquid is encapsulated in a water-soluble sachet, which is placed on top of the soiled clothes in the washing machine. The film around the sachet is also active in the washing process, acting as a soil suspension agent when it dissolves. SB Chemicals: UK, 0846 673331.</p>

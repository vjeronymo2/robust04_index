			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzbeh Bu ol-Hari: "The PRC-Iran-India Axis </F> To Counteract U.S. Policies"]    [Text] PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will arrive in Iran  after his Asian trip. His visit to Iran is within the framework  of the regular visits carried out by the officials of the two  countries to consolidate and broaden bilateral relations.  Tehran and Beijing have particular reasons for expanding  bilateral relations:  <H5>  Broadening Economic Relations and Cooperation </H5>   Qichen's remarks on political cooperation in safeguarding  the  interests of the countries of the south in the regional and  international organizations have been assessed as positive and  he has expressed his interest in closer cooperation among the  PRC, India, and Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] member  countries.  <H5>  Interest in Preserving Peace and Stability in Central Asia </H5>   The necessary coordination on issues pertaining to human  rights is required, as the countries of the north are seeking to  bestow legitimacy on their own overbearing viewpoint in this  regard to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of  the south that oppose their domination.    It is predicted that the officials of the PRC and Iran will  discuss these as well as other issues, such as the crisis in the  Korean peninsula, the security of the Persian Gulf, and the  Palestinian issue.    But most importantly, the talks between the PRC and Tehran  will pertain to Washington's goals on the Asian continent. When  the world is witnessing the rise of nationalism following the  Cold War, the countries of the north spearheaded by the United  States are seeking to capitalize on this phenomenon. In other  words, the north is seeking to use the weapon of nationalism to  break up that group of countries in the south that resists them.    The United States sees the extensive region from the Red Sea  to Sinkiang and Tibet as suitable for the implementation of its  objectives, which include some important countries in the region  such as the PRC, India, Iran, and others.    In this regard, by supporting the secessionist movements, as  in Tibet, the United States wants to create a security  organization in Central Asia that will fill the vacuum stemming  from its presence in that vast area. [as published] This is why  we saw General Waters, the commander of the NATO armed forces,  declaring that this organization is seeking to control countries  such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Similarly it  was announced that the United States is seeking to set up a base  in Kyrgyzstan.    By capitalizing on the economic problems of the Central  Asian  countries, the United States wants to infiltrate the region.  What is important in this path is that the national security of  the PRC, Iran, and India will be endangered, because they are  near this region.    If the U.S. goals in the breakup of the regional countries  materialize, the front of the countries of the south and the  Asian continent will face tension and instability.    But solidarity and coordination among Beijing, New Delhi,  and  Tehran could counteract this imperialistic policy of the  countries of the north and prevent Central Asian countries from  depending on them, thus guiding the region toward peace and  stability.    The visit by Qian Qichen can help achieve this prospect.</p>

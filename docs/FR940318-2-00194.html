In furtherance of a settlement, the Service is distributing a proposed draft Stipulation and Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Service filed the request pursuant to section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. 3622).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's request has been assigned Docket No. R94&hyph;1. The request is on file with the Commission's docket section and available for public inspection during regular business hours. The Service's draft Stipulation and Agreement, which will provide a basis for settlement discussions, has been sent to previous rate case participants. Additional copies are available from the Postal Service by contacting Ms. Stephanie Majors at (202) 268&hyph;2988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Filing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Postal Service asserts that without rate and fee changes, it will incur a substantial revenue deficiency in the proposed test year, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in contravention of 39 U.S.C. 3621. Request at 1. In support of this claim, the Service identifies a test-year revenue requirement of approximately $55.2 billion and total revenues of approximately $50.5 billion, producing a revenue deficiency of approximately $4.7 billion. As 39 U.S.C. 3621 requires that total estimated income and appropriations equal as nearly as practicable total estimated costs, the Service proposes rate and fee changes ``as a basis for providing sufficient revenues in the test year to cover the projected revenue deficiency.'' Id. at 1&hyph;2. (Footnote omitted.) The Service claims that adoption of the suggested rates will increase total revenues by approximately $4.1 billion, change the revenue requirement by $0.61 billion, and yield a revenue deficiency of about $0.8 million. Current and proposed rates and fees are contained in Attachment A to the Service's request, which is reproduced as Attachment A to this notice and order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed test year is October 1, 1994 - September 30, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview of Proposed Rate Changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Testimony supporting the Service's request describes this rate filing as ``an across-the-board increase'' of 10.3 percent, which corresponds to a three-cent increase over the current 29-cent First-Class (first-ounce) stamp. Rates, fees and discounts for subclasses of mail and special services are adjusted by 10.3 percent, or the nearest percentage that corresponds with historical rounding constraints, such as a whole-cent increment for the First-Class Mail additional-ounce rate and a tenth of a penny increment for third-class bulk regular rates. USPS&hyph;T&hyph;11 at 6. Significantly, Postal Service testimony acknowledges that in certain cases, an adjustment other than 10.3 percent is required, entailing larger increases for subclasses which have experienced large attributable cost increases, and larger or smaller increases to achieve legislated cost coverages for preferred rate categories. The net result of these considerations is described as an overall average rate increase of 10.0 percent. Id. at 6&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average percentage increases, by major class, subclass or category, are set out in the following table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

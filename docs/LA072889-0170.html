			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOUSE SUSPENDS HEALTH PLAN TESTS  </P> <P> The House today approved a one-year suspension of a tax rule on health plans  that business groups claim is so costly and complex to administer that it  threatens the ability of some companies to stay in business.  </P> <P> The lawmakers' 376-26 approval of legislation containing the suspension of  so-called Section 89 is unlikely to be the last word on the subject from  Capitol Hill. Later this summer or fall, Congress plans to act on legislation  that would simplify -- but not repeal -- the rule's requirements.  </P> <P> Section 89 establishes a series of tests that employers must go through to  prove that their health plans do not favor higher-paid workers. The goal of the  requirement, enacted in 1986, is to expand the number of employees covered by  health insurance.  </P> <P> Many business groups have claimed that the rules are so hard to follow that  some companies would be forced to drop health plans altogether. The rules were  to take effect last Jan. 1 but became such a source of controversy that the  Treasury Department delayed their implementation until Oct. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Paris rethinks line on ships France may drop its threat to veto a new international ban on direct shipbuilding subsidies if, in talks with Brussels, it can find other ways to help its merchant-ship construction sector. At stake is last July's agreement between European, US, Scandinavian and Asian countries representing 80 per cent of world shipbuilding. Negotiated over five years within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the agreement would put an end to the system whereby European Union governments can pay up to 9 per cent of the cost of a boat built in national yards. The agreement would not come into force until 1996. But the German presidency of the EU is keen to get the deal, negotiated by the European Commission, ratified at a Council of Ministers meeting on November 28. France has made no secret of its opposition to the deal, and threatened last month to invoke the 'vital interest' clause of the 1966 Luxembourg compromise to block it. However, to avoid a damaging confrontation with Germany, the Balladur government has seized on suggestions from Brussels that Paris could exploit the OECD agreement's authorisation of some indirect aid by increasing payments for research and development, environmental and training purposes. 'This would be an elegant way out,' an expert in the OECD negotiations said. To date, France has refused to follow Spain, Portugal and Belgium in winning an extra period to phase out subsidies under the OECD accord by agreeing to further capacity cuts. 'We have restructured enough,' said one French official, citing the drop in the number of French-built merchant ships from 25,000 in 1975 to 4,800 now. 'But the Commission has suggested we come up with a plan that takes account of past restructuring expenses,' such as redundancy payments, the official said yesterday. Brussels officials stressed, however, they were suggesting nothing that would break an agreement which has the support of 11 other EU members, as well as the signatures of the US, Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden. French officials believe that Germany will help Paris out of the impasse. They said the OECD negotiations were triggered by the US threatening Germany, Japan, Korea and Norway with retaliation for unfair trade practices, and claimed Paris had been accommodating in letting Bonn raise subsidies to the Rostock yards in eastern Germany. The OECD accord allows governments to offer 'home credits' (to a domestic buyer to buy a domestic ship) equivalent to 'export credits' (for foreign purchasers of boats built at home). But France complains that, with the French merchant fleet ranking 36th in the world, it has too few shipowners left to take advantage of this. Experts counter that France's problem is that its yards no longer make enough of the vessels sought by shipowners. Its small-ship construction sector has specialised in cruise ships and LNG gas carriers, and has performed well in export markets. Of the 15 ships on order to French shipowners, only four are being built in French yards.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Some  17 Japanese middle school students on May 13 committed a group  assault on four third-year middle class boys of the Tokyo Korean  Primary and Middle School No. 1 at the plaza of the department  store in downtown Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture.    Due to the assault, one of the Korean schoolboys suffered an  injury. It will reportedly take ten days for him to recover.    Representatives of the Chiba Prefectural headquarters and  Tokatsu branch of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and teachers and students of the school on May  19 called at the Matsudo Police Station to inform it of the  damage and demanded that it take an appropriate measure to  prevent the recurrence of such grave case.    A series of cases prove that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon  campaign of the Japanese authorities is also directed against  Korean students in Japan.</p>

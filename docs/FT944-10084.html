			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Hurd rules out talk of resignation Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday said he had considered resigning in the light of Thursday's High Court ruling that he acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia. But the foreign secretary made it clear that he would not quit. 'I have never knowingly broken the law, and would not dream of doing so,' he said. His remarks came less than 24 hours after the court ruled that the grant of aid was 'fatally flawed' because the project was 'economically unsound' and did not promote the development of a country's economy as required by aid laws. The ruling was the second defeat for ministers in the courts in two days. Mr Hurd said that in 1991, when he was considering the matter, 'no one suggested at any time that the choice was about the law'. 'A promise had been given that the project would be carried through,' he said. 'The project was then criticised - powerfully criticised but not at all on legal grounds - and I had to decide whether it was right . . . on grounds of economy and efficiency to go ahead and fulfil the undertakings Mrs Thatcher had given. 'It wasn't a very easy decision, but I decided it was better to honour the word this country had given.' Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Hurd said the court had not ruled that the project should not go ahead, but that it could not be financed out of the aid budget. 'I now have to consider how the aid budget can be conducted on this basis, whether we need to appeal or not,' he said. His remarks came after Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, called for somebody to be 'held to account'. Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP who chaired the inquiry held by the Commons foreign affairs committee, said the Pounds 234m 'wrongly taken' from the aid programme should be given to those who would truly benefit. Mr Cook wrote to Mr Hurd seeking assurances that the funds would be repaid to the aid budget. Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide finance for the dam in 1989 while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with Malaysia. Mr Hurd authorised the first instalment in 1991 in spite of advice from Sir Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, that the funding was 'an abuse of the aid programme'.</p>

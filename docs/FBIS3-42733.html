			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sokol: "From the Life of </F> Administrators; Staff Cuts Are Drawing Near: It Is Proposed that  Central and Local Organs of Administration Be Cut by More Than  43,000 Persons"]    [Text] Speaking at a recent all-Ukrainian conference of  representatives of local councils, Leonid Kravchuk reported that  the government has decided to cut the central and local organs  of state executive authority by almost 25 percent. The  documents, which were submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to  parliament, expanded and defined this thesis specifically.    As for the state administrative structures, it is planned to  bring them to the level that existed on 1 January 1992. This  means that the central ministries and departments must drop  4,200 persons (30 percent), and regional administrative  organs--21,500 (19 percent).    In the context of ministries and departments--according to  the structures of regional executive authority--the picture is  as follows. More than all the others there will be cuts in the  staffs of local organs of the main auditing  administration--4,100 persons. After this come the Ministry of  Statistics--3,000 persons, Ministry of Justice--more than 800  persons, Ministry of Finance--more than 700 persons, State  Property Fund--600 persons. There will be a relatively smaller  cut--400 persons--in the organizations of the Antimonopoly  Committee, but this figure constitutes exactly half of those who  work here. The structures of the State Committee for the  Protection of Consumer Rights Affairs will be cut by 158 workers  (out of 790). It is impossible, however, to say whether this is  good or bad. According to the idea, this department should be  strong and capable of coming to the defense of consumers. The  latter, unfortunately, do not feel this at all.    Similarly, it is also planned to cut organs of local and  regional self-government to the level of 1 January 1992. These  structures are supported by local budget resources, and the  state does not lose on them. But money is money, and it should  be spent economically. Therefore the staffs of the  self-government institutions of authority will have to be cut by  17,400 persons.    At the same time, some organizations will grow. For example,  local tax inspection offices will increase by 12,000,  customs--by 5,500, courts--by 1,100, and procuracies--by 927  persons.    It is obvious that the current staffs are bloated, and that  they have to be cut. But this process should not proceed  mechanically.</p>

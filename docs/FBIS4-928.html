			<p>BFN     [Text] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says that  despite the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to take part  in the election, conflict between Zulus and Xhosas is  inevitable, which will cause South Africa to become another  Rwanda. The organization said it was not surprised at what it  called the Zulu leadership's pathetic capitulation to the  Xhosa-led ANC in view of its betrayal by the government.</p>

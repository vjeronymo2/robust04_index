			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Equity Issues: Euro-convertible debenture planned by Bangkok Land BANGKOK Land, Thailand's biggest property group, is planning to launch a Dollars 600m Euro-convertible debenture. Following the removal of a number of legal and fiscal obstacles last year, there have been more than 20 Euro-convertible issues from Thailand, but the Bangkok Land issue is the largest to date. The company is to tender for a Dollars 1bn contract to build 20km of inner-city overhead railway. Issue proceeds will be used to finance the project. The company said the issue, convertible into Bangkok Land equity, will go ahead whether or not it wins the contract. The bonds will have a coupon of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent and a maturity of 10 years. Mr Anant Kanjanapas, chief executive, said the issue 'could boost the credibility of Thailand among foreign investors'. The Eurobond market has become a highly attractive method of financing for Thai companies, since the cost of bank loans in Thailand is around 12 per cent. Last month, Bangkok Land successfully launched a Dollars 150m Euro-convertible debenture lead-managed by Daiwa Securities. It also announced a 1-for-10 issue of warrants to existing shareholders. Tanayong, a rival property company run by Mr Anant's brother Mr Keree Kanjanapas, has already announced a Dollars 150m Euro-convertible debenture issue with a maturity of less than 10 years. Led by Swiss Bank Corp, it is part of a Bt6bn fundraising exercise to cover urban rail projects. Union Finance Asia and Phatra Thanakit, two local securities houses, will co-lead an issue of Bt2.5bn of unsecured debentures with warrants and Bt750m of new shares to support the issues. Tanayong is already committed to investing some Dollars 1bn to construct an urban railway for the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority.</p>

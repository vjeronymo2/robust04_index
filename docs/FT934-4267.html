			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Midland Indep Newspapers set for spring float Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail is expected to go for a stock market flotation in the spring. The management buy-out team, led by chief executive Mr Chris Oakley, which acquired the titles from Mr Ralph Ingersoll in November 1991 for Pounds 125m, has made it clear the group would float when the timing was right. One factor standing in the way of a float was fears that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, would impose VAT on newspapers in this week's Budget.</p>

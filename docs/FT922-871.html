			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Congress may intervene in US rail strike CONGRESS prepared to intervene in the US rail dispute yesterday, as the system ground to a virtual halt after a machinists' union strike against CSX Transportation, one of the biggest freight lines. There are Congressional powers to impose labour settlements on the rail industry. Mr Michael Boskin, White House chief economist, estimated that the strike would cost the economy about Dollars 1bn a day and might lead to thousands of lay-offs. Testifying before the House energy and commerce sub-committee on transportation, he said: 'A prolonged strike could well push us into negative growth.' The car industry, which obtains parts and ships finished products by rail, is particularly vulnerable. The International Association of Machinists had failed to agree with CSX over contracts. However, Mr John Dingell, energy and commerce committee chairman, said there was hope for a negotiated contract settlement. He noted that the work stoppage differed from other rail strikes because there was a management lock-out this time, as well as a walk-out by labour.</p>

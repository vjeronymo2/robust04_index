Expiration Date of Section 1619 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We revised &sect;&sect;416.260 and 416.261 to remove the expiration date to reflect the change made by section of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 that made section 1619 permanent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 1619(a)_Special SSI Cash Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 amended section 1619(a) of the Act to provide special SSI cash benefits to an individual whose earnings exceed the amount designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to represent SGA despite a disabling impairment, provided that individual meets certain eligibility requirements. We discuss below the changes we made to reflect the changes in the law, as well as related policy changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.262(a) to reflect that an individual must have been eligible to receive a regular SSI benefit or federally administered State supplementary payment based on disability in ``a,'' rather than ``the,'' month before the month for which section 1619(a) eligibility is being determined. The statutory change removed the former requirement that the individual must have been eligible for regular SSI benefits, special SSI cash benefits, or State supplementary payments in the month immediately prior to the month of eligibility under section 1619(a). The month the individual was eligible for a regular SSI benefit or federally administered State supplementary payment may not be in a prior period of eligibility which has terminated according to &sect;&sect;416.1331&hyph;416.1335. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;416.262(d) to reflect the statutory change that an individual must ``meet,'' rather than ``continue to meet,'' all nondisability requirements for SSI eligibility in the month for which the determination is being made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These two changes permit eligibility for special SSI cash benefits following one or more months of suspension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We revised &sect;&sect;416.260, 416.261, and 416.262(b) to reflect that an individual is eligible for benefits under section 1619(a) when his or her ``gross earned income,'' rather than ``earnings'' as described in &sect;416.1110, exceeds the designated SGA amount (currently $500 per month). Because actual monthly determinations of SGA are not required before an individual moves from section 1611 to 1619(a) status, we will use gross earned income rather than earnings. This is consistent with Congress' intent, as shown in the legislative history of section 1619, to simplify transitions between benefit statuses, limit actual determinations of eligibility, and ease administration of the section 1619 program. In response to a public comment, we added a new sentence to &sect;416.260 clarifying that the calculation of this gross earned income amount is not to be considered an actual SGA determination. We discuss this clarification below. For disabled individuals otherwise eligible for a cash benefit, the only distinction between regular benefit status under section 1611 and section 1619(a) status will be whether or not their gross earned income exceeds the SGA level. Section 1619(a) does not apply to the blind because earnings of blind individuals are not subject to an SGA test under the SSI program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

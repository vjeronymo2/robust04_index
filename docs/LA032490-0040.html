			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PEARCE RECEIVES LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE;  </P> <P> COURTS: TWO JURORS HAD FAVORED DEATH IN THE GAS CHAMBER. BUT, AFTER HAMMERING  IT OUT, SYMPATHY FOR THE FORMER TEACHER'S AIDE, WHO WAS CONVICTED OF HIRING TWO  TEEN-AGERS TO KILL HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND, WON OUT.  </P> <P> A Vista Superior Court jury decided Friday that Roberta Pearce deserved  sympathy and spared her from the gas chamber for hiring two teen-age boys to  murder her estranged husband.  </P> <P> Instead of death, the 42-year-old former Escondido teacher's aide was sentenced  to life behind bars without parole for the crime that involved sex, drugs, a  kitchen knife and a carpenter's hand ax.  </P> <P> After an hour of deliberations, the jury was deadlocked, 10-2 in favor of life  in prison, but after Judge Franklin Mitchell Jr. ordered them to try again,  jurors debated for two more hours and emerged to announce a unanimous decision.  </P> <P> Juror Harold Pinaire of Oceanside said afterward that it took some convincing  to sway the two women jurors who wanted Pearce's death.  </P> <P> "They didn't see the good in Roberta Pearce, we had to keep hammering away," he  said.  </P> <P> Despite the brutal death of Wayne Pearce, who was stabbed and hacked 23 times  on Jan. 31, 1989, Pinaire said the jury was moved to compassion by the sad  events in Pearce's life leading up to her husband's killing.  </P> <P> "It was horrendous," Pinaire said. "He walked out on her for another woman. She  wasn't going to have any children. She thought she might have had breast  cancer. I know it had to play something on her mind."  </P> <P> Pearce was expressionless as the sentence was read to the court, just as she  was on March 12 when she was convicted of first-degree murder. She showed no  sign of relief that the death penalty wasn't imposed.  </P> <P> Her brother, Haskell Meadows, later said "she cannot understand how she was  found guilty" to begin with.  </P> <P> Though he said she was bearing up under the strain, "She's scared because she's  going to be going to prison. She said she's heard there's a lot of fights in  jail."  </P> <P> However, the legal saga of Roberta Pearce might not be finished.  </P> <P> She is scheduled to appear again before Mitchell for formal sentencing May 11,  and her co-defense counsel, Brad Patton, indicated that he will probably file  motions for a new trial. He declined to say on what basis.  </P> <P> Superior Court Department G, so humid that a small floor fan was pointed toward  the jury box, is a place far from the reality of most of Pearce's 42 years.  </P> <P> She was raised in a middle-class, devout Christian family in a tiny Tennessee  town, married at age 16, and bore two daughters before a divorce from her first  husband in 1974.  </P> <P> Eventually, she married Wayne Pearce and wound up in North County, where she  was a teacher's aide at Orange Glen High School in Escondido. There, she made  some devoted friends among the faculty, who remembered her in courtroom  testimony as caring for difficult students, loving her pets, and desperately  wanting a baby with Wayne Pearce.  </P> <P> After 41 years of an ordinary life and 14 1/2 years of marriage to Pearce, her  world crumbled. He left her for a younger woman and she lapsed into a tawdry  life. A 16-year-old girl, Mandy Gardiser, became her housemate, and soon,  Pearce's ranch house in Valley Center attracted other youths.  </P> <P> In testimony, she admitted smoking marijuana with the youths and to having  sexual relations with one teen-age boy, Frank Rodriguez. The prosecution  claimed she hatched a scheme for two other boys, Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato,  then 15, to kill her husband in exchange for each receiving a car and part of  Pearce's benefits from her husband's $200,000 life insurance policy.  </P> <P> Hill and Pilato ambushed and mortally wounded Pearce with a knife from Roberta  Pearce's kitchen and a carpenter's hand ax as he left for work. They were found  guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority  until they reach age 25. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder for  his role.  </P> <P> Pearce's murder conviction carried special circumstances -- murder for  financial gain and lying in wait -- which set her penalty at either death or  life in prison without parole.  </P> <P> All this week, jurors heard testimony. They heard sometimes emotional pleas to  spare Pearce because she had led a good life until she crumbled when her  husband destroyed their marriage and her chance for a child. The defense also  claimed the murder plot was invented and perpetrated by the youths.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Casserly, argued that her crime was so  cold and calculated -- hiring teen-agers and being angry with them when Wayne  Pearce didn't die immediately -- that only death was the right penalty.  </P> <P> Even after jurors decided on life in prison for Pearce, Casserly insisted the  crime merited the ultimate penalty.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't be advocating a position we didn't think was appropriate," he  said. "They voted for life and we accept that." He wasn't certain in which  state prison Pearce would serve her sentence.  </P> <P> But juror Pinaire said the panel felt that despite the crime, her teaching  skills could still be useful to society, which helped make her worth saving.  </P> <P> "I believe Roberta Pearce can do something for the prisoners or even society  itself, even though she's confined," he said.  </P> <P> He said the two jurors who initially voted for the death penalty are women,  "which was a surprise to me. I kind of figured they'd be more sympathetic."  </P> <P> The jury was composed of seven women and five men, most of whom declined to be  interviewed after sentencing. Said one woman, "It's done, it's over with.  That's it."  </P> <P> For Pearce's family, that may not be it.  </P> <P> Her father, Herbert Meadows, said, "We kept telling her don't give up hope,  we'll have an appeal."  </P></p>

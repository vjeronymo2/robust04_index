			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Murdoch to sell first large US venture MR Rupert Murdoch has agreed to sell his first large venture in the US, the San Antonio Express-News group, to the Hearst Corporation in a deal worth Dollars 185m in cash. The agreement is likely to result in closure for Hearst's existing title, the San Antonio Light, the Texas afternoon paper which the company has owned since the 1920s. Mr Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp, said yesterday he had mixed feelings about the sale. 'As publishers of newspapers around the world, we recognise the economic realities of competitive newspaper markets in the US and that this transaction will strengthen both News Corporation and Hearst,' Mr Murdoch said. Hearst said yesterday it would try to find a buyer for the Light but made clear that if none was found the paper, which has a circulation of 148,591 daily and 221,186 on Sunday, would close. The Express-News, bought by Mr Murdoch in 1973, has a daily circulation of 188,797 with 284,728 on Sunday. Mr Murdoch seems to have driven a hard bargain. All the Express-News staff will keep their jobs. If the Light closes, the staff will get severance pay. He said the Express-News staff had waged a long and victorious contest in the San Antonio market 'and no agreement would have been possible without a guarantee that they would all be offered continued employment'. The deal raises questions over how long Mr Murdoch will keep the Boston Herald, his last directly-owned newspaper in the US and also a paper that faces competition from the Boston Globe.</p>

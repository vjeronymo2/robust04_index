			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US steel groups seek talks on voluntary curbs US steel companies are positioning themselves for the March 31 expiration of the US 'voluntary' steel restraints (VRAs) if the date passes without a multilateral agreement to lower trade barriers and limit government intervention in the steel sector. Speciality steel producers last week announced their support for a three-year extension of the VRAs and threatened to file anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases if their protection expires without a multilateral agreement. The producers, along with the United Steel Workers of America union, have requested an early meeting with President George Bush. With speciality steel concentrated in a few key electoral states, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana, politics in this election year could bring the president to their point of view, if a Multilateral Steel Accord (MSA) fails. In a letter to Mr Bush, they said they represent the industry's high-value and high-technology segment which must not be lost. 'Our products have unique characteristics, which makes them critical to the economic and industrial well-being of the US. There are few sectors in the industrial economy that could function without speciality steels.' The American Iron and Steel Institute, whose members produce three-quarters of the United States's raw steel, have reaffirmed their support of a 'strong' multilateral agreement. It said the threat of subsidised and dumped imported steel would be 'very real' without an agreement by March 31. A working paper for an MSA, presented last week in talks with Japan, Canada and the EC, prohibits the use of steel subsidies, except for a worker adjustment programme, structural adjustment schemes in the case of permanent plant closing, and environmental programmes.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Investors develop a taste for revolution - Wall Street WHILE corporate heads were rolling almost everywhere this week (often to the accompaniment of shareholder applause), the chairman of American Express earned an unexpected reprieve, and the company's stock paid the price. In an extraordinary counter-coup, Amex's long-time, and much criticised, chairman, James Robinson, won a battle against dissident board members and not only retained his position at the helm of the company, but also assumed new managerial powers over Amex's troubled brokerage subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Brothers. The news disappointed Wall Street. Disappointment, in fact, is too pale a word to describe the market's reaction - despair would be better. One fund manager told the Wall Street Journal: 'When you see politics win out over shareholders, once again it makes you think that Mr Robinson is unique in his disregard for shareholders and control over the company.' Another member of the investment community was even more trenchant: 'Arrogance and self-absorption won out over the interests of shareholders .. Mr Robinson is a big negative. Whatever the p/e ratio is, it's less with Jim Robinson in the company. Period.' Investors were equally uncompromising with Amex, selling the stock in large numbers. After news of Robinson's victory broke, Amex shares dropped 13 per cent to Dollars 22 3/8 in three days. The selling reflected several sentiments: unhappiness with the outcome of the board battle; disappointment at the failure of Amex to find a chairman from outside the company; dissatisfaction with the fourth-quarter and full-year 1992 results, which were well down on the previous year; and a lack of confidence in Robinson's ability to tackle Amex's deep-rooted problems, especially those at Shearson Lehman. While Amex's chairman was granting himself a last minute reprieve, two other chairmen of big US corporations were forced to walk the plank - John Akers at International Business Machines, and Paul Lego at Westinghouse Electric. Although the latter insisted that boardroom pressure had not forced him to resign, Lego is leaving after only two and a half years at the helm of Westinghouse. His departure also comes on the heels of heavy criticism of the company's management by shareholder activists and industry analysts, all of which suggests that Lego may have jumped before he was pushed. As one big Westinghouse investor put it: 'I don't think Lego would have done it without firm nudging from the board.' The news of Lego's departure was generally received positively by the stock market, which bid Westinghouse shares up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 on the day he stepped down. At IBM, the situation was much clearer. Having insisted recently that he would remain as chairman for several more years, Akers' sudden resignation on Tuesday, and the demotion / early retirement of two of his key lieutenants, made it clear that the patience of board members and shareholders had finally run out. Last week's announcement of a record Dollars 4.97bn loss for 1992, which forced IBM to slash its quarterly dividend for the first time in its history, must have been the final straw. Again, the market welcomed the management reforms, with heavy demand lifting IBM shares up from below Dollars 48 to Dollars 51 1/4 by the week's end. The rise in IBM shares, however, cannot be solely attributed to the changes at the top of the company. The stock also benefited from the decision by some investors this week to switch out of overheated small-company stocks and into bigger cyclical industrials. This switching may prove to be only a temporary phenomenon, but it was a welcome development nonetheless for the beleaguered components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For the first time in weeks, the Dow put in a stronger performance than over-the-counter stock indices. The turnaround was partly the result of a natural correction in the market - investors took profits on their OTC holdings and moved some of that money back into industrials - and partly a response to the news that economic growth at the end of last year was surprisingly strong. The Commerce department announced on Thursday that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the final quarter of 1992, the healthiest growth in four years. The GDP report indicated that the economy has decisively broken free from the 1990-1991 recession, and it immediately encouraged investors to take a fresh look at cyclical stocks like IBM, General Electric and International Paper, which tend to move in line with the ups and downs of the economy.  ------------------------------------------ Monday      3292.20   +   35.39 Tuesday     3298.95   +    6.75 Wednesday   3291.39   -    7.56 Thursday    3306.25   +   14.86 Friday      3310.03   +    3.78  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VATICAN URGES NOVITIATES TO LEARN EARLIEST TEACHINGS  </P> <P> Students for the Catholic priesthood need to return to more traditional  learning by studying both Greek and Latin and the teaching of the church's  earliest writers, the Vatican said this week.  </P> <P> The Congregation for Catholic Education said seminaries and theological  faculties should place greater emphasis on the study of the so-called "Church  Fathers" of the early centuries, whose work is considered the basis of church  doctrine and orthodoxy.  </P> <P> The writings of the Church Fathers are important to both Eastern and Western  Christian traditions, and the study of their work is called patristics and  patrology.  </P> <P> "Theological reflection has always been clearly aware that there is something  in the Fathers which is unique, irreplaceable and perennially valid," it said.  "In order for the church to continue growing, it is necessary to know their  doctrine and works thoroughly."  </P> <P> The document lamented that theologians often give scant attention to the early  teachings, which sometimes become "caught up in an overall rejection of the  past" or "taken over by the various fashionable philosophies and ideologies of  the day."  </P> <P> "Theologians . . . think that they are doing theology but are really only doing  history, sociology, etc.," it said.  </P></p>

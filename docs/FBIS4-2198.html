			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "10 Major Exchanges Take Shape in Shanghai"] </F>   [Text] Following the establishment of its stock exchange  in 1990, Shanghai has set up 10 major exchanges including those  for stocks, metals, chemicals, cereals and oils, automobiles,  petroleum, building materials, technology, coal, and  agricultural means of production. By extensively applying  hi-tech, advanced world standards, such as high-capacity  computers and satellite communications, as well as standardized  managerial systems, these exchanges have realized paperless  operations. Of the 10 exchanges, the stock exchange can handle  as many as 1,800 transactions a second, with a daily average  transaction volume of 900 million yuan, and the cereals and oils  exchange handles a daily average volume of 800 million yuan.  Equipped with a complete range of functions covering a wide  area, these exchanges are exerting an increasingly conspicuous  influence. Shanghai has become China's biggest stock and  futures exchange and has taken another step toward becoming an  international financial and trading center.</p>

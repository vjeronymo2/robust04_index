			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Occasionally a programme catches the public imagination even before it goes out, and interest balloons in a disproportionate way. Often the subject is connected, albeit remotely, with sex as is the case today with Giving The Empire A Lift. This half-hour programme on ITV (7.30pm) depicts a typical day at Rigby &amp; Peller, the London corsetiere which makes brassieres for the Queen among others. We are promised the confessions and fetishes of the company's clients and a first-time fitting for a woman who discovers that, for years, like many others, she has been buying bras that don't really fit. Before that in BBC1's sequence of repeats, Wildlife 100 at 7pm shows the memorable programme 'Twentieth Century Fox' which, in 1981 when most of us were unaware of such things, showed the habits of urban foxes. Assignment (7.45pm BBC 2) explores 'The Galician Connection': the route now taken by Colombia's cocaine producers to ship drugs in to Europe via Galicia in north-west Spain.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Ukraine wins extensive guarantees for renouncing nuclear power Ukraine said last night it had won extensive guarantees from the US, Russia and Britain in return for renouncing any aspiration to be a nuclear power under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally joined yesterday at the CSCE talks in Budapest. The accession of Ukraine to the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for the Start-1 treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former Soviet nuclear warheads, to enter into force. Under the deal the US, Russia and Britain pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, not to use or threaten force against Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if it faced nuclear aggression. In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of Russian commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion.</p>

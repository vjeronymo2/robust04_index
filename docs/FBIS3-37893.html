Ryabchikov: "Parties Prepared To Help </F> President"]    [Text] President Yuriy Meshkov dedicated last Saturday to  talks with leaders of officially registered parties. During the  course of the discussions, they clarified their positions and  their attitudes toward the president's program for  transformations in the republic, and they explained what help  they needed. The leaders of the parties, including the PEVK  [expansion unknown] and Ukrainian parties, declared their  readiness to contribute to the implementation of the economic  reforms.    "The meeting took place in a constructive setting," said the  deputy chairman of the Agrarian Party, Mikhail Frolov. "We are  in favor of social justice for the peasantry and granting them  the benefits necessary for the advancement of agriculture. The  president's views coincide with ours here."    "We came to the meeting with a package of proposals," said  the chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, Yefim Fiks, "and  in turn we received a proposal from the president to prepare  draft edicts for them."    Participants in the meeting spoke of the need to adopt a  joint statement of all political forces of the republic in  support of the president's actions.    Commenting on the results of the talks, the president's  adviser for communications with parties and public  organizations, Sergey Nikulin, noted that Yuriy Meshkov asked  the participants in the meetings to prepare proposals for  candidates for vacancies in all structures of state power. The  consolidation, Nikulin thinks, will make it possible to create a  powerful bloc supporting the president's policy in the new  parliament. This will be a parliament of a new quality, he  emphasized.</p>

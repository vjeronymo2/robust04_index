			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Survival when winter stops play - Cricket Next month the English cricket season starts. Hoping to get some of the hard facts of life out of the way before that happy time, I set out to try and understand how county cricket clubs earn their money. By now, most first-class cricket clubs have published their accounts for last year, before starting the season with new determination. Sometimes the problems are old ones, such as Derbyshire's propensity for financial torment. This led them to a record loss of Pounds 120,000 last year and their chairman's departure. But, more often, records were on the profit side, even in the most unexpected places. Gloucestershire, for instance, had a year rotten with defeat, finishing 17th out of 18 in the county championship - but ripe with profit, to the extent of Pounds 49,050, as the secretary, Philip August, told me jovially. Gloucestershire, he said, had three main sources of income. Biggest by far is a grant from the Test and County Cricket Board. I knew the TCCB subsidised the counties, but I thought I had better hear some individual survival tactics before hearing about the ones at central office. Besides, the Gloucestershire officers were keen to describe their affairs a bit more colourfully. 'We can afford to be a bit more cavalier now,' said August, assuring me that cavalier meant enterprising. Gloucestershire is still a sensible county. One example of enterprise is that its coaches want to give the players a first-aid course ready for this summer and, instead of dismissing the idea out of hand, officials can now afford to consider it. Perhaps Courtney Walsh will learn to resuscitate his victims on the follow-through. On the sensible side, Gloucestershire rents out the new pavilion at the Phoenix County Ground in Bristol, whenever it is not in cricket use, as a venue for dinners, weddings, conferences and other functions. Financially, this is a contributor to Gloucestershire's second biggest source of income: commercial operations. Third, and smallest, is cricket itself. Only 12 per cent of the club's income comes from membership fees and gate receipts. 'It's sad that's all we get from people actually watching cricket, but that's how it is,' said August. Some 60 per cent of all Gloucestershire's cricket earnings comes from the 10-day festival at Cheltenham - consisting of two county and two Sunday games, attracting local business support and sponsorship. Quiet, outlying games make a nice change but they do not make a nice profit. That is why most counties centre their cricket on fewer grounds with every passing year; it is cheaper and easier that way. But the complications of cricket finances show how strongly the counties have retained their distinctive characters. Warwickshire's Andrew Wilkes told me that using Edgbaston for county games did not just make a little money - it lost money. 'By the time we've paid all the staff needed at a huge ground like that and got everything ready, it seldom matches up to what we take from a few hundred spectators,' he said. Derbyshire, by contrast, has always depended heavily on gate receipts, especially from the county ground. This season home matches will only be at Derby and two other venues: Ilkeston and the festival ground of Chesterfield. The county blames a lot of its money troubles on the four-day game reducing the number of fixtures. Top priority is to attract people into cricket, to watch and to play and, so, to make money for the club. It is long-term, hopeful planning and it delights the club's first woman committee member, an energetic Derbyshire nationalist called Liz Hill. One example is the improvement of facilities for children and families at matches. A group of players and officials will tour the whole county, fund-raising and demonstrating the joys of cricket. Back at base, the Derby ground does not earn money in the winter so much as look after its core of intrepid supporters, with regular meetings and meals. Financial troubles must not be allowed to weaken the county's traditionally-strong community spirit. Glamorgan has gone one step further and combined community spirit with patriotism, greatly to its advantage. 'We cashed in on a tide of Welsh nationalism, after some low years. Our brave committee cut the membership fee from Pounds 45 in 1992 to Pounds 15 last year and our membership shot up. So did membership income, from Pounds 88,800 to Pounds 172,500; last year we made our first operating profit since 1977,' says marketing director Tony Dilloway. The TCCB favours initiative, especially if it works, and rewarded Glamorgan's rise from 14th to third place in the county table last year with a generous grant. Glamorgan does not own its main grounds but rents them for a fixed number of playing days each year. The staff spend the winter recruiting support all over Wales: they have no time for commercial operations. 'We get our money from cricket, not hospitality boxes.' Just to complete the assortment of different approaches to cricket finances  -Warwickshire told me proudly that its record profit of Pounds 289,024 last year owed much to the Edgbaston hospitality boxes. They are sought after as prime places to watch cricket, do business deals and lap up luxury. The people who run Warwickshire are realists. They know they depend on their commercial operations, which they see as intrinsic to modern cricket. A fair share of the large sum they received from the TCCB last year had been paid to the TCCB by Warwickshire in the first place. Test grounds put the profits from test matches and one-day internationals into the TCCB's 'pool', the central source of supply for all the first-class cricket clubs, including minor counties, according to their size and needs. It is a kind of Robin Hood system, designed to keep the county system going. Such credit was given by all the counties, rich and poor alike, to this time-honoured system, with its newly-increased resources, that I felt almost uneasy. I talked to the TCCB's chief accountant, Cliff Barker, who was amiable, happy to agree that the TCCB had made more money in the last few years, but less happy to give details of how it had achieved this. 'Mainly from English home matches,' he said, adding that last year test match crowds worldwide were falling, but in England they rose 22 per cent, in spite of defeat by Australia. He attributed much of this to Sunday play in test matches. 'Another bonus we have now is in the bigger broadcasting fees resulting from the BBC having to compete with rivals Sky TV.' I asked him if he liked Sky's cricket coverage. 'I like the ending of a monopoly,' replied Barker. The TCCB is the sole organiser of all the sponsorship deals for test and one-day internationals, redistributing its earnings around the counties. Barker assured me that the counties were free to spend their 'pool' money as they liked; only the buying of players was controlled, by a board of all the teams. County cricket is big business and it is run as a big business in order to survive. But only honour is more important than money if the traditional nature of the game is to thrive.</p>

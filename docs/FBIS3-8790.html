			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by REPUBLIKA: "Movement for a Democratic Slovakia </F> Deputies to the Former CSFR Federal Assembly: President Is  Calling in Question the Will of Citizens"]    [Text] Spisska Nova Ves--Aware of our decisive measure of  responsibility for the founding of the Slovak Republic, we,  deputies to the former Federal Assembly for the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] elected in the 1992 elections, issue  the following statement on the current situation in society:    Our young Slovak Republic has arrived at a fateful  crossroads. This happened on the basis of a carefully thought  out and systematic course of action by the president of the  Slovak Republic, who, by his address in the National Council of  the Slovak Republic, initiated the process of destabilizing the  Slovak political scene and a parliamentary crisis, whose outcome  is the negation of the results of free and democratic elections.  By this unprecedented action, which is without parallel in the  history of European parliamentarianism, he exceeded the  framework of his constitutional powers. As a result, the  further development of our society is getting into the hands of  political entities that did not vote for the Constitution and  sovereignty and that were never favorably disposed toward the  founding of an independent Slovak Republic. This development  fills us with serious concern. We follow with the same concern  the endeavor by the president of the Slovak Republic to call in  question the will of citizens as expressed in their exercising  the right of petition.    While we acknowledge the undeniable contribution made by  Michal Kovac, president of the Slovak Republic, to the founding  of the Slovak Republic, we feel the moral obligation and  justification, obtained by the law on the termination of the  federation, to appeal to the president's conscience to consider  whether his remaining in the post of president of the Slovak  Republic is in conformity with the interests of the Slovak  Republic.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / BT makes more price cuts British Telecommunications yesterday announced price cuts worth Pounds 46m in a full year. The main beneficiaries will be heavy residential users and businesses which make many international calls. A new residential discount scheme, to be called PremierLine, will give customers 15 per cent off all direct-dialled calls in return for an annual fee of Pounds 24. Subscribers will also be eligible for Air Miles and other benefits. The scheme is aimed at residential customers with bills of more than Pounds 100 a quarter, many of whom have moved their long-distance calls to Mercury, BT's main competitor. Mercury responded by pledging to maintain its guaranteed savings on long-distance and international calls when the price changes take effect at the end of the month. BT is also cutting the cost of international calls to Japan, the Republic of Ireland, Israel, Hong Kong, Bahrain and a number of European countries outside the European Union. From the end of the month the off-peak period for weekday international calls will start at 6pm, as for national calls. Changes to the discount schemes for high-volume business customers will also be introduced, but with a broadly neutral effect in price terms. The reductions take to Pounds 550m the total annual value of price cuts over the past year. Under the price cap agreed with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, BT has to cut prices in the year from July 1 by a further 7.5 per cent after inflation.</p>

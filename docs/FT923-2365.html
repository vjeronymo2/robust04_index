			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK economy: Special deal prods banks into reduction UK BANKS were very reluctant to reduce interest rates yesterday, even though the government cut the rate at which the Bank of England lends to the market, or the minimum lending rate, by 2 percentage points. The MLR was cut at 9.30 yesterday morning, reversing Wednesday's increase, but it was not until after 3pm that any big banks cut their base lending rates - only after 40 banks and five big building societies were summoned to a meeting at the Bank. Banks said yesterday the reason for the delay was not any doubt on their part that the MLR cut was sustainable. They said the lag in responding to the MLR cut was due to technical problems in the money markets, which were solved when the Bank put special lending arrangements in place. According to a banker the root of the problem was the scale of the government's purchases of sterling on Wednesday, when it was battling to prop up the pound. Analysts estimate that it bought Pounds 15bn of sterling. Any institution which sold sterling to the Bank has to deliver the funds today. UK banks, which act as intermediaries in settling the bulk of these transactions, have received orders from banks across the world to deliver sterling to the Bank. The UK banks do not, however, have enough sterling to meet these obligations so they have to borrow pounds. Normally they would borrow much of it from the discount houses, which act as an interface between the Bank and the clearing banks. Only discount houses can borrow from the Bank at the MLR. The discount market has insufficient capacity to cope with such demands, however. As a result, an acute shortage of sterling developed in the markets and short-term borrowing rates soared. The banks feared companies would draw on agreed-rate overdraft facilities to make a quick profit by lending to banks at high short-term rates - round-tripping. No bank wanted to be the first to cut its base rate to 10 per cent, so John Townend, head of the Bank's money market division, summoned treasurers of banks and building societies. He proposed that the Bank would lend directly to the banks, bypassing the discount houses, at 10 per cent. Banks were able to borrow 2 per cent of their eligible liabilities - all their liabilities except deposits with other banks - for seven days. Though some banks doubted that sufficient liquidity was being provided by the Bank, in the event they were reassured. Short-term money market rates came down and in the end the banks reduced their base rates - much to the government's relief.</p>

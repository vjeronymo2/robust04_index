			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Vaz urges recall of Commons on BCCI PARLIAMENT SHOULD be recalled from its summer recess if the conclusions of Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International bear out newspaper accounts of the draft report's findings, a Labour MP told the Commons yesterday, David Owen writes. Mr Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East, marked the last day of the parliamentary session by asking in a point of order whether Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, planned to make a statement on the report. He was told by Mr Michael Morris, deputy speaker, that it was too late for such a statement. Mr Vaz also disclosed that Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, had apologised to Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, over the leaking of details to newspapers of its response to a select committee report into BCCI.

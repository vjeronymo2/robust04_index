			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Digital to phase out Irish plant DIGITAL Equipment, the troubled US computer maker, is closing its manufacturing facility in Galway, Ireland, with the loss of 780 jobs. Work will be phased out over the next 12 months, the company said yesterday. Its European software development and distribution headquarters in the same area, with 350 employees, will be retained. In Dublin, Mr Ruari Quinn, minister for enterprise and employment, said the decision was 'a major disappointment'. There was intense lobbying by the UK and Irish governments when it seemed Digital would choose between Ayr, Scotland, or Galway for closure. The Irish government has asked the European Commission informally to investigate UK government incentives, which Dublin suspects helped to keep the Ayr plant open. Manufacturing will also continue at South Queensferry, Scotland, where the Alpha microprocessor, said to be the fastest in the world, is made. Mr Edward McDonough, Digital's vice-president for manufacturing, said the closure was part of a three-year restructuring programme. The Galway operations would not go to Ayr but to other Digital plants. The decision had been made on the basis of manufacturing efficiency and not for social reasons. Once the world's leading minicomputer manufacturer, Digital has been hit by changes in the computer industry which have cut the profit margins on computer hardware.</p>

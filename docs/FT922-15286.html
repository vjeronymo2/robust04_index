			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Trade talks fall on deaf ears: The Uruguay Round is deadlocked, but is too important to fail Negotiators in Geneva are likely to miss their Easter deadline as they struggle to break the 15-month deadlock in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. Officials at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) talk of paralysis, as the political will to make compromises among central players such as the US and the European Community appears to ebb away. Fear that the talks face imminent collapse prompted US President George Bush last week to call for 'a political push from whatever source' to rescue them. He declined, however, to offer further US concessions. American officials in Geneva say 'a minor miracle' is needed to achieve a breakthrough. At the same time, farm ministers from the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) meeting in Paris on Friday called for a swift and successful end to the negotiations. They warned of 'significant downside risks for the world trading system, and costs for the world economy' if the talks fail. They too offered nothing. The risks of failure are already apparent, as recession in 1991 led to a third successive year of faltering world trade growth: the value of trade rose by a meagre 1.5 per cent to Dollars 3,500bn - the smallest gain since 1985, according to the Gatt. Without the boost to trade that a successful conclusion to the round should bring, recovery is likely to be retarded. The collapse of the round - launched in 1986 to break down barriers to trade in services, agriculture and textiles, to boost international respect for patents and copyright, and to improve mechanisms for settling trade disputes  -has been looming for a long time. A summit held in Brussels in December 1990 broke up in acrimony after the EC and US failed to agree on farm trade reform. A compromise reform package, known as the Final Act, was drawn up by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt. It was tabled late in December 1991 and was intended to break the deadlock. All of the 108 countries that have signed up to the Gatt expressed reservations with elements of the package but, with the exception of the EC, have agreed that it is is too important to the world economy to be rejected. The issue which continues to jeopardise any agreement is farm trade, in particular the EC's Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). Reform of farm trade is essential to successful completion of the round because many participants in the developed and developing world are seeking an end to protective farm subsidies in the EC and the US, in exchange for freeing their domestic markets to outsiders. Mr Dunkel proposed cutting agricultural subsidies by 20 per cent by 1999, converting farm quotas and other protective devices into tariffs and then cutting them by 36 per cent by the same date. He also sought reductions in subsidised farm exports. The EC rejected the plans in January. Mr Dunkel has refused to reopen the Final Act for fresh negotiation. He has instructed the EC to settle differences over farm trade with other negotiators - principally the US - and bring back a compromise acceptable to all. Such a compromise would seem to be in the interests of the EC and the US. They spend billions of dollars a year supporting the prices farmers get for their crops, paying for storage of excess production, and subsidising the price of farm products being dumped on the world market. Such policies place a heavy burden on taxpayers and consumers in the west, and damageagriculture in the Third World by depressing world prices for meat and cereals in particular. Although the EC has made some concessions over the past few months, two contentious issues remain: EC demands to 'rebalance' its protective regime by raising protection against the import of cereal substitutes in exchange for lowering protection for other farm products; EC demands that compensation payments to farmers (seen as the centrepiece of plans to reform the CAP) should not be regarded by the Gatt as a distortion of trade. Today, compromise on both these issues appears possible, with the EC suggesting it could drop its demands for 'rebalancing' in exchange for compensation payments to farmers which do not distort trade. One EC spokesman in Geneva said that the remaining differences between the EC and the US are 'more a matter of presentation than substance'. Many observers of the tortuous manoeuvrings within the Gatt find it hard to understand why the entire accord is being put at risk over the issue of CAP reform when the potential gains from an agreement are immense. For the first time, trade in commercial services - worth Dollars 680bn in 1989, the latest year for which the Gatt has figures, accounting for about 19 per cent of world trade - would fall under the Gatt umbrella. A timetable would be set for the markets of all Gatt signatories to be opened to foreign banks, securities houses and insurance companies; national monopolies in telecommunications would be dismantled; liberalisation of shipping and civil aviation would begin. Detailed country-by-country negotiations on opening these markets are currently stalled, with the EC and others blaming the US for seeking to limit the scope of liberalisation. But there is a general assumption that progress on the farm subsidy issue would yield US concessions. In addition, respect for patents and copyright - vulnerable to piracy in many developing countries - would also be built into an agreement on intellectual property rights. Trade in textiles and garments would be brought into Gatt, after having defied liberalisation for 40 years. Over 10 years the labyrinth of bilaterally negotiated quotas that determine textile trade would be dismantled, and replaced by tariffs. Moreover, reinforced Gatt dispute settlement rules would be expected to check the destructive proliferation of rows over goods that are allegedly subsidised, or 'dumped' in export markets. They would tackle the abuse of technical or industrial standards, which are frequently used as a block to imports. Perhaps most important of all, a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would secure the participation of much of the developing world in multilateral trade agreements. Since 1986, more than 60 countries from the developing world and former communist bloc have adopted policies of reductions in tariffs and quotas. The prospect of reduced barriers to their exports - which depend on the completion of the Uruguay Round - have been an important incentive. Although deadlines in Gatt negotiations have often been missed, the current stalemate is creating a growing sense of urgency. Beyond April, there are not enough days in the US congressional calendar to get an agreement ratified ahead of the US presidential elections in November. Officials in Geneva, including those from the US, are already talking of what might be done to minimise 'backsliding' from compromises already made in the areas of services, patents and copyright, and tariff cuts if negotiations have to be postponed until January 1993. In spite of a consensus that further delay is inevitable, no one is willing to contemplate outright failure. As Ambassador Bal Krishan Zutshi, India's long-standing Gatt representative, commented: 'No one can afford to abandon what has been achieved out of the round so far. Negotiators will come back sooner or later and settle it.' Even delay carries with it grave dangers: Protectionist lobbies in the US in particular have been held at bay largely because of the promise that trade grievances would be dealt with more speedily in the Gatt by new trade dispute procedures. If the round is put on hold, it will be hard for President Bush's administration to resist demands for unilateral action against 'unfair trade'. June 1 is a critical date, on which a two-year US Farm Bill expires. With it, commitments not to match EC farm export subsidies on a tit-for-tat basis also expire. In fact, the US administration will face a formal commitment to relaunch a subsidy war with the EC on exports of farm products. Such action would almost certainly trigger retaliation. The multi-fibre arrangement which controls world trade in textiles and garments expires in December. With no Uruguay Round in place, awkward renegotiation of rules for trade in textiles and garments would be needed. Long-sought improvements in Gatt's rules for settling trade disputes would be held up. Countries frustrated with how Gatt currently deals with trade disputes - the US foremost among them - may resort to bilateral sanctions, which again could trigger retaliation. Delay would also hamper attempts to address new problems - such as reconciling free-trade principles with environmental concerns, and bringing competition policy under the rubrick of the Gatt. There is a growing feeling among critics that it is time for the world's leading industrial powers to set an example to newly liberalising countries in the Third World. They should set aside narrow domestic political considerations in favour of improving the world trading system. An old joke about Moses might prove instructive. He was sent by the Israelites to the top of Mount Sinai to negotiate with God over the commandments. He came down exhausted after 10 days with a list of 310 commandments. The Israelites angrily sent him back to negotiate a better deal. Three more days passed before a gaunt Moses reappeared: 'I have good news, and bad news,' he said: 'The good news is I've got the list down to 10. The bad news is that adultery is still in.' For negotiators in Geneva struggling with ennui and exhaustion after six years of non-stop haggling, such a spirit of compromise could be timely.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                VALUE OF WORLD MERCHANDISE TRADE 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------          Exports                                    Imports   Value       Annual change                 Value        Annual change (Dollars bn)     per cent                (Dollars bn)      per cent   3,530           1 1/2        World        3,660           1 1/2     555           5 1/2    North America      625          -2 1/2   1,365          -1             EC          1,450           1 1/2     885          11 1/2         Asia          825           8 1/2      70          16                                China           65          19 1/2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gatt  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Leading Article: Tough time for Europe's left FEW TEARS will be shed over the departure of Mrs Edith Cresson. But it is ironic that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the main architect of her downfall, should now take her crown. The new French prime minister has been the intellectual driving force behind France's tight economic policy of the last few years, the painful side-effects of which are largely to blame for the Socialist government's present unpopularity. Mrs Cresson, for all her faults, was sacrificed for this cause, a precedent upon which Mr Neil Kinnock might reflect. Mr Beregovoy may also find his electoral standing is rapidly squeezed by the burden of France's economic problems. The electorate is weary after years of high unemployment and slow growth, as last week's polls made clear. But there is little he can do to change things for the better. The French economy's downturn may well be reaching its nadir. Germany's post-unification expansion, which buoyed French exports and growth in 1990, has turned sour. But inflationary pressures remain, requiring the Bundesbank to keep the interest rates of all members of the European exchange rate mechanism at painfully high levels. German rates will remain high for some months yet. Greater cost Perversely, France's hard-won battle to reduce its inflation rate below that of Germany makes the real cost to it of Europe's tight monetary policy even greater. Nor will Mr Beregovoy find it easy to follow the lead of other European countries and relax fiscal policy. The one achievement after years of rigour is France's lonely position as the only important European country that meets all of the convergence criteria for European monetary union. In short, the French Socialist government will have to fight next year's general election against a background of sluggish growth and high unemployment, similar to that which in Britain may be about to deliver the first socialist government for more than a decade. Mr Kinnock's Labour party is also pledged to follow similarly monetarist policies to those of Socialist France. There are some lessons the British Labour party would be wise to learn from the French experience if it is not to follow its socialist brother's example. The French government's problems are compounded by its failure to tackle France's persistent long-term unemployment problem. Labour has a clearer idea of the combination of counselling and training needed to reduce long-term unemployment. But it must also avoid the over-zealous regulation that has stifled French job creation, discouraged women from joining the labour market and kept female and youth unemployment rates at very high levels in the 1980s. Ongoing strain If it wins next week, Labour may have five years in which to get its act together and see unemployment on a downward trend. But that might not be long enough. Even if German interest rates are falling by 1993, they are unlikely to fall very far. The fiscal strain of propping up east Germany will last for some years to come. Persistently high European real interest rates and a sluggish German economy are not auspicious for European growth. Nor would an ERM re-alignment allow interest rates outside Germany to fall further, although some form of re-alignment before monetary union may be inevitable for countries with persistent trade deficits such as Italy and possibly the UK. The strains imposed by Germany's economic difficulties will be especially tough for left-wing government to endure. Up to now, the French Socialists have judged the pains of a rigid ERM - slow growth and fiscal restraint - to be worth the gains in terms of enhanced credibility with financial markets and the promise of Emu. Mr John Smith and his Labour party colleagues have made the same judgment. Yet if European growth remains sluggish after 1993, and Emu is pushed further into the future, they will find life increasingly hard. Going forward to Emu or retreating to a more flexible ERM with independent national central banks, are both consistent with the agenda of Europe's social democratic left. But the status quo, if it persists into 1993 and beyond, may be too tough to tolerate.</p>

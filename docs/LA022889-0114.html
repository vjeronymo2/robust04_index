			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FUNERAL HOME HAS ITS LICENSE REVOKED  </P> <P> A state board Monday revoked the license of Lamb Funeral Home of Pasadena,  whose operators are awaiting trial on dozens of felonies, including improperly  cremating bodies and diverting earnings from prearranged funeral trust  accounts.  </P> <P> The state Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers in Sacramento said the  revocation, which becomes effective March 30, is the result of a stipulated  agreement under which Lawrence Lamb, who holds the license, agreed to a  voluntary revocation.  </P> <P> But the board announced that it had issued a new license, subject to stringent  conditions, to the Lamb Management Co., which is owned by Lawrence Lamb's sons,  Bruce and Kirk Lamb, who had no involvement in the previous operation.  </P> <P> Among the restrictions are that former operators of the business, Lawrence  Lamb's daughter, Laurieanne Lamb Sconce; her husband, Jerry Sconce, and their  son, David Sconce, have no relationship with the new business, to be known as  Pasadena Funeral Home.  </P> <P> The Sconces are awaiting trial in Pasadena Superior Court on nearly 70  felonies, including selling parts of 26 bodies for research without permission  of the next-of-kin. David Sconce additionally faces charges of soliciting the  murder of the former prosecutor in the case.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORRECTIVE COURSE FOR CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> One out of every eight American children are born in California. If this state  leads the way to prenatal care, other states will follow. As the industrialized  democracy with the worst record for infant mortality, the United States should  make a healthy birth for all its children a national priority. Our future must  not be stillborn.  </P> <P> Here's what Californians can do:  </P> <P>  -- Make access to prenatal care a right protected by the state Constitution.  An initiative that would establish this health right is being drafted for the  1992 ballot.  </P> <P>  -- Vote for candidates who pledge to make California the first state in  America to achieve universal prenatal care. This is not pie in the sky, but  fiscally sound: For every dollar spent in prenatal care, at least four are  saved in emergency and long-term care.  </P> <P>  -- Create a malpractice insurance cooperative to sell low-cost coverage for  obstetricians who provide comprehensive prenatal care to Medi-Cal mothers.  Malpractice insurance represents more than $200 of the cost of every birth.  </P> <P>  -- Restrict the sale of health-insurance plans with fine-print clauses stating  that prenatal care and delivery are not covered. Also, the commissioner of  insurance and private companies should find a way to insure families who do not  qualify for Medi-Cal and aren't covered by employer plans.  </P> <P>  -- Increase multicultural outreach programs to bring the message of preventive  care to women early in pregnancy.  </P> <P>  -- Give pregnant women priority in substance-abuse programs, which will have  to be expanded.  </P> <P>  -- Encourage childbirth and health-education classes. Prepared childbirth for  low-risk babies saves money and bonds families together.  </P> <P>  -- Expand model programs, such as the Comprehensive Perinatal Program, in  urban areas throughout the state. Programs geared to the special needs of rural  mothers and farm workers also must be developed.  </P> <P>  -- Provide maternity leave for families to nurture newborns in a stable  environment.  </P> <P>  -- Expand nutrition programs for pregnant mothers.  </P> <P>  -- Empower nurse midwives to participate more in low-risk births.  </P> <P>  -- Give prevention priority in health spending. Preventing emergencies saves  scarce resources for non-preventable emergencies.  </P> <P>  -- Don't lose sight of babies in the abortion debate. Demonstrators gather by  the thousands, but when a woman is turned down for prenatal care, she is alone.  Both sides should join together to support health care for mothers who want  their children to be born and grow up healthy. Jonathan Freedman  </P></p>

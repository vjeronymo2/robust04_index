			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UN fury at Serbs' broken promise UN officials in Sarajevo, whose patience with all the Bosnian parties is wearing thin, reacted with fury yesterday when Serb officials reneged on a promise to allow free passage to 11 convoys of vitally needed fuel. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN envoy in former Yugoslavia, expressed his 'outrage' to the Bosnian Serb leadership and won a pledge that one of the the convoys would be allowed to proceed, according to UN officials. The so-called safe havens for Moslems which the UN has established in eastern Bosnia are virtually out of fuel and other essentials because the Serbs have not allowed any convoys through this month. Meanwhile the Bosnian government army traded automatic fire with French peacekeepers as it began withdrawing from the positions which it recently established in defiance of the UN on the slopes of Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo. In principle, this withdrawal should marginally improve the atmosphere and clear the way for the convoys to start moving. But tension in the Sarajevo area was stoked by news that 11 Serb soldiers had been killed by the Moslem-led government army in a commando attack over the weekend. UN officials say the row over the convoys is the latest sign that their own room for manoeuvre in Bosnia, which has never been large, is shrinking. 'The behaviour of both parties is getting worse,' one UN official said. 'Peacekeeping requires consent, and at the moment that consent is begrudging at best.' UN commanders believe the Bosnian Serbs, militarily vulnerable and isolated by their erstwhile protectors in Belgrade, are taking out their frustration on the peacekeepers. UN officials have also been irritated by what they view as provocative behaviour by the Bosnian government, which has - in their view - taken advantage of the almost uncritical support it enjoys in Washington. Washington, frustrated by its allies' reluctance to authorise arms supplies to Bosnia, has been emphasising its strong political commitment to the leadership in Sarajevo, and keenness to see tougher use of air power against the Serbs. US officials are pointing to the hardship endured by Moslem civilians as an argument for stepping up support to their government. But UN workers privately retort that the Sarajevo leadership does not always co-operate with their efforts to relieve civilian suffering. General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, threatened at one point last month to invoke Nato air strikes against the government army. But he later had to admit that this threat was not a plausible one, given that the US - Nato's most powerful member - would never allow its aircraft to be used for that purpose.</p>

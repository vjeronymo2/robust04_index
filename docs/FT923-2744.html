			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon ahead to Pounds 60.6m - Interest charges sharply reduced following Pounds 149m rights issue INTEREST SAVINGS following its Pounds 149m rights issue last November helped MB-Caradon increase interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 60.6m. The interest charge fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 2.5m in the six months to June 30. The figures were in line with expectations and the shares initially rose on the news before falling back to close 12p down at 224p as analysts scaled down forecasts for the year. Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said demand had increased slightly immediately after the UK election in April but had then weakened again. Pre-interest profits from managed businesses - products such as double glazing, radiators and bathrooms, and cheque printing - rose 4.2 per cent to Pounds 42.5m on sales down 3.2 per cent at Pounds 324.7m. The group's 25.2 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the European packaging group, contributed Pounds 20.6m to profits, a rise of 15 per cent. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the UK building products business, where operating profits fell from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 17.9m, had suffered a 9 per cent volume fall in all, though with wide variations, but had increased prices 2 per cent. He said business was now 'bumping along the bottom' although without any sign of an upturn. The trend in profits would depend on how competitive rivals became on pricing. European building product operating profits were up 39 per cent to Pounds 7.5m partly because of the sale of the loss-making Austrian boiler business. Mr Jansen was cautious about the German market in the short term but expected growth in the longer term. Cheque printing, mainly based in the US, increased operating profits by 45 per cent to Pounds 17.1m. The first half of 1991 had been affected by costs of integrating American Bank Stationery, acquired in 1989. Benefits of the merger had now come through. Margins rose from 15 to 21 per cent, but Mr Jansen said it was aiming to reach the 25 per cent margins its main rivals achieved. The balance sheet was strong, Mr Jansen said, with gearing at 12 per cent. He said this gave the group the scope to make acquisitions although he said the lowest risk way of spending was investing in the group's existing businesses. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 24m in the first half, broadly covered by cashflow, Mr Daniel Cohen, finance director said. Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 7.6p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.75p, although this represents a 2.6 per cent rise when the scrip element of the rights issue is taken into account. Mr Hichens said that dividend was prudent. He said 'why stick your neck out at the half year?' The group would be better placed to decide on the appropriate dividend for the year when reporting full year profits next March. See Lex</p>

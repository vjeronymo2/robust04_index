Speaking to the Foreign Press Association, Rabin rejected  the  PLO's demands for more radical action against the Israeli  settlers in the territories. Jack Katzenell reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin made an  impassioned appeal to the Palestinian leadership not to allow  the late Barukh Goldstein to succeed in his aim of halting the  peace process by means of the atrocity at the Hebron mosque.  These are crucial days, Rabin said, and much will depend on how  quick the negotiations are resumed.    [Rabin] The longer it will be dragged, the more it will be  difficult to resume them, and the situation on the ground will  be complicated. I believe that at this stage, the leadership on  both sides -- the Palestinian and us -- has to stand up, to  overcome pain, sorrow, and agony, and to understand that the  real solution is in the political field.    [Katzenell] Rabin rejected Palestinian demands for the  disarming of all the settlers. For decades the settlers have  been the object of Palestinian terrorism, Rabin said, and even  since the Oslo agreement, they have been the victims of  terrorist attacks by the organizations opposed to the peace.    [Rabin] In coping with terror and violence, there were  Palestinian victims, mainly in confrontations with the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and other security forces, but terror by  Israelis, killing, was very rare, if at all.    [Katzenell] Rabin also rejected suggestions that the  settlers be evacuated from down-town Hebron. In his view, this  would mean accepting the Palestinian demand for immediate  negotiations on the future of the settlements, and that would be  a breach of the Declaration of Principles. If we reopen signed  agreements after only five months, Rabin said, what value will  there be to any new agreements that we sign with the  Palestinians. [end recording]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 2 March adds:  "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today warned against the  involvement of Russia in the peace process without coordination  with the Americans. Rabin said that parties to the negotiations  might take advantage of the absence of a Russian-U.S.  cooperation.    ["Speaking to foreign reporters, the prime minister said  Israel will continue imposing the closure on the territories for  as long as Israel believes it necessary. He added that the  attorney general is examining the possibility of issuing  additional detention orders against Kakh activists in the  territories. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that  Rabin further said: I have taken all the necessary steps to  prevent a massacre in Hebron, to the best of my discretion and  with the best means I had at my disposal."]</p>

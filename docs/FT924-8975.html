			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Tempestuous Russian with a lust for life - Poetry in Performance THE FIRST evening of this year's Poetry International Festival, which opened at the South Bank last weekend, was given over to a centenary celebration of the life and work of one of the most important Russian writers of the 20th century, Marina Tsvetayeva. Of the quartet of great Russian poets of our time - Pasternak, Mandelstam, Akhmatova and Tsvetayeva - Tsvetayeva was for many years the least well known in the west, and the poet who was largely responsible for introducing her work to English-speaking readers, Elaine Feinstein, opened the evening with an account of her life and work. Tsvetayeva was born in the comfortable bourgeois surroundings of fin de siecle Moscow. Her father was an art historian (and the creator of what is now known as the Pushkin Museum) and her mother a gifted pianist. But there was little warmth or gaiety in her childhood; and the relationship with her mother, though intense, was, like Tsvetayeva herself, extremely difficult. The mother inculcated in her precocious daughter a love for German romanticism, and Tsvetayeva's passionate devotion to all things German was to prove a complicating influence upon her difficult later life. 'Mother gave us to drink from the opened vein of lyricism,' she once wrote. Her childhood was peripatetic, and her adolescence lonely. In 1912, she met her future husband, Sergey Efron, in the Crimea, and recognised in him a soul mate. He, the child of revolutionaries, had been orphaned. She had just lost her mother. They clung together like children and were to do so for the next 30 years. It was a relationship of unequals. Tsvetayeva possessed the greater talent and had a ruthless determination to succeed at the task she had set herself of being a poet; Sergey, by comparison, was pallid and indecisive, and proved incapable of supporting his family. They married in 1912. Before the Revolution, life remained relatively privileged. Tsvetayeva's talents burgeoned into exquisite lyrical poetry with seeming ease, establishing the themes that would be her work's principal obsessions: poetry, Russia and love. She also had innumerable affairs with poets and actors in repeated attempts to slake her 'compulsive, feverish lust for life'. Sergey, hurt, remained as faithful as a dog. When the Revolution came, Sergey joined the White army and Tsvetayeva espoused the White cause with fervour - though not for reasons of profound political conviction. She feared the irresponsibility of the crowd, and was never convinced that revolution could be a 'purifying force.' It was also a humanist's response: sheer horror in the face of all that tragic waste of human life. Left behind in Moscow, she and her young family suffered the cold and famine of those terrible years. She burnt her books for heat; and travelled into the countryside to barter amber necklaces for scraps of food. Her domestic life was marked by confusion. 'The flat,' wrote the widow of the poet Mandelstam, 'is given over to dust, dirt and decay. There is an atmosphere of witchcraft.' The whereabouts of her husband remained unknown for years. One of her children starved to death in an orphanage. After the Reds triumphed, Tsvetayeva discovered that Sergey had escaped to Prague, where she joined him in 1923. It was no easy decision to leave Russia, no matter how great the hardships. Parting represented a kind of separation of the soul from the body. The Motherland, to the end, remained 'an absolute of memory and blood . . .' The experience proved a trigger for some of her finest poetry. Then began her 17 years of life as an emigre writer, spent in Berlin, Prague and finally Paris. The most intense moments of Tsvetayeva's life were lived through her writing  -her long and impassioned 'mystical marriage' by letter with the poet Boris Pasternak, for example, and the poetry that she never ceased to write. Outwardly, she may have looked slovenly and unkempt. Inwardly, she remained concentrated and resolved. In 1937, fate played its most heartless card. Sergey was accused of complicity in the murder of a Soviet agent who had refused to return to the USSR. He disappeared - back to the Soviet Union. Tsvetayeva, now branded the wife of a failed agent, followed him. The last four years resemble the horrid and almost improbably brutal final scenes of a Jacobean tragedy. Sergey was arrested and shot. Her daughter was sentenced to eight years in a labour camp for 'espionage'. Tsvetayeva hanged herself in August 1941. Earlier in that same day, according to Tsvetayeva's latest biographer in an intimate psychological portrait that will be published next month, Tsvetayeva's spoilt son may have harangued her for ruining his life. In the second half of the evening, 12 women poets - Wendy Cope, Fleur Adcock, Carol Ann Duffy and others - read in turn their own new translations of Tsvetayeva's poetry, and two Russian readers gave us the same poems in the original versions - and how astonishing was the contrast] On occasions like this one wonders how it is that English poets ever manage to make great poetry out of a language that can sound as emotionally shy as ours. But then perhaps it is not the fault of the language itself; perhaps it is something to do with our national character. Tsvetayeva was a poet of extreme emotionality, and listening to her poems in the Russian is like watching a wrestling match on television - there is rage and violence everywhere; sudden brutal lunges that can win the most hardened listener. Only Mimi Khalvati, a young poet who was born in Tehran, seemed to measure up to the challenge of representing her. When she read her translation of 'In Praise of the Rich', a wonderful piece of sustained sarcasm, the emotional shape of the poem - its sudden twists and turns, its hushes and its bellows - became immediately apparent. The rest of the poets simply lacked the emotional training to go the full distance with this tempestuous Russian. Tsvetayeva by Victoria Schweitzer will be published by Harvill (Pounds 20) at the end of November; Black Earth, a new collection of Tsvetayeva translations by Elaine Feinstein, has just been published by the Menard Press (Pounds 4.50).</p>

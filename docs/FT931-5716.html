			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mazda and Ford end venture talks MAZDA and Ford, the Japanese and US motor groups, have abandoned their negotiations to set up joint vehicle production in Europe. The breakdown of the talks is a serious setback to Mazda, which is left as the only one of the top five Japanese carmakers without a production base in Europe. Nissan, Toyota and Honda have developed their first European car assembly plants in the UK, while Mitsubishi is developing a joint car production venture with Volvo in the Netherlands. Mazda and Ford, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the Japanese carmaker, have studied a wide range of possible joint car projects for Europe, but Mazda said yesterday the talks had been discontinued 'for the time being'. The fruitless negotiations with Ford of Europe have lasted nearly four years and followed abortive talks with Saab, the Swedish carmaker. Mazda said yesterday that 'local sourcing' in Europe remained 'an important strategic consideration.' Mazda now planned to intensify its examination of options without Ford of Europe. 'We will be stepping up our studies of possible co-operative ventures with other European manufacturers. We would like to resolve the situation as soon as possible.' It refused to comment on earlier reports that it had held talks with Chausson, the French automotive engineering group. Ford said the talks with Mazda had been terminated because of 'concerns about the potential profitability of a co-operative European venture. We could not establish mutually acceptable economic results for a joint project.' Mazda's failure to develop a European production base will act as a serious brake on its growth in Europe during the remainder of the 1990s. Without local production it will be unable easily to circumvent the quota restrictions on direct exports from Japan to the European Community, which are scheduled to last to the end of the decade. Brussels is already pushing Japan to cut its export shipments to the EC this year in light of the steep decline forecast in new car demand. Tokyo and Brussels are in conflict over the interpretation of the understanding reached in 1991 over the development of Japanese car sales in Europe during the seven-year transition to a free market in 2000. Tokyo  - together with the UK government  - insist that local Japanese vehicle production in Europe is not included under the agreed ceilings for direct exports and the system for monitoring these shipments. Mazda is also studying the shipment of cars to Europe from its joint venture assembly plant with Ford in the US.</p>

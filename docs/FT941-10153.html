			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil below best after setting new high Sao Paulo ended 1.9 per cent higher in heavy trade in response to Congress approval late on Tuesday for the creation of a social welfare fund, the backbone of the government's stabilisation programme. The market was nearly 5 per cent up at the close of the previous session. Profit-taking left the market below the day's best with the Bovespa index ahead 1,668 at 90,467 in turnover of Cr221.4bn. Some traders said that buying was prompted by short-covering in the Bovespa futures market. Central bank officials have said that they intend to keep monetary policy tight after the adoption of a single price index to try to prevent consumer spending from rising. The government has vowed to bring the country's 40 per cent monthly inflation down by pegging prices to the new index. Mexican stocks rose to a new peak in early trading, helped by a fall in domestic interest rates, but later declined on profit-taking. The IPC index was finally 21.54 down at 2,859.63, after setting an intraday all-time high of 2,895.89, near to the psychologically important 2.900 level. The central bank said that the 28-day Treasury bill interest rate would be cut to 9.72 per cent.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Ethics and worse AMERICAN BUSINESS schools have long been preoccupied with business ethics. Not so their counterparts in Britain. Despite the all-pervasive scandals of the 1980s, there is a tendency in Europe to regard the study of business ethics as faddish. Dixons, which is giving Pounds 1m to the London Business School for a chair in business ethics, clearly thinks otherwise, and with good reason. Those who appeal to Adam Smith's description of naked self-interest as the driving force behind wealth creation forget that Smith was also a moral philosopher. It would never have occurred to him that the hidden hand of market forces could operate outside a moral context. Nor would he have been surprised at the way companies as diverse as Levi Strauss and The Body Shop have turned social and moral concerns to competitive advantage. Yet it is equally possible for firms to win competitive advantage through corrupt practices, such as bribery. Failure to do so may even lead to loss of competitive advantage. In other cases the moral landscape may be transformed by scientific advances or changed public perceptions, leaving managers in an invidious position. Short of closing down an industry that employs millions across the world, how should the captains of the tobacco industry respond to changed perceptions about the threat to health? There seems little doubt that bad ethics can give business a bad name. Retail investors have deserted the Japanese stock market because they feel, not without justice, that they wandered inadvertently into a den of thieves. Low standards of entrepreneurial behaviour in Australia in the 1980s did unquantifiable damage to that country's standing in international markets. The case for studying business ethics is that they are difficult and that they matter. Since when have ethics been faddish?</p>

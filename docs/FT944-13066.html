			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Conservatives put on a brave face over 'sleaze' Conservative MPs escaped to their constituencies from the hothouse of Westminster yesterday hoping desperately that the steady drip of 'sleaze' allegations against the government has been staunched. Publicly, they were putting on a brave face, arguing that with 2 1/2 years to go before the next general election, the government has plenty of time to recover its lost popularity. Many offered a parallel with the Westland affair in 1985-86, which came close to bring-ing down the government, but was followed by Baroness Thatcher's overwhelming victory in the 1987 general election. MPs from both sides of the party dismissed most of the allegations as either trivial or unfounded, but there were sharp differences on Mr John Major's handling of the affair. Most mainstream MPs believe the prime minister coped reasonably well in trying circumstances. Many were pleased by his fighting performance at prime minister's question time on Thursday, when he angrily dismissed Labour probing. But right-wingers were largely dismissive, claiming that the prime minister had displayed weakness and disloyalty, especially to Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister who resigned earlier this week. 'The problem is that his decision to sack Neil, even though the allegations against him were unfounded, has left every minister open to challenge. We just don't know who's next,' said one. The right was also angry with newspaper reporting of the events of the week, claiming that trivial and unsubstantiated allegations had been unfairly exploited to embarrass ministers. 'I've been told that newspapers have four more names which are going to be released at the rate of one a month,' a senior rightwing backbencher claimed confidentially. Conspiracy fantasies aside, the party has clearly been deeply wounded by the controversy. 'It is devastating us,' a senior member of the 1922 committee of backbenchers admitted. 'We are just hoping it will go away. But the real danger is that there will be more (allegations). If that happens we are in real trouble,' he said. Another backbencher, fiercely loyal to the prime minister, argued that he had laid the groundwork for a government fightback by setting up the standing committee on public standards, to be chaired by Lord Nolan. But she admitted: 'All this is hurting us a lot. It has lowered our morale. We were already unpopular because of the recession; now people think we are crooked as well as incompetent.' In a sign of the times, departing MPs of all parties rushed to comply with Commons rules that payments and overseas visits must be entered in the Commons register of interests within four weeks. Scrutiny of the register revealed a number of oversights by MPs on both sides, notably by Mr Bernie Grant, Labour MP for Tottenham, who added seven free or subsidised overseas trips to his previous declaration. 'It's crazy really,' said one MP. 'Many of these things are pretty minor, and this is the first chance most people have had to register things since the summer break. But in the current climate everyone has to be squeaky clean.'</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> BROKEN SPRINKLER SYSTEM CLOSES COURT FOR HALF OF DAY  </P> <P> Criminal proceedings resumed Wednesday after being washed out Tuesday morning  by a broken sprinkler system on the top floor of the Compton Courthouse.  </P> <P> "It was like it was raining in here," said Michele Watson, a secretary who  works in the seventh-floor offices of the Los Angeles County district attorney.  </P> <P> Both the Superior Court branch and the Municipal Court are housed in the  building, which was evacuated and closed at noon, although the breach in a  sprinkler system reservoir occurred early in the morning.  </P> <P> When the water first began seeping through the top floors, arraignment  proceedings were moved to the basement. But the fire marshal eventually ordered  the facility closed.  </P></p>

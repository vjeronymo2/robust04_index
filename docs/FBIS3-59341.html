			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Xie Zhi'an (6200 3112 1344) and Ding </F> Daishu (0002 0108 2579): "Clear Choice for Reducing Losses of  Individual Enterprise Tax Revenues: Individual Tax Revenue  Avoidance Schemes and Corrective Policies"]    [Text] With the rapid expansion of the individual economy  we have had on the one hand incessant growth in individual tax  resources which has created excellent conditions for the  expansion of individual tax revenues. According to statistics,  in 1992 the Chengdu individual economy (individual industrial  and commercial households, private enterprises, market fairs)  provided tax revenues of 180 million yuan, approximately 8  percent of that city's revenues. Individual tax revenues  represent about 10 percent of the province's  industrial-commercial tax revenues: Last year alone the province  took in 820 million yuan in taxes (excluding Chongqing). On the  other hand, because some of these entrepreneurs do not pay much  attention to taxation, the market mechanisms are not fully  developed, tax collection policies and collection methodologies  are less than perfect, and because of the number and quality of  our tax collectors, the phenomenon of "avoiding, cheating,  minimizing and evading" taxes is commonplace among  entrepreneurs, and seems to be growing as well.    What is needed is to promote the healthy growth of the  individual and private economy on the one hand and on the other  to reduce to the lowest level possible all losses in state tax  revenues. This is presently the most prominent and most pressing  problem awaiting solution in the area of individual taxation.  Some days ago these reporters visited the provincial and Chengdu  city tax departments and discovered that at the present time  there are the following four main problems in individual  enterprise taxation.    1. The collection of individual enterprise taxes is very  difficult, our ability to levy and administer taxes is very  weak. To avoid taxes, some individual and private enterprises  use such tricks as not keeping records of income, false  registration of ownership, bogus contracts, falsification of  rents and leases, falsification of joint operations, and so  forth. And the inadequate resources for levying and  administration exacerbates the difficulty of collecting  individual enterprise taxes. According to statistics, the  Chengdu Tax Bureau handles taxes for some 150,000 individual  enterprises, but they only have 410 tax department cadres  responsible for the direct administration or the shared  administration of individual enterprise taxation, so each  officer administers an average of 390 enterprises. At the  Hehuachi Market in Chengdu, the average tax cadre administers  427 enterprises. The uneven ideological and cultural  qualifications and temporary nature of the 1,300 plus auxiliary  tax officers also exerts a certain influence on the normalized  development of individual enterprise taxation.    2. Some individual and private enterprises are changing into  cooperative-run, state-run, or foreign-funded enterprises. In  the past several years the concerned departments in this  province have time and again attempted to clean up the "four  false enterprises" (false cooperatives, false state run, false  foreign invested, false subsidiaries) but their numbers continue  to grow. In 1990 alone the Chengdu City Tax Bureau uncovered  over 4,000 "four false" enterprises within the city. At  present, many individual and private operators, in order to cut  their taxes, are changing themselves into cooperatives, or  state-owned, or foreign-funded enterprises, and registering  subsidiary ownership, thus causing severe losses in individual  enterprise tax revenues. (There is also the fact that some  street management offices are requiring individual enterprises  to change to cooperative enterprises in order to increase their  own management fee income.) Three of Chengdu's major areas --  Qingnian Road, Ranfang Street, and Nanshuwa Street -- have been  affected by the change from individual to cooperative  enterprises. In 1992 there was a decrease of 190 individual  enterprises, and the tax revenue for the three districts dropped  410,000 yuan.    3. Interregional operations currently represent one of the  big drains of tax revenues. Over the past several years the  economic contacts and exchange of products between regions,  between city and countryside, between the interior provinces and  the outlying regions have become more closely linked day by day.  However, the tax collection and tax administration departments  of the various localities only pay attention to the end of the  operation in their location; add to this all the trouble caused  by regional protectionism, and a huge leak in individual and  private enterprise tax revenues is created. Some individual  household and privately run operations are registering as  subsidiary operations under state-owned and cooperative  enterprises, nominally opening offices or warehouses in Chengdu  or other districts but in reality they carry out independent  operational activities; some so called non-independent  accounting units in reality have no accounting relationship with  any parent organization; some register as branch operation  subsidiaries of special economic zone companies or enterprises,  but in reality neither end of the operation pays income taxes.  For instance, early last year a Guangdong individual enterprise  entrepreneur, nominally registered as a subsidiary joint  operation of a certain Chengdu electrical equipment company, in  actuality was just an individual household operation, and was  responsible for some 100,000 yuan in lost tax revenue.    4. False use of an enterprise's name, operating without a  license. Some individual entrepreneurs have no operating  license or tax registration, falsely use the name of some  state-run enterprise (that is, of some duly licensed state run  enterprise, but with which it has no accounting relationship and  is not a branch organ) to carry on operations and avoid taxes  for long periods of time. For instance, a certain Chengdu  private enterprise operator used this method to operate without  a license from July 1991 to March 1992; she was investigated and  punished and made to pay over 53,000 yuan in back taxes.    Experience has proven that if we want to promote the growth  of the individual and private economy and also want to reduce  state tax losses to the lowest level possible, then the key is  the strengthening and reform of tax collection work. At the  present time, the administration of individual taxation is in  the form of democratic evaluation, tax bureau approval and  periodic collection. With the expansion of the market economy,  this formulation no longer meets the requirements of the  developing situation. A somewhat better method would be, for  the individual and private enterprises, to set up accounts and  establish licenses, collect taxes according to the account  audits. We should strengthen the license issuing administration  system, truly implement figuring taxes according to rates and  collecting taxes according to the laws. At the present stage,  because a lack of understanding of the idea of taxation  according to law among the individual and private enterprises,  plus the inadequate collection and administrative force of the  tax departments, it will be difficult to render the system  scientific, standardized and systematic in a short period of  time. At the present stage we could implement quota-determined  tax calculations, appraise and fix a base figure and then in  succeeding years calculate and levy taxes according to a certain  ratio, modifying treatment according to differences and changes  in the different districts, different businesses, different  ports and markets. Use a "give the fish plenty of water" policy  to cultivate tax revenue resources. The second is that the  preferential tax treatment policies enjoyed by all the economic  elements of all types of ownership systems in the same region  should be equitable and rational, avoiding lopsidedness of too  much or too little. Thirdly, hire ample tax collection and  administration personnel for handling the individual  industrial-commercial households and privately run enterprises,  gradually achieving a level where each official on the average  handles 100 enterprises. At the same time, bolster the ranks of  the auxiliary tax force, set up a full fledged network for  aiding and protecting the tax workers, overcoming the abuses of  taxation by whim and the seeking of personal benefit that still  exists in the tax collection process.    Looking at the long term, we should take a cue from  international examples, push for the modernization and  socialization reforms of tax collection and administration. In  this regard, the Haikou City Tax Bureau in Hainan supplied us  with an experience worth examining. Their method is this: they  have abolished the traditional method of a specialist tax  officer being in charge of the tax collection and administration  of each household and changed from administration by household  to administration by category; they have changed from having the  taxpayer report in to pay taxes to having the taxpayer  initiating the payments, and being held responsible for the  contents of her tax report. Components of the tax departments,  in order to meet the requirements of specialized division of  labor, have devised a administration by category method of  operation, eliminating the investigation units in the  sub-bureaus and having the city-level investigation unit provide  uniform leadership and control. At lower levels they instituted  various and numerous smaller units having investigative powers,  authority to open case files, and authority to levy and accept  registration fees, and so gradually moving toward  specialization. The main responsibility of the tax sub-bureau  is the collection of tax moneys, and tax law propaganda work; as  for enterprise tax collection, it is all done under computer  control, the tax collector directly collecting taxes or carrying  out taxation through some social intermediary organization  acting as agent. At the same time, they have strengthened tax  collection audit work, and set up tax law offices. They are  gradually setting up a new tax system wherein the tax offices  levy taxes by computer according to the law, the taxpayers  themselves report and pay their taxes, there are social  intermediary organs to act as tax agents, and the judicial  organs handle tax law violation cases according to the law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pratyathawi Tawethikun, deputy permanent secretary  of the Foreign Ministry, commented during a press briefing this  afternoon on the U.S. citing Thailand as a country where the sex  trade and the exploitation of women and children are rampant.  He said that the Thai Government has been trying to both  suppress and prevent prostitution and the abuse of women and  children. He said the problem exists not only in Thailand, but  everywhere, and therefore it is unfair to accuse Thailand in  that manner.    Regarding the procurement of Thai women for prostitution  abroad, the deputy permanent secretary said those responsible  for the trade are foreigners, including the American people  themselves who lure Thai women for prostitution with the  connivance of Thai people. He believed other countries have an  understanding for Thailand regarding the U.S. accusation. The  Foreign Ministry and Thai embassies will explain this matter to  foreigners for the sake of better understanding. They will also  launch a campaign to prevent Thai women from being lured for  prostitution abroad.</p>

This proposal would require an inspection to determine the model and orientation of certain flight control rods, and replacement with modified rods, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of corrosion found on the pitch trim and rudder trim rods. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent problems associated with corrosion of the flight control rods, which could compromise the required strength of these items. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;84&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes. (This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted as a part of a sampling program carried out by the manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by water accumulating in the lower part of the rods and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards), which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0071, dated February 23, 1994, describes procedures for inspecting the elevator trim rod and rudder trim rod to determine the orientation of the open rod end. It also describes procedures for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation of water between the internal and external tubes of the rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;003&hyph;053(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0048, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for reversing the installation of the ends of the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods so that the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

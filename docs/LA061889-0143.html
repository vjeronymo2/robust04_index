			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 100 YEARS OF JOY IN A TINY SANCTUARY;  </P> <P> 36 COUPLES RENEW VOWS AT CHURCH OF THE ANGELS' CENTENNIAL  </P> <P> Exactly 64 years later, right down to the date and hour, Louise and Charles  Fishburn repeated their marriage vows and kissed again, just as they had in  that same place June 11, 1925, at 3 in the afternoon.  </P> <P> This time there was no price sticker on the sole of a shoe to embarrass the  bride, as there had been the first time she knelt at the altar of the Church of  the Angels.  </P> <P> At that same Pasadena Episcopal church on April 6, 1963, Ralph and Barbara  Villani's wedding guests forgot to bring rice, so they tossed grits, the  closest last-minute substitute they could scrounge from the vicar's wife.  </P> <P> Funny, beautiful, tearful and sentimental moments were relived last Sunday at  the quaint historic 100-year-old church on Pasadena's Avenue 64, where 36  couples returned to renew their wedding vows.  </P> <P> The occasion was a celebration of the Church of the Angels' centennial, an  event that began on Easter and will end on St. Michael and All Angels Day on  Sept. 24. The church's cornerstone was laid the day before Easter in 1889, and  the completed building was consecrated just in time to be named for All Angels  Day that year.  </P> <P> In its first century, 3,000 weddings were recorded in the Church of the Angels'  registry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Built as Memorial  </P> <P> Built as a memorial to landowner Alexander Robert Campbell-Johnston by his  widow, the tiny church was patterned after the British couple's favorite  Holmbury St. Mary's Church in Surrey, England.  </P> <P> In 1889, the 3,000-acre Johnston-Campbell farmland was in an area known as  Garvanza, later to be called Highland Park. The church is one of the Episcopal  Diocese's oldest buildings and has always served an active, albeit small,  parish. It seats 125 and has about 75 families in its membership. It is a  registered historic landmark and remains almost exactly as it was when first  built.  </P> <P> Made of sandstone, red brick and redwood, with a huge stained glass window,  pipe organ and beautiful handcrafted pulpit, lectern, baptistery and statuary,  it was a popular wedding site from the beginning.  </P> <P> "We could easily have three weddings a week, but we try to serve as an  Episcopal parish church and not a wedding chapel," said the rector, the Rev.  Robert Gaestel. Newlyweds are required to attend the church and have premarital  counseling sessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Now  </P> <P> There are now only about 12 weddings there in a year, Gaestel said.  </P> <P> History was relived for those who returned Sunday for the special 3 p.m.  ceremony and champagne-and-cake reception. The church was decorated as if for a  wedding, with white ribbons marking the pews, each of which seats only five or  six people. Each "bride" received a miniature bouquet and the men were given  boutonnieres.  </P> <P> The Fishburns, who lived in Pasadena for many years and now make their home in  South Laguna, were the longest-married of the guests. They chose the church in  1925 for its beauty and its small size because, they said, they were new to the  area and didn't know enough people to fill a large church.  </P> <P> "I wish I could find my gown," Louise Fishburn said. "I think I must have  misplaced it about 50 years ago." The newest newlyweds were Tsuzumi and Patrick  Timothy Day, who married this year on St. Patrick's Day. They said they chose  the church because he grew up in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflection of the Times  </P> <P> In between there were marriages that reflected America's history. Robert and  Augusta Sherman of Whittier were married during the Depression in 1934 and  returned for their 50th anniversary in 1984. "It blessed us, that's why we  lasted so long," Robert Sherman said.  </P> <P> Richard and Josie Hansen of San Marino and V. N. and Lillian Williams of  Oceanside were married Nov. 28, 1936, at a double wedding that only their  families attended because there wasn't room for anyone else. The two women had  been grade school chums, and both couples returned for Sunday's event.  </P> <P> Dr. and Mrs. T. Burton Smith of Brentwood married there in July, 1943, because,  they said, during World War II "it was not appropriate to have a big wedding."  From 1984 to 1986, Smith, a urologist, served as President Reagan's physician  in Washington.  </P> <P> Kay Laber Case of Pico Rivera, who grew up next door in what was then known as  the Episcopal Church Home for Children, married Charles Case in the church in  1954. "I started in the home at age 5, so this was really home to me," she  said.  </P> <P> The Church Home for Children, a large complex of buildings that shares the  church site, was for children whose parents couldn't provide homes for them.  Now called Hillsides, it serves as a sanctuary for abused children.  </P> <P> Brooke and Edward Garlock chose the Church of the Angels for their Aug. 14,  1976, wedding because of its size.  </P> <P> "My mother wanted All Saints," Brooke Garlock said, referring to the Episcopal  church that is one of Pasadena's largest. "She only wanted to invite the whole  city," her husband said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Anniversary  </P> <P> Roger and Lani Leigh, who married in the tiny church on June 11, 1988,  celebrated their first anniversary in their wedding finery -- he in gray dress  clothes, she in a long lace-and-pearl gown. She was one of three brides who  wore their wedding dresses for the celebration.  </P> <P> In a brief talk during the service, Gaestel said: "From the time the church  opened to the present there have been tremendous changes in how people think  about marriages. Not long ago, people didn't want to be married in church at  all, and women didn't want to be 'given away' from one man to another. Couples  wanted to be married in a park or on a beach and to write their own vows. Now  traditional church weddings have come back with a vengeance."  </P> <P> Sue Schechter, chairman of the centennial, said no exact records have been kept  of the couples who married in the church, so it was impossible to track them  down. Most contact was by word of mouth and publicizing in the church bulletin.  </P> <P> As it was, the 36 couples and their families filled the church.  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: APV shares slip 8p as profits fall to Pounds 30.8m SHARES in APV fell by 8p to 108p yesterday after the food manufacturing equipment maker reported a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.8m in the year to December 31. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said orders in the second half of 1991 did not repeat the sharp decline experienced in the corresponding period of 1990, so the full-year order intake last year was about 5 per cent higher than in 1990. However, a bunching of orders towards the year-end meant the group was unlikely to achieve the same level of profit in the first half of this year as it did in 1991, when pre-tax profits were Pounds 14.5m. Overall APV said it entered 1992 with an order book 15 per cent above the level a year earlier, and indications so far were that the overall order intake was broadly in line with that experienced at the same time last year. Turnover last year grew by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 874.4m, while earnings per share were 23 per cent down at 6.9p (9p). An unchanged final dividend of 3.4p is proposed maintaining the total at 5.4p. Gearing rose slightly from 40.4 per cent to 42.1 per cent. APV makes more than 80 per cent of its sales overseas and said that continuing recession in the UK, US and Australia, along with signs of a slowdown in Germany, had not encouraged investment. While the food and beverage sector was resilient, the prevailing economic environment meant there was a tendency to defer capital expenditure. Last year APV's return on sales margin fell from 5.8 per cent to 4.7 per cent. Over tha past two years, APV has shed about 1,800 jobs worldwide, and the group said further action would be taken to reduce operating costs where necessary. Restructuring costs of Pounds 8.9m were offset by the release of a fair value provision of Pounds 5.9m, leading to a net extraordinary charge of Pounds 3m.</p>

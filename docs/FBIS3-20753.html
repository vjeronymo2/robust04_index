			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Joint declaration: "Center Accord-PSL (Polish Peasant </F> Party)-Peasant Accord-Christian National Union: Economic and  Social Principles"]    [Text] A crucial prerequisite for the attainment of worthy  national, social, and personal aspirations is a strong and  growing economy. Its formation must be promoted by a proper  policy of the state.    1. The state must provide the conditions for the growth of  an  economy which shall be dominated by private ownership of  manufacturing, commercial, and service establishments.    1.1. Once the share of the private sector in the Polish  economy exceeds 50 percent in terms of both employment and  generation of national income, its further growth should be  principally decided by the increase in the number and size of  family-owned enterprises (and farms) in agriculture, industry,  trade, and services. In addition to eliminating the impediments  to freedom of private enterprise under law it is necessary for  the government to pursue a tax policy that supports the growth  of private business and promotes business investments.    The experience of many countries proves that, in order to  grow, small business needs a policy of credit preferences by  means of credit-price subsidies, the creation of a system of  credit guarantees and of the institutions providing such  guarantees, and the building of an infrastructure supporting the  private sector in terms of consultantcy 33 and promotion.    1.2. Of special importance to not only the growth of the  private sector but also to righting a fundamental wrong is the  reprivatization of the property seized by the communists--in  kind whenever possible or in monetary or material form whenever  so dictated by social considerations.    1.3. The privatization of "socialized" plants should be  continued upon promoting in particular employee privatization  which turns broad strata of the population into proprietors.    2. An important objective of government policy should be the  promotion of investment by foreign capital whenever this means  creating new jobs, opening access to foreign markets for Polish  goods and producers, and introducing new technologies in our  country.    2.1. A basic prerequisite for attracting major capital  investment to Poland is the stability of tax laws, and  especially of the income-tax and VAT rates.    2.2. In general, individually negotiated tax and duty  exemptions should be eliminated and regular tax and fee rebates  should be introduced for investors--also through the  establishments of various kinds of economic zones and areas.    2.3. The protection of the domestic market should be  strengthened and the practice of establishing duty-free quotas  for domestically manufactured finished products abandoned.    3. Spending on science and education should be treated as  capital  investment.    3.1. Research subsidies provided by the state budget should  enable our science to stay abreast of the accomplishments of  world science.    3.2. Support by means of subsidies, tax exemptions, or duty  exemptions should be provided to both basic research in  particular domains and applied R&amp;D work.    3.3. Support by means of both tax policy and subsidies  should  be provided to educational centers and students.    4. Economic policy should promote optimal conditions for  economic cooperation with the countries of the European Union,  these being most favorable to Poland.    5. In current economic policy an particularly important  objective is to combat unemployment, and especially unemployment  among young people.    5.1. Special protection by means of economic instruments  should be provided to domestic manufacturers and products.    5.2. By means of a broad variety of instruments ranging from  the policy on currency rates of exchange through tax exemptions  and credit 3I3 preferences to diplomatic moves, exports of  Polish products and services should be promoted.    5.3. Tax and credit preferences should promote production  for  export.    5.4. Tax and credit policy should promote investment to an  extent sufficing to halt the growth in unemployment in 1994 and  to reduce unemployment by at least 1 million in 1995.    5.5. Tax preferences should be granted for investments in  regions with highest unemployment.    5.6. A program for building superhighways on the basis of  non-state financing should be initiated.    5.7. A program for training unemployed young people 16 to 23  years old should be initiated most urgently.    6. Strengthening the family should be a long-range objective  of social policy, and it should be promoted by economic policy.    6.1. Family allowances should be preserved as an entitlement  for which all families with underage children and child-raising  homemakers are eligible.    6.2. The legal minimum wage should assure decent living  conditions for the employee and, when family allowances are  included, also for his/her family.    6.3. Tax policy should strengthen family life by means of a  joint tax return for all persons living in a joint household.    7. Social policy should assure the material security of  retirees. The traditional ratio of retirement pensions to the  mean wage should be retained, and they should be subject to  cost-of-living adjustments.    7.1. Similar protection should be extended to sickness  benefits, especially for persons who cannot support themselves  by working.    7.2. The state should promote the growth of private  insurance  companies.    8. All citizens should be guaranteed a minimum of health  care.    8.1. The universal nature of health care should be assured  by  universal compulsory health insurance.    8.2. Citizens should have access to additional group and  individual insurance.    9. Social policy should promote, by means of various  instruments, adequate housing with allowance for the financial  possibilities of individual citizens.    9.1. The state should promote the growth of credit  institutions and the purchases of housing, and it should pursue  a tax policy promoting 33 housing construction and personal  spending on housing (also by means of a credit and payment  system).    9.2. Local governments should, upon appropriate support from  the state budget, expand the infrastructure of land development  and housing and support the construction of private rental  housing.    10. Employees of the state administration, the procurature,  the judiciary, the police, and the military, as well as teachers  should be afforded special protection of their occupations and  incomes.    11. Current social policy should principally focus on  alleviating the consequences of the unfavorable development of  the economic situation, and especially the consequences of  unemployment and inflationary growth of the cost of living.</p>

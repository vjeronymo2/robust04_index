Name of Standard. Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications. (Former Draft Federal Standard 1093).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Category of Standard. Telecommunications Standard; Grounding and Bonding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explanation. This standard, by adoption of ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;607&hyph;1994, Commercial Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications, specifies the requirements for a uniform telecommunications grounding and bonding infrastructure that should be followed within Federal buildings where telecommunications equipment is installed. The standard provides the requirements for a ground reference for telecommunications systems within the telecommunications entrance facility, the telecommunications closet, and equipment room; it also provides the requirements for bonding and connecting pathways, cable shields, conductors, and hardware at telecommunications closets, equipment rooms, and entrance facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This standard supports the telecommunications infrastructure which encompasses telecommunications equipment spaces, cable pathways, grounding, wiring, termination hardware, and other devices, and which provides the basic support for the distribution of all forms of information within a building or campus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grounding and bonding approach described in this standard is consistent with the cabling topology specified in Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 174, Federal Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard (ANSI/EIA/TIA&hyph;568&hyph;1991) and installed in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces (ANSI/EIA/TIA&hyph;569&hyph;1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> A Bow to Tradition: James Griffith's paintings, which blend historic European  landscape painting with botanical and formalist studies, are wonderfully dense  and inviting. Each canvas contains a dark fragment of brownish atmosphere  overlaid with a snip of chiaroscuro vegetation that's been done with remarkable  painterly quickness and accuracy.  </P> <P> Panels of thick white paint surround and cut into this area of spatial  illusion, simultaneously defining and isolating that conceit. A final layer of  intellectualization is applied by a large, needle-fine incised plant form that  cuts over both painting and white ground.  </P> <P> The nearly invisible linear plant shape, which suggests a stylized baroque  stencil, deftly but gently unifies the flat white space with more traditionally  painted areas of the canvas. It also adds a surprising amount of movement to  the static geometry of the two opposing areas. Richly resonant with the  traditions of painting from Rembrandt to Robert Ryman, each canvas seems to  argue for a simultaneous exploration of realist and abstract formal concerns.  Together the separate panels gain strength and fresh meaning from their  improbable juxtaposition. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to March 31.)  -- S. G.  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: European sector anticipates German official rate cut THE DECISION by the Bundesbank to reduce its repo rate by 20 basis points to 6.95 per cent convinced international government bond markets that German official rates would be cut today. Reflecting concern over economic credibility, long-dated German government bonds fell back, while short-term prices, which signpost interest rate moves, held firm. Meanwhile, French government bond prices held steady and Italian paper rose on switching from the German market. Economists had expected a fall of between 10 and 15 basis points in the German repo to just above 7 per cent following the level that overnight money had reached previously. However, there was so much liquidity in the market following the heavy foreign exchange intervention to support the French franc over recent days that the Bundesbank had to offer a lower rate to the commercial banks as an incentive to bid for loans. By the close last night there was a consensus that the council will announce a half-point cut in the 6.75 per cent discount rate which sets the floor for German lending, and the same amount for the Lombard rate, which sets the ceiling. Any reduction would be contrary to the Bundesbank's stated policy of holding rates high in the face of inflationary pressures. Consequently, it could dent the bank's economic credibility and affect sentiment in long-dated bunds which is relatively closely bound up with confidence in sound economic policies. The September 10-year bund futures contract traded on Liffe fell 30 pfennigs to 95.90, while short-dated paper was steady. Meanwhile, the 10-year Notionell future for September eased only 2 centimes from Tuesday's close to 120.18 and was trading higher after the official close. However, the strongest potential for further easing was considered to be outside the ERM and the Italian September futures contract traded on Liffe jumped nearly half a point from 104.57 to 104.92. THE SUCCESS of the latest Pounds 3.25bn auction for UK government bonds surprised most participants and provided an opportunity for the gilts market to continue its upward momentum. September gilt futures shot forward by more than a per centage point to 109 1/32 before retreating in the face of profit-takers to close nearly half a point up at 108 7/16 . The government auction of 7 per cent stock maturing in 2001 was covered 2.29 times against expectations of between one and two times and against the miserable cover of 1.1 times at the last big auction a month ago. The stock was placed at an average accepted price of 97 3/16 , giving a yield of 7.46 per cent. The cover partly reflected the fact that dealers had positioned themselves better this time and the relevant section of the yield curve had fallen acceptably ahead of the auction. More significantly, there was no tail - the gap between the lowest accepted bid price and the average bid price - which pointed to very fierce bidding. It appears that US funds bought heavily against expectations that an eight-year maturity would be shunned by overseas buyers who prefer 10-year stocks. US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday following a strong afternoon auction of five-year notes. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 106 3/32 , yielding 6.648 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.201 per cent. Prices opened lower, primarily because of the announcement of a 3.8 per cent rise in June durable goods orders, an increase that was three times as large as market forecasts. The goods orders data is notoriously volatile, however, and analysts pointed out that if commercial aircraft orders were excluded, the rise was only 0.3 per cent. Consequently, prices gradually recovered their lost ground, and by late morning had edged into positive territory. Hopes that the afternoon sale of the Dollars 11bn five-year notes would go well was also behind the market's recovery. Those hopes were met when the auction was completed amid strong demand. The longer end posted further gains later in the day after the White House confirmed that President Clinton was considering cutting back spending on government entitlements as part of his deficit-reduction drive.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] We spoke to Grigoriy Yavlinskiy on the  telephone today.    [Begin recording] [Yavlinskiy] The fact that Yegor Gaydar  did  not want to be a decorative figure is quite understandable.  This confirms the thought that it is not right to use one's  name to adorn the government. Therefore, I believe, this was  not a surprise. He has been aware for quite a long time that he  cannot influence the policy, he still continued to create an  illusion that these reforms are such and such and that they  should proceed in such and such a way and that this is indeed  the government's policy of reforms.    [Unidentified correspondent] Grigoriy Alekseyevich, if you  are offered a post in the government, will you agree?    [Yavlinskiy] Who exactly will offer it to me?    [Unidentified correspondent] The prime minister, probably,  or  maybe the president.    [Yavlinskiy] I think it is unlikely that the president will  propose this to me.    [Unidentified correspondent] What about the prime minister?    [Yavlinskiy] This is of no importance.    [Unidentified correspondent] Let us say this happened. Would  you enter the new government or do you also believe that now it  is impossible to do anything in the government?    [Yavlinskiy] I could formulate very many proposals that I  believe are the necessary prerequisites for the government to be  able to improve the situation in a limited period of time, let  us say over a year. These prerequisites include cadre  reshuffles, the elimination of corruption in the government, a  clear-cut political policy with regard to reforms, the absence  of compromises on what has to be done and, first and foremost,  the acknowledgment of what was done wrong with the aim of  correcting it. I think that nobody is ready for this. [end  recording]</p>

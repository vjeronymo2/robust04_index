			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT COUNCIL TO CONSIDER 10 P.M. CURFEW AT BEACHES  </P> <P> The Newport Beach City Council on Monday night will consider setting a 10 p.m.  curfew at city beaches in an effort to reduce late-night revelry that  oceanfront residents say invades their privacy and keeps them awake.  </P> <P> City beaches, which stretch from the Santa Ana River south to the Wedge at the  Newport Harbor entrance, now close at midnight.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach, San Clemente and Seal Beach have midnight curfews; Laguna  Beach essentially has none. Some state beaches, such as the Newport  Beach-operated Corona del Mar State Beach, close at 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Because their front yards are shared by the public, Newport residents living on  the water's edge say they are continually subjected to traffic and noisy  beach-goers long past midnight. So they have banded together in asking the City  Council to adopt what they say is a fair compromise.  </P> <P> "We are just virtual prisoners," said Dayna Pettit, president of the Balboa  Peninsula Point Assn., one of three homeowner groups lobbying for the early  beach closure.  </P> <P> "We're not against partying," Pettit said. "But there has to be a time when the  city effects measures that balance the rights of the tourists and property  owners."  </P> <P> To avoid a legal fight over that balance, Chief of Police Arb Campbell and  Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn and his staff are urging the City  Council to reject the idea.  </P> <P> Instead, Wynn and Campbell are recommending the installation of lights facing  the shoreline on the beach flanking the Balboa and Newport Beach piers to  discourage lawlessness and signal the beaches' closing.  </P> <P> "Our objection is twofold," Wynn said. An earlier curfew "means even a resident  could not go along the beach" after 10 p.m. Also, Wynn said, the noise and  traffic problems from late night beach-goers are concentrated around the two  piers, so early closing of beaches for the entire 5.8 miles may be overkill.  </P> <P> Pettit and the presidents of two other large homeowner associations lobbying  for earlier beach closure think lights may not be enough.  </P> <P> In an April 16 letter to city officials, Pettit and her association also  suggested that at 10 p.m., police could sweep the beach area in a helicopter  and make loudspeaker announcements that the beach is closed.  </P> <P> "And residents would not object at 10 p.m. as they did at midnight."  </P> <P> Pettit's group, the Central Newport Beach Community Assn. and the West Newport  Beach Assn., which together represent several hundred property owners along the  beach, argue that the early beach closure would help police enforce the  citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors. Also, they say, there is a shortage of  officers at beach closing time because shifts change at midnight.  </P> <P> But they favor allowing the beach near the Balboa Pier to remain open until  midnight because it is the only spot with fire rings.  </P> <P> In opposing the earlier beach closure, however, Police Chief Campbell said more  people would need to be "ushered" from the beach at 10 p.m. than at midnight.  "This would result in a significant enforcement problem for the Police  Department."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Officers Needed  </P> <P> At least three new officers and two four-wheel-drive vehicles would be needed,  he said. He urged the lighting approach, which he estimated would cost about  $30,000.  </P> <P> Bill Gold has lived with his wife, Helen, on the Balboa Peninsula beachfront  for 22 years. He supports closing the beach at 10 p.m. but admits "there really  aren't that many people out there after 10."  </P> <P> But those that do stay late can be downright obnoxious, he said.  </P> <P> "I've been out here before when a guy is out 10 feet from my wall making out  with his girlfriend and a guy is urinating in my front yard," he said.  </P> <P> He wouldn't mind announcements by helicopter loudspeaker, but "the lights I'm  against. That's stupid. Any encroachments like that I'm against."  </P> <P> The 172 residents who responded to questionnaires from the Balboa Peninsula  Point Assn. shared many of Gold's complaints. Pettit said all but 12  respondents favored closing the beach at 10 p.m. The few who opposed the idea  echoed the following sentiment:  </P> <P> "I'd hate to get in trouble with the law should I decide on taking a midnight  stroll," one man wrote. "This is not something we do but once in a while. I  just would like to have that option open."  </P></p>

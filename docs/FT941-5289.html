			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / French move on organised crime A leading French judge yesterday handed the justice minister a report recommending the creation of 11 regional police squads to fight organised crime, writes David Buchan. Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a justice ministry adviser, is reported to have criticised an inter-ministerial body, the Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption, for not acting on a dozen cases which it should be following up, including 'at least four concerning elected politicians and journalists'. The report comes as the murder of a French deputy in the south of France 10 days ago has focused attention on organised crime in the Riviera and coincides with a parliamentary by-election in scandal-ridden Nice. After a first round of voting at the weekend, the Gaullist mayor of Nice, Mr Jean-Paul Barety, looks likely to win next Sunday, despite an exceptionally strong showing by his National Front rival. Mr Barety beat Mr Jacques Peyrat, the National Front candidate, by just 34 votes but the Socialist party is now expected to openly support Mr Barety.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Headway losses double to Pounds 795,000 Pre-tax losses at Headway, the consumer and industrial goods specialist once known as Beaverco, were more than doubled to Pounds 795,000 in the six months to December 31. The comparative figures are previously unpublished because the group changed its year-end in September. Turnover, affected by the difficult trading conditions, slipped to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 12.2m). Operating losses were Pounds 761,000 (profits Pounds 57,000), and were mostly, said Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, attributable to Aronstead, the garden furniture company. The other companies in the group showed profits. Interest payable was reduced to Pounds 319,000 (Pounds 504,000) and there was an exceptional gain of Pounds 285,000 relating to profit from a property sale. After estimated tax credits of Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 134,000), losses for the period were halved to Pounds 533,000 (Pounds 1.08m) - there was no extraordinary charge this time. Losses per share grew to 4.2p (2.8p).</p>

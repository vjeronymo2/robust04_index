			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / All for one glass, and one glass for all: Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are a central Israeli election issue 'If I am negotiating with you over a glass of water and all the while you are drinking from it, there comes a point when there is nothing left to negotiate' - Mr Sari Nusseibeh, a senior Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, talking about Israel's settlement of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Jewish settlement of Karnei Shomron, straddling three hilltops in the northern West Bank between the Arab towns of Nablus and Kalkilya, is in a bit of mess these days. There are mud and bulldozers, concrete and cement mixers and ranks of fast-rising new houses - hundreds of them. Karnei Shomron was established in 1977, shortly after Mr Menachem Begin, the former prime minister who died yesterday, first came to power pledging to settle masses of Jews throughout 'the land of Israel'. Today, it is home to 4,500 people. But not for long. No fewer than 1,100 dwellings are under construction in the settlement, which, its leaders say, will enable the population to grow to 10,000 by the end of next year. The settlement is an impressive, but not isolated, example of the growth in Mr Begin's settlement programme in the occupied territories. This initiative has been undertaken over the past two years by the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister and successor to Mr Begin as leader of the right-wing Likud party. Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, makes no secret of the intention to complete what Mr Begin started by settling so many Jews in the West Bank and Gaza that the Palestinian aim - of reclaiming the land lost in the 1967 Six Day War through the current Middle East peace talks - is rendered impossible. But the government's zeal for explosive settlement growth is coming under fire in the campaign for the June 23 general election. The opposition Labour party under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its newly elected leader, is accusing the Likud party of endangering the country's long-term stability and prosperity through its ideological and economic commitment to the settlements. For months, the US administration of President George Bush has been pressing Mr Shamir to freeze the settlements, calling them an obstacle to the peace process. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has refused to give the go-ahead for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees requested by Israel to help it settle hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union unless settlements are curbed. So far, this US strategy has not worked. In the metaphor of Mr Nusseibeh, the Palestinian negotiating team's research co-ordinator, Mr Shamir has gone on gulping from the glass of water as fast as he can swallow. Mr Sharon said last month that 22,000 houses had been under construction since 1990 in the West Bank and Gaza, twice the previously existing number. The Jewish population in these areas has risen to about 100,000 from about 60,000 five years ago and from fewer than 10,000 when Likud came to power in 1977. Half the land in the West Bank and one third of Gaza have been designated for Israeli use. The government plans to double the Jewish population within a few years. These figures do not include the 120,000 Jews living in Arab east Jerusalem, also captured in 1967, where large-scale expansion is also under way. Ms Sondra Baras, an immigrant from Cleveland, Ohio, a decade ago and now spokeswoman for Karnei Shomron, says the word 'settlement' has become a misnomer. 'It conjures an image of small outposts of mobile homes and a few people. Actually what you have now are towns and cities. You cannot just evacuate and hand back towns and cities. You can't just toss out hundreds of thousands of Jews.' However, a significant part of Israeli opinion has long dissented from the drive to settle. What is different now is that circumstances have combined to make the issue an important election battleground, on which Likud looks vulnerable. For while the government has been pouring money and energy into the settlements, the economy in Israel 'proper' has come unstuck under the weight of immigration. For four of the five months to February, the economy showed negative growth. Unemployment is almost 11 per cent. Largely as a result, immigration of Russian Jews, an historic Zionist aspiration, has slowed significantly. The solution was regarded to be the large-scale cheap foreign borrowing that would be made possible by the US loan guarantees. But Mr Shamir's stance on settlements has put that in jeopardy. The Labour party, re-invigorated after a long spell in the doldrums by Mr Rabin's accession, has been quick to offer an alternative. Mr Rabin says he would freeze most settlements, commit the government to giving up most of the West Bank and Gaza in negotiation and thus open the way both to peace and economic recovery. Mr Gad Ya'acobi, a senior Labour MP and former minister, says Labour's proposal would ensure approval of the US loan guarantees. It would save the Shk3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) a year currently being spent on the settlements which Labour would freeze. And, according to Mr Ya'acobi, the proposal would be worth a further Dollars 4bn a year to the economy  - the result, for example, of the lifting of an Arab boycott on trade with Israel. (Some Arab countries have said they will end their boycott if there is a settlement freeze.) These estimates may be inflated, but Mr Ya'acobi's main point remains. 'The main popular issues in the election will be economic and social. Many Israelis are understanding for the first time the link between the ability of Israel to solve these economic problems and the stopping of the settlements and the Likud policy on peace and security,' he says. From the point of view of the Palestinians, who see the Likud settlement drive as the biggest threat to their aspirations, a Labour success in the election would be welcome, but not unreservedly so. Labour, after all, was the party in power when the settlement effort began after 1967. Mr Rabin has been careful to distinguish between those he calls 'political' settlements, which he would halt, and those he designates vital to Israel's security, which he would not. The latter category includes those of the Jordan Valley, those around Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim, the biggest of all settlements, and all in east Jerusalem - a far cry from Palestinian demands for a complete freeze. What is more, many Israelis believe that the existing level of settlements - ironically built by up to 20,000 Palestinian labourers - is such that it has already precluded any realistic chance of an Israeli withdrawal from the territories. Some of the settlers themselves, however, do not see it that way. They have heard even Mr Shamir say that, although he opposes any change in their status, the settlements will eventually be the subject of negotiation. One settler, Ms Audrey Gerber, in Karnei Shomron readily admits to being worried about their future status. 'Everything is up in the air right now,' she says. Her friend, Ms Drora Golloway, agrees: 'Whatever government takes over, I'm worried about what will happen.' Ms Sondra Baras adds: 'We no longer feel they are going to raze us to the ground, things have gone too far for that. But there is an insecurity - that we will stay here but not feel secure; that the Arabs would get more control over our lives than we think is safe.' What they worry about is that the current peace negotiations - especially under a Labour government - could lead to a deal under which Jews are allowed to stay in their settlements, but under the jurisdiction of a Palestinian authority. The Palestinian stance is that all the settlements should be evacuated and repopulated with Palestinian refugees. But Mr Nusseibeh admits that some arrangement under which the settlers would stay could be acceptable, as long as they were under Palestinian administration. The Palestinian hope would be that a lack of motive to stay and financial incentives to leave would lead to a shrinkage in settler numbers. So far, however, the peace talks that began in Madrid last October have come nowhere near such an arrangement. The Likud proposal to date is that the settlers would remain firmly under Israeli jurisdiction, out of the scope of the limited offer of Palestinian autonomy. All eyes, therefore, are on the June election to see if the Israeli electorate will dictate a change. Mr Nusseibeh says: 'In order to proceed, we have to have either a change in the position of the Israeli government, or a change in the government itself.'</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS, BUT LSU FAILS TO ANSWER IN LOSS TO GEORGIA  </P> <P> No. 16 Louisiana State missed the front end of 10 consecutive one-and-one  free-throw opportunities, and Georgia made the free throws it needed to beat  the Tigers, 94-92, in overtime Wednesday in a Southeastern Conference game at  Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> Although LSU's Chris Jackson scored 45 points, he couldn't offset the Tigers'  (12-4, 4-3 in conference play) poor free-throw shooting in the last seven  minutes of regulation and first three minutes of overtime.  </P> <P> "We knew that free-throw shooting was our Achilles' heel," LSU Coach Dale Brown  said. "And last year, we were the best free-throw shooting team in the league  and No. 4 in the nation.  </P> <P> "Maybe they should get their tails out there a little early and practice  shooting free throws."  </P> <P> Jackson missed a 48-foot shot at the end of regulation and two three-point  attempts with 20 seconds left in overtime.  </P> <P> Georgia (11-5, 4-3) sent the game into overtime tied at 79-79 when Rod Cole  made three free throws with four seconds left. Cole was fouled on a three-point  attempt that missed and, under Southeastern Conference rules, was awarded three  free throws.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs got 27 points from Alec Kessler.  </P> <P> No. 8 Duke 85, North Carolina State 82 -- Phil Henderson scored 25 points and  the victorious Blue Devils made their first three shots in overtime in an  Atlantic Coast Conference game at Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> Christian Laettner of Duke (15-3, 5-1), scored on a tip-in with 17 seconds left  in regulation to tie it, 74-74. N.C. State (13-5, 2-3), which rallied from an  11-point deficit in the second half, never led in overtime. The Wolfpack was  led by Rodney Monroe, who hit only six of 26 attempts but scored 19 points.  </P> <P> No. 9 Oklahoma 107, Iowa State 96 -- Damon Patterson and Skeeter Henry sparked  a late 10-3 run at Norman, Okla., that helped the Sooners (13-2, 2-1) win a Big  Eight Conference game over the Cyclones (6-9, 1-2).  </P> <P> Michigan State 75, No. 12 Indiana 57 -- Kirk Manns scored 25 points and the  Spartans became the winningest visiting team at Assembly Hall in Bloomington,  Ind.  </P> <P> Michigan State won for the sixth time at Assembly Hall, where Indiana is 229-31  overall and 134-25 in Big Ten play.  </P> <P> The Spartans (15-3, 4-1) used a 29-11 spurt in the first half to take a 35-27  lead at halftime. Indiana is 13-3, 3-3.  </P> <P> No. 15 St. John's 83, Providence 75 -- Boo Harvey hit 10 of 12 free throws in  the final five minutes to help the Redmen hold off the Friars in the Big East  at Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> St. John's (17-3, 6-1) broke a first-place tie with Georgetown in the  conference. Providence is 11-5, 4-3.  </P> <P> No. 20 Connecticut 99, Central Connecticut 77 -- The Huskies' Chris Smith  scored 19 points, including five three-point shots, at Storrs, Conn.  </P> <P> Connecticut is 16-3; Central Connecticut is 3-13.  </P> <P> Notre Dame 88, Wichita State 78 -- LaPhonso Ellis' 15 points led six Irish  players in double figures at South Bend, Ind. Notre Dame is 9-6; Wichita State  is 5-12.  </P> <P> Auburn 74, Kentucky 70 -- Derrick Dennison scored 27 points, including two on  free throws after a steal with 13 seconds remaining, as the Tigers rallied from  a 14-point halftime deficit for a Southeastern Conference victory at Auburn,  Ala.  </P> <P> Auburn (6-11, 3-4) tied the score, 70-70, on two free throws by Chris Brandt  with 26 seconds to play. Kentucky (8-9, 4-4) set up for a potential  game-winning shot, but Dennison stole a pass, was fouled and made both shots.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt 71, Florida 64 -- Morgan Wheat's three-point basket with 2:42 left  broke open a tight contest as the Commodores (11-5, 4-3) won a Southeastern  Conference game at Gainesville, Fla.  </P> <P> The Gators (6-8, 2-5), playing without suspended 7-foot-2 center Dwayne  Schintzius, lost their third consecutive game.  </P> <P> Schintzius got the haircut that Coach Don DeVoe had demanded as a condition of  his return to the team, but DeVoe has not announced whether Schintzius has been  reinstated.  </P> <P> Houston 64, Southern Methodist 47 -- Houston's Byron Smith scored 19 points and  Carl Herrera had 19 rebounds and blocked six shots as the Cougars (13-6, 4-3)  won a Southwest Conference game over the Mustangs (6-9, 1-5).  </P> <P> Virginia 77, Virginia Tech 59 -- Cavalier forward Bryant Stith scored 22  points, including 10 in a row early in the second half, to lead the Cavaliers  (11-5) over the Hokies (9-9) at Roanoke, Va.  </P></p>

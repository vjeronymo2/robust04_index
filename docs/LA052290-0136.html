			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MEALS FOR ELDERLY PROGRAM RESCUED  </P> <P> A nutrition program that was almost halted temporarily by a $200,000 deficit  will continue serving meals to the elderly as a result of recent donations  received from the county and cities, the executive director said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Feedback Foundation Inc., which feeds about 2,500 elderly Orange County  residents each day, announced last month that it would have to close nutrition  sites for the month of June unless the county and local cities came to its aid.  </P> <P> Last week, the County Board of Supervisors pledged $100,000 and individual  cities have committed amounts from $1,000 to $22,000, according to executive  director Shirley A. Cohen. Over the next couple of weeks, other cities are  expected to pledge financial support.  </P> <P> "We're OK, we won't have to close in June," Cohen said. "I'm very grateful for  the cities' and the county's support."  </P> <P> Still, the organization is reeling from the shortfall, which Cohen said was a  result of a 14% increase in food costs at a time when federal funding is static  and participant donations have taken a sharp drop.  </P> <P> The organization sent letters dated April 30 to 13 cities and the county asking  for financial aid. Cities were asked to donate based upon the number of their  residents who benefit from the program. Santa Ana, for example, which has  164,112 residents who receive food from Feedback each year, was asked to donate  $22,000. Fountain Valley, which is estimated to have 5,000 residents who will  use the service during the 1989-90 fiscal year, was asked to give $1,000.  </P> <P> In some cases, cities have rushed to get their checks to the organization in  time, Cohen said. Santa Ana and Anaheim, for example, quickly issued checks for  $22,000 and $17,000, respectively.  </P> <P> "Some of the cities have been wonderful," she said. "When a city rushes a check  like that, it's pretty neat."  </P> <P> Feedback Foundation was formed as a nonprofit organization in 1967. Its first  project was a school and summer lunch program for low-income Santa Ana  children. When the Santa Ana school system took over the school lunch program  in 1973, the foundation phased out its children's lunch service and began a  program to provide nutrition for the elderly. The program was expanded in the  mid-1970s when the federal government began funding a separate home-delivered  meals program.  </P> <P> Currently, Feedback Foundation, one of three county nutrition programs, serves  about 1,700 seniors in group programs and 800 housebound residents each day,  Cohen said. The food is cooked in a central kitchen in Anaheim and delivered by  truck or van to community centers and homes. The foundation asks for a $1.35  per meal donation when possible. However, 67% of the clients have incomes below  the poverty level. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

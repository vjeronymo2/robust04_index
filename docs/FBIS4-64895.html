			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze by </F> Hans-Werner Oertel; place and date not given: "The CDU Wants To  Continue Playing a Leading Role in the East"]    [Text] [Oertel] Eastern Germany still has its specific  features: an enormous social gap, on the one hand, and higher  industrial growth rates than the west, on the other. What are  the Christian Democratic Union's [CDU] concepts for the new  laender?    [Hintze] First, we will have to continue promoting growth,  which will be 7-8 percent in eastern Germany this year. We are  on the right track in this respect. The second priority refers  to subsidy cuts, and we would like to point out that this mainly  refers to cuts in the west. Between 1991 and 1994, 25 percent  of subsidies were cut in the west. We will have to repeat this  between 1995 and 1997.    We will have to make sure that we keep the process that we  have initiated in the new laender going. That is entirely clear  to us. What is also important is a consistent support of their  economic development. We have achieved particularly good  results in this respect over the last few days.    [Oertel] Like what?    [Hintze] Take the chemical industry in Saxony-Anhalt, or  electronics in Saxony, or the strong hopes that we now have for  Thuringia. I think the reason why people talk less about the  new laender now is because every field has been promoted by a  very intense package of measures -- tax, legal, supportive, and  economic measures. We have to make sure now that both  tendencies -- growth and reduction of the inflation rate --  continue.    The great political challenge we face now is an all-German  one; it can no longer be separated into east and west.    [Oertel] In spite of increasing wages, people in the east  are afraid that real wages might continue to decline. What is  your party's response to this?    [Hintze] We have to make sure there is not too wide a gap  between wages and productivity. I think that this has meanwhile  become a principle in eastern Germany as well. We are aiming at  similar living conditions, but we have to do it in such a way  that the economy can cope with it. This is a very important  principle. All we can promise the population is that the  increasing economy will bring about an adjustment of income  levels. This entire economic process cannot be controlled by  the state. Rather, conditions have to be improved so we can  achieve this independently. We are well on our way with this.    We have a special problem in eastern Germany. We need the  instruments of labor policy to a far greater extent there -- for  the large number of people that do not have jobs yet through no  fault of their own.    [Oertel] Do you expect the labor market situation to  improve?    [Hintze] As many as five out of six economic institutes say  that it will begin to improve in 1995. That means that the  lowest point in employment has also been reached now in eastern  Germany. The trend will be clearly upward from now on. I do not  know whether we will see this expressed in real figures this  year, but I certainly expect it for 1995.    [Oertel] Let us talk about landtag elections. The CDU is in  the government everywhere except Brandenburg. Might there be a  need for new alliances, perhaps with the Greens in Saxony?    [Hintze] In Saxony, I quite realistically expect Kurt  Biedenkopf to win an absolute majority again, so we will not  need a coalition partner at all. In the other laender, we will  fight for a strategic majority, which will enable us to provide  the minister-presidents and determine the way we want to form  such governments. I would wish for the coalition with the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] to be continued and for the FDP to show  the necessary power in the election campaigns.    [Oertel] There has been a proposal by Mr. Mahrenholz that  the hunt for small informers should come to an end now. What is  your opinion on that?    [Hintze] I think this is a matter for those in charge in the  new laender to discuss and to come up with a proposal. I do not  think that such a proposal should come from western Germany.  This should be discussed by those that were affected very  strongly by the former GDR state. This does not mean that I am  criticizing Mr. Mahrenholz, who, being a former constitutional  judge, does, of course, have a right to contribute his view to  the debate. I do not want to set a course in this question.    [Oertel] The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] must be  taken seriously in the new laender: What is the CDU's way of  dealing with them in view of the election campaign?    [Hintze] Our political opponents in the election campaign  are the Social Democrats. Political cooperation with the PDS is  no option for us, neither at the moment nor in the future.    [Oertel] Yet, CDU delegates have been elected with PDS votes  in some places and joint votes were cast, as in Brandenburg. Do  you consider that normal?    [Hintze] I am sticking to my statement: For me, there is no  political cooperation with the PDS.</p>

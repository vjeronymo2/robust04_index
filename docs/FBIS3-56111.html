			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Talalayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- The kind of relationship,  which the Russian president will have with the newly elected  parliament, has acquired a truly vital meaning for Russia today.  Many people, including the president, if one can judge by his  statements, will long remember the tragic end of the former  Supreme Soviet, although there deservedly should be no pardon  for its leaders, whose unlimited personal ambitions and  insatiable hunger for power almost threw the country into civil  war.    In this connection, it is no surprise that people awaited  the  president's first appearance in front of the new parliament with  impatience. This interest was heightened by the president's 8  January reversal of his original decision to hold a joint  session of the Federal Assembly's two chambers and to speak only  to the deputies of the upper chamber, the Federation Council.  This decision was obviously based on the guidelines contained  in the new constitution.    Yeltsin stated his position on the proper relationship  between the two branches of power fairly clearly. After a  reminder of the tremendous efforts required to maintain peace in  the country last year, the president stressed that, "it is very  important that the members of the Federation Council and the  State Duma put the Russian parliament on a constructive path, so  that cooperation becomes the most important aspect in relations  between the executive and legislative branches."    Undoubtedly, the Federal Assembly is beginning its work in a  very difficult period when the Russian state is really just  being founded. However, the first popularly approved  constitution in Russian history has given the country a  realistic chance to form its ruling structures calmly and  effectively. One could say that Russia has finally agreed on  the rules of the game, which must be observed by all the  political forces.    Now Russia needs more than anything else to preserve that  spirit of agreement and calmness, which will prevent a  dictatorship from ever returning. With this in mind, the  president appealed to the deputies to "help the social and  political forces agree on the most important thing, to fully and  categorically exclude the use of force from the country's  political arena."    Of course, the president and the parliamentarians can  disagree with each other, argue, and insist on their own  opinion, but all political problems can and must be solved in a  legal way. "Despite the variety of parties in the parliament,  there is a principled basis for their joint constructive work,"  Yeltsin declared. The same thought was voiced by Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was simultaneously addressing  the deputies of the State Duma.    However, the parliament's first day of work, especially in  the lower chamber, did not radiate optimism. After spending a  lot of time debating procedural questions, the Duma deputies  never did get to any important matters. But the alarming thing  is that the democratic forces have not yet managed to take  control of the situation, while the part of the opposition  represented by the Liberal Democratic Party and its ecstatic  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy behaved, to put it mildly,  provocatively. It looks like the apprehensions voiced by  Presidential Press spokesman Vladislav Kostikov on the eve of  the parliament's debute may be true. He said that "a  confrontational spirit might dominate" the Federal Assembly.    Of course, it is too early to draw conclusions. Moreover,  the president has enough constitutional powers to prevent  opposition forces from using their full strength. No matter how  contradictory the 12 December elections were, Russia has to live  with the new parliament for two years. The parliamentarians  have been provided with all the necessary conditions to earn  themselves a worthy place in the country's history. They have  the sad experience of their predecessors, the executive branch's  good will and readiness to cooperate, and the trust of their  electors. Now the ball is in the parliament's court.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sport goes up in smoke While Europe dithers over tobacco advertising, Australia has taken the drastic step of banning sport sponsorship by tobacco companies. In a sport-mad country the ban - which comes into effect in 1995 - is a serious matter. The state of Tasmania has said it may defy it, arguing that it is unfair to deprive sports bodies of so much cash. Indeed, tobacco groups - which since 1976 have been prevented from conventional advertising - contribute an estimated ADollars 20m (Pounds 8.5m) a year towards the total ADollars 120m sport sponsorship market. The Confederation of Australian Sport is hoping to persuade the federal government to set up a health fund paid from a levy on tobacco sales. Some states already have such a scheme: Victoria has paid about ADollars 25m over three years in 'Quit' sponsorship. Sports associations are finding other ways of fighting back: lobby group the NSW Sports Federation has called for blacklisting of companies that use sport in their advertising without contributing to it. Alcohol companies fear they may be next in line, but Ros Kelly, the sports minister, says she has no plans for further bans. She argues that there is no safe level of nicotine intake, whereas moderate drinking may even be good for you. Tobacco sponsorship is already restricted in many EC countries: it is banned in Portugal and Italy, while in France tobacco advertising and sponsorship are due to be phased out by 1993. This is expected to cost the motor racing alone some FFr350m (Pounds 35m) a year. Tobacco companies in the UK spend Pounds 7m a year on sponsorship, particularly of sport. Since the UK banned tobacco advertising on television, sponsorship has become more important. However, the practice is increasingly controversial: the BBC was recently criticised by the Health Education Authority for allowing back-door tobacco advertising worth the equivalent of some Pounds 200m annually. It claimed that by strategically placing tobacco logos in sponsored sporting events, the industry got television coverage without paid-for advertising.</p>

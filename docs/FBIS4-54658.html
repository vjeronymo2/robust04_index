			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Liviu Tudor: "The General Police Inspectorate Has </F> Set Up Its Own Intelligence Service"]    [Text] A "Directorate for Operative Supervision and  Intelligence" has recently been set up within the General Police  Inspectorate. The new informative service of the General Police  Inspectorate is headed by Colonel Traian Dima and became  operational with the new restructuring of the services and  directorates within the General Police Inspectorate.    From the name of the new service, which is not subordinated  to Military Unit [UM] 0215 Bucharest, one can infer that its  duty is to carry out an intelligence supervisory watch on the  activity of the General Police Inspectorate and to brief the  Inspectorate leadership on relevant operational developments.    The initiator of this intelligence unit is Major General Ion  Pitulescu, head of the General Police Inspectorate. The first  attempt made by Major General Ion Pitulescu to set up such an  intelligence service within the Inspectorate's structure was  last March, when his initial proposal was turned down. By  claiming that UM 0215 Bucharest -- a specialized unit designed  to defend state secrets in the Ministry of Interior and ensure  the protection of the police personnel -- "cannot fulfill such  duties in the sphere of the police bodies' activity," the head  of the General Police Inspectorate, Major General Ion Pitulescu,  emerged victorious and obtained the approval for setting up the  new unit.    Therefore, to the five already existing domestic  intelligence  services, one should now add a sixth one, namely the Directorate  for Operative Supervision and Intelligence of the General Police  Inspectorate.</p>

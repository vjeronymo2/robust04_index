			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABC NEWS OFFICIAL FREED, CBS PRODUCER MISSING  </P> <P> An ABC News producer taken hostage in Panama said he was held in a Panamanian  army intelligence headquarters, where he was "threatened constantly" but  released.  </P> <P> The producer, Robert Campos, said Wednesday night he was abducted at the Panama  City Marriott Hotel with four other Americans, and that to his knowledge none  of the others had been released. CBS producer Jon Meyersohn and an American  businessman staying at the Marriott were separated from Campos and a Colombian  national after their abduction, Campos said by telephone on ABC-TV's  "Nightline."  </P> <P> CBS said it had received no word of Meyersohn's whereabouts.  </P> <P> "A group of us were on the mezzanine level of the hotel when we saw the  'Dignity Battalion' soldiers entering the hotel from the lower level," he said,  referring to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's staunchly loyal paramilitary force.  </P> <P> "We tried to run away by taking an elevator up to a higher floor and when the  elevator doors opened, two soldiers leveled their AK-47s at us. We again tried  to run but they said that they would kill us if we did. They laid us on the  floor and took us off in a pickup truck."  </P> <P> Campos said they were taken to an army intelligence headquarters near downtown  Panama City, about a mile from the military headquarters. About 75 people were  at the building, all armed, mostly with AK-47s, he said.  </P> <P> "We were threatened constantly," Campos said. "We were told that many  Panamanians were dying because of this invasion and that we would pay. This  Colombian gentleman spoke up and said he had a wife and a daughter to worry  about and one of the soldiers told him, 'If I feel like it, I'll make sure you  never see them for Christmas.' "  </P> <P> Campos was held nearly six hours before being released, said Laura Wessner, a  spokeswoman for ABC News.  </P></p>

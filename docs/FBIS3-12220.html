In Singer's opinion, the meeting between Rabin and  'Arafat and the signing of the agreement between Israel and the  PLO could take place before 13 April 1994.    Nevertheless, in a special interview with DAVAR, Singer  noted  that Israel says that the mass release of prisoners is  conditional on a general amnesty of collaborators. According to  him, the PLO made a strategic decision to advance rapidly in all  tracks of the talks. The talks in Cairo in the last two weeks  have been very businesslike and good, Singer said. Issues which  were previously settled only after arguments that lasted for  days have recently been settled within half an hour, he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 31 March (AFP) -- Georgian authorities  regained control of parliament Thursday a few hours after  militiamen occupied the building, apparently in protest at the  appointment of a new interior minister, correspondents on the  scene said.    An inquiry was opened on the reasons for the assault by some  1,000 protestors, following a call to action by Tbilisi militia  chief David Zeikidze, with explanations ranging from a personal  vendetta to a possible coup attempt against President Eduard  Shevardnadze.    A parliamentary spokesman said the protestors, some of them  armed, were opposing the national assembly's appointment of  Shota Kviraia as new interior minister a few months after he was  first named by Shevardnadze.    The incident could also be linked to December's fierce fight  between the ministries of defence and security, when Kviraia was  acting as deputy minister of security.    That conflict sprung from the chaos reigning in the country,  which is bursting with armed militia, and policy differences  over the rebel autonomous republic of Abkhazia.    According to an AFP journalist in the parliament,  Shevardnadze was still in the building attending a meeting  Thursday afternoon. A quarrel broke out in a corridor when the  president, surrounded by bodyguards, tried to calm Zeikidze and  his men after they had hit a deputy, the journalist said.    Access to the parliament was blocked and security was tight  throughout the capital Thursday afternoon, the anniversary of a  1991 referendum on Georgian independence and the birthday of  former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who fled office in January  1992 and died last December.    Demonstrations were expected, in particular around  Gamsakhurdia's former home on a hill above the capital.  Security forces were concerned that any protest could spread  down into the city centre.</p>

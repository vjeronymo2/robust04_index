			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / MacSharry stresses need for restart of US-EC oilseed talks SLIGO is the home town of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner. It was here that he was schooled in Irish politics and where he still retreats for weekends away from the pressures of world farm trade negotiations and Brussels bureaucracy. The 140-mile journey from Dublin can be a tortuous drive, slowed by heavy traffic and road works, but hoardings along the way identify the road projects as financed from EC structural funds, part of a nationwide and much-needed road improvement scheme. Once you are there, however, the tranquillity of the views over the Atlantic Ocean dispel the anger induced by the ubiquitous cattle trucks which seem to have a queue of cars weaving in frustration behind them wherever they go. Mr MacSharry set the cat among the pigeons in Brussels last week by withdrawing as the EC negotiator in the farm trade talks with the US, then beat a tactical retreat to Sligo while Mr Jaques Delors, EC Commission president, took the heat for the breakdown in the talks. He acceded to an interview to clarify the point at which the EC-US negotiations have stalled. It was conducted in his black Mercedes limousine, which comes with his job as commissioner. 'The house is full of Fianna Fail people getting ready for the election campaign,' he apologised. Never once referring to Mr Delors by name he said: 'My only concern, and I want to stress and underline this, is that the US and the EC should come to agreement as quickly as is possible on the outstanding point in agriculture and get back to Geneva so that they can wrap it all up among the 108 countries before the end of the year. That is my only concern in the whole affair. 'There is an amazing responsibility on the shoulders of all those directly concerned, and particularly the bosses, to get on with the job,' he said. 'My only concern has been to do my part. We've brought (the negotiations) to the stage where they can be concluded. It is necessary to do so now in the interest of the world economy to help it out of recession.' Discussing his decision not to continue as EC negotiator in talks with the US, Mr MacSharry said: 'I have not resigned from the post of EC agriculture commissioner. There are numerous responsibilities attached to (that job), one of which is international negotiations on agricultural matters. That responsibility I have asked the president to carry out. So it's a matter for the president. I am satisfied that I have made my contribution. Now it is just a matter of finalising the details and all together must do that and do that quickly.' Expressing optimism that agreement can be reached with the US, he said: 'Of course there are differences, they want to get their way the same as the Community wants to get its way. . . but the differences are slight enough.' He pinpointed US insistence on oilseed tonnage rather than acreage limits as the final hurdle to be cleared in the talks. 'To comply with the Gatt panel which has found against the (oilseeds export subsidy) regime in operation in the EC, we are prepared in the context of the Gatt negotiations. . . to extrapolate the oilseeds sector out separately from the arable crops sector and treat it separately. . . to identify it as a single sector,' he said. This would imply that acreage limits on oilseeds would be negotiable, a significant departure from the previous EC stance which treated the arable crops sector as one package. Asked whether the offer to separate out oilseeds from the arable crops sector had led to the row with Mr Delors, Mr MacSharry said he did want to become involved in personality clashes. 'Of course there are governments that do not like the reform of the CAP and maybe would like that it would go away, but it won't go away,' he said. He insisted that the oilseeds offer to the US had been made in the context of the CAP reform package. 'Outside of that I will not go because I have made a solid commitment to the governments and the farmers, that we would not ask that they pay twice - first to reform the CAP and secondly to comply with Gatt obligations, so therefore we will do it the context of the reform of the CAP,' he said. Mr MacSharry declined to say whether he would resume his role of negotiator if requested. 'It is a matter for the president (Delors). He allocates the responsibilities. . . I am only interested in getting this thing back on the rails and I think my action has highlighted the importance of it and that in itself has been a good thing. It is now up to people much higher than me. . . to see that the job is done. 'In fairness to the United States they have come a long way. . . they are prepared to move on the four points of concern to the EC, which are lesser export volume commitments, rebalancing, a proper peace clause, and most important of all, to accept that the per hectare payments and livestock premiums under the new CAP reform will not be disciplined and will not be reduced. So in fairness to the US they have come a long way,' he said. Mr MacSharry pointed out that the US administration's fast-track trade negotiating procedure agreed with Congress expires next March, and that to enable the US to ratify an agreement within that period,a farm trade deal would have to be concluded rapidly, and an overall Gatt agreement concluded by the end of the year. 'If it isn't wrapped up by Christmas. . . then we are talking about another year lost, and where will the world economy be by then?' he asked.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: NEC and Bull discuss link NEC, the Japanese electronics company, and Bull of France, are discussing sharing the burden of developing a range of computers, the Japanese company said. The two companies are negotiating details of a deal through which they would share the development of next generation computers, including mainframes and middle-range machines, NEC said. Personal computers were not, however, included among seven areas of co-operation that were under discussion, the company noted. The agreement, if finalised, would considerably reduce the burden of development for both NEC and Bull, in which the Japanese company has a 4.43 per cent equity stake. NEC has been supplying Bull with mainframes which the French company has been marketing in Japan on an original equipment manufacturing basis, under its own brand name. If the latest talks bear fruit, NEC might draw on Bull's strengths in manufacturing of computer boards and the central processing unit in making next generation models, NEC said. Such a step would help Bull to reduce the cost of buying mainframes from NEC, while at the same time enable the company to utilise its resources more effectively. It would also help NEC by reducing its development costs. NEC and Bull are also in negotiation for Bull to sell NEC supercomputers in Europe.</p>

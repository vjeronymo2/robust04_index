			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: An astonishingly antiquated view of the personnel function Sir, Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, has scrapped personnel as a board-level post, and has made it a less senior position, according the the October issue of Personnel Today. The departing personnel director, Peter Hobbs, is reported as saying that the move is 'part of a general down-grading of the personnel function'. Mr Hobbs lays part of the blame for this on the influence of City analysts, suggesting that, in the eyes of stockbrokers, the profile of a successful company does not necessarily include a personnel director. His view was partly confirmed by Hoare Govett pharmaceuticals analyst, Nigel Barnes, who said that 'happy employees are important but personnel was not of primary importance'. It is astonishing in this day and age that an investment analyst in such a reputable firm is still holding on to the antiquated idea that the personnel function is concerned with happiness. What he (and the Wellcome board) needs to understand is that in a knowledge-intensive industry such as pharmaceuticals the personnel or human resource strategy is central to the business strategy. The task of the HR function is to contribute to the achievement of a sustainable competitive advantage by means of superiority in such fields as recruitment, selection, training and development, performance management, motivation, organisation design and, above all, the development of a corporate culture which nurtures talent and encourages creativity. This fact is recognised very clearly by such overseas competitors of Wellcome as Merck, which has a very strong HR function. Barnes says that 'when we are assessing the value of the company, the most important thing is the products'. He fails to perceive that in a pharmaceutical or other knowledge intensive industry the people are the product. Where does he think new drugs come from if not from highly committed, highly creative people? Incidentally, the same issue of Personnel Today comments that 'some of the 500 employees who committed themselves to achieving Investors in People status at its launch a year ago are making little progress towards the award'. I am not surprised. Philip Sadler, chairperson, Association for Management Education and Development, 21 Catherine Street, London WC2B 5JS</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Maxwell widow foots son's legal bills MRS ELIZABETH Maxwell, widow of the late Robert Maxwell, who last month described herself as 'destitute', is the mystery benefactor helping to pay their son Kevin's legal bills. Her identity was disclosed in the Court of Appeal yesterday. The provisional liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed the pension funds of Maxwell companies, tried unsuccessfully to have her made 'jointly and severally' liable with Kevin for BIM's legal costs. Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators, said Mrs Maxwell had provided Pounds 900,000 'at the drop of a hat' to Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian. The costs related to Mr Kevin Maxwell's unsuccessful plea that he had a right to remain silent in response to questions from the liquidators about some Pounds 450m of missing pension money to avoid self-incrimination. Lord Justice Dillon said that, according to Mrs Maxwell, around December 11, five weeks after her husband's death, Kevin asked her for Pounds 100,000 towards his legal fees. On December 16, Kevin and Ian asked for a further Pounds 400,000 each for legal fees. There could, the judge said, be no objection to a mother giving her son money for legal expenses. 'Naturally, in view of the circumstances which have come to public notice since the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, there must be some suspicion that money in the hands of the Maxwell family may have been taken improperly by Mr Robert Maxwell from funds or companies with which he was associated.,' he said. But the judge concluded that there was no evidence that the money used by Mrs Maxwell to pay her sons' bills was derived from Bishopsgate or was not genuinely hers. The first part of her contribution came in the form of almost FFr1m (Pounds 100,000) and later another sum of nearly Pounds 400,000. In a magazine interview last month, Mrs Maxwell was reported as saying: 'I haven't salted away anything, because I never for a minute believed that he'd leave me destitute.' A spokeswoman for D J Freeman, the London solicitors representing Mrs Maxwell, declined yesterday to comment on her assets. Mrs Maxwell, 71, was born Elizabeth Meynard near Lyons. She comes from a wealthy family which owned several silk factories in the 1930s. Her father, who became a legal consultant, at one point specialised in uncovering fraud in the fruit and vegetable market at Les Halles in Paris. It is understood that she brought Paris property and others assets to the marriage. Some of the property is occupied by Maxwell companies, but it is not known if she retains the title to these assets. She has also owned for several years a chateau in Montagnac-sur-Lede in the Lot-et-Garonne region. It is estimated to be worth Pounds 3m and has a swimming pool, outdoor whirlpool bath and helicopter pad. It has eight bedrooms, four bathrooms and two kitchens. She may be able to earn further money - publishers have approached her for her memoirs. It is clear, however, that paying for her son's legal bills will make a considerable hole in her assets.</p>

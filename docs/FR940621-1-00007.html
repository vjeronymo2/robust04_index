The proposed regulations, if adopted, would require Ballast Water Management practices for each vessel entering the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating on waters beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules would help to prevent the additional introduction of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species into the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels operating on the Hudson River. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before August 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406) (CGD 94&hyph;003), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

The primary medium for their introduction is believed to be ballast water from vessels. Many vessels take on water in foreign harbors or in the near shore waters which are often rich in living organisms. When these vessels arrive to take on cargo, they discharge ballast water and any organisms contained in the water enter the local ecosystem. While many of these species do not survive in this new environment, those that do quickly adapt, and in some instances thrive, particularly where there are no natural predators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Zebra Mussel provides a good example of the harmful effects of a newly introduced species. In 1988, this small bivalve mollusk native to the Black, Azov, and Caspian Seas in the Ukraine and southern Russia, was discovered in the Western Basin of Lake Erie. Scientists believe that it was introduced in 1986 by the discharge of freshwater ballast of a vessel from Northern Europe. Hundreds of millions of Zebra Mussels can now be found on and in pipes, screens, conduits, boat bottoms, floats, buoys, rocks, submerged objects, and native animals and plants. As a filter feeding organism, it removes vast quantities of microscopic organisms from the water, the same organisms that fish larvae and young fish rely upon for their food supply. It also completely covers rocks and other substances normally used by native fish for laying eggs. Since its introduction into the Great lakes the Zebra Mussel has reproduced and spread throughout the Great Lakes and its tributaries and has been found as far south as New Orleans. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

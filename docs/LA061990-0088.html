			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;  </P> <P> RAVEL SPECIALIST TO OPEN SYMPHONY'S SUMMERPOPS  </P> <P> When Canadian conductor Boris Brott takes the Hospitality Point podium  Wednesday evening, he will open the San Diego Symphony's SummerPops season on a  decidedly sophisticated note. His mainly Ravel program, called "Ravel  Rhapsody," inaugurates the orchestra's 12 weeks of outdoor programming on  Mission Bay.  </P> <P> To be sure, Brott has not failed to include "Bolero," the hummable 1928 ballet  piece that instantly made the composer world-famous (even before he could count  to "10"). But Brott's Ravel sampler also includes "La Valse" and the Suite No.  2 from "Daphnis et Chloe," hardly typical pops selections.  </P> <P> Brott, who is music director of the Hamilton (Ontario) Philharmonic, devised a  program for Canadian television in 1975 to celebrate the centennial of Ravel's  birth. In addition to hosting the program, the Ravel specialist conducted the  Toronto Symphony in a concert of the French composer's orchestral works and  arrangements.  </P> <P> Brott's chief mentor, celebrated French conductor Pierre Monteux, provided the  eager young Canadian with a direct connection to Ravel's musical world.  </P> <P> "My initial conducting studies were with Igor Markevitch and Pierre Monteux,"  Brott explained. "Monteux had conducted the premiere performance of 'Daphnis et  Chloe' and was strongly identified with Ravel."  </P> <P> Having spent two years as Monteux's apprentice in Europe, as well as four  summers at the conductor's summer music camp in Maine, Brott said he felt he  had gained almost a direct link with the composer. Many of Monteux's Ravel  scores were annotated during conversations with the composer.  </P> <P> "Monteux's view of Ravel was very classical, that is, he stressed the  composer's desire to achieve a clear sense of form, as opposed to the blurred  image of the Impressionist label his music is usually given. Ravel's music is  conductor's music, in the sense that it plays the orchestra."  </P> <P> Brott made his SummerPops debut last season and returned in December to conduct  a week of the San Diego Symphony's concerts for student audiences.  </P> <P> Last chance for the mighty Wurlitzer. This Sunday, members of the Theatre Organ  Society of San Diego will bid farewell to the soon-to-be-demolished California  Theatre with a 2 p.m. concert on the aging movie palace's Wurlitzer theatre  organ. Four local organists, Chris Gorsuch, Chuck Kramarich, Russ Peck and Greg  Breed, will perform on the city's second-largest theatre organ before it is  dismantled and put into storage.  </P> <P> The 24-rank Wurlitzer, which is owned by the society, was installed in the  California Theatre in 1977, and the first concert was presented a year later.  According to society member Bob Brooks, the California Theatre's original  eight-rank instrument had been long gone, having been sold to a local Catholic  church after talkies made theatre organs obsolete. The society's Wurlitzer came  from a movie theater in Santa Rosa and was purchased for the society by local  organ aficionado Preston M. (Sandy) Fleet.  </P> <P> Next month, Theatre Organ Society members will remove the Wurlitzer from the  California Theatre and put it into storage while they locate a new home for  their prized instrument. According to society president Jackie Cornell, it will  be out of commission for at least a year.  </P> <P> "Even if the Wurlitzer should go to the North Park or Balboa theatres, it would  take two to three years before these facilities were ready for concerts. At the  moment, however, the whole thing is still out in left field. In the meantime,  we will probably give concerts using electronic organs or meet in members'  homes that have (theater) pipe organs," said Cornell.  </P> <P> Mazeltov! Friday night at Temple Beth Israel, cantor Sheldon Merel will be  honored for 10 years of service at San Diego's oldest Reform synagogue. Merel  is well-known in the local musical community, both for the synagogue's  excellent music program and for his leadership in local interfaith musical  concerts. Last month, Merel organized the "Blended Voices" concert at Symphony  Hall, which put the choirs of five San Diego churches on stage with the Jewish  Community Center Orchestra and the musicians of Temple Beth Israel.  </P> <P> Rumble in the park. Balboa Park's Spreckels Organ is armed with a new rank of  pedal pipes whose low roar is equal to the sound of planes landing and taking  off from nearby Lindbergh Field. On June 10, civic organist Robert Plimpton  inaugurated the new 32-foot Bombarde in his regular Sunday afternoon recital.  He demonstrated the new stop's ability to snarl in French toccatas -- Plimpton  opened his program with Widor's popular Toccata from the Fifth Organ Symphony  -- and to undergird the fugues of J.S. Bach with fiery accent.  </P> <P> For the record, the lowest pipe of the new Bombarde is indeed 32 feet in  length, and its pitch is a mere 16 cycles per second. (The lowest C on a piano  is still an octave higher than the low C of the Bombarde.) The term Bombarde  comes from the French organ-building tradition and denotes the brightest and  loudest reed stops on an organ.  </P> <P> According to Plimpton, the new Bombarde has added the necessary sonic  foundation to the brilliant trumpet stops added to the organ over the last two  years.  </P> <P> As a prelude to Plimpton's recital, Salvatore Giametta, San Diego Mayor Maureen  O'Connor's assistant for the arts and cultural affairs, had proclaimed June 10  as Spreckels Organ Day and praised the works of the Spreckels Organ Society,  which raised the $50,000 to acquire and install the new Bombarde. Society  president Vivian Evenson presented to Giametta the new stop and several other  recent improvements to the Spreckels Organ. The instrument, which was given to  the city in 1915 by local businessman John D. Spreckels and his brother,  Adolph, is the world's largest outdoor pipe organ.  </P> <P> Haydn at night. As part of Balboa Park's diamond jubilee observances, the San  Diego Master Chorale will perform Haydn's oratorio "The Creation" in the organ  pavilion June 25 at 8 p.m. Under the direction of music director Frank Almond  and accompanied by civic organist Robert Plimpton, this choral concert  duplicates a 1915 performance of the oratorio during the Panama-California  Exposition.  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Cookery: More than potatoes for St Patrick - Philippa Davenport adds a touch of flair to traditional Irish treats this Tuesday - was a big occasion at my school, where many of the nuns were Irish. The sisters in charge of the kitchen were the strongest in their allegiance to the Emerald Isle. On March 17, every bosom wore its bunch of shamrock with pride, and supper on that date was always the same: fried eggs on fried bread set in a sea of tinned marrowfat peas. Sometimes, we questioned the Irishness of this culinary curiosity. This vexed the nuns, who thought that every convent-educated girl ought to recognise instantly the colours of the Republic's tricolour flag in the orangey-gold and white of the eggs and the bright green peas. My own choice of menu for an Irish feast is rather different. Oysters to begin with, Guinness cake and Irish cheeses to finish, and pig in the middle  -with potato and cabbage to keep it company, of course. Boiled bacon might not be the most elegant of fare but it has acquired a certain chic now that, in the interests of thrift, simple peasant foods have become such 'in' things. And if the pig is quality meat, its delicious flavour should please gourmets and gourmands alike. Success depends on three things: good meat, careful curing and gentle cooking. Boiled bacon must not be boiled (there is an Irishness for you) or the meat will be dry and ragged. Succulence depends on keeping the liquid at the barest simmer; the fewer burps that bubble to the surface, the better. This was achieved by in-built inefficiency in traditional Irish kitchens where the cooking was done in a cauldron hanging over a lazy fire of steamy peat. Cooks in modern, high-speed kitchens must slow things down deliberately. Choose a heavy pot, keep the flame faint and employ a heat diffuser for good measure. Tradition calls for a large pot in which the rest of the meal can be cooked along with the bacon. I prefer to use a small one, heavy-based and with a well-fitting lid to minimise evaporation because, if the joint fits snugly into the pot rather than swimming in liquid, the cooking liquor is stock by the end. No need to reduce it or add any extra flavourings. Shoulder of bacon, a corner gammon or gammon proper are all suitable cuts, whether smoked or green. Soak the joint for a few or several hours according to taste and the butcher's recommendation. Put it into the pot and pour on just enough cold liquid to cover. For a 4 lb shoulder joint last week, I used 3 pts water plus one teaspoon each cider vinegar and brown sugar, a bay leaf, a few peppercorns, and some lightly-bruised fennel seeds. On other occasions, I have replaced some or all of the water with very dry cider (such as Bulmer's No. 7) or cloudy, unsweetened apple juice. Bring to a bare simmer, skim, cover and cook as gently as possible, allowing 20 minutes a pound. Then, turn off the heat and leave the bacon to stand in the liquid in the covered pot for 20 minutes, rather as though resting a joint between roasting and carving. Cabbage goes very well with bacon so long as it is not killed by drowning, when it smells as vile as it tastes. The fact that cabbage likes fast, fierce cooking, while bacon needs slow and gentle treatment, is one good reason for cooking the two ingredients separately. Besides which, the taste of brassica does little to improve bacon stock. For a chunky, peasant-like cabbage dish, I like Savoy, January King or some other tight-headed variety cut into big wedges, steamed briefly over furiously-boiling water and blotted carefully. Also excellent, and a mite more refined, is cabbage shredded as fine as tagliolini and blanch-boiled. Throw it into a large, hubble-bubble pot of fiercely-boiling salted water and fish it out again a few seconds later  - the chances are it will be cooked before the water returns to the boil. Turn it into a sieve, tossing to drain it well and separate the strands. Anoint it, if you will, by turning it in warmed olive oil or melted butter, season with salt and pepper, and add some chopped coriander leaves or toasted sesame seeds; or omit the brilliantine sheen and serve the cabbage unadorned along with plain, boiled bacon and offer a sauce on the side. Hollandaise is hardly Irish, but it is probably the first and finest choice. An orange mustard sauce makes an inviting alternative. In the top part of a double-boiler, mix together two teaspoons each of thick cream and wholegrain mustard. Add two tablespoons freshly-squeezed orange juice, one teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and the finely-grated zest of two oranges. Place over barely-simmering water and stir with a wire whisk until the mixture is well blended, hot and slightly sticky. Gradually beat in 6 oz of diced and chilled unsalted butter, piece by piece, until amalgamated to a hot, smooth and creamy sauce, rather like a thin Hollandaise. Add two or more teaspoons of orange juice to taste and season with salt and pepper. Cover and let the sauce stand for a few minutes before serving to allow flavours to develop. The best potatoes to go with freshly-boiled bacon and cabbage are floury, earthy Golden Wonder grown in Ireland - if you can get them. Irish soda bread or Boxty bread go well on the side. Although the pig, the potato and cabbage are an obvious Irish trinity, they are not sacrosanct. Other vegetable combinations can please just as much (as we realised when eating the cold remains of the bacon joint on later nights). Sweet and tender spinach - not the coarse perennial sort - is a delight steamed until just wilted and served in a ring with a pond of melted butter in the centre and a barricade of mashed potato round it. Grate nutmeg over the whole lot, or season the spinach with a pinch of cinnamon and add almonds, raisins and orange zest for a medieval touch. Broad beans (one of the few vegetables that freeze well) are marvellous with bacon, particularly when dressed in a parsley cream sauce that includes enough parsley to warrant the name and is properly creamy (I use a mixture of the bacon stock and cream). It must not be a floury wallpaper paste. Braised celery hearts, grilled fennel finished with a smidgeon of Parmesan, and baked chicory have a lot to recommend them. Steamed green beans scattered with fried almonds, and stoved artichokes, are other possibilities. Strong contenders among potato dishes include Celtic onion and potato cake; creamy leek and potato gratin; saute potatoes; baked potatoes; and new potatoes steamed, sliced thickly and finished with mustard seeds that have been popped momentarily in hot oil. Good salads include orange and fennel; cooked matchsticks of carrot with black olives; a mixture of sliced avocado and ripe dessert pears; celeriac remoulade; chicory and pink grapefruit with a honeyed dressing; and Waldorf. When the joint became impossible to carve neatly, thin but ragged slices of bacon made open sandwiches with watercress on thickly-buttered soda bread one lunchtime. I used rather untidy chunks for a substantial soup-cum-stew with short lengths of leeks, carrots and broccoli and pieces of potato cooked in some of the bacon stock. (Do not boil the meat; add it to the pot at the end, just long enough to heat it through, and serve with a bowl of vinaigrette a l'oeuf for adding at table.)</p>

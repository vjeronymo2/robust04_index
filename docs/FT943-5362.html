			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Socialists jettison party dogma: Conference move brings SDP into line with rightwing coalition partner Japan's two-month-old ruling coalition of left and right was strengthened at the weekend when Socialist members voted to follow their leader and scrap their most extreme policies. The move, agreed at an extraordinary convention of the formerly pacifist Social Democratic Party on Saturday, is the biggest policy change in the SDP's history. It bolsters the authority of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the pragmatic Socialist prime minister, and removes the biggest risk to the survival of the originally unstable coalition: a policy split between the SDP and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, the largest partner. The decision angered the SDP's extreme-left minority, which staged drum-beating demonstrations outside the convention centre and begged Mr Murayama not to sell out to the LDP. One senior member of the left resigned and others might follow. A nearly two-thirds majority of the national convention voted in favour of a draft policy, accepting the existence of the country's self-defence force - Japan's military - so long as it was the minimum needed. While a relief to the government, this is a sign that defence spending could face a further squeeze in next year's budget. The party agreed that the US-Japan treaty, under which 24,000 US troops are based in Japan, must be 'firmly maintained', rather than turned into a mere friendship treaty, as in its previous policy. On taking office, Mr Murayama quickly dropped the SDP's traditional opposition to the US-Japan security treaty and to the existence of Japan's military. But until Saturday's critical test of his control, it was unclear whether SDP members would support him or rebel. Other changes to Socialist dogma included acceptance, for the first time, of the national flag and national anthem, formerly seen as militarist symbols. In an important move for energy policy, the SDP dropped its traditional demand to ban nuclear power and said Japan should continue to use those nuclear reactors now in operation until new energy sources could be found. The weekend U-turn means the SDP's official policies are now nearly the same as those of the LDP, the Socialists' traditional foe for nearly four decades until last year. The policy switch is likely to reduce, but not erase, any anxiety in Washington that the new government will be tempted to downgrade Japan's strategic links with the US. An element of uncertainty over just how far the SDP had embraced the US security tie was raised yesterday when Mr Wataru Kubo, party secretary general, said Japan should reduce and eventually drop the military aspect of its relations with the US and shift the alliance to a more internationally-oriented linkage.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Winding up operations after foreclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in the post-foreclosure context, this proposed rule provides that a holder that forecloses on an UST or UST system with ongoing operations may wind up the UST or UST system's operations without also being considered to be participating in management. Winding up is considered a protected activity by a foreclosing holder because, without such protection, foreclosure would not be possible where practical or commercial necessity dictates that the foreclosing holder undertake such actions. ``Winding up'' in the post-foreclosure context includes those actions that are necessary to close down an UST or UST system's operations, secure the site, and otherwise protect the value of the foreclosed assets for subsequent sale or liquidation. In winding up an UST or UST system, a holder may undertake all necessary security measures or take other actions that protect and preserve an UST or UST system's assets, including steps taken to prevent or minimize the risk of a release or threat of release of the UST or UST system's contents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Liability of a Holder as an Operator of an Underground Storage Tank or Underground Storage Tank System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this proposed rule would be promulgated under authority to write regulations governing UST activities, EPA intends that it be consistent with and further the purposes of the statutory security interest exemption found at Section 9003(h)(9). One critical aspect of the RCRA subtitle I statutory security interest exemption is that while it excludes a holder from the definition of ``owner'' for corrective action purposes, the statute does not explicitly address a holder's responsibilities as an UST or UST system ``operator.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The absence of explicit language in the statute regarding operators creates a potential problem for holders, since EPA's UST  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action regulations (as described in Section II. B of this preamble) apply to both owners and operators of underground storage tanks. Thus, although RCRA subtitle I clearly exempts holders from corrective action liability as ``owners'' of USTs, the statute does not address whether such otherwise exempt persons face correction action liability as ``operators'' of USTs. Without clear protection from corrective action liability as potential operators of USTs, EPA believes that lenders will continue to be reluctant to make loans to UST-related businesses due to continued uncertainty about their potential liability for corrective action. This regulatory proposal therefore addresses a holder's potential liability for RCRA subtitle I corrective action as an ``operator'' of an UST or UST system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under RCRA Subtitle I, being an ``operator'' is not synonymous with ``participating in the management'' of an UST or UST system. Section 9001(3)_Definitions and Exemptions_defines the term ``operator'' to mean ``any person in control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of the UST system.'' A person may, without being an ``operator'' of an UST or UST system, be sufficiently involved so as to be participating in the management (as that term is defined elsewhere in this proposal) of an UST or UST system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Pre-Foreclosure Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to foreclosure, a holder who is in control of, or has responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST or UST system is subject to the full range of requirements applicable to operators of USTs. In addition, a holder may also forfeit the protection of the proposed regulatory security interest exemption from compliance with the UST regulatory program as an owner if the holder participates in the management of an UST or UST system as defined in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a holder will not, as a general matter, have control of, or responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST or UST system prior to foreclosure in its capacity as a secured creditor who holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest. Prior to foreclosure, a holder is permitted to conduct those activities related to its financial and administrative obligations of managing a loan portfolio. The holder in this position will not lose its ability to take advantage of the proposed regulatory exemption exclusively as a result of engaging in these activities. See Section III.C.5 of this preamble for a more complete discussion of this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

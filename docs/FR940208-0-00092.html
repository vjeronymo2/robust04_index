			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Developed areas, such as towns, airports, and roads, and dry lakes, active mining operations, and water bodies will not be affected by the designation because they will never contain primary constituent elements. To the extent possible, these areas were deleted from critical habitat. If these areas were found along the periphery of CHUs, boundaries were redrawn to physically exclude them from the final maps. This was not possible for areas imbedded within individual units. Acreage totals were adjusted where possible to reflect their exclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of desert tortoises and suitable desert tortoise habitat (i.e., for nesting, sheltering, foraging, dispersal, and gene flow) are found on BLM land. Much of the private land included in the critical habitat boundaries results from checkerboard landownership patterns along railroads. The final designation of critical habitat includes the areas that contain the best remaining desert tortoise habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Economic Impacts of the Final Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The economic analysis (Schamberger  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993) provides the Service's conclusions on the potential impacts of the areas selected for final designation as critical habitat. This analysis served as a decision document in evaluating economic consequences of the action leading to the final decision to designate critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the requirements of section 4 of the Act, the economic analysis reviews the final economic impact of designating critical habitat. Only these incremental costs and benefits of designation may be considered in determining whether to exclude lands from designation. The economic analysis examined the costs and benefits of precluding or limiting specific land uses within portions of critical habitat beyond those restrictions that have already been implemented either for the benefit of the desert tortoise through the listing process or for some other reason. Incremental analysis was the appropriate method to use because the designation of critical habitat is the only action for which the Service now has decision authority. The economic costs of listing the species have already been incurred, and the economic effects of actions taken by other Federal or State agencies are outside the purview of the Service. The analysis was cast in a ``with'' critical habitat versus a ``without'' critical habitat framework and measures the net change in various categories of benefits and costs when the critical habitat designation was imposed on the existing baseline. The analysis evaluated national economic, or efficiency, costs and benefits that reflect changes in social welfare. The standard measure of those costs and benefits is economic surplus in the form of economic rents and consumer surplus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs of designating an area as critical habitat are the net economic costs of precluding or restricting certain land uses over the period of analysis. Costs are measured as the difference between the resource's value in its economically best use without critical habitat and its next best use (opportunity cost) when that use is precluded or restricted by critical habitat. Economic effects include a mixture of efficiency and equity measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic efficiency effects of designation include those that result in changes in social welfare. Regional economic impacts often represent transfers among people, groups, and/or geographic regions. For simplicity, economic efficiency effects are referred to as benefits and costs, and distributional effects are cited as economic impacts. National economic efficiency effects may include, but are not restricted to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Net change in aggregate value of capital (e.g., lands) due to critical habitat designation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Wage earnings foregone from a significant number of employees permanently displaced through critical habitat designation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Opportunity costs of foregone or precluded economic activities (e.g., curtailed or terminated land development); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Benefits of retaining genetic and biological diversity through specific species protection measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional (distributional) economic impacts may include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Changes in specific county tax revenues due to changes in land use (e.g., developed real estate versus raw, undeveloped land); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Regional social costs and benefits from factors such as transient unemployment, job training, or redistribution of existing job-mix categories (e.g., transitioning from underemployment in seasonal range or mine work to full employment in other sectors).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis of effects of critical habitat designation combines national economic efficiency effects and regional (distributional) impacts. These include effects on the net returns of local ranch operations, foregone grazing fees, compensation to allottees for permanent improvements to land leased from the Federal government for grazing, changes in total employment, and the portion of grazing fees that would be shared with local governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These consequences are presented in the context of size, relative to the value added, of the seven counties in which the grazing impacts would be realized. These consequences illustrate the relative magnitude of critical habitat designation economic effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

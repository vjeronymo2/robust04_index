			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MURPHY'S 'HARLEM NIGHTS' TOPS RECORD BOX OFFICE WEEKEND  </P> <P> Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" led a blockbuster weekend in the box office that  broke all fall and winter non-holiday weekend records, according to  Entertainment Data, Inc. Early estimates for the Top 10 pictures are $50  million, up 43% for the same weekend last year. Despite soft reviews,  Paramount's "Harlem Nights" grossed $16 million on 2,180 screens -- the second  highest Thanksgiving / Christmas film debut behind the $19.9 million opening of  "Rocky 4" in 1985.  </P> <P> After four weeks in the No. 1 slot, Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking" slipped a  notch with a weekend take of $8.5 million. Disney's animated instant-classic  "The Little Mermaid" opened strongly at $6 million, followed by Tri-Star's  ensemble drama "Steel Magnolias," which grossed $5.6 million on 480 screens for  a strong $11,303 per screen. Don Bluth's "All Dogs Go To Heaven" (MGM/UA)  finished No. 5 with $4.7 million.  </P> <P> In limited release, Orion's "Valmont" -- director Milos Forman's version of  "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" -- opened quietly on seven screens and grossed an  estimated $100,000 for a per-screen average of $14,285. In comparison, last  year's "Dangerous Liaisons" by director Stephen Frears averaged $28,150 on  three screens over the four-day holiday weekend of Dec. 23.  </P></p>

The proposed action would have deleted the existing provision for terminating action, required repetitive leak checks of both the forward and aft lavatory drain systems, and added an optional procedure for complying with the rule. That proposal was prompted by reports of engine and airframe damage, engine separation, and damage to property on the ground, caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had dislodged from the airplane. This action revises the proposal by changing the optional procedure, adding a requirement for installation of a cap on the flush/fill line, and requiring periodic leak checks of the flush/fill system. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That supplemental NPRM proposed to revise a previously issued NPRM that proposed the supersedure of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;5250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986). AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07 currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. The previously issued supplemental NPRM proposed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Delete the existing provision for terminating action;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Require repetitive leak checks of both the forward and the aft lavatory drain systems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide an optional procedure for complying with the rule, which would entail revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to incorporate a schedule and procedure to conduct leak checks of the lavatory drain systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action was prompted by reports of engine and airframe damage, and one report of engine separation on a Boeing Model 727 series airplane that occurred subsequent to the issuance of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07. These incidents were caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had broken loose from the airplane and struck the fuselage or had been ingested into the engine. The proposed action also was prompted by reports of leakage from lavatory drain valves that have a configuration similar to that specified in AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07 as terminating action. Such leakage can result in the formation of blue ice, which can dislodge from the airplane and result in engine damage or separation, airframe damage, and/or a hazard to persons or property on the ground.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY;  </P> <P> PARKING LOT RATES INCREASE  </P> <P> The county's Small Craft Harbor Commission Wednesday endorsed doubling the  parking rates from $1 to $2 at some lots in Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> The advisory commission voted 4 to 0 to urge the Board of Supervisors to  approve the increase to bring marina parking rates in line with charges at  private lots in the marina area.  </P> <P> The increase will generate an estimated $221,000 a year in additional revenue.  </P> <P> Summer parking rates at Marina Beach parking lots will remain $5 during the  day, but the summer rate after 6 p.m. would rise from $1 to $2. The $2 rate  would also apply during the day in non-summer months, and the entry fee at  other marina parking lots would increase from $1 to $2.  </P></p>

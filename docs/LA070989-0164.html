			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO DEBT TALKS REPORTED CLOSE TO AGREEMENT  </P> <P> Negotiators for Mexico and a consortium of commercial banks said Saturday that  they are "close to agreement in principle" on a new financing package for that  cash-strapped country that is likely to exceed $3 billion.  </P> <P> Banking industry officials said the outlines of the accord probably would be  completed late this coming week. Full details of the package are not likely to  be worked out for several weeks after that.  </P> <P> The statement, issued jointly by senior negotiators for both sides, was  intended to signal the likelihood that they will reach an accord before the  start of the annual seven-nation economic summit in Paris on July 15-16.  </P> <P> The two sides have been under intense pressure from the U.S. Treasury  Department to end the three-month stalemate and hammer out an accord that  President Bush can use to show that his new Third World debt strategy is  working.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand has invited leaders of 22 poor countries  to an eve-of-summit dinner to discuss the debt issue, and U.S. officials fear  that Bush could be embarrassed if an accord is not in hand.  </P> <P> The U.S. proposal, unveiled March 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,  already is under growing criticism by debtors and creditors alike, mainly on  grounds that it cannot provide enough relief to do the job.  </P> <P> The plan calls on commercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans to Third  World countries in return for receiving guarantees from the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank for the remainder of their loans.  </P> <P> Saturday's statement said the pending new accord was likely to include "a range  of options," from paring the amount of the debt owed by Mexico to providing new  bank loans to that country.  </P> <P> The total of new loans and debt reduction for Mexico would amount to slightly  more than $3 billion. The Mexicans had asked for something approaching $6  billion to $7 billion.  </P> <P> The negotiations had been stalemated for months, and the Mexicans had begun to  consider taking new measures -- such as placing their current debt payments in  escrow -- that would escalate their skirmish with the banks.  </P> <P> However, in the past two weeks, the Bush Administration has stepped up its  pressure on both sides to complete agreement on at least the outlines of an  accord. Brady himself jumped into the fray.  </P> <P> The talks are being conducted in New York by a 15-bank advisory committee  headed by William R. Rhodes, a vice president of Citibank, the largest bank in  the group, and Jose Angel Gurria, the Mexican undersecretary of the Treasury.  </P> <P> Mexico has a $107-billion foreign debt, of which about $75 billion is owed to  commercial banks, both U.S. and foreign.  </P></p>

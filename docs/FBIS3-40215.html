The relationships between the powder  properties and the preparation factors such as reaction  temperature, carrying-gas flow rate, and reactant densities are  studied. The _b_-SiC ultrafine powder with uniform size (&lt;  0.1  m), high purity (30 weight percent of carbon content), and  homogeneous crystalline structure is obtained through the  decarbonization, deoxidization, and crystallization processes.    Key words: ultrafine silicon-carbide powder, CVD,  low-molecular polysilane.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Due to its high-temperature mechanical properties, and good  thermal shock-resistance property, SiC is one of the major  materials in research on using high-temperature ceramics for  engine parts.[.sup]1[/]    To make superior ceramics by a sintering method, one of the  crucial techniques is to prepare ultrafine (nanoscale) ceramic  powders having the properties of non-agglomeration, size  uniformity, and high purity.[.sup]2[/] The best method to  prepare SiC ultrafine powder is the chemical vapor deposition  (CVD) method.[.sup]3[/]    Among the several CVD methods, one is to prepare the SiC  ultrafine powder from reactions between silicon-content monomers  (e.g., SiCl[.sup]4[/], SiH[.sub]4[/]) and carbon-content  monomers (e.g., CH[.sup]4[/],  C[.sup]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]),[.sup]4[/]; and another, from  the thermal decomposition of organic silicon compounds  containing both carbon and silicon (e.g.,  CH[.sup]3[/]SiCl[.sub]3[/],  CH[.sup]3[/]SiH[.sub]3[/],  [(CH[.sup]3[/])[.sub]2[/]Si][.sub]2[/],  etc.).[.sup]2,5[/] However, in the monomer reactions, the  existence of chlorine reduces the production rate, corrodes the  equipment, and pollutes the environment. Moreover, when the  carbon-to-silicon ratio (C/Si) is too low, too much free silicon  is produced. Therefore, it is worthwhile to research other  systems.    This paper studies the production factors of making SiC  ultrafine powder from low-molecular polysilane (LPS), which is a  by-product from synthesizing polyalkyl silane, as raw material  and high-purity argon as carrying gas. The research also  analyzes the composition, structure, and configuration of the  ultrafine powder.  <H5>  2. Experimental Work </H5>   2.1 Raw Materials: LPS is a by-product generated  from the cracking process of making polyalkyl silane from  polysilane. It is a pale yellow liquid composed of organic  silicon oligomers with different boiling points. These oligomers  have chain or ring structures with    <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-12A>           Equation </FIG>     as the backbones, and an average molecular weight of 250.  They vaporize completely at 300C.    2.2 Carrying Gas: The carrying gas is high-purity  argon with 12 x 10[.sup]-6[/] of oxygen and 16.5 x  10[.sup]-6[/] of H[.sup]2[/]O as analyzed with a DH-3C  trace-oxygen analyzer and a US-1-1A trace-water analyzer,  respectively.    2.3 Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine  Powder: As shown in Figure 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-12B>           Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of the Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine Powder </FIG>     2.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization and  Crystallization of the Ultrafine Powder: The SiC  ultrafine-powder product from the reaction is amorphous. The  powder is treated at 1600C for crystallization as well as  decarbonization and deoxidization to remove the free carbon and  oxygen in the ultrafine powder.    2.5 Ultrafine Powder Characteristics: The powder's  infrared spectrum is obtained with a Hitachi 270-30 infrared  spectrometer. The size and configuration of the powder are  determined with a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope  (TEM); the powder crystal structure, with a type D/max-IIIA  X-ray diffractometer; and the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen  contents, with a USA PE2400CHN element analyzer.  <H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5> <H5>  3.1 Effects of Reaction Temperature </H5>   Under the condition that the argon flow rate is controlled  at  0.24 L/min; and LPS flow rate, 0.025 g/min, different powder  batches are made within the temperature range of 900 to  1300C, as shown in the TEM photos in Figure 2. The reaction  temperature has little effect on the particle size and  configuration. The powder diameters are between 0.05 and 0.1  m with very narrow distribution, and most particles are  spherical.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13A>           Figure 2. SEM Photographs of SiC Powder Synthesized at Different Temperatures </FIG>     Figure 3 shows the relationship between the powder's carbon  and the hydrogen contents and the reaction temperature. The  carbon content increases and the hydrogen content decreases with  the increase of the reaction temperature. The fact that the  hydrogen content in the SiC product is zero at the reaction  temperature 1300C indicates that the transformation of the  organic LPS to the inorganic SiC is complete. In LPS, the ratio  of carbon to silicon is 2:1, therefore the total carbon content  in the ultrafine powder exceeds the theoretical value (30 weight  percent) and free carbon exists in the final product. At low  temperature, the main cracking product is CH[.sup]4[/] which  will be carried out by the gas flow; as a result, the carbon  content is comparatively low for the low-temperature reaction  product. At high temperature, the cracking product is mainly  H[.sup]2[/], therefore the free-carbon content in the product  increases.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13B>           Figure 3. Effect of Reaction Temperature on the C and H Mass Content in SiC Powder </FIG>    Figure 4 depicts the infrared spectra of products obtained  at  different temperatures. It shows that as the temperature  increases, the transformation of the organic LPS to the  inorganic SiC is gradually completed. At 450 cm[.sup]-1[/],  there is a Si-O absorption peak. As the temperature increases,  the peak becomes weaker. The existence of the Si-O bond is  caused by the infusion of oxygen, one of the impurities in LPS.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13C>           Figure 4. Infrared Spectra of LPS and Its Pyrolytic Products Obtained at Different Reaction Temperatures </FIG>  <H5>  3.2 Effects of Carrying-Gas Flow Rate </H5>   When the reaction temperature is controlled at 1100C  and  LPS flow rate at 0.025 g/min, at different argon flow rates, the  ultrafine powders remain spherical. When the argon flow rates  are 0.088 L/min, 0.24 L/min, and 0.535 L/min, the diameters of  the ultrafine powder are 0.1 m, 0.075 m, and 0.04  m,  respectively. The SiC ultrafine-powder diameter decreases with  an increase in the argon flow rate. The SiC ultrafine-powder  growth is a kinetics phenomenon. After SiC ultrafine powder is  formed, its growth depends on its length of stay in the furnace.  The higher the carrying-gas flow rate, the shorter the SiC's  stay in the furnace, consequently the finer the powder produced.  <H5>  3.3 Effects of LPS Flow Rate </H5>   When the furnace temperature is controlled at 1100C and  argon flow rate at 0.24 L/min, SiC ultrafine powders are  prepared at different LPS flow rates. The results show that when  the LPS flow rate is at 0.025, 0.065, or 0.160 g/min, all  powders are spherical having a diameter 0.75 m, which  indicates that the LPS flow rate does not affect the size or the  configuration of the SiC ultrafine powder.  <H3>  3.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization, and Crystallization of  SiC Ultrafine Powder </H3>   As aforementioned, the SiC ultrafine powder prepared by this  method contains free carbon and SiO[.sup]2[/], which as  impurities produce unfavorable effects on the material; thus,  decarbonization and deoxidization are needed. Besides, the  prepared SiC ultrafine powder is amorphous, therefore,  crystallization is also needed.    To achieve the purpose of decarbonization and deoxidization  and in the meantime crystallization, this process utilizes  high-temperature (about 1500C) reaction in which free  carbon reduces SiO[.sup]2[/] and forms gaseous SiO and CO,  which eventually evaporate. At the same time the crystallization  is also completed. The XRD results (Figure 5) show that as the  crystallization temperature increases, the SiC ultrafine powder  gradually transforms from the amorphous state to the _b_-SiC  crystalline state. When the reaction temperature reaches  1500C, _b_-SiC is virtually completely crystallized, and  no other phases are observed.      Figure 4 shows that after crystallization for 2 hours at  1500C, the infrared absorption peak at 450 cm[.sup]-1[/]  in the SiC ultrafine-powder spectrum disappears, which indicates  that the powder is deoxidized.    The element analysis shows that the carbon content of  decarbonized SiC drops from 39.54 percent to 30.15 percent,  which is basically close to the theoretical carbon content (30  percent) of SiC. The fact that the color of the ultrafine powder  changes from brownish to whitish also indicates that the powder  is completely decarbonized.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-14A>           XRD Patterns of SiC Powder Treated at Different Temperatures </FIG>  <H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>   (1) The LPS CVD technique can produce SiC ultrafine powder.  The technique is feasible because of its low processing  temperature, lack of corrosion, and simple procedures.    (2) The carbon and hydrogen contents are mainly controlled  by  the reaction temperatures: the higher the reaction temperature,  the higher the carbon content, and the lower the hydrogen  content. The SiC ultrafine-powder size is controlled by the  carrying-gas flow rate: the higher the flow rate, the smaller  the particle size.    (3) After the transformation from LPS, the SiC powder  product  is always carbon rich. After the decarbonization, deoxidization,  and crystallization treatment, high-purity, uniform-sized and  almost completely crystallized spherical _b_-SiC ultrafine  powder can be obtained.

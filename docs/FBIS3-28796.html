			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japanese banks posted a  record low year-to-year growth rate in January of 0.5 percent in  the average balance of lending, reflecting weak demand for funds  amid the sluggish economy, the Bank of Japan said Thursday [10  February].    The balance stood at 525.4 trillion yen at the end of  January, the central bank said.    The banks involved are 11 major commercial banks, 64  regional  banks, 65 second-tier regional banks, three long-term credit  banks and seven trusts banks.    It was the third consecutive month in which the lending  growth rate has hit a new low.    Major commercial banks in particular made an effort to step  up lending, said a Bank of Japan official.    "But with fund demand generally frail, there was too much  competition to get a piece of the pie and the lending situation  basically stayed the same," he said.    "I don't think lending will drop in the future, but it  probably won't increase for a while either," he said.    The balance of lending by the major commercial banks, known  as city banks in Japan, rose 0.4 percent, while that of  long-term credit banks grew 0.1 percent.    Regional banks saw a 1.8 percent rise, and second-tier  regional banks posted a 0.4 percent increase. But trust banks  saw a decline for the fourth straight month, dropping 1.7  percent -- the biggest fall on record.    Trust banks are probably suffering from the lack of  popularity of their mainstay variable-interest loans whose rates  are decided by the long-term prime rate, the central bank  official said.    Foreign banks saw a decline for the second straight month,  but the drop by 14.7 percent was smaller than the 15.5 percent  decline in December.</p>

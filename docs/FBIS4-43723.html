			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister and FDP Chairman Klaus </F> Kinkel by Einar Koch; place and date not given: "Mr. Kinkel,  Are You Afraid of the Bundestag Elections?"]    [Text] Defeat in the European elections, failure to cross  the 5-percent threshold in Hamburg and in Lower-Saxony -- BILD  asked Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Kinkel: Are you  worried about the Bundestag elections on 16 October?    [Kinkel] No! After the lost European election everybody in  our party now knows what is at stake. Now we must fight back  rather than complain. We are fighting for each and every vote.  Without a strong FDP it will not be possible to continue the  liberal-conservative coalition after 16 October. The  alternative is: red-green -- or at least something just as bad:  a grand coalition.    [Koch] How does the FDP want to manage to get into the next  Bundestag?    [Kinkel] We are entering the election campaign with our own  tax concept. We want to ease the tax burden on the citizen and  the economy. This means that the solidarity surcharge must be  reexamined after three years with the goal of abolishing it  completely or at least reducing it gradually.    [Koch] What about tax reductions?    [Kinkel] Payroll and income tax must be reduced at all  levels. Private households must be recognized as employers.  Trade capital tax and property tax for companies must be  abolished completely. This must be discussed in government  negotiations after the elections.    [Koch] Social Democratic Party [SPD] Deputy Chairman Thierse  does not rule out a social-liberal coalition from the outset....    [Kinkel] The SPD is completely out of step. A debate about  a red-green coalition cannot be silenced anymore. The initial  upswing in the polls was false euphoria. Just before its party  congress the SPD's leading team is not exactly personified  confidence in victory.</p>

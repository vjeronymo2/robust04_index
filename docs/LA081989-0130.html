			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 100 FRANCHISERS WILL SELL THEMSELVES DURING 2-DAY EXPO AT DISNEYLAND HOTEL  </P> <P> It's hard to think of something these days that some franchise, somewhere,  doesn't sell.  </P> <P> There are franchises that will dye your carpets, rent you a gown, or rustproof  your car. A Vacaville outfit franchises Wooz, an amusement park in the form of  a gigantic maze that people pay to enter so that they can find their way out.  </P> <P> Many of the nation's 2,500 franchise companies will be represented today and  Sunday at the Worlds of Franchising Expo at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> For two days, more than 100 franchise firms -- a record number for the show --  will be hawking business opportunities and ideas to the 8,000 to 10,000 people  expected to attend.  </P> <P> For the companies -- which represent about 20% of the nation's franchise firms  -- the expo is a chance to find potential investors and business people who  might become franchisees.  </P> <P> For the public, it's a chance to find out how to become a franchisee -- those  entrepreneurial, small-business people who want to own their own businesses but  who also crave the security of a bigger entity's tested and true way of making  a business work.  </P> <P> And these days, franchises are hotter than a Big Mac.  </P> <P> Projections are that franchises will account for about half of all retail sales  by the year 2000 -- up from the one-third estimated now, according to the  International Franchise Assn., the Washington-based association that is putting  on the expo. In fact, the association estimates that a new franchise outlet  opens about every 17 minutes.  </P> <P> That's a lot of sales. And the trend shows no signs of slowing, according to  industry officials.  </P> <P> Franchises are particularly popular in California -- home for 20% of all of the  franchise companies in the United States.  </P> <P> "It's where the action is," explained John Reynolds, marketing director of the  IFA. "California is known as the land of promise, so it attracts many  entrepreneurs who start companies here.  </P> <P> So it's no surprise that many of the exhibitors at this weekend's expo are  based in Orange County. The roster includes two private postal services --  A.I.M. Mail Centers of Mission Viejo and Mail Serv of Irvine; El Toro's  Children's Orchard, which specializes in inexpensive clothing for youngsters,  and Huntington Beach's Money Mailer, an advertising and direct-marketing  franchise firm.  </P></p>

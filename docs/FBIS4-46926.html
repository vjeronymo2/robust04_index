			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Veniamin Bereslavskiy, under the "From a Fact to </F> a Phenomenon" rubric: "Summer: Mercury Hunters"]    [Text] Thirty children from a multifamily building on  Parashyutnaya Street in Primorskiy Rayon finished out the school  year at the clinic of the Medical Institute of Pediatrics. They  were recently discharged from the hospital after comprehensive  evaluation and treatment. As the intern of the chair of  childhood diseases, M. Soboleva, testifies, signs of the  influence of mercury, which to one degree or another affected  the health condition of the young patients and may be a factor  in their future, were found in all the children.    The case with which I began occurred precisely when the Days  of Protection Against Ecological Dangers was being held in St.  Petersburg. The two-month event has the resounding motto,  "Ecology--Safety--Life," which in itself testifies to the  significance of raising ecological issues in the city. The lives  of the people are indeed on the line! However, recently yet  another warning sign--"Attention--mercury!"--appeared on  Podkovyrov Street in Petrogradskiy Rayon, next to a house where  a playground used to be. Almost one month has passed, but so far  only the initial work on the cleanup of the area has been done.  The further demercurization (this is precisely what a mercury  cleanup is called) has been suspended, because it is not clear  who must pay for the quite complex measures to clear away the  pileups of construction refuse, metal, and all kinds of junk, as  well as to dismantle a burned-out outbuilding.    Mercury does not forgive haste and negligence; it appears on  the list of particularly poisonous, toxic substances. Inhaling  mercury vapors is extremely harmful: The liver, the kidneys, and  the nervous system are afflicted. Initially, the symptoms of  poisoning are unclear and fuzzy--fatigue, irritability,  headaches, dizziness. However, most serious diseases develop  later under the protracted influence of the vapors.    After an extensive survey was taken several years ago, it  was  discovered that about one-half of the schools in the city, one  day-care center in five, and one-fifth of the premises of  health-care facilities, including maternity wards, were  contaminated with mercury. Major measures to control the danger  of mercury were taken; the citywide Demercurization program was  developed for the first time in Russia and is being implemented.  An obstacle was thrown up to the vicious "mercury breath." A  tremendous and significant effort has been undertaken; as of  now, contamination has been cleaned up in all schools and  day-care facilities for children of the city. It is forbidden to  use any instruments containing mercury in class; nor is mercury  used in chemical experiments now.    The case is more complex with health-care facilities,  numerous colleges and scientific research institutions, and  enterprises where mercury-containing instruments are used. They  usually get away by claiming that demercurization will allegedly  interfere with the normal operation of enterprises and  institutions. However, is it normal for newborns to be on  occasion held in rooms where the maximum permissible  concentration of mercury is exceeded? Is it normal for students  to remain for a long time in laboratories contaminated with  mercury? Is it normal for dozens of enterprises using mercury  and instruments containing mercury not to be certified from the  point of view of ecological danger? Is it normal that any one of  us may be taken hostage by some plant in whose compound the  unrecorded poisonous metal freely "circulates?"    For the first time, mercury cleanup specialists developed,  jointly with the sanitation and disease control inspectorate,  clear-cut rules for recording, storing, and using mercury and  mercury-based instruments, set strict norms, and mapped out all  possible obstacles in the path of the toxic substance. Alas, the  documents on which protection for you and me could have been  based have drawn no response from the mayoralty for many months  now.    Fortunately, St. Petersburg is one of the few cities of  Russia that has everything it takes to control mercury  pollution. An ecological unit is in operation at the All-Russian  Institute of Geophysical Surveys, VIRG (telephone 567-88-02)  whose specialists can promptly survey premises, city  territories, and sources of water supply. The State Enterprise  for Ecological, Geological, and Geophysical Research, EGGI  (telephone 312-62-09) has likewise mastered all up-to-date  methods for mercury detection and cleanup at facilities. The  municipal PITsER--the St. Petersburg Engineering Center for  Ecological Projects--was established in 1991. It has assumed  responsibility for both emergency efforts and planned actions to  clean up contamination, and for the collection of mercury and  mercury-containing instruments whose service life has ended or  which have broken down while in operation.    Even during such a small accident, it is best to call in the  PITsER at the telephone 218-80-69.    The mercury cleanup specialists of St. Petersburg earn their  bread through hard labor. It is good that several subdivisions  exist which are independent of one another--the PITsER, the  EGGI, the VIRG-Rudgeofizika. It is bad that they, those who  protect us against a real threat, are put in a situation of  continuous rivalry, that each one of them uses solely his own  methods without striving to use outside accomplishments. I think  that it would be very proper for our environmental protection  department to ensure effective interaction. It is hardly  reasonable at present to sacrifice some elements and be left  without knowledgeable and self-sacrificing people when the  danger has not been completely eliminated.</p>

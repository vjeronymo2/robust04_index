			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Italy passes tough Mafia law: Decree to strengthen hand of authorities wins cross-party support ITALY'S new government last night won approval in the lower house of parliament for a tough new anti-Mafia decree. Put forward after the recent murders of Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino, two prominent judges in Sicily leading the fight against the Mafia, the new ruling will strengthen the hand of police and magistrates tackling criminal organisations. The lower house also passed an amendment which means politicians caught buying votes from gangsters could face up to six years in prison. The government, led by Mr Giuliano Amato, has been faced with a public outcry since the two assassinations. Its immediate reactions after last month's murder of Mr Borsellino included sending 7,000 troops to Sicily to help local police and carabinieri. The government decided not to turn the vote on the new decree - which had already been approved in the Senate, the upper house - into an issue of confidence, following signs of broad cross-party support. It did however agree to drop a clause which would have given police greater powers to detain suspects without charge following criticism from the main opposition Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). The decree will also lay to rest the High Commission for the Fight against the Mafia, which was set up in the early 1980s but which has proved ineffective in tackling organised crime. The organisation would have become partly redundant next year, when Italy's new anti-Mafia DIA, modelled on America's FBI, comes into operation. Italy's financial markets rebounded for the second day running yesterday after Monday night's surprise cut in interest rates by the Bank of Italy and last week's agreement on ending the scala mobile wage indexing system. The half-point reduction in the official discount rate to 13.25 per cent and in the rate for fixed-term advances to commercial banks to 14.75 per cent contributed to a slight decline in the lira. The Italian currency was fixed at 755.83 against the D-Mark, compared with 754.95 on Monday. Shares on the Milan stock exchange rose for the second consecutive day, with prices rising by over 2 per cent and the Comit equity index closing up 7.71 points at 424.35. However, brokers warned that the rise came against a background of very thin trading.</p>

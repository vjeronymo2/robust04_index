			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Privatisation is a big issue for Colombia  -The Emerging Investor If the active investors in Colombia's stock market had their way, Mr Andres Pastrana would probably be the country's next president. Mr Pastrana, the Conservative candidate, polled about 20,000 votes less than his rival from the governing Liberal Party, Mr Ernesto Samper, in the first round of the presidential election on May 29. Because neither managed to garner more than half the vote, the two face a run-off on June 19. Although President Cesar Gaviria is a Liberal and his government was responsible for the economic modernisation programme which has opened the country to foreign trade and investment, many investors suspect Mr Samper would backtrack on some of Mr Gaviria's policies, or at least not push ahead with them. 'Basically, the market thinks that Samper would stop privatisation and Pastrana would go ahead with it,' said one financier in Bogota. His pledges to raise the minimum wage and to try to ensure that benefits spread to the poor 'may be commendable but may not send the right signals to foreign investors,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis, chief emerging market economist at Bear Stearns in New York. 'My guess is that the market would probably prefer Pastrana to win, but we're really talking about shades of grey here, not black and white.' From the stock market perspective, privatisation is important, although the Colombian government was never as big a stakeholder in industry as other Latin American governments. There is a large unfulfilled potential demand among international investors for Colombian shares, and privatisation offers the possibility of expanding the traded float. A majority of the Dollars 18bn market capitalisation never trades, because the families and other groups which run the companies keep a tight grip on their shares so as not to lose control of their companies. Of the 176 companies listed on the exchanges of Bogota, Cali and Medellin, only about 20 trade in any volume. The unwillingness by family groups to cede control is a phenomenon impeding stock market development in many Latin American economies. But it is especially important in Colombia because of a rule that gives holders of 30 per cent of a company veto power over decisions. These groups are, if anything, attempting to tighten their control on their companies, said Mr Mauricio Botero, a partner in Corredores Asociados, the biggest stock broker in Colombia. The overhang in demand may, however, help to explain the relatively modest declines of the Colombian market compared to the rout in emerging markets earlier this year. Last week the market was only about 4 per cent off its March all-time high. As a further indication of the demand, 'out of the Dollars 2.3bn of approved foreign investment in shares, only about Dollars 350m has been invested,' said Mr Roberto Santa Maria of the Bogota Stock Exchange, which claims about half of the country's equity trading. Foreign investors must register with the government, a measure intended to prevent drugs traffickers using front companies to bring back money into the country's stock market. When Cementos Diamante decided to take advantage of this foreign demand a few weeks ago, it issued not common stock but the presumably less attractive non-voting preferred stock in the form of American Depositary Receipts. Even so, such is the rarity of Colombian paper - it was only the third ADR issue by a Colombian company and the first from a non-financial enterprise - it was still heavily oversubscribed. More ADR issues are likely. Carulla, the supermarket group, is could make an issue of perhaps Dollars 30m. Banco de Colombia and Banco Ganadero are expected to launch issues and the latter may be the first Colombian company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Banco de Bogota is also said to be considering an ADR offering. Privatisation could further add to the float. With its popularity high, the government is no lame duck and it is widely expected to move ahead on some privatisations. These could include Banco Popular and other government shareholdings such as Promigas, the gas transportation company, now part of the Ecopetrol state energy company. Mr Paul Weiss of Corredores said that all should be privatised through the stock exchange and listed, and 'should make a sizeable difference to the market'. Yet even these may be taken over by big private groups. Stockbrokers would like the government to force companies to consolidate their balance sheets, although some companies, such as Cementos Diamante, already do. To the chagrin of international investors, this is not done at the moment resulting in higher p/e ratios than would otherwise be the case. The market is about 24 compared to an estimated 16 if accounts were consolidated. Foreign investors have been allowed into the market since late 1991, but they are not the only new force. There is substantial competition among the managers of the newly-allowed private pension funds. The system is voluntary but in two months, 160,000 people have signed up, an estimated 5 per cent of the market dominated by the state-run Institute of Social Security. 'In the long-term the pension funds are going to be very important institutions in this market,' said Mr Weiss. Nonetheless, this will merely accentuate the lack of a large float of Colombian equities which can be traded. Mr Santa Maria believes that over time Colombian companies will begin to see advantages in 'sharing some of the risks of ownership with others'. In the mean time, he is clearly frustrated that when companies do raise new equity, many of them prefer to do it in the US or international markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          3/6/94    Week on week change Stock                          Country   Dollars   Dollars    %                                          close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Light Servicos De Eletricade   Brazil    0.2472    0.0466     23.22 United Microelectronics        Taiwan    4.1732    0.7001     20.16 Tatung                         Taiwan    2.6221    0.3498     15.39 Teco                           Taiwan    2.7698    0.3497     14.45 Aygaz                          Turkey    0.2263    0.0275     13.85 Ege Biracilik                  Turkey    2.0489    0.2447     13.56 Bagfas                         Turkey    0.1804    0.0214     13.46 Alarko Holding                 Turkey    0.6881    0.0765     12.50 Michaniki                      Greece   40.8663    4.2092     11.48 Koc holding                    Turkey    0.5046    0.0459     10.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

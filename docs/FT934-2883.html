			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Negative equity loan plan targets new clients Centrebank, the direct banking arm of Bank of Scotland, has launched what is believed to be the first loan scheme for homeowners caught in negative equity who are not existing customers. A mortgage for a new property can be provided with a loan covering the deposit on the new house and the shortfall between the outstanding mortgage and the selling price of the old property. The loan is secured against the surrender value of an existing life policy. Borrowing is at 0.5 of a percentage point above Centrebank's variable mortgage rate. Abbey National has launched a negative equity scheme for existing borrowers. Up to Pounds 25,000 of negative equity can be transfered to a new mortgage.</p>

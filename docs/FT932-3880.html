			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Aker optimistic in spite of sharp fall to NKr47m AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday revealed a sharp fall in four-month pre-tax profits to NKr47m (Dollars 6.8m) from NKr332m in the same period last year. However, last year's figures were helped by a gain of NKr380m from the disposal of the group's shares in Valenciana, the Spanish cement producer. 'If exceptional items are excluded, the result after financial items is better than last year,' Aker said. The improvement in the group was mainly attributed to sharply reduced net financial costs to NKr50m from NKr148m, due to significant debt repayments last year. Long-term debt stood at NKr4.23bn at end-April, compared with NKr6.35bn at the same time last year. Group operating profit improved substantially to NKr135m from last year's NKr32m. Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, said he expected a sharp improvement in group operating profit for 1993. Sales rose to NKr5.57bn from NKr5.38bn last year as operating costs increased to NKr5.25bn from NKr4.98bn. The cement and building materials division saw four-month sales dip to NKr1.68bn from NKr1.75bn, but achieved a profit after financial items of NKr30m, against a loss of NKr173m in 1992. Aker said the improvement was mainly due to a better result in the group's international cement business, which returned a profit of NKr18m. The division also made a NKr94m gain on the disposal of a waste treatment plant. The oil and gas technology division lifted sales to NKr3.66bn from NKr3.21bn, as profit after financial items rose to NKr105m from NKr94m. Four companies within the division improved their four-month performance and Aker expects the division as a whole to achieve a better result this year than it did in 1992. Aker's other activities saw turnover reduced sharply to NKr231m from NKr415m and suffered a loss of NKr48m, compared with a profit of NK342m last year. Aker blamed the decline on the disposal of Nybro Bjerck and lower sales by Stord International.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONN COURT REJECTS ALL-GERMAN ELECTION RULES  </P> <P> West Germany's highest court on Saturday rejected the current rules for  December's all-German elections, a move likely to split the left-wing vote and  further strengthen Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chances of reelection.  </P> <P> The decision by the Federal Constitutional Court appeared to throw a life  preserver to small East German parties, which had played a key role in last  fall's East German revolution but had seemed likely to face extinction in the  unified German vote, scheduled for Dec. 2.  </P> <P> Although the ruling by the eight-judge panel requires adoption of a new  election law, parliamentary leaders said Saturday that the Dec. 2 balloting  need not be postponed. Friedrich Bohl, leader of the ruling Christian  Democratic party, said that a new plan will be introduced in Parliament this  week, with swift passage expected.  </P> <P> The ruling has no affect on German reunification, scheduled to occur Wednesday  under an East-West treaty that went into effect Saturday.  </P> <P> The high court objected to a rule that all parties must poll at least 5% across  a united Germany to win any seats in the new all-German Parliament but that  parties not competing in the same areas could "piggyback" or join forces to  clear the hurdle.  </P> <P> That arrangement was fine for the Social Democratic Party, main rival of Kohl's  Christian Democratic-led coalition. The Social Democrats had hoped to lure  voters from the reformed East German Communist Party, now calling themselves  the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), who had no real chance of finding an  ally big enough to help them over the hurdle.  </P> <P> But the court said that Bonn should apply a separate 5% hurdle for eastern  Germany, virtually ensuring that the PDS and the East's Alliance 90, a grouping  of civil rights activists, will be able to enter the new Parliament under their  own steam.  </P> <P> With a split left-wing vote, the Social Democrats' already poor chances of  defeating Kohl's center-right alliance have weakened.  </P> <P> East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, a Christian Democrat and close  ally of Kohl, welcomed the decision, saying that it supports what he has been  advocating all along.  </P> <P> "The constitutional court's judgment is a resounding slap in the face for the  electioneering games of the (Social Democrats) in East and West," he said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Bonn braces for the absorption of the East German army.

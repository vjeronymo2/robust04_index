			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says Hong Kong People Should Not </F> Have Any Concern Over the Chinese Troops Stationed in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Apr (WEN WEI PO) -- Zhang Junsheng  and Zhu Yucheng, two deputy directors of the XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch, stressed today that the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  is of good quality and well-discipined because it is the  people's own army. Hong Kong people should not have any concern  over the troops stationed in Hong Kong.    Zhang Junsheng said: "The PLA is the people's own army in  our country and an important force for defending our nation.  Thanks to a strong PLA, our country can be independent and  enjoy a stable environment for economic construction.  Therefore, we should more readily accept our PLA." A reporter  mentioned that some PLA men had beaten civilians, and Zhang  replied: "It is possible that one or two people in the armed  forces violate discipline, and such things may happen in any  country in the world. This afternoon, the leaders of the  military unit also said that if such things happen, they will  handle them seriously. I think that we should still set our  eyes on the mainstream of the Army."    Zhu Yucheng said: "The troops to be stationed in Hong Kong  in the future certainly should know more about Hong Kong, and  the best troops should be selected for this mission. I hope  that more activities like this will be organized. Hong Kong  people should not be concerned over the PLA because they are the  people's own troops and their quality and discipline are  absolutely perfect."</p>

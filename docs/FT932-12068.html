			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / French rates cut as franc strengthens THE Bank of France yesterday took advantage of the latest easing in German monetary policy by again cutting its two key interest rates. The French authorities cut their intervention rate, which sets the effective floor for money market rates, by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent. They also cut the 5-10 day lending rate, the effective rate floor ceiling, by the same amount to 9.25 per cent. The cut in French rates came in the wake of Wednesday's larger-than-expected cut in the cost of lending short term funds to German commercial banks. The Bundesbank cut its repo rate to 7.75 per cent from a previous 8.09 per cent. Yesterday's easing in French monetary policy came amid signs of increasing confidence in the French franc among foreign exchange and money market dealers. The currency yesterday strengthened in the wake of the rate cut, closing in London at FFr3.369 against the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.374. This was the first time the French currency had closed stronger than FFr3.37 to the D-Mark this year. At the same time, French money market rates continued their recent fall. Three-month French franc interest rates yesterday closed about 20 basis points lower on the day at 7.90 per cent. This means that 3-month French franc rates are now only 18 basis points above 3 month D-Marks. The narrowness of that spread is seen by dealers as an important sign of the French franc's intrinsic strength. At the height of the recent currency crises, French franc rates have had as much as a 4 percentage point premium over those of the D-Mark, reflecting fears that the franc might have to be devalued in the exchange rate mechanism. However, there is no sign so far that lower rates have bolstered confidence among French business. The latest INSEE monthly survey published yesterday showed that business confidence in France had deteriorated since the start of the year, particularly in the motor and construction industries. According to INSEE, the level of orders remains at an unusually low level and most businessmen do not expect to increase output in the short term. Hopes of recovery were damped by yesterday's announcement that unemployment rose sharply by 1.4 per cent in March, taking the jobless total to a record 3.06m, or 10.7 per cent of the work-force. Hugh Carnegy adds from Stockholm: In the wake of the Bundesbank rate cuts, Sweden's central bank, yesterday cut its key marginal interest rate by 0.25 points to 9.25 per cent.</p>

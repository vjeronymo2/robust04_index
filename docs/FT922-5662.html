			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hitachi set back 37% as demand weakens HITACHI, the Japanese electronics company, reported a 37.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y128.9bn (Dollars 991.5m) for the year to end-March, and along with the entire Japanese industry, blamed the decline on weak demand for semiconductors and computers. The company said sales had risen 3.6 per cent to Y3,925bn, but noted that production of chips and computers had been well below capacity, and sales of consumer electronics had fallen 7 per cent on the previous year. Japanese electronics companies, which dominate the market for memory chips, have been particularly bruised by the unexpectedly weak demand for the present generation of 4Mbit chips. The industry is still suffering from a two-year downturn in the domestic audio-visual equipment market. Hitachi said its capital investment for the current year would be around Y160bn, down from Y207.5bn, while research and development spending would be about Y400bn, slightly lower than last year's level of Y411.6bn. Apart from weak demand, the Japanese electronics industry's ability to invest has been curbed by the higher cost of capital since the collapse of the Tokyo stock market. For the current year, Hitachi is forecasting a slight fall in sales to Y3,900bn and a further fall in pre-tax profit to Y120bn.</p>

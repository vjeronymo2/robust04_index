			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Scottish Equitable SCOTTISH Equitable is launching a product which combines investments in its cash and worldwide tactical unit trusts. The idea is that 30 per cent of the sum is invested in the cash trust; monthly withdrawals are then made to generate income which (since it represents return of capital) is tax-free. The remaining 70 per cent is invested in the world-wide tactical unit trust, with the aim of producing enough growth to more than recoup the income withdrawals. Worldwide Tactical Trust was 15th (out of 115) funds in the international equity growth sector over the five years to July 1, with a return of 83.8 per cent. There is no guarantee that the original capital will be returned. The income taken can be up to 6 per cent of the total invested but, of course, the higher the income level, the greater the risk to capital. The product has a five-year term but there are no penalties for early withdrawals. Charges on the investment are 5.25 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual on the worldwide tactical trust; 0 per cent initial and 0.5 per cent annual on the cash trust. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000.</p>

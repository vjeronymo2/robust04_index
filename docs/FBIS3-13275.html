Praise be to God and peace be upon the prophet and his scion and  upon God's pious people. On the last Friday of the blessed  month of Ramadan and on the International Day of Jerusalem, we  salute the memory of our late imam, who gave the jihad movement  for liberating Palestine fresh impetus through his declaration  of this great day.    This year, the heinous crime at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque  awakened people, especially the Islamic nation, and their  interest in the cause of Jerusalem, Islam's primary cause.  Zionism exposed its alien, aggressive face. It was naive for  some to extend a hand of friendship to the usurping invaders and  forget the movement of jihad, which the mujahidin staged for  years and paid with the blood of many virtuous martyrs. Those  people left the ranks of jihad and struggle, deluding themselves  into thinking that the Israeli leaders would grant them special  privileges on the land of Palestine.    The Palestinian issue clearly demonstrates the right of the  Muslim Palestinian people to jihad. There is no need for  incidents like the one in Hebron for people to realize the  intrigues of Zionism and the lies of its leaders and protectors  when they talk about peace in the Middle East. We must warn  those who deviated from the right path and tell them that they  should return to the movement of jihad along with the sons of  the Islamic nation and the valiant Palestinian people,  consolidate the bonds of Islamic unity, and comply with what  Islam and the Koran decided for them. They must be assured that  there is no other way to achieve the rights of the persecuted  Palestinian people than struggle and steadfastness. The Zionists  and their covetous protectors will never stop their aggressive  and expansionist spirit without the jihad of the Muslim people,  which God promised victory and might. Peace be upon you. There  is no help except from God. When comes the help of God and  victory, and thou dost see the people enter God's religion in  crowd, celebrate the praises of the lord, and pray for his  forgiveness, for he is oft-returning in grace and mercy.  [Koranic verses]</p>

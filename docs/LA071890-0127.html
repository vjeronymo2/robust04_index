			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ELECTORATE TO DECIDE JOB PROTECTION ISSUE  </P> <P> It will be more difficult to remove the city clerk from office if voters  approve a proposed City Charter amendment that will appear on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> The City Council this week voted 6 to 1 in favor of presenting an amendment to  voters that, if passed, would require a two-thirds vote by the City Council to  fire the city clerk.  </P> <P> Currently, the procedure calls for a simple majority vote. There council has  seven members.  </P> <P> Councilman Daniel E. Griset voted against placing the amendment on the ballot.  "I've long held the view that the five-vote protection is appropriate for  managerial positions and the clerk's job is essentially a clerical position,"  he said.  </P> <P> Councilman John Acosta disagreed and said the procedure for firing the city  clerk should be the same as that used to fire the city manager and attorney.  </P> <P> "I believe in parity," Acosta said. "I think this brings the clerk in line. We  have three hired employees and they should all be under the same rules."  </P> <P> Acosta, along with councilmen Richards L. Norton and Ron May, tried  unsuccessfully two weeks ago to place amendments on the ballot that would  change the requirements for firing the city manager and city attorney, calling  for a simple majority vote instead of a two-thirds vote. After those amendments  were voted down, Norton suggested the amendment concerning the city clerk.GREG  HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

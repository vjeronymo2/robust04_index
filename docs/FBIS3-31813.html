			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["di. ann." interview with IMF Representative in Albania Wei </F> Ding in Tirana; date not given: "How Albania Came First"]    [Text] Tirana -- "Albania is the country with the highest  growth rate in Europe, and with inflation similar to Poland's.  The country's growth is expected to continue." This was the  sensational statement by IMF Director Michel Camdessus. Albania  grew by almost 11 percent in 1993, with its program of economic  reform, fast privatization especially in agriculture, and the  liberalization of trade, prices, and currency exchange. "The  agricultural sector grew fastest," IMF Representative in Albania  Wei Ding told GAZETA SHQIPTARE. "This branch is also the  largest single component in the GNP."    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What is the GNP in 1993 expected to be in  absolute figures?    [Wei Ding] It is estimated that it will turn out to be  approximately $1.1 billion. On the basis of a population of 3.3  million this corresponds to an average income of about $330 per  person in 1993. Construction grew fast at 31.5 percent,  transportation at 13 percent, and trade, tourism, and services  at 1.5 percent. The 10-percent decline in industrial production  has influenced the final total, but it must be borne in mind  that the growth of the GNP of a modern economy is not measured  solely by manufacturing production. Added value in all forms,  i.e. selling for more than you bought, counts as growth. Here,  one must also count for example what peasants produce for their  own consumption.    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will growth continue in 1994?    [Wei Ding] Growth will continue. It is planned to be about  8 percent this year. We hope that industrial production will  not continue to fall. Thus, Albania may be again be among the  countries with the highest growth rates.    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What work will the IMF do in Albania in  1994?    [Wei Ding] Our program is a continuation of last year's.  It aims at technical assistance for the government in  formulating its medium-term economic reform program. We also  aim to mobilize international support for Albania.    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Inflation is expected to reach 20 percent  in 1994. How will this figure affect the revival of the economy  and foreign investments?    [Wei Ding] Albania's inflation figure was not very high in  1993 either. The figure of 20 percent expected for 1994  indicates economic stability, and will attract foreign  investors. They will want their long-term interests to be met,  that is to profit from their investments, which they can only do  in a stable economy.    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What do you think of the banking system  in Albania?    [Wei Ding] In my experience, this is the most difficult  sector to reform not only in Albania but in all the countries of  the East, because this was the most old-fashioned sector. The  banking system in Albania has not been divided into two levels,  with the Central Bank and the merchant banks. We would also  like there to be private secondary banks that would service  various branches of the economy. This would also help the  process of bank privatization.    [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will private banks be opened in Albania?    [Wei Ding] In fact you have one private bank, the  Italo-Albanian Bank. Its example shows that improvements to  this system cannot take place overnight, because they involve  the customers, the staff, the management, and the banking  infrastructure. Meanwhile, we must decide what will be the best  privatization scheme, and work is being done on this in  cooperation with the government. There are applications to open  private banks from Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and  Malaysia. I hope that Albanians too will have opened private  banks by the end of this year. Perhaps some of these currency  exchange bureaus will be turned into banks. There are still  technical problems, such as the amount of starting capital that  Albanian private banks must have. These matters are still under  discussion.  <H5>  [Box, page 3] </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Growth in GNP in 1993, by sector:                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry                              |-10.0 percent                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture                           |14.5 percent                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction                          |31.5 percent                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transportation                        |13.0 percent                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others                                |11.5 percent                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Structure of GNP (total 100 percent)                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry                              |14 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture                           |56 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction                          |9 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transportation                        |3 percent                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others                                |18 percent                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

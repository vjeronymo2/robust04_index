			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Charles Enderin, including </F> interviews with two unidentified arms dealers, and comment by  Ahmad Hillis, a Fatah leader -- recorded; arms dealers and  Hillis speak in Arabic with superimposed French translation]    [Announcer] Israelis and Palestinians today announced a  real breakthrough in the negotiations over the Israeli  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, negotiations that  have been bogged down for three months. An agreement is all the  more urgent because tension is rising on the ground, in  particular, in Gaza where there are more and more clashes  between Palestinians against a background where firearms are  proliferating. Our correspondent Charles Enderlin reports:    [Enderlin; against video dated December 1993 showing masked  uniformed men parading and firing into the air] The phenomenon  has reached unprecedented proportions in Gaza. Whereas only  three months ago fighters scarcely dared show their weaponry,  today there are hardly any parades or rallies by Palestinian  organizations without a show of assault rifles.    A huge underground firearms market has come into being. The  dealers sell to organizations like Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] or Fatah, but also to individuals.    [Arms dealer] [video shows him sitting in home, with a few  rifles and pistols; clip captioned: Gaza, this morning] I only  sell to those who are defending society, not to people who buy  weapons for the pleasure of walking around with a gun.    [Enderlin] Where do you import the goods from?    [Arms dealer] The Kalashnikovs come from Egypt. All the rest  from Israel, in particular the ammunition.    [Second arms dealer] [video shows him standing outside  house,  waving a pistol] A 9-mm pistol like this one costs 3,000  dollars, 18,000 francs. A Kalashnikov 36,000 francs; the highly  prized American M-16 costs 66,000 francs. Before the agreement  with Israel it was very hard and very dangerous to get hold of  items like this. Today it is easy. There are a lot of goods,  and the Israelis do not give a damn.    [Enderlin] The heads of the Fatah military wing are worried.  They are afraid of accidents and inter-Palestinian clashes.  They seize the weapons of individuals who do not belong to any  movement.    Yesterday, several hundred students demonstrated outside the  PLO headquarters against the sale of weapons, and against  fratricidal clashes. Ahmad Hillis, one of the Fatah leaders,  makes his accusations:    [Hillis] The Israeli authorities have completely stopped  controlling weapons. But Gaza will not become a second Lebanon.  If we have peace, things will settle down. Otherwise, all these  weapons will be turned against Israel.    [Enderlin] Only the establishment of autonomy and the rapid  deployment of the Palestinian police will prevent Gaza from  sinking into anarchy.</p>

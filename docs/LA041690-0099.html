			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LONDON ROCK FANS THRONG CONCERT SALUTE TO MANDELA  </P> <P> More than 70,000 rock fans thronged to an anti-apartheid concert televised to a  potential audience of 1 billion people today as a tribute to black nationalist  leader Nelson R. Mandela and his campaign to end white minority rule in South  Africa.  </P> <P> Mandela and his wife Winny both smiled broadly and raised their right fists in  a symbol of defiance as they entered London's Wembley Stadium and sat in a  special section with other dignitaries.  </P> <P> Mandela was scheduled to deliver an address at the conclusion of the concert.  </P> <P> The audience crammed the arena to capacity, cheering, waving flags and  releasing balloons as a succession of musicians performed on a vast stage  adorned with the colors of the African National Congress and African art  murals.  </P> <P> The first artist in the program, expected to last some four hours, was singer  Patti LaBelle. Others on the card were Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Simple  Minds, Lou Reed, Neil Young, Chrissie Hynde, Dave Stewart and Miriam Makeba.  </P> <P> "If anyone had trouble with the traffic getting here, there was one guy who  took 27 years to get here," said British comedian Lenny Henry.  </P> <P> The British Broadcasting Corp. said 26 nations -- a potential audience of 1  billion people -- will receive live coverage, giving Mandela the largest  platform to air his views since he was released after 27 years in jail on Feb.  11.  </P> <P> Organizers said there will be numerous collaborations and unlikely duets  between musicians. The event is predicted to be of a similar magnitude as the  1985 Live Aid concert and a 1988 event staged to mark Mandela's birthday in  captivity.  </P> <P> Mandela is in Britain for the first time in 28 years but has refused to meet  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who eased sanctions against Pretoria because  it proceeded with reform plans, including releasing him and legalizing the ANC.  </P></p>

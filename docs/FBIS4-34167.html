			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan F. De La Puente Mejia] </F>   [Text] "Operation Aries" has, among other things, proved  that Upper Huallaga some months ago became the last great  stronghold of the Shining Path [SL] and that, as in most of the  Peruvian jungle, it is still too early to talk about a "post-SL  era."    One of the first lessons learned from the events in April is  that the current antisubversive strategy must be reviewed. The  strategy that has been most effective--which weakened the  peoples' support for the SL and prevented its infiltration in  the towns--was devised by General Arciniega between 1989 and  1990. This strategy simultaneously sought to militarily defeat  the terrorists and to restore the confidence of the people in  the state. This strategy recovered the initiative, give military  actions a bit of an edge, and thus changed the course of the  war; it gave up the idea of repressing coca plantations and  isolating the civilian population--especially coca growing  peasants--from the SL; it began assistance programs and  encouraged coca growers and the inhabitants of Uchiza and  Tocache to become organized.    The strategy used throughout "Operation Aries," seems to be  a  more schematic and less creative application of the strategy  that has been implemented--with the exception of Arciniega's  time--nationwide. Its objectives seem to be exclusively military  and nonpolitical, leaving little room for civilians, with the  exception of their participation in the assistance programs. The  people do not understand why security forces appear one time  with foodstuffs and medical assistance and another time on an  operation that violates their rights.    Since the start of terrorist actions in Upper Huallaga, the  antiterrorist struggle has overlooked the fact that this  territory is substantially different to that in other emergency  zones. Violence continues in Upper Huallaga--unlike in the  mountains and in coastal regions--due to endemic poverty, the  concentration of wealth, and the lack of development. The  peoples' need for protection from abuse by drug traffickers and  the struggle against a government obsessed with eradicating coca  plantations helped the Shining Path to grow strong. What the SL  saw as "rebellion," the people interpreted as "protection."    Likewise, it would be interesting to assess the results of a  military operation that was described as an orderly offensive  when in truth it was a counteroffensive.    It was obvious, and reported in various forms, that during  the past few months the SL has been engaged in a desperate  offensive and a geographic relocation, a fact that was not  acknowledged or wrongly assessed by the military command of the  zone. Following its most recent nationwide meeting--last  February--the SL began a nationwide offensive on 1 April with  its greatest expectations centered in Upper Huallaga.    The same sources stated that between 1 and 6 April the Armed  and Police Forces lost many agents due to SL ambushes,  commenting that "Operation Aries" was a hasty and poorly planned  action. This explains why the SL "Red Sea" column easily eluded  the military barrier, why no significant arrests took place at  the theater of operations, and why the military command made the  great mistake of holding the International Red Cross  Organization responsible for the terrorists' escape.    This is explained in the fact that "Operation Aries" had  purely military objectives.    The following factors were not taken into account when the  Cuchara, Primavera, and Yanajanca valley's were surrounded and  when the towns scattered throughout the 80,000 hectares were  bombed (with rocket fire):    First, that territory has for a long time rejected the SL  units and settlers have refused to cooperate with them. Second,  that territory has been covered by the "Red Sea" column which  came to intimidate the settlers. Third, that territory is of  political interest to the government and the other institutions  that are carrying out projects to replace coca. It is also the  place where Enaco [National Coca Enterprise] is campaigning to  legalize the illegal coca plantations, and these initiatives  require the confidence and cooperation of the civilian  population for their success.    The second problem that transcends the defeat of the SL is  the endemic lack of democratic institutions, and the profound  economic, and social backwardness of the zone. The people blame  successive governments for the lack of democracy and  development, these governments promised great projects but did  not carry them out and only remember the existence of the zone  every time there is an antidrug or an antisubversive operation.  The people recognize, however, that small progress to combat the  endemic evils of the region have been made since 1990.    It would be a mistake, therefore, to fail to appreciate the  few civilians who live in Upper Huallaga and to use them  exclusively to form peasant defense patrols. An antisubversive  strategy that destroys what little government and democracy  there is there could achieve a military victory in the  short-term but it would leave the next governments with their  hands tied when they try to manage that region which is part of  the large Peruvian jungle of which it is said a great deal of  our future depends. It is necessary to consider that in the  post-SL era, the lack of a development model to successfully  replace the drug trafficking economy with the state economy will  again be a reason for confrontation and demand. It would be  risky if the legacy of the Armed Forces amounts to nothing more  than simply arming peasant defense patrols.    To give an example of the current situation of the towns and  cities of Upper Huallaga, we should look at Uchiza and Tocache,  which were the magic cities of the past and always full of life.  Today they have electricity for just a few hours a day, their  streets are not paved, and health care and education are poor.  Until a few years ago, the association of parents in high  schools gave "allowances" of food and housing to graduated  teachers who agreed to stay in the zone despite the dangers.    Aucayacu is not connected to the Mantaro Electrical Plant,  it  has thermal equipment like Uchiza and Tocache. Its streets are  not paved and the highway to Tingo Maria, which was once paved,  is unrecognizable--the 300 or so ditches opened by the SL some  years ago have been filled but not paved.    Tingo Maria is the worst case of neglect. Even though it is  the capital of the province, the state has invested very little  in this town where 50 percent of the shantytowns have no  electricity and 30 percent of its streets are not paved.    Following the heated municipal elections which many believe  were won by Ramon Julca, the people had great hopes of Mayor  Loyseth Reategui Lopez's administration. But Tingo Maria  inhabitants were disappointed in less than a year. It turns out  that the worst municipal administration in Peruvian history has  spurned the people and handed over all its power to the  military. Reategui's recent statements justifying cases of abuse  and denying the violation of human rights and dubious actions by  her administration prompted the creation a few days ago of the  Leoncio Prado Defense and Development Front, headed by Guanilo  Lopez.    The Front has protested over the signing of a huge contract  between the Fonavi [National Housing Fund] and Tecnicos  Ejecutores S.A. The deal is endorsed by Reategui and will  supposedly provide electricity to the shantytowns. The funny  thing is that, after the contract was announced, it became  apparent that the shantytowns will benefit least while Tingo  Maria, which already has nine electricity supply lines, will be  further electrified at a very high cost that will be paid by its  neighbors.    Guanilo Lopez has warned of a possible fraud and pointed out  that while the electrification of the rest of the country is  funded by the Treasury through Foncodes [National Compensation  and Social Development Fund] or the Ministry of the Presidency,  in Tingo Maria--a town plagued by poverty and fear--development  costs the earth. Lopez stated that this contract sounds even  more suspicious when one considers that another enterprise,  Orion S.A., quoted for the same job for half the price.    One of the most vulnerable towns is Tingo Maria, due to the  constant overflowing of the Huallaga River. It has not had the  municipality's support to create a Civil Defense office. On the  contrary. According to the Front, donations by the National  Civil Defense following the floods early this year have  disappeared. The list of irregularities also mentions the  over-invoicing of the roof of the market place (by 100,000  soles), the paving of airstrips, and the hiring of enterprises  that belong to councilmen, which is prohibited under the penal  code.    Nevertheless, the mayor continues on her controversial path  and reacts to any complaint by recalling Huanuco's campaign to  become annexed to Ucayali. Sectors of the local media maintain  this would be even worse, that Ucayali will not worry about  Tingo Maria if currently it does nothing about Aguaytia which is  much nearer to Pucallpa. Many believe the only solution is for  the government to take care of Tingo Maria.    The situation in rural areas is no better. Rural  investments are limited and, despite some achievements by the  Upper Huallaga Development Project (PEAH), the main objective  has failed: to broaden the agricultural border.    The main problems facing agricultural development are the  transfer of technology and the successful diversification toward  the eradication of coca plantations.    But things are not that easy: Decades of coca plantations,  which hardly require any technology, have created a mentality  that prefers easy crops and despises technology. Despite its  potential, the farming sector in Upper Huallaga uses less  technology than anywhere else in the country.    The same occurs with the coca replacement. Although it has  been proven that traditional crops (cocoa, corn, fruit, rice,  and others) would be best to replace the coca plantations, most  implemented projects tend to try other crops (silkworms, the  luisa plant [small plant grown in Peru for medicinal purposes])  which are not working. Among the identified problems in the  development of the rural sector are the lack of markets,  technical assistance, and product promotion.    To meet Upper Huallaga's demands, the government would have  to change its attitude toward that region. It has been proven  that the replacement of coca plantations and neoliberalism are  contradictory.    The SL began the year by consolidating a strategy it has  been  using for months. It involves the regular use, for the second  time, of the corridor from Monzon Valley (in Upper Huallaga) to  the northern mountain region in Huanuco Department and from  there to the provinces east and south of Ancash; at the same  time they moved their forces north, toward Lower Huallaga  (Campanilla, Juanjui, Bellavista, and Picota, in San Martin  Department) and east, toward Padre Abad Province (Ucayali  Department). At the same time, its Huanuco Zone Committee was  elaborating a plan that has clear objectives for Huanuco  University and the shantytowns that surround this city.    This movement is the alleged result of undeniable facts: the  SL's relationship with the rural population of Upper Huallaga is  coming to an end and in many zones (for example the pockets near  Aucayacu) it is openly rejected. Other factors include the SL's  failed attempt to administer the coca economy, a substantial  reduction in the rural population due to the crisis affecting  the coca production, the shifting of the drug trade to the north  of San Martin Department, the Central Jungle, and Madre de Dios,  and the harsh blows by the Armed Forces over the past few years.    At the height of its power, members of the SL took over  small coca producing peasant villages scattered throughout the  Huallaga Valley where they imposed their law and their  organization. They appointed delegates and established a "local  force." They appointed those responsible for logistics,  military, and political affairs; they issued rules and punished  those who violated them. The town that had been "taken  over"--more often than not with the consent of its  inhabitants--was revisited several times and became an SL  recruiting center.    It seems that the villages are now disavowing SL impositions  and it looks like relations between SL and the civilian  population are no longer cordial. The strict SL moral codes,  which generally do not apply to SL members themselves, are no  longer welcome. The so-called "local forces" and the  "grass-roots forces" are experiencing a true crisis.    In this new stage, SL has decided to strengthen its  so-called  "main force," that is, the mobile columns that make up the  People's Guerrilla Army (EGP). The most important of these  (comprising 120 to 150 men) is the "Red Sea" battalion; another,  comprising 60 to 70 men, operates in Pucayacu--a town near  Aucayacu--where they killed four people, among them the  president of the local Mothers Club and a Foncodes [National  Compensation and Social Development Fund] promoter. On 17 and 18  May, when an "armed stoppage" was staged, SL columns were  spotted near the Padre Luyando district and between Crespo,  Castillo, and Aucayacu. In spite of this, the "armed stoppage"  was a failure.    This reversal could be fatal for the SL. By resorting to its  columns, SL is entering a field it does not dominate, that of  large-scale guerrilla warfare. So far, SL has preferred to  perpetrate simple ambushes or bomb attacks, killing civilians or  military personnel, and attacking towns that have no police or  military protection. There have been very few instances of  clashes over the past 14 years (the takeover of the Huamanga and  Vilcashuaman jail; the attack on the Uchiza police post; and the  attack on the Madre Mia military base in Upper Huallaga, among  others). It is well-known that in its creed, SL puts heroism  before military training; dedication before sophistication. To  counter this disadvantage, the SL has been forced to violate one  of the most sacred rules of "President Gonzalo" [top SL leader  Abimael Guzman]: "Do not buy weapons, seize them from the enemy."    Everything indicates that the SL has become modernized in  the  Upper Huallaga area and now has sophisticated weapons; this is  proven at the military command's press appearances. Until  recently, we saw shotguns, booby traps, and handguns. Now they  carry FAL [Light Automatic Rifles] and RPG [antitank grenades],  Instalaza rockets, fragmentation grenades, etc.    This is not the only rule the SL members in Upper Huallaga  are violating: Compared with their traditional ideological  anachronisms, their current actions have no political meaning  and they are acting more like bandits. An example of this is  their incursion in Pucayacu on 14 May: The president of the  local Mothers Club was killed "for accepting food assistance  from imperialism" yet later...SL members carried off 3 metric  tons of the same food supplies.    Stern nom de guerres alluding to the Maoist tradition have  yielded to nicknames and aliases. Among these are "Chapulin,"  "Bigotes," "El Manco," "Yersi," "Napo," "Pepe," "Jeshuco,"  "Michel," "Anuje," "Taruca," "Chocolate," "Cucharita," "Popeye,"  etc. None of these would suggest to us Peruvian Maoist  combatants.    Villagers have reported that one of them, "El Manco," who is  believed to be the leader of the "Red Sea" column, is known for  his blood-thirstiness with his victims. Many legends have been  created about him. The most incredible removes him from the  political world and places him in the world of black magic:  Villagers say he made a pact with the devil who demanded one of  his arms in exchange for immortality. This is why he remains  unscathed in all the clashes.    Everything seems to indicate it will be hard for SL to  relocate itself in other areas and to base its actions on its  "main force." Moreover, it experienced a serious defeat in  Huanuco over its plans for the "Hermilio Valdizan University.  The arrests made in the last three months are believed to have  seriously damaged the party and the "party organizations."  [quotation marks as published]    Local experts have said these difficulties follow a  slackening of internal discipline. For example, it has been  reported that Huanuco SL members commemorated Mao's 100th  anniversary on 26 December in the town of Vichayoto (15 km from  Huanuco) with such a huge party that the following day scheduled  operations had to be canceled: The local main square was not  taken over. This resulted in the sparing of the lives of Mayor  Luzmila Temple, local regional government president Lucia  Shinsato, and Provincial Prosecutor Carlos Tucato, who were  supposed to have been assassinated.    In Huanuco, arrests have followed the detention of German  Campos Mallqui. He was arrested in January and numerous  documents were seized from him. His delayed repentance resulted  in the arrest of others, including some university professors  who are not directly involved in seditious activities. In light  of this, the proposed SL takeover of the Huanuco University  seems more and more unlikely.</p>

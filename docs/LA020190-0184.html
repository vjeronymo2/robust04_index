			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 SOUGHT IN KILLING, CATERING TRUCK HEIST  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies are still searching for three men in last week's lunchtime  armed robbery of a catering truck that left one customer dead.  </P> <P> Jesus Ramirez, 23, a polisher at Circle Fine Arts Co., was waiting in line Jan.  25 for a snack when he was struck by a single bullet fired by one of the  robbers, who had gone inside the truck to demand money.  </P> <P> "We don't know why the gun went off or why he was shot," said Sgt. Robert  Stoneman of the sheriff's information bureau. "There was nothing to indicate  any struggle."  </P> <P> The three men fled with about $7,000 in cash, police said. The catering company  was carrying extra money because it was payday at the Circle Fine Arts plant,  and some customers routinely cashed their checks at the truck.  </P> <P> The company makes picture frames and acrylic sculptures for sale at galleries  and gift shops.  </P> <P> A company official said that Ramirez, who lived in Chino, had only worked at  the plant for a few months. "I think Jesus Ramirez was just standing in the  wrong place at the wrong time," said the official, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> Witnesses said they had seen the three men, all of whom were armed, at the  location on previous paydays. The men were seen fleeing last Thursday in a  white Volkswagen, which was abandoned about a mile from the plant at 17930 Ajax  Circle. Later, they were seen getting into a rust-colored Ford Mustang.  </P> <P> The man suspected of shooting Ramirez is described as a Latino in his mid-20s,  about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing 140 pounds. He wore a gray cloth  jacket.  </P> <P> A second robber is described as a Latino in his late-20s, about 5 feet, 8  inches tall and weighing 175 pounds. He had long black hair, a black mustache  and wore reflective sunglasses. He wore blue jeans, a plaid shirt, black tennis  shoes and a blue bandanna.  </P> <P> A description of the third man was not available. All three spoke only Spanish  during the assault.  </P></p>

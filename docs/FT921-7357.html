			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / City watchdog chief to head Lloyd's inquiry LLOYD'S of London, stung by a barrage of recent criticism, has asked Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to direct inquiries into alleged malpractices at the insurance market. Sir David, a member of the Lloyd's Council since 1988, will oversee investigations into allegations that working Names, who have jobs with Lloyd's agents and brokers, have benefited at the expense of outside Names who were allegedly placed on poorly performing syndicates. Names are individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's. He will also co-ordinate investigations by Lloyd's into so called 'spiral' reinsurance business, in which Lloyd's syndicates reinsure each other's exposure to catastrophe risks. Spiral syndicates have registered devastating losses for their Names. Critics have suggested that the main purpose of spiral business was to earn commissions and fees for brokers and underwriters at the expense of syndicate members. Commenting on Sir David's appointment, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said: 'I needed a man who was so white that snow-white looked dirty. I realised that there had been a lot of fuss in Parliament and we couldn't ignore the allegations.' He said he hoped Sir David's appointment would 'at least stop outpourings of venom without any facts'. Action was also necessary to bolster confidence of Names and policyholders as well as the agents and brokers who trade at Lloyd's. 'The market is very numb. They've never been treated like this before. They find it utterly amazing that these allegations are being made,' Mr Coleridge said. Sir David's appointment, he said, was designed to 'raise the profile' and 'put into a higher gear' existing regulatory work, which has been under way since the end of last year. Sir David has chaired the SIB, Britain's chief investment watchdog, since 1988. Scrutiny of the way agents place Names on to the 280 or so syndicates currently trading had already been stepped up before the recent round of publicity, Mr Coleridge said. Lloyd's has already set up a number of independent review committees to ascertain the factors which contributed to the losses of the several spiral syndicates. The first of these reviews, into Feltrim syndicate 540/542, is chaired by Sir Patrick Neill, and is scheduled to report in the spring. Sir David, who could start on his task as early as next week, is expected to take at least two months to complete inquiries and produce a report, which Lloyd's expects to publish. Mr Coleridge said the existing staff and other resources of the Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market services for agents and syndicates at the market, may be insufficient. He added that Sir David would be free to appoint external consultants or draw on any other resources he might require. Mr Coleridge said he told Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour spokeswoman for City affairs, on Thursday that Lloyd's wanted either to 'demolish' the accusations or, 'if there was anything in them, we would get hold of the wrongdoers and string 'em up'.

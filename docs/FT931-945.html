			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / EC ambassadors support free trade zone EUROPEAN COMMISSION plans to negotiate a free trade zone with Russia between now and the end of the decade have won support from the 12's ambassadors to the Community. This initial endorsement comes as a delegation to Moscow of EC foreign ministers and the Commission today meets members of the Russian government to discuss the bilateral relationship and Russia's crisis. Brussels' request for a mandate to widen its 'partnership' negotiations with Russia to include an eventual free trade agreement has to be endorsed by foreign ministers of the 12 on April 5 in Luxembourg. The hope is to get an agreement that EC heads of government can approve at their summit meeting in Copenhagen on June 21-22. But despite fears that some member states might try to spike the proposal, 'all went surprisingly well' at this week's EC ambassadors' meeting to discuss it, said one EC diplomat. At first, France adopted a 'low-key' approach to the free trade plan, diplomats said, while Belgium - which had been reticent when foreign ministers had a preliminary discussion of the idea on March 8 - now strongly supports it. But the clearing of this preliminary hurdle coincided with news yesterday that the Commission has opened an inquiry into a surge of Russian aluminium imports into the EC, acting on a complaint from French producers.</p>

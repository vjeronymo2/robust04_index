			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Monsanto slips in first quarter MONSANTO, the US chemicals company, yesterday posted a 3 per cent decline in first-quarter net income to Dollars 161m, or Dollars 1.28 a share, on sales down 1 per cent to Dollars 2.19bn. A year earlier, Monsanto had net profits of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.31, on sales of Dollars 2.22bn. The Missouri-based company said 1992 sales had excluded revenues from several businesses involved in its restructuring. Mr George Krug, an analyst at Oppenheimer, had expected weak earnings comparisons for 1992, and Wall Street's reaction to the results was muted. Monsanto's shares closed Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 67 3/4 . Monsanto's agricultural division turned in operating income of Dollars 149m, just below the Dollars 151m reported last year, in spite of sales that rose to Dollars 515m from Dollars 499m a year ago. The decline was blamed on non-recurring factors. Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, said group income had actually increased in the quarter when adjusted for non-recurring factors and a disposal. The company's chemical unit achieved operating income of Dollars 87m on sales of Dollars 896m, compared with operating income of Dollars 83m on sales of Dollars 927m a year ago. The business benefited from lower raw material and manufacturing costs and higher sales volumes which offset a decline in selling prices. The Searle pharmaceuticals division had first-quarter operating income of Dollars 23m, against Dollars 19m a year ago, on sales which rose to Dollars 363m from Dollars 341m in the 1991 quarter. Operating income from Fischer Controls fell 38 per cent to Dollars 13m, while sales eased nearly 7 per cent to Dollars 215m from Dollars 230m. Operating income from the NutraSweet artificial sweetener business was nearly static at Dollars 38m, against Dollars 39m a year ago. Last year's figures included a Dollars 10m reorganisation charge. Sales in the 1992 quarter fell to Dollars 199m from Dollars 226m.</p>

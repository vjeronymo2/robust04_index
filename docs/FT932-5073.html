			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Soros factor lifts property - The Bottom Line SHARES IN commercial property companies have hit the roof. This week, when George Soros, the international speculator, announced he was sinking Pounds 284m in UK property, the sector rose by more than 6 per cent in a day. This added further sparkle to the revival in property share prices that started last September. Since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism, cuts in interest rates, hopes of economic recovery and the prospect of higher inflation pushed the property sector up by 92 per cent, compared with a 26 per cent rise in the FTA-All Share index. The stock market's enthusiasm for property shares is highlighted in the relationship between share prices and net asset values. As the chart shows, shares in property companies usually trade at far less than the value of their underlying assets. Now - and for only the second time in 15 years - shares are trading at a premium to asset value. There are two reasons. First, investors have been attracted by property shares' higher-than-average yield. Although prospects for dividend growth remain feeble, yields look increasingly secure as property companies become less likely to make dividend cuts. Second, the City has become increasingly optimistic about the outlook for asset values. Looking ahead, investors expect the discount to net asset value to reappear, as property values rise. But predicting the movements of property values is notoriously difficult. Moreover, any errors in forecasting property values will be magnified into large errors in net asset values, since property companies are highly geared. Would-be property investors are not confined to property shares. Two authorised property unit trusts are targeted at private investors: Barclays Unicorn Property Trust and Norwich Union Property Trust. In addition, Johnson Fry, the financial services group, is marketing a unquoted commercial property investment that will invest in high yielding property for a maximum of four years. However, most private investors are likely to rely on property shares if they want to be exposed to the sector. People wanting to spread their risk might consider the two investment trusts that specialise in property shares, TR Property Investment Trust and Trust of Property. Otherwise investors will need to select stocks with care, since the next few years are likely to see large disparities in the performance of different companies according to their spread of assets and quality of management. The ratio of debt to equity is important. The gearing of the large property companies ranges widely, from about 50 per cent for Land Securities to around 90 per cent for Great Portland Estates. On the face of it, the companies with the highest gearing will produce the greatest increase in net asset values, if property values are rising. But the City is often more enthusiastic about companies with lower borrowings that have the scope to make shrewd acquisitions, which is why the stock market has reacted enthusiastically to the recent spate of fund raising exercises. The property sector is dominated by a handful of large investment companies, namely Land Securities, MEPC, British Land, Slough Estates, Great Portland, Brixton and Hammerson. But analysts believe several smaller companies have good prospects. UBS, the broker, favours Town Centre Securities, Frogmore, Mucklow, PSIT, Capital &amp; Regional and Burford. Recovery situations, such as Scottish Metropolitan and Dwyer, may also prove rewarding, it says. But investors should be aware of the risks. Last week's collapse of Speyhawk, the developer, demonstrates that stock picking in this sector is still potentially treacherous. The ranks of smaller property stocks are littered with penny shares that may not survive. In any case, investors should not expect to make profits in the short term. Even the most enthusiastic City analysts are talking about a period of consolidation. It may take firmer evidence of an uplift in the underlying property market before the recovery in property share prices resumes.</p>

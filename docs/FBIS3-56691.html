			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military observer Vladimir Klimov: "Guarantee -- </F> Until February"]    [Text] The guarantee period of certain nuclear munitions  located in Ukraine runs out in February. There is no need to  explain what a delay in transporting them to Russia for  dismantling and processing into nuclear fuel would lead to.  This was the subject discussed at a news conference in the  Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Colonel-General Yevgeniy  Maslin, Major Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and Anatoliy Svetikov,  and also Boris Gorobets, spokesman for the Ministry of Atomic  Energy, spoke about the prospects of the agreement with Ukraine  on questions of dismantling nuclear weapons reached during the  meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and  Leonid Kravchuk.    There are 176 missile-launchers currently deployed in  Ukraine  and around 40 heavy bombers, accounting for around 2,000 nuclear  weapons. Some of them are in a potentially dangerous  [predavariynom] state. It is vital to transport them to Russia  in the immediate future for dismantling.    Russia is prepared to do this. Although the relocation of  certain nuclear weapons is dangerous, it will carry out all the  commitments it assumed at the summit. By way of compensation  Russia will supply uranium for nuclear electric power stations  to Ukraine for 10 months.    What if the Ukrainian Supreme Council suddenly refuses to  ratify the Moscow agreements? This question was raised at the  news conference. The answer that was given maintained that the  agreement between the three presidents theoretically does not  need ratification.    Furthermore, the people in Ukraine who are involved in  handling [obsluzhuvaniye] nuclear munitions understand the full  danger of the prevailing situation and will take the necessary  measures to implement the agreement. However, there are  politicians in Ukraine who will oppose the implementation of the  agreement for the sake of achieving their own ends or to keep  their long-occupied posts. What may the non-implementation of  the agreements lead to? If Ukraine wants to become a nuclear  power, the UN Security Council must ratify this decision. It  will scarcely come out in favor of the expansion of the world  nuclear club. Clearly its expansion would have a domino effect.  It cannot be ruled out that the DPRK and other states prepared  to make nuclear weapons would want to join Ukraine.    So we will trust in the sensible attitude of the people who  decide the state's future.</p>

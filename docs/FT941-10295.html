			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Girobank staff call first of one-day strikes Girobank clerical staff plan to strike next Wednesday in the first of a series of one-day stoppages in protest at the bank's basic offer of a 1.5 per cent consolidated pay increase. An overtime ban by the NCU communications union's 3,250 clerical staff at Girobank offices across the country started last week. The NCU said yesterday that the bank had been notified that further one-day strikes would be held on March 7 and 22. Girobank, which has been a subsidiary of Alliance and Leicester Building Society since it left the public sector in 1990, said it regretted the strike decision but intended to minimise disruption to customers. The bank said it hoped staff would ignore the strike call and go to work as usual next Wednesday. It pointed out that the full pay offer to its staff was worth an average of 9 per cent because it included a Pounds 300 unconsolidated bonus as a reward for co-operating in work changes. Staff have also been offered an extension of a job-security guarantee for a further 12 months. The NCU leadership recommended their members to accept the bank's package, but it was rejected in a secret ballot last autumn by 1,408 to 1,249. In a postal ballot last month the staff backed the use of strike action by 1,317 votes to 933. There was more overwhelming support for industrial action short of a strike, with 1,691 for and 599 against. Ms Jeannie Drake, NCU deputy general secretary, said: 'Given the Pounds 64.4m worth of profits generated by our members last year and the 20 per cent improvement in operational efficiency achieved, the bank's offer is a miserable reward.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, denied yesterday in the Commons that his department was involved in collusion with the Post Office to close sub post offices. Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP who is sponsored by the UCW communications union, said a letter from the Post Office's general manager in north Thames and East Anglia to staff revealing the Post Office's closure and sell-off programme targets had been 'agreed with the Department of Trade and Industry' was evidence of 'grubby collusion'.</p>

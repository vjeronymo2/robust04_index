			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] KEYHAN Economic Service -- Based on the latest  reports received from Tehran, following the serious disruption  of the economic situation in the Islamic Republic and the  intensification of the political disorder, there has been a  striking increase in the illegal flight of capital from Iran.  Sources close to international financial organizations who  follow changes in Iran have confirmed these reports. They say  the relatively old phenomenon of capital fleeing from this  country has taken on unprecedented proportions in recent months.    At the European headquarters of the World Bank in Paris, a  high-ranking official who did not want to be identified told  KEYHAN (published in London) that according to the latest  assessment by this organization, in the year 1993 about $8  billion in capital left Iran in various forms. The same official  disclosed that World Bank delegates recently submitted the  results of their assessment of this matter in Tehran. Six  members of the World Bank met with Morteza Mohammad-Khani,  minister of economic and financial affairs. This meeting was  attended by Daniel [?Pupay], director of World Bank cooperation  with Morocco and Iran.  <H5>  Why The Flight of Capital? </H5>   So far spokesmen for the Islamic Republic government have  treated the flight of capital as a normal phenomenon and have  attributed its increase in the years since the revolution to the  ill will of those affiliated with the monarchy regime and to the  consequences of the war. In its issue of 17 Mehr 1372 [9 October  1993], the newspaper RESALAT wrote: Based on the estimates that  were made, the volume of capital leaving Iran between the years  1352 [21 March 1973- 20 March 1974] and 1365 [21 March 1986-20  March 1987] was more than $27 billion, or about $2 billion per  year. The peak was in the years 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March  1979] to 1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], when agents and  affiliates of the former regime played the basic role.    However, the end of the war and the beginning of  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policy of "reform" was only able to halt  temporarily the massive flight of capital from Iran. This halt  ended months ago and has resumed at a more rapid rate with the  weakened position of those who supported "economic adjustment"  and the terror of the economic crisis. In the view of foreign  and domestic experts, the expedited flight of capital is caused  by four factors, the decline in value of the rial, increased  insecurity for investors, disorder in economic policy making,  and Iran's increased foreign debt.    1. The drop in value of the rial: Heightening inflation and  the irresistible erosion of the value of Iran's national  currency against international currencies is one of the main  reasons for the flight of capital. In view of the nation's empty  foreign exchange stocks, the drop in the price of oil, factory  shutdowns and the unprecedented increase in the demand for  foreign exchange, Iranian public opinion is convinced that the  price of the dollar on the free market, which is already  hovering around 212 tomans, will not remain at its current level  and that the rial will continue to fall (late in the week a  report was received that the price of the dollar on the Tehran  foreign exchange market reached 219 tomans). The long-term  outlook for Iran's national currency is especially dark in view  of the fact that all the Islamic Republic's experts expect a  significant increase in the inflation rate in the coming months.  'Ali Taqi-Khamushi, deputy from Tehran and chief of the Iran  Chamber of Commerce and Industries, recently discussed the 1373  [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. He said:  Unfortunately, this budget includes inflation of 50 to 60  percent.    2. Increased insecurity for investors: They have compared  capital to a bird that lands only in a secure environment and  flees as soon as it senses danger. Since the time of the  revolution of 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the Islamic  Republic has never been able to encourage Iran's capital to  participate actively in the task of the nation's economic  reconstruction. In the insecure atmosphere the vice-regency of  the chief jurisconsult has created in Iran, capital has been  either going into short-term profitable activities such as  brokering and speculating, or it has been going to foreign  countries at any price.    3. Disorder in economic policymaking: The lack of any kind  of  specific economic policy, the war between factions over  directions for development and continuous changes in choices  have made investors despair concerning the future and persuaded  them either to leave their capital inactive or send it out of  the country. In the last year, following the paralysis of the  nation's economic leadership apparatus and the crisis in the  policy of "economic adjustment," there has been a vast wave of  confusion in Iran's economic and financial circles and  confidence in the future has been severely shaken.    4. Increased foreign debt: The experience of Third World  debtor nations, especially in Latin America, shows that there is  a close relationship between increased foreign debt on the one  hand and the rapid flight of capital on the other unless the  indebtedness can be used in the framework of a specific and  constructive economic strategy to strengthen industrial  foundations. Iran's foreign debt, as we know, is one of the  worst kinds of debt a country can have, because it has been used  to import consumer goods. Moreover, because of its nature  (taking the form of usance), it comes at very high interest.  Increased foreign debt in a country like Iran is indicative of  even greater instability in its political and economic positions  and for this reason has made the atmosphere even more insecure  for investors, and it increases the illegal flight of capital.  <H5>  Consequences of Capital Flight </H5>   Iranian capital makes its way abroad in various ways: In the  form of cash in the transfer of foreign exchange, through  manipulation in the prices of export or import goods, and other  means. For example, exporters can show the amount of foreign  exchange earned from their exports to be less than it is and  they can keep the difference between the real foreign exchange  and the amount declared abroad. Likewise, importers may  negotiate with foreign companies to show the foreign exchange  needed to be greater than it actually is and keep the difference  abroad.    The flight of capital, in whatever form it takes, is very  costly to Iran's economy. The consequences can be summarized as  follows:     -  A significant portion of the nation's domestic savings is  transferred abroad instead of being used in economic  circuits.    -  The portion of incomes subject to taxes is reduced,  and since the government's revenues also decreases, a  significant share of the tax burden falls on the weak  classes.    -  It increases the demand for foreign exchange and for  this reason the fall of the rial against foreign currencies is  precipitated.    -  It decreases the resources needed for domestic  investment and drives the country to borrowing on the  international financial markets, thereby increasing the nation's  foreign debt.    Economic experts say the only way to combat the flight of  capital is to create a secure atmosphere, restore the overall  economy to soundness and put producing units into operation.  Legal restraints in this regard are not that effective.  <H5>  The Search for Capital </H5>   The flight of $8 billion in capital in one year is taking  place at a time when Iran is faced with an unprecedented drop in  foreign exchange. On Tuesday 12 Bahman [1 January] Hasan  Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, said in the province of  Semnan that due to the drop in the price of oil Iran has  suffered a $4 billion revenue loss in the year 1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994]. He added that during the First Five-Year  Plan Iran lost $6.4 billion in foreign exchange due to  fluctuations in the price of the dollar against other  currencies. Rowhani said: We sell oil in dollars, but our  purchases are recognized in pounds, yens, marks, and other  currencies.    The foreign exchange shortage has halted many of the Islamic  Republic's development programs. Even development projects in  the nation's oil regions in the Persian Gulf have stopped. The  newspaper SALAM's correspondent in the oil regions of the  Persian Gulf reports that the development projects in the  nation's oil regions in these areas have been stopped by the  government because of the failure to allocate sufficient  credits, and Iran's shared gas reserves are being drained by  nations in the Persian Gulf.    On Sunday 11 Bahman [31 December] Engineer 'Abbas Vakil,  chief of the Lavan oil district, said: Due to the failure to  allocate credits and to make suitable investments to develop the  Dalan-Kangan (Khuf) gas field that is shared by Iran and Abu  Dhabi, this project has stopped. There is no gas exploitation or  development being done by Iran, and the Abu Dhabi government is  using advanced techniques to produce and extract the shared gas  from this field.    Engineer 'Abbas Vakil emphasized the need for Iran to invest  in activity and exploitation in this gas field. He said: The  Khuf gas field has been in use by the government of Abu Dhabi  for three to four years. The Khuf gas field is in the lower  layer of the Mosalman gas field, 150 km from Lavan Island.    The severe shortage of foreign exchange and the halting of  many development projects has persuaded the Islamic Republic's  officials again to seek foreign investment. Morteza Mohammad  Khan, the Islamic Republic's minister of economic and financial  affairs, recently met with Rafi' al-Din Ahmad, executive  secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the  Pacific (ESCAP) and told him: "Economic and legal conditions are  favorable in Iran for attracting and supporting foreign  investment."    Mohammad Khan is inviting foreigners to invest in the  Islamic  Republic at a time when the uproar of opposition to Coca-ola has  provoked very negative reactions outside Iran. Recently Mohsen  Rafiqdust, supervisor of the Foundation for War Veterans and the  Oppressed, said: We will remove the American Coca-ola company  from Iran.    In its 5 Bahman article [25 December], writing in this same  vein, the newspaper SALAM published an article quoting one of  its readers: The question that comes to my mind is, this company  (Coca-ola) has invested and started a factory with lawful  authorization, and all the public officials have witnessed its  activities and advertising. Now why all of a sudden is there all  this commotion about removing it?    A reader of SALAM--or perhaps the newspaper's editorial  board  preferred to have this said in the words of a "reader"--wrote in  answer to the above question: "Zarifi said that this company,  associated with world-devouring America, has created problems in  the field of competition for domestic producers affiliated with  the Foundation for the Oppressed and War Veterans. Therefore,  the chief of this foundation's very serious opposition is not  without its points!" Of course, to obtain his reward in the  hereafter, it is useful for him to invoke the war against the  cultural invasion.    In any case, this measure by Mr.Mohsen Rafiqdust shows to  what extent the public atmosphere in Iran is ready to protect  Iranian investments and to attract foreign investments.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Court rules out 'duty of care' towards Names LLOYD'S of London yesterday won a landmark decision in the High Court that it has no specific legal responsibility to look after the interests of Names. Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that Lloyd's had no 'duty of care' in a case brought in the name of Ashmore and 32 other plaintiffs who were Names on the now defunct Oakeley Vaughan syndicates. The decision will make extremely difficult any further attempts by Names who have lost money on syndicates to seek compensation from Lloyd's in its role as regulator of the market. However, Mr Michael Freeman, solicitor for the Names, said after the decision that he had already met some of the plaintiffs and there would be an appeal. The judge's decision rested on several issues concerned with the scope of the 1911 Lloyd's Act, the principal legislation by which the market was constituted until a new act was passed in 1982. He ruled that while Lloyd's had duties to regulate and to act fairly, it did not have a specific duty of care to Names. He also clarified that the 1982 Act - which specifies the duties of Lloyd's more precisely - came into effect as soon as it received Royal Assent in July 1982. Lloyd's said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the decision. But it added: 'This will not affect (our) continuous determination to regulate the market in a way that is both fair to members and allows the business to prosper.' Nevertheless, it said it had always recognised the obligation to deal fairly with members of Lloyd's in the exercise of its regulatory powers. One plaintiff, who did not want to be named, said: 'The general move among us is to carry on. This is definitely going to be appealed. It's a bad day for Lloyd's. Lloyd's pleading that it has no duty of care means Names have absolutely no redress at all and are absolutely unprotected.' He said many members' agents and managing agents were no longer taking out professional indemnity insurance. Combined with Lloyd's lack of duty, that meant Names had none of the compensation mechanisms available to investors in other regulated industries. 'This ruling must seriously affect any Names thinking about the future,' he said. 'It means Lloyd's can have an investigation, keep the report secret and Names have no redress.' Another plaintiff said he was considering taking Lloyd's to a European court.</p>

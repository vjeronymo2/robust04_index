			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ahold gains NYSE go-ahead on ADR move AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer, has received permission from the New York Stock Exchange to move its existing American depositary receipts on to the exchange starting on November 15, writes Ronald van de Krol. Yesterday, an extraordinary Ahold shareholders meeting approved a 2-for-1 share split, designed to bring the company's share price into line with that of other food retailers quoted on US stock exchanges. The split, which halves the nominal value of Ahold's shares to Fl 1.25 (Dollars 0.65), also takes effect on November 15.</p>

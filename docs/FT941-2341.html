			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Hopes fade for Russia-IMF pact Agreement between Russia and the International Monetary Fund seems unlikely in the near future, and is likely to require government measures to convince the Fund that the 1994 budget is viable. Talks between Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, and Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the Fund, set for yesterday, were postponed until today, following Mr Chernomyrdin's sudden decision to fly to Sochi for talks with President Boris Yeltsin. However, the outline of a longer term deal is already emerging, though very strong doubts remain on both sides about its feasibility. A senior Russian official was quoted as saying that 'the talks have got nowhere because of the IMF's non-constructive attitude'. Fund officials in Moscow will not comment on the talks, though sources say they are impatient with the lack of information provided on the budget. The talks, which began on Friday, have been going on at two parallel levels. The first, between Mr Chernomyrdin, Mr Camdessus and Mr John Odling-Smee of the IMF, focus on broader policy and political aspects of managing the economy. The second, involving Mr Sergei Dubinin, the finance minister, and the wider IMF team, concern the details and the underlying assumptions of the budget. The key problem for the IMF team is the income side of the budget, where high inflation and low tax collection point to the government's inability to collect the Rbs120,000bn for which it has budgeted. The likelihood is that the IMF will work out with the Russian government various ways of attempting to increase the tax take - and wait for around two months to judge whether or not these measures are working. This approach, a standard IMF technique, would also test how committed Mr Chernomyrdin's government is to radical economic reform. The prime minister has repeatedly committed his government to observing the budget, and has in the past month given other public indications of his desire to continue economic change. Mr Mikhail Zadornov, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, said that 'no agreement on the second tranche of the IMF facility is likely to be signed in the near future' - a prediction with which the Fund and the government are unlikely to disagree.</p>

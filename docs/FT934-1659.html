			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day in Pounds 15.5m fundraising exercise Amber Day Holdings, the discount retailer, last night announced a Pounds 15.5m fundraising exercise which will see Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution, raise its stake in the group from 17 to 25 per cent. The latest management team, supported by Warburg Pincus, will use the proceeds to strengthen the group's highly geared balance sheet and eventually double the size of its existing chain of 58 What Everyone Wants stores. The controversial group, which has suffered from continuing management upheaval, also plans to change its name to WEW Group, which it said 'marks a clear separation with the past.' Mr Peter Carr, an experienced retailer who became executive chairman in August, is the group's third chairman in the last 15 months. He will receive an option on 3m shares, subject to achieving profit-related targets over a five-year period. No part of the option can be exercised before 1998, under normal circumstances. Amber Day said it proposed to raise about Pounds 15.5m by issuing 29m new shares by way of a placing and open offer and a subscription. Under the subscription, Warburg Pincus will subscribe for 5.8m new shares (5 per cent) at 58p per share. Under a placing, the company has placed 23m new ordinary shares with Warburg Pincus and certain sizeable shareholders, together representing an aggregate holding of 52.7 per cent of the company's share capital, and other institutions, at 56p per share, subject to an open offer to qualifying shareholders. Under the terms of the open offer, qualifying shareholders can subscribe for the new ordinary shares at the same price on a 1-for-5 basis. The fundraising exercise, change of company name and Mr Carr's options scheme are all subject to shareholders' approval.</p>

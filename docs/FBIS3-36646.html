It was in the plane bringing him back to France on the  afternoon of Saturday 5 February after a three-day visit to  Moscow that the French defense minister learned of the massacre  at the Sarajevo market, one of the six areas in Bosnia protected  by the United Nations and now under fire from 188 Serbian guns  according to French intelligence.    Invited by Gen. Pavel Grachev, his Russian counterpart, with  whom he visited the Taman mechanized infantry division, Francois  Leotard tried at the end of last week to convince his  interlocutors -- who included Oleg Soskovets, first deputy  chairman of the council of ministers, Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, and  General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff -- of the  need for air support for the humanitarian bridge to Tuzla and  Srebrenica, two of the other areas placed by mandate under UN  protection.    Mr. Leotard thought he detected a slight difference in tone  in the statements of Mr. Kozyrev, the diplomat, and Gen.  Grachev, the soldier. The former struck him as "less peremptory  and less stubborn" than the latter. The French minister told  Mr. Kozyrev that an air operation backed by the United Nations,  under the terms of a resolution already approved by the Russians  and requested, if necessary, by the local UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] officials, is not aggressive because it would  be "close air support" intended to accompany humanitarian aid to  prevent it from being attacked. It is not "an Iraqi concept"  Mr. Leotard explained, referring to the 1991 raids on Baghdad.  Mr. Kozyrev agreed that it is necessary to avoid any quarrel on  terminology and that more detailed explanation should be  continued. However, he suspects the big Western powers at the  United Nations of "wishing to punish the Serbs alone" by these  actions.  <H5>  New Military Doctrine </H5>   Mr. Leotard also suggested to the Russian foreign minister  that Moscow should support the attitude of France which is  seeking to obtain the international community's "impartiality"  and "neutrality" in the Yugoslav conflict. Starting with the  United States. Without having any formal proof of this, the  French suspect the Americans of arming the Bosnian Muslims by  secret supplies, as they did in Afghanistan.    This French request for Russia's cooperation is strange to  say the least, addressed to a country which, as Mr. Leotard's  entourage admits, makes no secret of its pro-Serbian sympathies  -- although it denies that -- or of its desire as a European and  Slav power to reestablish a more active diplomacy in the region  after three years of low profile.    With Gen. Grachev, however, the dialogue was more closely  argued. The Russian defense minister thinks that the use of  fighter planes "could lead to an escalation" on the ground and  that these are "bombing raids" aimed at "exerting pressure on  the Serbian side" in situations -- the Tuzla and Srebrenica  areas -- which are "artificial" and "exaggerated" for  demonstration purposes. Gen. Grachev therefore rules out any  "bombing" of Tuzla. His French interlocutors had the feeling  that he was also opposed to it in that, to carry out such  actions in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations chose  NATO's structures and military resources as its secular arm.    In an indirect but fairly convincing way, these discussions  between Russians and French on the Balkan crisis also revealed  the ambiguity of the new military doctrine adopted in November  1993 by Moscow. Mr. Leotard was given a commentary on this text  by Gen. Grachev and Gen. Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian  Security Council. Indeed, in light of what is happening in  Bosnia, but also in Moldova, in the Transcaucasus, in  Tajikistan, or in Georgia, for instance, two more specific  points should warrant greater attention from the Western general  staffs.    The first of these aspects apparently relates to the  difficulty which the Russian military have in designing  defensive actions, although their new doctrine is intended to be  based resolutely on operations of a nonoffensive nature.  <H5>  Concept of `Nearby Foreign Countries' </H5>   The confusion -- if it is unintentional -- which the  Russians  are maintaining between a bombing raid (which can be a  deliberately aggressive action) and air support (which amounts  to prevention of a possible provocation) suggests that they do  not share this distinction, which is usual in the Western  general staffs and that they have stuck to their previous  concept based on the offensive.    The second point seems even more fraught with  misunderstandings. It relates to the idea which the Russians  have of what is called the security "architecture" in Europe  and, through this collective notion, the security area proper to  their country and the sphere recognized as that of "nearby  foreign countries" [countries of the former Soviet Union]  according to an expression used in their new doctrine. In other  words, as Mr. Leotard asked his interlocutors, when and where  does Russia's security start if it does not want to be accused  of making the limits of its interests coincide with the borders  of the former Soviet Union?    The answers may have varied from one interlocutor to  another,  but they were close in substance. According to Gen. Lobov,  Russia has 60,000 km of borders to protect -- half of which are  not currently protected -- and, with its 2.1 million men under  arms in 1995, it would respond to the countries which might seek  its aid. According to Gen. Grachev, Russia is the only state in  the world to have currently deployed so many "peace soldiers"  (1,200 "blue helmets" in the former Yugoslavia and 16,000 of its  men in Moldova, the Trancaucasus, or Tajikistan without any UN  mandate). In reply to the Russian minister who wanted France to  send observers to Georgia under UN auspices, Mr. Leotard said  that it would send around six "White Helmets" of the 55  originally planned.    Mr. Kozyrev, for his part, summed up the Russian position on  "nearby foreign countries" by rejecting the accusation of  "imperialism" or a return to Greater Russia which has often been  made against his country's military doctrine. He asked Mr.  Leotard how, from this viewpoint, France justified "the legal  basis" of its military presence in Africa. He expressed the  hope that he should be sent -- as a source of inspiration if  necessary -- the defense agreements on which France bases its  interventions on that continent.    Despite the many differences of opinion, Gen. Grachev and  the  French defense minister nonetheless signed two framework  cooperation agreements one of which -- by far the most important  -- establishes the conditions in which France will help to  renovate old Mig-21's, delivered for export, and to produce a  twin-jet training plane called the Mig-AT [Advanced Trainer].</p>

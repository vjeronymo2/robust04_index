			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Jozef Moravcik Versus Vladimir Meciar"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--In an interview for the TA SR, Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik yesterday described as very incompetent  former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's allegations, made in an  interview for SMENA NA NEDELU, that the official tours of duty  of current government officials were "tourism for taxpayers'  money." Moravcik stated that, if he were to compare official  trips before [under Meciar's government, when he was foreign  minister] and now, the present ones are far more concentrated  and businesslike. He specified that one of the serious  shortcomings under Vladimir Meciar's government was that, from  the viewpoint of diplomatic practice, official trips were not of  the required standard. Moravcik stated that, throughout his term  as prime minister, Meciar did not pay a single official visit to  any country of the European Union [EU] because of the lack of an  official invitation. In that sense, Moravcik's visit to France  was the first official trip made by a Slovak prime minister to  an EU country since the founding of the independent Slovak  Republic.    According to Moravcik, the trips of the other Cabinet  ministers can be positively evaluated as well. The level at  which they are being received is higher than was the case of  representatives of the previous cabinet.</p>

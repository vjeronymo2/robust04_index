			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The UDMR Offensive"] </F>   [Text] The 26-27 February meeting of the Council of  Representatives of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania], which was held in Miercurea Ciuc, adopted a  declaration regarding the way in which Romania's obligations  stipulated by the amendments of the Council of Europe with  respect to the status of ethnic minorities should be complied  with.    Assessing that "Romania's authorities are not observing  these  amendments and are not displaying the political will to accept  and implement them," the signatories of the declaration reassert  the ethnic minorities' right to have their own local  self-administration bodies and a special status in the areas  where they represent the majority of the population, and  recommend that local administration bodies should be summoned  within two months to decide upon the forms of autonomy that  should be applied, as formulated in the UDMR program and in its  draft bill on the status of the ethnic minorities and autonomous  communities. The declaration also protests the draft bill on  education, which has already been accepted by the Education  Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the measures  taken by certain county prefects annulling the decisions of  local bodies regarding bilingual inscriptions, and requests that  in the areas preponderantly inhabited by ethnic minorities they  should be allowed to use their mother tongue in justice and  administration.    In that context the declaration asks Romania's Parliament to  sign the European Charter on Local Self-Administration, accept  the UDMR amendments to the education bill, and put on the agenda  the draft bill on the status of ethnic minorities and autonomous  communities.</p>

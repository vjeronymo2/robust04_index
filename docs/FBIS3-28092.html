Samsung  Electronics, Goldstar and Daewoo Electronics saw exports of  electric home appliances and semiconductors to Japan soar an  average 150 percent last year over the year before. Exports  rose a further 50 percent last month, compared with 12-percent  growth in January 1993. The industry attributes the brisk  exports to a strong yen that has weakened the price  competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers.    Samsung exported 350 million U.S. dollars worth of  electronics to Japan, up 110 percent from 1992. Its exports of  semiconductors were up 100 percent to 240 million dollars from  1992's 120 million dollars; Television sets, up 142 percent to  80 million dollars; and refrigerators, up 192 percent to 12  million dollars. Samsung said January exports grew 50 percent,  compared with 12 percent a year earlier.    Goldstar shipped 33 million dollars worth of television  sets,  up 65 percent from 20 million dollars in 1992, and 1 million  dollars of microwave ovens, up 100 percent from 500,000 dollars  a year earlier. Its January exports increased 33 percent to 16  million dollars, three times the 11 percent growth registered  the year before.    Daewoo saw exports skyrocket 116 percent to 218 million  dollars last year with shipments of microwave ovens rising 56  percent, refrigerators 45 percent and video cassette recorders  29 percent in January.</p>

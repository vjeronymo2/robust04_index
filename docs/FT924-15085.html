			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Iri defends sale of Finsiel IRI, the Italian state holding company criticised for its decision last week to sell its majority-owned Finsiel software subsidiary, yesterday issued a statement defending the deal. The move came as Stet's shares recovered by 4.35 per cent to L1,080, recovering a fraction of Monday's plunge of more than 23 per cent. Iri said selling Finsiel to the Stet telecommunications group, which it also controls, had a strong industrial logic in view of the increasing use of digital telecommunications technology. The group indirectly refuted accusations that the deal had been hurriedly devised in order to bolster its debt-laden balance sheet by indicating that the transaction had been under consideration for some time. Finsiel, which made net profits of L29.4bn (Dollars 22.35m) on sales of L1,283bn last year, has a virtual monopoly of software services for Italy's public sector. However, current activities in telecommunications are limited to a small subsidiary owned jointly with a Stet subsidiary. Iri also argued that the L700bn price for the sale of its 83.3 per cent stake was in line with similar transactions for software groups elsewhere. The precise figure would be reached through specialist valuations now under way, and a third valuation would be made in case of sharp differences. The comments did little to calm critics, who attacked the deal as little more than an accounting exercise that should give Iri an extraordinary gain of around L650bn this year. Their main objection is that the sale offers little immediate advantage for Stet. The group, in the middle of an ambitious investment plan to improve domestic telecommunications, is heavily indebted. Stet's cash-flow is already inadequate to finance its investments, and critics say buying Finsiel is an unnecessary luxury. Stet has also tapped investors regularly through big rights issues, which have depressed the share prices of the group and its subsidiaries.</p>

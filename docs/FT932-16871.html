			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Union fails to win Rolls-Royce pledge ROLLS-ROYCE Aerospace yesterday refused to give union representatives assurances that it would avoid compulsory redundancies in cutting 5,000 jobs over the next two years. The AEEU craft union said it was bitterly disappointed at the company's response and would consider holding a plant by plant ballot on industrial action. However, Rolls-Royce has warned that any resistance to redundancies could mean far less generous pay-offs. In most plants union members are unlikely to back industrial action. White-collar staff at Bristol have already rejected it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been disclosed that on the issue of market  access discussed at the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)  Mickey Kantor sent letters, which were dated 16 February and  contained new proposals, to Japan and the European Union (EU).  As he explained before, Kantor, in the letter, demands that  Japan lower tariffs on forestry products and distilled liquor.  The Japanese Government plans to reject the demand, saying:  "We already reached an agreement late last year on the tariff  issue." Now that a ministerial meeting, scheduled to be held in  April to sign an accord, is drawing near, however, the Uruguay  Round is facing new difficult issues. In the letters, Kantor  proposes that the United States, Japan, and the EU develop a new  package. While explaining a plan to scale down [kotai] a  proposal, in which the United States pledged to reduce tariffs  on such items as electronic machines, Kantor urges Japan to make  additional tariff cuts on forestry products and other goods.  From the EU, Kantor is demanding further reduction of tariffs on  aluminum. The United States is saying that it will lower a part  of its tariffs on trucks. However, the letters call for a  scale-down in each nation's average tariff reduction rate.    It seems that USTR Kantor sent the letters because of  pressure from the U.S. Congress. However, both Japan and the EU  are opposing the U.S. proposals. They will strongly urge the  U.S. Government to abide by the agreement reached late last  year. At the same time, Japan and the EU are studying the  possibility of asking GATT Secretary General Sutherland to act  as a mediator.</p>

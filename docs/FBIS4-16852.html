			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Dubnov: "Talks on the Future of </F> Tajikistan: No Success Yet, but Then No Failure"]    [Text] The leaders of the Tajik opposition -- Khodzhi  Akbar Turadzhonzoda, former spiritual leader of Tajikistan, and  Mukhammadsharif Khemmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic Revival  Party -- have traveled to Moscow via Islamabad.    They are both authorized leaders of the Tajik opposition  delegation at the inter-Tajik talks taking place in Moscow under  the auspices of the UN secretary general's special envoy Ramiro  Piriz-Ballon.    The first -- Moscow -- round of the inter-Tajik talks has  ended, having opened on 5 April. Republic Minister Shukurdzhon  Zukhurov officially headed the Tajikistan government delegation,  the unofficial Tajikistan foreign minister Rashid Alimov, who  has been in Moscow for the duration [sentence as published].  The opposition delegation was temporarily headed by Otakhon  Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajikistan  Democratic Forces in the CIS Countries.    During two weeks of talks behind closed doors the sides  managed to agree on an agenda for the subsequent rounds of  dialogue. A total of 27 questions are to be discussed, divided  into three "baskets." The first concerns a political settlement  in Tajikistan and includes the cessation of hostilities on the  Tajik-Afghan border and inside the Republic, the attitude toward  the military formations of various government forces and  opposition forces, and various measures contributing to mutual  trust. The second agenda "basket" is intended to solve problems  connected with the return of refugees and people who were forced  to move: guarantees of a safe return home, property matters...    Finally, the third "basket" contains fundamental questions  of  the future constitutional structure and consolidation of the  statehood of the Republic of Tajikistan, a new election law, the  holding of elections, a transitional period in the Republic...    In an IZVESTIYA interview at the end of December with former  Tajikistan chief justice Turadzhonzoda, he formulated the basic  approaches to a peaceful settlement as a result of which the  Tajik-Tajik talks finally began in Moscow. The Tajik opposition  aknowledged at the time that Russia had geopolitical interests  in the region and agreed that Russian peacemaking forces should  stay in Tajikistan on condition that their commanders were  replaced.    In Moscow now, answering my questions, Turadzhonzoda  particularly stressed that they had come to the Russian capital  to express their respect for and gratitude to Russia for the  part it is playing in a peaceful settlement in their country.  The opposition leaders are hoping to meet with Russian  leadership representatives in Moscow.    Turadzhonzoda and Khemmatzoda intend to participate in the  next rounds of the inter-Tajik talks, which will take place in  the Iranian or Pakistani capital, on condition that "top people"  in the official Tajik leadership are also participating.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto has ordered on  Wednesday to find out why the country's exports have dropped and  that steps have to be taken to correct the situation for the  sake of the country's foreign exchange income, Information  Minister Harmoko said.    Speaking after a limited cabinet meeting with President  Suharto, Harmoko also said that the president had asked for a  close observation on the inflation rate which stood at 0.24  percent in April and 0.70 percent in March.    Accordingly, surplus of the country's trade with partners  from Hong Kong, Japan, China, United Arab Emirates, and Thailand  had dropped in January this year.    But its trade with the United States, the Netherlands,  Britain, South Korea, and Benelux had surplus increase.    Indonesia had a surplus of U.S. $649.2 million in February  with exports standing at U.S. $2.7999 billion and imports at  U.S. $2.1507 billion, Harmoko said.    He said the total value of Indonesia's exports from April  1993 to February 1994 reached up to U.S. $33.3964 billion, while  its imports were valued at U.S. $26.2405 billion, leaving a  surplus worth U.S. $7.1459 billion.    Harmoko said the money circulated in March totalled to some  Rp. [rupiah] 38.452 trillion (U.S. $19.226 billion).    Inflation went down because of the drop in the index price  of  food stuffs which was recorded at 0.71 percent in April or down  from 1.61 percent in March.    The house index price only increased by 0.40 percent while  garments only 0.29 percent far below from the 1.41 in March.    But the supply and demand for strategic commodities is  balanced, Harmoko said.    President Suharto, on the same occasion, had also specially  asked to give attention to cocoa marketing and quality control,  knowing that this commodity is being produced mostly by  smallholders, he added.</p>

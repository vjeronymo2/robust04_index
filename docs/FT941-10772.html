			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Haden MacLellan appoints MD A series of senior management changes at Haden MacLellan Holdings, the big engineering group, was concluded yesterday with the appointment from March 1 of Richard Taylor as group managing director. The changes over the past 18 months began with the departure in September 1992 of the flamboyant chairman Philip Ling. His successor, the conservative Harold Cottam, was charged with improving the group's image in the City as well as examining its management structure. This led to the departure early last year of chief executive Mel Hawley, only a year after his promotion to the post. His duties were taken on by Cottam and by the mds of the two main divisions, Taylor at process engineering and services and Clive Northmead at manufacturing and distribution. A group finance director, Nigel Reed, was appointed at the end of last year. The appointment of Taylor, 48, is a reward for his efforts since joining the group as managing director of the UK process engineering and materials division in 1984. In particular, a management and operational reorganisation led by him reinvigorated the group's formerly loss-making US businesses, which were brought under his operational control in 1992. In his new role Taylor will remain in overall charge of the process engineering division, for which he also announced a streamlined reporting structure yesterday. The division accounts for more than two-thirds of HMH's Pounds 300m group turnover. HMH said yesterday that it was 'possible and appropriate' for Taylor to give full attention to his additional responsibilities and bring added focus to the group's total operations and strategic direction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Sok-ki in Seoul] </F>   [Text] Kim Chol-su, minister of trade, industry, and  energy, said on 9 April that "Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations  had been already finished," and that "it is almost impossible to  renegotiate the UR accord."    In his roundtable talks with reporters that day, Minister  Kim  said that "after its ratification at the National Assembly, the  government will sign an agreement on the formation of the World  Trade Organization [WTO] during the nation-ministerial  conference in Marrakesh," and that "this is not related to UR  renegotiation but rather a matter of domestic procedures of  ratification."    Minister Kim said: Every country has its own policy  different from that of others regarding the signing of the World  Trade Organization agreement. Therefore, the government has so  far prudently calculated the loss and gain of the agreement  during the meetings of related ministers. As a result, it has  boldly decided to sign the agreement after its ratification at  the National Assembly.    He said, however, that "regardless of the change of the  signing form of the agreement, the government will officially  participate in the World Trade Organization system, an order of  international trade," and that"it is the government's firm will."    He added that "the ROK, which has so far achieved economic  development through free trade, must not be isolated from the  international community because of its failure to participate in  the World Trade Organization," and that "it would never be a  good choice if the government brings international isolationism  on itself."</p>

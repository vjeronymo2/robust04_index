			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Field Marshal Patten calls in big guns - David Marsh on the Tory chairman's battle in Bath THE BUSTLING Regency emporium of Bath boasts 800 shops serving a population of just 85,000. 'Pure magic. It is the Mecca for retailing outside London,' enthuses Ms Eileen Walkington, the breathless Lancashire-born director of the city's chamber of commerce. The political opponents of Mr Chris Patten, the sleepless-eyed chairman of the Tory party and Bath's MP since 1979, are trying to turn this centre of shopping pilgrimage into a Conservative graveyard. In 1987 Mr Patten had a slender 1,412 majority over the Alliance candidate. He now faces a tough battle with a broad coalition of anti-Patten campaigners, egged on by a vociferous group of Bath traders complaining about high rents and rates. Mr Patten is hoping that this month's Budget moves to ease the burden of the uniform business rate (UBR) will defuse the Bath shopkeepers' revolt. But as the Conservative party's image-maker, as well as the man responsible for introducing the poll tax to England and Wales during his previous job as environment secretary, Mr Patten is vulnerable to the anti-Tory swing across southern England. Mr Don Foster, the studious 44-year-old Liberal Democrat candidate, is working flat-out to woo the shopkeepers. Buoyed by early canvassing returns, Mr Foster says he has 'difficulty containing his exuberance' about his prospects for victory. Mr Patten, who rushes to Bath every afternoon after mornings spent in London masterminding Tory strategy, is confident of weathering the challenge. He claims he will win, with an increased majority. Field Marshal Patten says he will call on 'heavy artillery' from headquarters  - including, probably, Mr John Major - to back his electioneering. Mr Patten may spend his mornings in the capital heaping invective on Labour, but the three-cornered fight in Bath means he needs the local Labour candidate. He is relying on Ms Pam Richards, a part-time social worker who has been a city councillor since 1980, to make inroads into the Liberal Democrat vote. Ms Richards has little hope of taking Labour above its third place in 1987, but she refuses to be distracted by suggestions that Labour supporters should transfer their vote to the Liberal Democrats. The three-year controversy in Bath about the effect of high commercial rents and the UBR has clearly undermined the Tories' reputation as the shopkeepers' party. Mr Eric Snook, a toy-shop owner and Conservative city councillor, says the criticism from the retail trade is overdone. But he admits that commercial rents in the city centre - a third of which are paid directly to the council - have been 'hyped up', contributing to a rise in business failures. The retail protestors say both rents and rates are set at values fixed in 1988-89 at the peak of the boom, and are still rising in spite of the downturn. Mr Philip Andrews, a leading member of Barrb, a loose grouping of Bath businesses fighting rent and rates increases, is standing as an independent. A 38-year-old ecologist and nightclub owner whose father worked for MI6, he says Mr Patten has been unable to act on the issue because of 'party self-interest'. Mr Robert Mimmack is director of property and engineering services at the Conservative-controlled city council, whose estates department is the largest landowner in the city centre. He admits that the Pounds 8m annual receipts from commercial rents - 15 per cent of total city revenues - help keep Bath's poll tax bills down, a crucial factor helping Mr Patten. One effect of soaring overheads, as well as general problems caused by the recession, is that 8 per cent of roughly 600 shops in the city centre are empty, Mr Mimmack says. Bath Tories say Mr Patten's jocularly professional campaign will blunt his opponents' stings. Nonetheless, national and local factors have increased the risk that, on polling day, the Conservative party chairman could become another victim of Bath's wave of boom and bust.</p>

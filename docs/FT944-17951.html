			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Reed Elsevier to become biggest law publisher Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, is poised to become the world's largest publisher of legal information after its Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Mead Data Central, the electronic information arm of Mead Corporation, the US paper and forest products group. The dominant factor in what is a significant expansion in North America will be the integration of Lexis and Nexis, Mead Data Central's online legal and business services, with the group's existing electronic publishing operations. 'This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit for us,' said Mr Pierre Vinken, co-chairman, yesterday. 'It establishes for Reed Elsevier a leading position in the growing US legal publishing and information markets.' Mead had been seeking to divest MDC since May this year. It finally accepted the Reed Elsevier offer on Tuesday, frustrating rival bids from Times Mirror, the US media group, and Canadian publisher Thomson. Mr Nigel Stapleton, Reed Elsevier's finance director, predicted that the deal - financed from cash reserves and Dollars 1bn of dollar borrowings - would be earnings enhancing 'from the outset' and would lift North American sales by more than 50 per cent. Growing demand for MDC's operations is expected to lift turnover to Dollars 612m next year, compared with Dollars 551m this year, and analysts expected it to contribute profits of about Dollars 75m. Shares in the group, however, fell in London and Amsterdam after Standard &amp; Poor's placed Reed Elsevier ratings on its negative 'Credit Watch' list. Reed International, the UK publisher which merged with the Dutch group last year, ended down 11p at 744p, while Elsevier shed 59 cents to close at Fl16.10. Some city analysts blamed the negative reaction on concern at the group's Pounds 1.2bn borrowings. Lex, Page 22 North America proves the right connection, Page 23</p>

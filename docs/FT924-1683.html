			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Post-cold war Nato works its way into its new role: Not far from Sarajevo, a unit once ranged against Moscow deploys its resources as a peacekeeper AT A municipally owned spa hotel at Kiseljak, not far from Sarajevo, Nato is working its way into a role for which it was never intended. The Hotel Dalmacija, an unsuccessful project built for the 1984 Winter Olympics, has become the headquarters for United Nations military operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The organisation and equipment have mostly been transferred from Monchengladbach, the base of Nato's Northern Army Group (Northag), a command set to close down next year as part of the alliance's post-cold war restructuring. The 420 military staff squeezed into the hotel include British, Dutch and Belgians straight from Northag's mobile HQ, which was designed as a back-up in an all-out east-west war - in case the main headquarters was destroyed. For German constitutional reasons, Germans at the HQ could not be sent to Bosnia. In their place are Americans, French, Spaniards, Danes, Portuguese and Norwegians. Apart from two token officers representing Ukrainian and Egyptian troops based in Sarajevo, it is a totally Nato affair. This is a new departure for Nato, which decided only six months ago to make its resources available for peacekeeping. At a meeting today in Brussels, Nato foreign ministers are due to strengthen that commitment in support of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe or the UN. They will also discuss practical steps - from fact-finding missions to training and deployment plans - to enable Nato to respond quickly when its help is sought. Bosnia is the first instance of direct Nato involvement - through the headquarters and the use of its Awacs early-warning aircraft - alongside that of individual Nato allies in a UN operation. Deployments to Bosnia were preceded in July by the dispatch of a Nato warship flotilla to the Adriatic, alongside another sent by the Western European Union. The moves followed months of sterile debate about the relative roles of the two organisations in European security. Nato's anxiety not to be outdone was, one French diplomat commented, 'a little bit ridiculous'. The WEU had organised maritime patrols before, in the Gulf. But when it came to ground operations, even the French had to recognise that only Nato was competent. The nature of the UN plan for safeguarding aid supplies in Bosnia, which meant deploying troops while a war was still going on, demanded well-organised command and control. The US, which had agreed to provide logistics and medical support although not combat forces, was brought into the headquarters operation providing vital access to US intelligence. It is significant that the mainstream Nato allies have been brought together with the French. The headquarters is drawn largely from the integrated military structure, which France withdrew from 26 years ago. But the UN commander in Bosnia is French, Major General Philippe Morillon. Spain, the other ally formally outside the integrated Nato command, provides his deputy, Brig Gen Luis Martinez Coll. The chief of staff is a Briton, Brigadier Roddy Cordy-Simpson. It is a sign of the significance Britain regards this mission as having for the alliance that he is destined to be the next commander of the British armoured division in Germany, the heart of the UK's contribution to Nato. Maj Gen Morillon, for his part, formerly commanded the 1st French armoured division in Germany, one of the cornerstones of the planned Franco-German Eurocorps. Bitter argument in Nato over this scheme, which the US saw as undermining the alliance, has been miraculously smoothed over in recent weeks. Paris and Bonn have made clear to the satisfaction of other allies - although operational details are still being worked out - that the corps will be available to Nato's supreme commander in Europe, either for European defence or for peacekeeping or humanitarian missions. Peacekeeping, a job Nato would never have been thought suited for during the cold war, is taking on growing importance in alliance planning. A French official said Nato's primary role of guarding against aggression from the east was 'less and less plausible, and maybe not enough to guarantee its cohesion'. While France maintained its independent stance within Nato, 'for peacekeeping we are all on the same footing', he said. France favoured setting up a planning cell of all 16 allies, in effect bringing it back into Nato military planning. It was ready to work with the staff of Shape (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) as long as other members understood there was no question of Shape itself taking a military initiative in situations like the former Yugoslavia. 'On a practical level, the French are back,' he said.</p>

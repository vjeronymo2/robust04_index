			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND CONGESTION  </P> <P> Prof. Gordon Fielding is only partly right ("Focus on Congestion, Not More  Freeways," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 6). The focus should be on reducing the use of  automobiles and trucks, as he says.  </P> <P> But he is wrong to ignore the essential cause of our dilemma, the gross subsidy  our society presently provides the motorist and particularly, the trucking  industry. It would require an increase of 50 cents per gallon, alone, to  reimburse the property taxpayers for local government services that drivers do  not now pay for.  </P> <P> He is also right to call attention to the huge financial cost needed to pay for  " . . . Building our way out. . . ." He says it would cost 18 cents per gallon,  but he doesn't say for how many years. Another, possibly more explicit, figure  is $100 billion, or $25,000 per family, for all the families in the Los Angeles  metropolitan area.  </P> <P> Finally, his conclusion is (almost) exactly right. We must place the cost of  transportation on the shoulders of the user, not on the community as a whole.  He should also have instructed us that the problem affects not only traffic  congestion; it also directly affects, grossly and adversely, our environment  and our economy.  </P> <P> STANLEY HART  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

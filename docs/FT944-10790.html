			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Ariadne' revived - Opera For the English National Opera, Graham Vick produced Richard Strauss's Ariadne on Naxos eleven years ago. His master-stroke was to insulate the high-flown Ariadne story completely from the low comedians' antics; but since the original Strauss-Hofmannsthal plan was to engineer comic friction between the competing troupes, respectively opera seria and commedia dell'arte, the Vick version was perverse in principle and dreary in effect - and not especially happy in its principal singers either. As revived once again by Lynn Binstock, it looks better. The edges have been softened; the mechanical high-jinks in the prologue act are still tedious, but the singing comedians get a looser rein later, and soon hit upon the right improvisatory, happy-go-lucky spirit. If Peter Snipp's sturdy Harlequin scores low on romantic appeal, his colleagues (all new) are an engaging crew: Timothy Robinson, Alasdair Elliott and particularly Mark Richardson as a daft Truffaldino. There is a sparky Dancing Master from John Graham-Hall, too, and a Malvolio-like Major-Domo from Nicholas Le Prevost. Above all there is Cyndia Sieden's Zerbinetta, whose charm and sparkling accuracy are a great tonic. This American soprano misses only the note of wry, world-weary amusement - but that is not perhaps compulsory. Her scene with the young Composer is hobbled by his being a mature, matronly mezzo, the Canadian Judith Forst: an admirably dignified singer, but no substitute for the slim youth Hofmannsthal had in mind. (Another breeches-role like the Rosenkavalier Octavian was not what he intended, but Strauss insisted that most opera companies could field an intelligent mezzo more reliably than a second tenor.) As for the heavies: well, there is much to admire in Jane Eaglen's monumental Ariadne, and Ian Caley has a good stab at Bacchus, a part that requires more sustained bellowing than Caley's usual repertoire. But the modern habit of doing Ariadne with Wagnerian voices in a large theatre has meant that thousands of people have heard the opera only on that inflated scale; its real delights suffer, and not least its wistful intimacies. There are plenty of those written into the score - almost a miniature score, by Strauss's standards - and they evaporate easily in a big house. The conductor Alexander Sander lets them do that rather often, though he makes a workman-like job of it all. He is curiously brisk and un-tender with the nymphs' music, forthrightly sung by Maria Bovino, Judith Douglas and Yvonne Barclay (whose Echo never sounds like one when it should). If Ariadne must be staged in the cavernous Coliseum, the present production will do, I suppose; but as seen and heard in, say, Munich's little Cuvillies-Theater, it is a different and much more lovable opera. In repertory until December 14.</p>

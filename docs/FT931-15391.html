			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Sense of financial security ebbs FOUR in 10 Britons feel less financially secure than they did two years ago, according to a survey published yesterday. The main reasons cited are fear of unemployment and the effect of increased prices on those with low incomes. The Mori survey, conducted for the insurance company Scottish Amicable, also found that Britons felt less financially secure than the French or Germans. Mori interviewed 2,017 adults in Britain, 1,000 in France and 1,028 in Germany. The interviews were conducted in September.</p>

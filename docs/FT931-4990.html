			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: France warned on oilseeds deal - Paris playing into hands of Americans, Commission claims FRANCE told its Community partners again yesterday that it could not accept any world trade reform package containing the oilseeds agreement reached last November with the US. But it was warned by the European Commission that it was playing into the hands of the Americans, who would welcome the chance to win a better deal for US farmers. The exchange came as Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, suggested informally to EC foreign ministers that a Uruguay Round accord should incorporate 'social parameters' offering an agreed minimum of rights to workers. The implication was that Europe was being unfairly undercut by sweatshop labour in Asia. Mr Delors was following up remarks he made in a speech in Paris on Friday. But his spokesman insisted he was expressing well-known views, and not trying to delay a conclusion to the Round. Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, reporting earlier to the foreign ministers on talks in Washington with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said he believed the US wanted to finish the Round this year, and did not want new subjects on the agenda. Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, told his colleagues that France had been 'totally consistent'. The Commission still had to prove that the Uruguay Round farm chapter, and the oilseeds deal, were compatible with last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Uruguay Round 'final act' - the foundation of attempts to conclude more than six years of world trade reform talks - was a reasonable basis for negotiations, Mr Dumas conceded, 'except on agriculture'. France 'will not accept a global agreement which includes oilseeds in its present form,' he added. Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, insisted last November's agreement was 'in line with the CAP', and that 'it remains the basis for an agreement. . . fresh negotiations on agriculture would only please the US'. The French government, which faces a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections later this month, threatened to veto the oilseeds agreement if it were put to a vote yesterday. Both the Commission and the current Danish presidency of the EC decided not to bring matters to a head, even though Mr Steichen fears an advantageous deal for the EC could unravel if not quickly confirmed. According to Mr Steichen, a vote is now likely when foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on April 5. It is unclear whether the likely new right-wing coalition in France will be more malleable on the Washington agreement. But senior EC officials do not rule out the possibility that France will simply be outvoted. The 'veto' it threatens is based on the so-called Luxembourg compromise, a 1966 political agreement allowing an EC member to invoke 'very important' national interests to block a deal. But the device is all but defunct. 'It has never been tested on an external issue,' one senior diplomat says. It has not been used since the Single European Act came into force in 1987, and attempts at Luxembourg compromise 'vetoes' by Germany and the UK not long before that both failed.</p>

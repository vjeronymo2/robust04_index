			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Bociurkiw] </F>   [Text] Facing an abrupt decline of up to 70 percent of  inbound tourists from Taiwan, Hong Kong's tourism industry  appealed to Taipei yesterday to reconsider its ban on tour  groups visiting China. Howard Young, Legislative Council  representative for the tourism industry, said the ban, imposed  by Taipei in response to China's handling of the deaths of 24  Taiwan citizens in a fire aboard a boat in Zhejiang last month,  was "bad for Hong Kong".    A Taiwan travel agent predicted there could be as much as a  70 percent decrease in Taiwanese arrivals in the territory.    A spokesman for the Taiwan Travel Agents Association said  cancellations from customers planning to travel to China had  been pouring in since the boat tragedy. With 1.8 million Taiwan  residents entering Hong Kong last year, many of them en route to  China, the impact of the ban on the territory could be  formidable.    Taiwan is Hong Kong's No 1 tourism market, accounting for  almost 20 per cent of all tourist arrivals.    Although not all China bound Taiwanese tourists stop in Hong  Kong, those who do spend far more than the average tourist.  HKTA [Hong Kong Tourist Association] figures show Taiwan  tourists spent $13.9bn here last year.    The HKTA spokeswoman, Penny Byrne, said that since the ban  applied only to group travel, the territory would not be as  adversely affected as thought.    "Companies that specialise in group tour traffic will be  hurt," Byrne said, adding that medium range hotels and retailers  would feel the pinch the most.    Airlines which carry Taiwanese tourists to China are also  expected to feel a significant impact, at least in the short  term. These include Cathay Pacific, China Airlines and Dragonair.    A Dragonair spokesman said: "There must be some short-term  impact."    A Taipei official at Cathay Pacific, which has up to 15  flights a day to Taiwan, said the carrier had already begun to  notice a drop- off in demand for Hong Kong-bound seats.    "We have seen some cancellations, mainly on group travel to  China," he said.    A Cathay official said that because only 20 per cent of  China- bound travellers came in groups, the airline did not  expect to be severely affected.    Cathay estimates about 60 per cent of passengers boarding  its  Hong Kong flights go to China.    Hunter Eu, deputy director general of the Taiwan Tourism  Bureau, said Hong Kong would definitely feel the ban.    One Taiwanese airline official said outbound travel to China  was on the decline even before the boat tragedy as many tour  groups had come back from China complaining about horrendous  service.</p>

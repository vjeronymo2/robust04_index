			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Endre Aczel: "AWACS Dilemma"] </F>   [Text] Now that a NATO air strike was delivered against  the attacking Serbs in the area of Gorazde in Bosnia, albeit a  very limited air strike, I find it essential to remind the  readers that this was the second time that the AWACS aircraft  (also) patrolling the Hungarian air space helped NATO in its  combat activity in Bosnia. The difference now is that, on 10  April, the Hungarian Defense Ministry in Budapest acknowledged  the fact that there were AWACS aircraft in Hungarian airspace on  the day of the attack; as for the attack carried out a few weeks  ago, there were only speculation that the reconnaissance planes  flying in the Hungarian airspace were the first to notice the  appearance of the two Serbian Galeb aircraft downed over Bosnia.    In other words, we lost our "innocence" earlier,  irrespective  of Prime Minister Peter Boross' promise to preserve it, a  promise made during his international news conference on 11  February.    Let us stop for a moment at this point. We should answer the  question of whether the prime minister made a hasty declaration  and an impossible promise or not.    I can say that Hungary's effort to keep away from the armed  conflict in Bosnia is a fully legitimate and correct effort.  Hungary's direct national interest requires this, irrespective  of whether it is aiming at NATO membership or not. (Regarding  the weight of the national interest, let me bring up the example  of the NATO-member Greece, which, out of fear for its territory,  placed Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] under a boycott, although this is precisely the  post-Yugoslav republic that blocks the possible spreading of the  flames of the Yugoslav conflict to Greece and, subsequently, to  NATO territory).    On the other hand, once the Hungarian Government (under  Jozsef Antall) allowed the AWACS aircraft into Hungary, it  obviously must have been aware of the fact that its patrolling  activity will be a constant one. In others words, this mission  could lose its goal if it had to constantly report to Budapest  about the hostile activity in Bosnia and ask permission for NATO  participation in fighting against this development. This is an  absurd situation. Budapest is definitely not present in the  "chain of command" linking the UN forces in Bosnia, the UN  secretary general (or his emissary), and NATO.    However, I would like to point out Boross' presumed dilemma,  which must have led to his incriminated declaration disapproved  of by NATO circles. This is a real dilemma, because the  appearance of the AWACS was connected to the UN decision on  banning the use of Bosnian airspace. Thus Hungary took, and is  taking part, in implementing this decision. This is why the  downing of the aforementioned Galeb aircraft did not cause any  problem. However, as far as I know, this UN decision did not  affect the (civil) war being waged on the land and did not  include sanctions in the case of an attack against Muslim  enclaves declared as UN-protected areas, like Gorazde. In other  words, this must have come up in the Hungarian Government, and  Boross also expressed it, namely that the surveillance activity  authorized by him only referred to a single UN decision, and it  cannot be used for other purposes, without special permission.    Could this have been made clear at the time? In principle,  yes. But not in practice. Once they are airborne, the  reconnaissance aircraft observe what they have been ordered to  do: Everything. They report what they see. Budapest cannot  order them to carry out a "selective view," namely to ensure the  airspace boycott but refrain from directing the attacking  planes. Therefore, if there was such a thing at all, the  dilemma is real.</p>

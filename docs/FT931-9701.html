			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Teacher strike may add to Los Angeles school woes BESET by violence, low academic achievements and fierce budget cuts, the Los Angeles school system now faces a possible teachers' strike, unless last-minute mediation produces a settlement. Teachers have voted to strike in two weeks time, after the school board had responded to the worst financial crisis in its history by slashing nearly Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) from salaries. The impending stoppage is one more challenge for the embattled Los Angeles schools. They are called on to provide social services ranging well beyond education, and carry the burden of a place in the front line in the city's racial conflicts. This burden has worsened since six days of rioting last year left 42 people dead and some 700 businesses burned or looted. These tensions are now high again, as the city prepares for a second trial, in a federal court this time, of the policemen accused of beating the black motorist Mr Rodney King. It was their surprise acquittal, in a state court, which set off the riots. Attention is also focused on the trial of youths accused of having beaten Mr Reginald Denny, a truck driver, during the riots. The unified school district, spreading far beyond the city of Los Angeles, is one of the largest and most diverse in the US, with many of its 645,000 students living below the poverty line and a high proportion from recent immigrant families whose English is weak. Politicians from the San Fernando valley, north-west of Los Angeles city, are now backing a plan to break up the school system to create smaller districts more responsive to local needs. A rival initiative, the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now, countered this week with a proposal for massive decentralisation of the school district's powers. The Learn proposal would give individual schools control over their own budgets, as well as over the selection of teachers and of teaching methods. Also, state schools throughout California could be shaken up by a statewide proposition, to be put to a ballot next year, to give parents vouchers that they could use to pay for their children's education in state or private schools of their choice.</p>

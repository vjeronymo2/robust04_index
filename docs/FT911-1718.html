			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Money Markets: A softer tone INTEREST RATES declined on the London money market yesterday, with three-month sterling interbank virtually discounting another cut of 1/2 point in UK bank base rates. The Bank of England discouraged speculation about lower rates however by not supplying enough help to take out the full underlying credit shortage on the cash market. This kept overnight money firm. Trading was cautious, waiting for the results of yesterday's local government elections. Tuesday's reduction in the US discount rate has encouraged hopes of lower UK rates. There was little reaction to news that the German Bundesbank left its credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council meeting. Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11 5/8 -11 1/2 from 11-11 9/16 per cent, while 12-month money was unchanged at 11 5/16 -11 3/16 per cent. Short sterling futures were steady on Liffe. June delivery opened at 88.84 and closed at the same level, compared with 88.85 previously. Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,000m, but revised this to Pounds 950m at noon and to Pounds 1,050m in the afternoon. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 144m bills outright, by way of Pounds 5m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 138m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 288m bills were purchased, via Pounds 269m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 19m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 162m bank bills were bought in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and late assistance of around Pounds 210m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 792m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 30m, a rise in the note circulation Pounds 135m and bank balances below target Pounds 45m. In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.90 from 8.95 per cent in comfortable credit conditions at the beginning of a new trading month. As expected the German Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council meeting, with the discount rate remaining at 6.50 per cent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 9 per cent.</p>

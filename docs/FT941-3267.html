			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Spanish Socialists seeking inspiration: The party's conference in Madrid will concentrate on renovating a jaded image The slogan for the Spanish Socialist Workers' party conference starting in Madrid tomorrow - 'Socialism's new impetus' - is indicative of nothing except that, after more than 11 years in power, the party is running out of slogans. Nine months ago the Socialists rather surprised themselves by winning a fourth consecutive term - although without an absolute majority and now uncomfortably dependent on parliamentary support from Catalan nationalists. This time there will be no triumphalism at the conference, the party's first since 1990 and the most difficult that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, has faced since he first swept into office. The party needs to patch together a semblance of unity before preparing its campaign for European elections in June and a regional poll in Mr Gonzalez's home territory of Andalucia at the same time. Its image is jaded, having lost a large part of the urban and young vote to the conservative Popular party. Searching for the first glimmers of economic recovery after the recession of 1993, Mr Gonzalez wants to bring the party firmly into line behind government policies for controlling the budget deficit and curbing welfare abuses. The draft policy statement for the conference is clear about the party's role: 'The party should support the government and be an instrument for explaining its actions to society.' Heated argument over the easing of Spain's notoriously restrictive labour laws has abated, with reform legislation on its way through parliament, undeterred by a one-day national protest strike seven weeks ago. The voice of the Socialist-led General Workers' Union (UGT) has in any event been muted by embarrassment over the collapse of a union-backed housing co-operative. Other ideological battles - notably over the welfare state and regional policy - are likely to be eclipsed in the public eye by personal struggles for influence in the party hierarchy. The big question is how much power remains in the hands of Mr Alfonso Guerra, the long-standing party number two, and his allies. Mr Guerra was the shadow following Mr Gonzalez into office: behind-the-scenes organiser, holder of the party reins, architect of election victories. Mr Gonzalez was the engaging figurehead, the communicator. Friends from student days, the two men have grown apart. They are now like an estranged couple trying to keep up appearances. Mr Guerra resigned as deputy prime minister three years ago over allegations surrounding his younger brother who, with Mr Guerra's permission, used a government office in Seville to run a business. Despite the affair, which supporters see as victimisation, he has retained a following. His brand of orthodoxy - although not the purist left wing of the party - continues to have appeal, especially in backward areas such as Extremadura, in the south-west. To opponents he represents an outdated style of party discipline and clannishness. No longer with a representative in the cabinet, the Guerra faction has a limited power base among the regional party 'barons', about 30 per cent among the nearly 900 delegates due to attend the conference. The dominant group among the delegates - mostly teachers, civil servants, lawyers and economists - goes by the label renovadores or 'renewers'. Back in 1974, near the end of the Franco era, when the young Mr Gonzalez became party leader at a conference in the Paris suburb of Suresnes, the renovadores were the new blood taking over from the exiled historicos. The tag now refers broadly to advocates of an open party organisation and free-market policies. But it covers a range of opinions. The only common bond is opposition to Mr Guerra. In previous conferences, Mr Guerra drew up the list of candidates for party office. This time, for the first time, Mr Gonzalez is doing it himself. Mr Guerra has threatened to stand down if the party executive is not 'balanced'. But there have been efforts over the last few days to achieve a consensus between the different factions to avoid an open break. It is a fairly safe prediction that the 52-year-old Mr Gonzalez will get his way. The party is closely identified with him, and he now seems intent on maintaining his hold for several more years. Wooed, among others, by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Mr Gonzalez told Mr Delors last month that Brussels was not in his plans. For all its talk of 'renewal', the party has failed to renew itself by promoting a new generation. And even in Mr Gonzalez's generation there is nobody who could easily now fill his shoes, either in government or in opposition.</p>

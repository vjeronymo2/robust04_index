Gorbatova (Samara); UDC 614.7:001.5(470.4)]    [Text]Present-day life in our country is characterized, on  the one hand, by a complicated economic situation, a serious lag  behind progressive nations of the world in the area of  scientific-engineering and technological decisions, and, on the  other hand, exacerbation of the ecological situation, and  absence of appropriate steps to protect the environment. In  other words, the socioeconomic situation in the Russian  Federation is characterized by absence of stable development and  viable environment.    In the Central Volga Region, there is a considerable  concentration of industry, concentration and integration of  agriculture and urbanization. The priority industrial sectors  are oil refining and petrochemistry, the chemical industry,  vehicle manufacture, and power engineering with multifactored  formation of working conditions, attraction toward superficial  sources of water, first of all the Volga River, with the great  demand for water of technological processes, considerable amount  of polluted sewage and discharge of waste into the atmosphere.  All this has led to intensification of anthropogenic impact on  the environment (water, atmospheric air), more complicated  relations between man and the environment, and worsening of  working conditions at industrial enterprises, which made it  necessary to develop at the Samara affiliate several scientific  directions of hygienic research, both basic and applied, on  problems of ``Scientific bases of environmental hygiene,'' and  ``Scientific bases of industrial hygiene and occupational  pathology,'' with development and reinforcement of ties with  practical health care.    We are referring, first of all, to investigation of the link  between condition of the natural and industrial environment, on  the one hand, and health of the population of the Central Volga  Region, on the other hand, with determination of cause and  effect relationship between environmental factors and human  health, patterns of formation of human health and elaboration of  scientific bases for primary prevention of morbidity.    Regression-correlation functions have been established  between incidence among children of neoplasms, acute pneumonia,  chronic bronchitis, congenital abnormalities, allergies and  level of atmospheric pollution, both by individual chemicals and  the sum thereof. The demonstrated nature of morbidity, as well  as prenosological changes in the physical condition of children  were similar and unrelated to the type of industry or specific  pollutants. Prepathological changes were manifested in the form  of diminished pulmonary ventilation, diminished functional  capacity of the nervous system (extended latency period of  oculomotor response), cardiovascular system (reduced stroke  volume with exercise), and depression of B-system of immunity  (low titer of heterophil antibodies in saliva). The effect of  pollutants was assessed with consideration of their combined  effect on health on the order of partial summation. The  demonstrated changes in health status of children served as the  main criterion for assessing hygienic efficacy of  water-protective measures at oil-refining and petrochemical  enterprises.    On the basis of methodological procedures developed at this  affiliate, it was established that the priority anthropogenic  chemical pollutants in Volga water reservoirs (Volgograd,  Kuybyshev), which are sources of drinking water supplied to the  public, have an adverse effect on human health. There was a rise  in noninfectious morbidity, with a shift of maximum values to a  younger age, and impairment of female reproductive function.    Determination was made of quantitative characteristics of  the  link between level of chemical pollution of reservoir water and  drinking water, on the one hand, and morbidity among the  inhabitants of the regions studied. There was a close  correlation between the toxic potential of water and diseases of  the nervous system and sense organs, genitourinary disease,  allergies, skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue diseases. It was  shown that chemicals with first and second class hazard rating  contained in drinking water made the chief contribution to  formation of morbidity among the public.    Establishment of a link between presence in water of  anthropogenic chemical pollutants and public health made it  necessary to refine methods for assessing the quality of water  in superficial sources. Along with means, we used analysis of  degree of deviation of parameters of anthropogenic chemicals  from the standard in order to assess the sanitary condition of  Volga reservoirs. Data on seasonal averages and, particularly,  mean concentrations over periods of many years of pollutants are  smoothed by the sanitary situation of a reservoir and do not  necessarily inform the health inspector accurately about the  real danger of pollution to health of the public, and they  merely indicate the minimal possible hazard.    In-depth analysis of morbidity involving temporary work  incapacity (TWI], course of gestation period and parturition in  more than 45,000 female workers, investigation of infant health  in the early neonatal period revealed that the problem of labor  safety for female workers (operators, laboratory technicians)  exposed to a set of toxic factors, and health protection for the  next generation is left virtually unsolved at enterprises of the  chemical industry (Tolyatti, Chapayevsk). Interruption of  pregnancy occurred most often at the early stages of gestation  and mainly among those who had little work tenure (47.7 percent  of the cases for operators and 55.3 percent for laboratory  technicians). In view of the frequent miscarriages, the mean age  of women at the time of birth of their first child is 23.8 years  for operators and 24.3 for laboratory technicians. In general,  women who are pregnant should not be hired as laboratory  technicians or come in contact with toxic agents for the  duration of pregnancy. Total days of TWI during pregnancy  constituted 9843, which is tantamount to stopping production  involving 400 female workers. Various chemicals are found in  biological media of pregnant women (blood, placenta, perifetal  water, milk): dimethyl formamide, toluene, dioxins.    Impaired neonatal homeostasis causes birth of children with  low birth weight. Intrauterine fetal hypotrophy constituted 15  percent. Penetration of toxic agents into fetal blood leads to  development of defects in various locations. Combined  developmental defects are not uncommon, and they constitute 36.1  percent among neonates of Chapayevsk. In premature fetuses, as  well as spontaneously aborted fetuses there are gross  development defects and their incidence is 50.8 percent.    The results of the study indicate that there is an urgent  need for a legislative solution to the matter of procedure for  granting authorized leave at the early stages of pregnancy to  women employed in chemical enterprises, as well as preferential  pension benefits for women working as ``laboratory  technicians,'' and adding the latter to the list of occupations  in which work is not allowed during pregnancy.    Analysis of morbidity involving TWI among workers at motor  vehicle plants (VAZ, KamAZ) revealed that acute respiratory  infections are in first place in the morbidity structure of  these two plants, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and  connective tissue (osteochondrosis) are in third place; this is  related, in the former case, to the adverse epidemiological  situation observed in recent years, as well as (in the latter  case) to work in uncomfortable, contrived positions. In second  place is hypertensive disease at VAZ and acute tonsillitis, sore  throat and pharyngitis at KamAZ. These differences can be  attributed to the greater intensity and stress of work at VAZ,  and this has been taken into consideration in elaborating  hygienic recommendations to optimize working conditions.    The increased importance of the chemical factor and its  effect on human health have determined the direction of work in  the field of preventive toxicology: development of sanitary  standards for toxic substances (PDK [maximum permissible  concentration], OBUV [approximate safe level of a substance]) in  environmental objects and work zones, expert toxicological  evaluation of new chemical compounds introduced to the national  economy and everyday life. This involved the use of modern  methods for faster standard setting, studies of pathogenetic  aspects of intoxication (lipid peroxidation, condition of  cardiovascular system), long-term and deferred effects, use of  mathematical models. Existing standards continue to be a  reliable foundation for maintaining optimum conditions in the  work environment, preserving purity of water sources and the  urban air environment.    Work on upgrading sanitary legislation was activated because  of the increasing anthropogenic effect on the environment (water  reservoirs, air) of the Central Volga Region, tense  sociohygienic situation at enterprises in cities of this region,  and poor tendencies as to working conditions on the main  assembly conveyers. Many thousands of workers engaged in  assembling passenger vehicles and trucks using mechanized  instruments are exposed to the combined effect of a set of  deleterious industrial factors: different combinations of noise,  local vibration, toxic agents, monotony, static and  nervous-emotional stress. Cases of vibration sickness have been  recorded among the workers; the incidence of musculoskeletal  pathology and other diseases involving TWI is growing. There has  been no decline in personnel turnover related to unsatisfactory  nature and conditions of work.    Consequently, the Sanitary Rules for Working on the Main  Assembly Conveyers in Motor Vehicle Plants, a draft of which was  developed in 1991, are important. Analogous developments remain  timely for other sectors of machine building.    With the increase in anthropogenic burden on water sources  and change in most important pollutants, there has been a  decline in practical value of State standards for sources of  water supply and drinking water because of the incomplete  record-keeping and use in sanitary surveillance practice of  indicators of organic and specific chemical pollution,  diminished importance of indicator microorganisms. In  particular, it was noted in studies at the Volga reservoirs that  bacteria in the E. coli group provide much information for  assessing water quality and direction of self-purification  processes, as compared to their lactose-positive variants. In  this regard, research is both interesting and necessary for  development of rating criteria of water quality and patterns of  water source self-purification processes as related to the prime  pollutant, ecological-hygienic system for rating water quality,  refinement of sanitary-chemical methods of monitoring water  quality in supply sources (on the example of the Volga  reservoirs).    Joint work with practical health care agencies in oblasts  supported by the Samara affiliate (Samara, Ulyanov, Penza)  remains an important element in carrying out research work. The  nature of relations between the research institute and practical  institutions of the SES [sanitary- epidemiological service] has  changed radically in recent times. Territorial SESs have equal  rights to work on scientific projects as subcontractors. This  serves as a foundation for carrying out such labor-intensive  studies as investigation of the health status of the public as a  function of environmental pollution, it is instrumental in more  effective and reliable practical implementation of hygienic and  ameliorative recommendations.    Data on the socioeconomic development of the Central Volga  Region and results of studies of recent years indicate that  further intensification is needed for hygienic research to avert  the negative impact of environmental and industrial factors on  the health of the people.    An applied direction is related to the continued search for  evidence of a link between the public's health and nature and  intensity of work zone pollution. But only development of basic  research, full disclosure of the pathogenesis of reactions of  both individuals and the population to chemical pollutants will  enable us to single out the high risk groups, elaborate the  scientific bases for clinical supervision and come closer to  controlling the health of the people.    In future studies, which are closely related to the priority  direction, it is planned to develop and refine the guidelines  for hygienic monitoring of environmental objects in order to  optimize it, improve organization and performance of analytical  monitoring of levels of priority chemical pollutants in  environmental and industrial objects, identify the mechanisms of  the adverse effects of industrial factors on the health of  workers, improve hygienic regulation of chemicals, the combined,  integral and associated effect on the body of deleterious  environmental and industrial factors.</p>

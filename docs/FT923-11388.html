			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Buffett buys 15% of US group GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which is slimming, received a powerful endorsement of its strategy when Berkshire Hathaway, the investment group led by Mr Warren Buffett, announced the acquisition of a 15 per cent stake in the business, writes Martin Dickson. Mr Buffett is one of the most highly-regarded investors in the US and tends to take large stakes in companies for the long term. His acquisition of 4.35m shares in General Dynamics will have cost about Dollars 300m. General Dynamics recently carried out a Dutch auction tender offer to buy back 13.2m of its shares at a price of Dollars 72.25 a share. It is committed to return to investors much of the excess cash the business is throwing off. Members and trusts of Chicago's Crown and Goodman families reduced their stake is from 22 per cent to about 14.4 per cent under the Dutch auction.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MAN FACING FRAUD CHARGES SUES OFFICIALS  </P> <P> An Oxnard man facing criminal fraud charges for allegedly marketing a heat pump  hailed as a source of "free electricity" filed a civil rights suit against the  Ventura County district attorney and sheriff's offices in Los Angeles federal  court Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dennis M. Lee, 43, is facing 38 charges of violating California consumer  protection laws and eight charges of theft by misrepresentation for marketing  an allegedly energy-saving solar heat pump called the Alternative.  </P> <P> Lee is free on $20,000 bond, pending a trial in Ventura County Superior Court.  But prosecutors have filed a motion to revoke his bail because "he is once  again selling and using misrepresentation to do so," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Rebecca Dean Riley.  </P> <P> Lee's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that sheriff's  deputies searched his Ventura office on Jan. 14, 1988, without a warrant and  denied his right to free speech by arresting him on June 22, 1988, just before  he was to host a marketing meeting at a hotel near Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> The suit also charges that he was jailed for nine months on an  unconstitutionally "excessive" bail of $1 million after his arrest, an amount  that later was reduced.  </P> <P> The suit also alleges that the district attorney's move to revoke his bail  April 9, after he told a meeting of investors in February about his arrest,  violates his right to free speech.  </P> <P> Riley said the Sheriff's Department had a warrant for the search, which led to  Lee's arrest for allegedly defrauding potential investors in his heat pump  company, CONSERVE Financial Services.  </P> <P> Lee's print advertisements for the Alternative promised "free electricity  extracted from the air," Riley said. Lee sold videotapes, blueprints and  documents describing the Alternative, and he offered investors a chance to buy  into manufacture and marketing of the device, she said.  </P> <P> However, the videotapes misrepresented the performance ratings of the  Alternative and falsely claimed that it was listed with Underwriters Laboratory  and that the marketing plan included a bonding program, Riley said.  </P> <P> Riley and the Sheriff's Department declined further comment.  </P></p>

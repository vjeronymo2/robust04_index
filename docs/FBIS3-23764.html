Kravchuk by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy  Zholdak; held in the office of the president of Ukraine on 9  December 1993; published under the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  Projects: Real Contenders for the Office of President of  Ukraine, Elections For Which Have Been Scheduled for 26 June  1994": "`Ukraine Will Be Great and Strong.' UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  Editor in Chief Holds Conversation With President of Ukraine  Leonid Kravchuk on the Most Burning Problems in Domestic and  Foreign Policy of Ukraine, the Leading Cadres of the State, the  Family, Rumors, and the Woes of the People"--for first two  installments see Ukrainian National Affairs Section of Central  Eurasia Daily Report of 28 Dec 93 p 30, 11 Jan 94 p 52]    [Text]  <H3>  The President Goes All the Way on Nonnuclear Status and  Makes a New Statement Through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </H3>   [Zholdak] Did you talk to Clinton from here, from your  working office?    [Kravchuk] This is the telephone I used to conduct the  conversation with Mr. Clinton.    [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator?    [Kravchuk] He is generally very polite. There has not been a  case yet in which presidents have talked to each other  impolitely. It is our politicians that frequently try to outdo  one another in impoliteness. Clinton is a very polite man. I  have communicated with him on the phone three times: first, when  I congratulated him on his election as President; the second  time he called me, when I was at the dacha, during the period of  strikes in summer; and now for a third time.    [Zholdak] Did you talk in the morning or in the evening?    [Kravchuk] In the evening.    [Zholdak] You sat.... Did you know that he would be calling?    [Kravchuk] Certainly. I had been notified.    [Zholdak] In what language did you talk to him--English or  Ukrainian?    [Kravchuk] I talked in Ukrainian and he talked in English.  Both he and I had our own interpreters.    [Zholdak] And, you say, very politely....    [Kravchuk] He expressed the most respectful attitude toward  both me and Ukraine. He always stresses the same thing: that  America is interested in the existence of an independent  Ukraine, and that it is in favor of the territorial integrity of  Ukraine, and he assures me that he wishes Ukraine well. He  starts with this every time.    [Zholdak] Is it true that a secret joint meeting of the  representatives of the Security Councils of America and Russia  was held in Moscow? Did they get together and discuss something  against Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] No.    [Zholdak] Is this just talk?    [Kravchuk] Just talk. Recently there was a meeting of the  Russian Security Council separately. This was reported in the  press. However, not only Ukrainian issues were discussed there  but also issues of overall security in the world.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Armed Forces of Ukraine  means defense, the existence of an independent Ukraine. When  Kuchma was prime minister, he stated that he did not know what  Morozov, our minister of defense at the time, was doing. Do you  remember this phrase?    [Kravchuk] What about it?    [Zholdak] The Supreme Council does not resolve issues of  effectiveness of the military mechanism either because it is a  collective organ. Tell me please, Mr. President, who among the  first, supreme officials of the state works on problems of the  Armed Forces personally, systematically, and I would stress,  responsibly?    [Kravchuk] The president.    [Zholdak] Does everything really devolve on you directly?    [Kravchuk] Everything that concerns the Armed Forces is  reported in its entirety solely to the president. The president  is commander in chief.    [Zholdak] Are you a colonel or...?    [Kravchuk] A colonel.    [Zholdak] It is good that at least you do not promote  yourself to the rank of marshal, as our Communist leaders once  did.    [Kravchuk] Rank is not the issue. The main point is to  prevent war and bloodshed in the state.    [Zholdak] On this, Mr. President, we will give you due  credit: During the two years of your "reign" certain, putting it  mildly, unfriendly forces have not succeeded in getting the  Ukrainian people involved in ruinous conflicts.    [Kravchuk] I repeat that the president is responsible for  the  security of our people to the greatest extent. And if you, Mr.  Editor in Chief, do not have any more questions about nuclear  weapons, and it appears that we have discussed this in a quite  detailed and popular way....    [Zholdak] Yes, you sorted it all out in a popular way.    [Kravchuk] I will declare yet again: No matter who clamors  or  votes in favor of nuclear armaments, Ukraine must get rid of  nuclear weapons. This is due to military-political, technical,  ecological, and other circumstances. However, this should be  done proceeding from the interests of the people.    [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will concur with you on this,  Mr.  President, if crafty Russia, or whoever else together with it,  pays all bills to us for all weapons, both tactical and  strategic.    [Kravchuk] I will ensure this.    [Zholdak] Russia is demanding debts from us, whereas it  itself is an even greater debtor of ours. Let its present  leaders first return to us 16 percent of the USSR reserves of  valuables--diamonds, gold, and other valuables. They have the  gall to put pressure on you.... Do not yield to them, and the  people will support you, Leonid Makarovych. However, at present  the state of the mood of the popular masses is highly volcanic.  I mean our current poor material situation. The people, most of  the people, are concerned about what they are going to eat  tomorrow. Everything is expensive, everything is beyond  reach.... Undoubtedly, you know this as well as I do.    [Kravchuk] Indeed, our economic difficulties have reached a  critical high point.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, here is the main question which  at present alarms Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We have  received an interesting letter. Its author quotes your  well-known pronouncement that is particularly fashionable coming  from the lips of various leaders who care about Ukrainian  independence only in a manner of speaking. You came up with it:  "We have what we have." Our reader is indignant about these  words, and he specifies, to my mind correctly, their message  with regard to the situation that has developed in the state. He  maintains: "We have what we have allowed." Indisputably, this  arrow was aimed at you, Leonid Makarovych.... Therefore, here is  the following question for you: How could it be that after  prices for foodstuffs, to say nothing of manufactured consumer  goods, were raised sharply by the Cabinet of Ministers, which  you lead, the Ukrainian people became paupers overnight, and at  the same time very malicious toward the leaders of its state,  and toward you in particular? Why did this happen? Be so kind as  to explain it in a simple and popular manner, without  "scientific" substantiation, if you would.    [Kravchuk] In a popular way, here it is. If we had real  borders with all states of the world, I repeat--real borders  rather than loopholes, as is the case now, just a belt with all  the attributes of a border, if we had customs checkpoints  likewise with all the attributes, we could establish within the  country prices that are in line with our economic potential.  This is the first point. Second....    [Zholdak] Pardon me, Mr. President, so, is the permeability  of our borders, i.e. the absence of real borders in our country,  the first reason for the growth of prices?    [Kravchuk] No, no, I will explain. I will return to the  main....    [Zholdak] It is just that I want to understand so that we  will not go far....    [Kravchuk] We will not go far. At present, with our  permeable  borders, prices in a neighboring state automatically influence  our situation. For example, we have lower prices, and Russia has  higher prices. They export products to Russia, sell them for  rubles, convert the rubles into dollars, get coupons again....    [Zholdak] They clip coupons!    [Kravchuk] Yes, they do! And the process of exports goes on.    [Zholdak] This is clear.    [Kravchuk] So, the second point. Prices should be in line  with costs. Our prices are not yet in line with costs. High  prices are not even the issue. Do you understand? The issue is  for wages to correspond to prices.    [Zholdak] Our political commentator, Academician Ihor  Rafayilovich Yuknovskyy, has always maintained this.    [Kravchuk] I know. We should bring compensation for labor  into line with prices, and then the standard of living of the  people will grow. For example, the price may be one kopek, and  the wage two kopeks. You will buy two things with two kopeks.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you said "we should bring," but  when will this "should" become a reality? How will this happen?  Are you already developing some kind of mechanism, or what? Are  you and your cabinet just thinking about it?    [Kravchuk] Why thinking? We are working.    [Zholdak] However, the shops are now barren. How much longer  will their beggarly appearance oppress our souls and our  consciousness?    [Kravchuk] Why are they barren? Because everything has been  removed from them.    [Zholdak] By whom? Where to? Did they simultaneously remove  everything from all shops?    [Kravchuk] They exported half the products beyond the  borders  of Ukraine. Collective farms do not sell at such prices....    [Zholdak] So, are they removing it from warehouses? Who is?    [Kravchuk] Look, you do not understand. At present,  kolkhozes  cannot sell products at low prices. These products should be  subsidized, or else they will sell the products with their costs  included. It cannot be otherwise. We gave 5 trillion in  subsidies.... I think the subsidy came to 5 trillion in 1.5  months! So, if we have the budget, these 5 trillion should be  given to collective farms, and they will sell to you at low  prices. Or else they will say: Defray my costs, I cannot  maintain expanded reproduction.    [Zholdak] So, are the reasons for price raises yesterday and  today to be found in permeable borders and prices that are not  in line with costs?    [Kravchuk] The costs are the main reason. We need to either  subsidize or decontrol prices. There is no other way.    [Zholdak] And you decontrolled them!    [Kravchuk] We decontrolled. The subsidies accomplished  nothing. I associate loopholes in the borders with the fact that  when subsidies exist, products are exported to where prices are  higher. That is, the borders are not the main point, they do not  rank first. However, all things are linked among themselves. I  will repeat that prices are low in the environment of subsidies.  Borders have to be under lock and key because of the subsidies  so that products will not be exported to where prices are  higher. Do you understand?    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, say more precisely, so that  both  I and the people who will read our interview will understand,  when exactly changes for the better will occur, and when our  impoverishment will stop. If only you could see how many old  grannies have now appeared in front of bakeries. They stand  there (may they forgive me) as if homeless, hungry four-legged  creatures.... They are asking for a slice of a roll because they  have nothing to buy it with.    [Kravchuk] I will repeat--when we bring wages into line with  prices.    [Zholdak] When will this happen? Tomorrow, a month from now,  10 years or 100 years from now?    [Kravchuk] When we finally determine what energy resources  we  will have and how much they will cost. Russia has recently  raised prices for energy resources three times. Three times.    [Zholdak] So, it will raise prices continuously, and we will  never....    [Kravchuk] No, no. There is the world price.    [Zholdak] What is it?    [Kravchuk] At present, we do not yet have this world price.    [Zholdak] Why do we not? When will we?    [Kravchuk] In January of next year (1994--UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  editorial note).    [Zholdak] It will be set in January and then what--  stabilization occurs?    [Kravchuk] Than we will, for our part, establish the upper  scale of prices.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] We will establish the scale of wages and  retirement benefits, and everything will depend on labor  productivity. For example, if we increase production, prices  will fall. If we reduce production, prices will grow. This is  legitimate. It cannot be otherwise. I will give you a simple  example. You have 100 kilograms of bread.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] And you also have 100 people. You can give one  kilogram to everyone regardless of how much money you pay to all  of them. If you pay them more money they will buy the same 100  kilograms with more money. That is to say, this is about  increasing the number of kilograms. If we increase it, the price  falls. At present, everybody is reducing it. Industry is cutting  back production, there is less meat and less milk. There is less  of everything. So, prices grow.    [Zholdak] However, wages do not grow accordingly. What is  your salary as president?    [Kravchuk] Six hundred thousand, it seems.    [Zholdak] Six hundred thousand net?    [Kravchuk] Well, no, this is the entire salary.    [Zholdak] The entire salary? And nothing on top of it? No  bonuses or extra pay? Nothing?    [Kravchuk] Yes.    [Zholdak] It is not only too much but even terribly little  for the president. How can the president be valued like that?    [Kravchuk] What is there to say when everybody gets low  wages  now. Some get a lot.... The issue now is how to equalize the  ratios of costs, prices, and wages. This is the main issue for  each state. Here, a multitude of problems are superimposed in  this area-- technology, costs, world prices....    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has started a  new rubric: "Are People Cogs? People Are Pincers!" One of your  fellow natives of Rivne responded to it. Ivan Ivanovych  Podranetskyy wrote to us.... I will not quote the entire text  because we will publish it separately. It was about the state,  and you as its head, bringing about a situation where the people  who before the price increases had savings that were  considerable as of that time either at home or in savings banks,  immediately became poor, destitute. What once was a few thousand  karbovantsy has lost value and become simple pieces of paper. At  first it was announced that a certain small amount of deposits  would be increased by 200 percent. However, pardon me, this is  too little, too late. What is to be done so that people will  have what they had? Mr. President, this adage of yours is  particularly appropriate in this instance.    [Kravchuk] If memory serves, the people in our country had  90  billion rubles [R] in passbook accounts. If we appraise it using  this coefficient, it will now come to trillions, tens of  trillions.    [Zholdak] Well.    [Kravchuk] So, we announce, for example, that you have a  trillion. Can you buy anything with this trillion? This is not  the issue.... You see? We may now be kind and announce to all:  The state is paying you back, the state is giving to you. We  live so that the state is supposed to give.    [Zholdak] What it must give....    [Kravchuk] Yes. The state must give what is fair. However,  where is the state to get this? What is the state? Does the  president have money in his pocket? If collectives do not give  this money, if the people who work do not give this money, where  is it to be had? I met today with the director of a Yugoslav  factory. It was an interesting meeting, lasting five minutes. I  asked her: "How do you operate under the conditions of a war  going on?" She answered: "All our workers there understood that  they might only live if they worked. There is no other way."  Further on, I asked: "What kind of taxes do you pay to the  state?" She answered: "For each dinar, two dinars." I was  astonished: "Then how do you live?" She said: "This is how we  live, such is the situation."    [Zholdak] I understand what you are driving at. We should  work, work, work....    [Kravchuk] Wait.    [Zholdak] This is correct, Leonid Makarovych, but on one  condition: Those who organize this "working" process should be  able and willing to implement such an appeal to work. Directors,  a majority of directors, do nothing but "cry": "We do not have  this, all of our relations have been broken...."    [Kravchuk] I did not finish my thought. Please  understand....  I would like to explain it to you in a popular manner. When we  proclaimed our state, what did we begin with? Reduce the work  day as much as possible. Provide as many social programs as  possible. Provide as much social protection as possible.  Provide! Provide! Provide! Everybody said that we were rich  enough to be able to provide for and give everything to  everyone. Here it is, take it! We forgot one thing: All this can  only be created through work. You may put an angel in this  office.... If people do not understand one simple thing, that a  way out should be sought through work, through manufacturing  high-quality products, through sales, and that foreign exchange  has to be earned, we will always be poor. There is no other way  out. Nobody will give us either oil or gas for free. Everybody  lives by world prices. Why can Ukraine not follow them?    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you have been saying all along  that we "must work." In this case, the directors themselves  "must" be first forced to work and hustle.    [Kravchuk] Why "forced?" Then let us return to that regime,  to the former owners of this office who engaged in this.    [Zholdak] No.    [Kravchuk] What do you mean by no? Down with democracy! Down  with laws! What does "force" mean?    [Zholdak] Calling them to order, so as to make them  accountable....    [Kravchuk] In what way?    [Zholdak] If a director works poorly, does not want to  handle  the enterprise or does not know how, or is incapable of handling  the enterprise, why should such a manager be retained?    [Kravchuk] However, you wrote yourself at one time--let the  collectives elect the directors.    [Zholdak] This was wrong.    [Kravchuk] Here we are, wrong. I also say it is wrong.  Everybody made a mistake, and now they want to find a scapegoat.  Yes, I say: we must, we must, we must. After all, I cannot  proclaim that I will issue an edict tomorrow, and that everyone  will have to work under the whip. Down with the laws we have  passed?... The people should understand this themselves. I  repeat that there is no other way out.    [Zholdak] Still, what are we to do about the letter from  your  fellow native of Rivne? So that the karbovantsy will become  valuable.    [Kravchuk] First, you must know that a decision on  indexation  was made by the Supreme Council, and that the value of savings  will be included when the budget is approved. However, to the  full extent.... My thinking is that, second, people should be  told the truth: We are crediting everything for you to a special  account and we will pay it back when we become rich.    [Zholdak] Can you announce this to the people?    [Kravchuk] I can. We will prepare proposals and  calculations,  and we will announce.    [Zholdak] Someone must become urgently concerned about the  common people, the "cogs." The "pincers" will hack out, wrest,  yank, and take theirs from the state. Let us promise that people  will be compensated even in 10 years....    [Kravchuk] We will definitely pay them back.    [Zholdak] After all, we will not be poor all the time, will  we? I do not believe this.    [Kravchuk] Neither do I.    [Zholdak] Is Ukraine in the abyss now or not? What do you  think?    [Kravchuk] Why in the abyss? In the abyss means being dead  already.    [Zholdak] Why? One can still live in the abyss. Hetman  Kalnyshevskyy lived to be 100 years in a "sack of stone."    [Kravchuk] This is not an abyss.    [Zholdak] More terrifying than an abyss.    [Kravchuk] If a man falls into an abyss it means certain  death.    [Zholdak] So, we are not yet in a precipice, Mr. President?    [Kravchuk]) We may overcome this situation.    [Zholdak] What is the situation in Ukraine at present, to  your mind?    [Kravchuk]) An extremely difficult economic situation.  However, having this kind of resources, we may realistically  bring about normal life in Ukraine.    [Zholdak] Thus, the situation is difficult, is it not?    [Kravchuk]) Extremely!    [Zholdak] Extremely! In this case, tell us who specifically  brought this about? Who among the highly placed leaders? What do  you think? Someone should finally be held accountable for the  suffering of a great people, instead of fleeing abroad to  diplomatic and commercial positions, as they are now saying  about the civil servant, currently the "Frenchman" Mr. Lobov,  say, the former minister of power generation and already the  "American" Mr. Sklyarov, and, say, an "active fighter" against  the state structures of the mafia, the former deputy prime  minister and likewise the "American" Mr. Yoffe....    [Kravchuk] Well, this is a "witch" hunt. This is  understandable.    [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, someone should be  responsible for everything. Or would you like to, pardon me,  have to take the rap for everything? I do not want to blame you  alone for the country experiencing such a collapse and  destitution....    [Kravchuk] No, I may say so.... I do not want to.... You  would understand that you are asking me a difficult question. As  president, the highest individual in the state, am I supposed to  shift the blame to someone else? I may only blame myself. This  is it. I cannot shift it to anyone, and I will not. In  principle, I am against a search for enemies and those  responsible for this or that. Everybody.... Now let us  deliberate this way. Was I the only one to whom the idea, for  example, to follow the path we have opted for occurred? No. The  people of Ukraine decided that. We opted for this path, we voted  in favor of it.    [Zholdak] Do you mean the path of independence? As it were,  Kuchma stated when he was prime minister that he did not know  what needed to be built and what path needed to be followed.    [Kravchuk] Why does he not know? I think that he said that  in  the heat of the moment.    [Zholdak] Apparently, for this reason he already wants to  become president of Ukraine now that he has been removed from  the position of the head of government. Perhaps he believes that  from the height of this state position he will see the landmarks  toward which to proceed. Mr. President, we are building an  independent, happy Ukraine.    [Kravchuk] Absolutely! And we know that this entails  sacrifices. We know that this inevitably entails devastation.  Because.... You will understand.... We are building a state out  of a piece. We import 80 percent of everything from Russia and  other states. We are now saying: Look for it internally. We  look, and we find. We have found it somewhere. We should also be  aware of favorable processes in this. Where and when....  Recently I went to Tunisia. They have been building that state  for 37 years now. Thirty-seven years! To this day they have a  great many difficulties. However, there is progress. We started  to build the state only two years ago and want things to get  better right away. We were taken in by an illusion--as soon as  we proclaimed independence, we decided that things would get  easier right away, everything would be cheap, cheap sausage  would become cheaper still, and we would not even work.... Do  you know what the length of the work day is in South Korea at  present?    [Zholdak] Six hours?    [Kravchuk] Fourteen hours!    [Zholdak] In the South Korea which, I think, has all it can  desire?    [Kravchuk] Yes, this is one of the richest countries of the  world. And they get about nine or 12 days of leave--I do not  remember exactly. Nobody raises the issue of having leave for  all right away and the shortest work day in the world. The state  must be built up, a new economy must be built up, wealth must be  created first, and then these things should be discussed.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, I may be mistaken, but so far  it  is not apparent that you personally, as president, have achieved  even a small success in anything--I mean primarily in "creating  wealth."    [Kravchuk] I do not see this either. Look at this.... I  submit the issue of commodity bonds. They block me. I submit the  issue, I was prepared and am prepared now to proceed to sell the  old fleet which Ukraine does not need. They block me. I  submit....    [Zholdak] However, you up and sold the fleet to Russia....    [Kravchuk] I did not sell it to anyone....    [Zholdak] In September you signed an agreement with Yeltsin  in Massandra.... You wanted to sell....    [Kravchuk] We merely signed an intent.    [Zholdak] All the same, why sign even an intent?    [Kravchuk] I am convinced even now that we must sell.    [Zholdak] However, sell rather than give or transfer to  Russia for some kind of astronomical debts invented by them. In  general, if they are allowed into Sevastopol with all of its  infrastructures, they will altogether evict us from there.    [Kravchuk] Can you drive them out of Sevastopol?    [Zholdak] No. We are not capable of doing this at present.    [Kravchuk] Then why the idle talk when it is necessary to  agree with Russia on normal principles of cooperation in the  region? If the issue of "driving them out" is raised, this means  war. I am convinced that Ukraine will be an independent state  only on the condition that it establishes a partnership,  good-neighbor relations with Russia. Anyone who has not grasped  this understands nothing about politics.</p>

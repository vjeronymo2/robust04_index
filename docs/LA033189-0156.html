			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOHN DOE'S NEW WORK THROBS WITH ADVENTURE  </P> <P> Where X typically packed the Coach House on its many forays there, X  guiding-light John Doe drew a far-from-capacity crowd Wednesday, when he  presented the debuts of new songs and a new band. It's a shame, for Doe's  25-song set, while moving in a still-rootsier direction than his old band was  headed, was brimming with the sense of musical adventure and honesty that  marked X's finest moments.  </P> <P> Chief among the show's surprises was that Doe has become a full-fledged  troubadour, more than able to carry a show on his own. Where once his attempts  at Phil Ochs-styled balladry or grainy country standards required a certain  amount of bemused indulgence from his listeners, Doe has grown remarkably since  X's indefinite split commenced last year.  </P> <P> In place of the earnest-yet-amateurish vocals that marked his roots efforts  with X and the offshoot acoustic Knitters, Doe's singing Wednesday was a  near-revelation. Sacrificing none of its directness, his voice displayed an  impressive passion, range and power -- even effectively belting out an Elvis  tribute on Dave Bartholomew's "One Night of Sin," the seamy archetype for the  King's "One Night With You."  </P> <P> With that voice and several of the new songs he introduced, Doe could well  become the equal of his hero Ochs, though a rousing solo version of the late  folk singer's "The Chords of Fame" -- a cautionary tale of a musician who  abandoned his honesty -- set a high standard to live up to. Doe was equally  effective performing solo and backed by a nimble roots-hopping trio of  Blasters' drummer Bill Bateman, K.D. Lang guitarist Greg Leisz and bassist Tony  Marsico, rescued from the Cruzados' new heavy-metal incarnation. Even X  standards such as "See How We Are" and "Hot House" were performed with an  incendiary zeal that made the prospect of an X-less future seem less ruinous.  </P> <P> Doe freely blended folk, country and rock on his new hard-driving "Prisoner,"  the 12-string propelled "Twisted Rendezvous," "Tape Number 52," an update on  the jukebox-weeper sub-genre, and a rendingly forlorn ballad, "It's Only Love,  It'll Go Away."  </P> <P> Though Doe claimed in a recent interview to be disaffected with Los Angeles and  is soon moving to the high desert, Doe's best new songs were those that dealt  with the town and its ways. In one he pined, "Step out on your balcony, and see  your city in bloom. Listen to the sound of guns going off, and try to sleep by  the light of the moon."  </P> <P> His most caustic lines were reserved for those who use BMWs as the measure of  achievement success in "Liar's Market": "It's a liar's market and I'm trying to  sell the truth. If I could be a liar, I could get as far as you."  </P></p>

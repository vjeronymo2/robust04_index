			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Leyland Daf van plant buy-out 'promising' THE POSSIBILITY of a management buy-out of Leyland Daf's van production business in Birmingham from the receivers of the collapsed Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicles group was yesterday 'looking more promising', according to one of the executives involved. Mr Norman Childs, communications manager for Leyland Daf Vans, said the management team, headed by Mr Allan Amey, who has been managing director of the van manufacturing operations for three years, had already signalled its intentions to the receivers and hoped to make a formal approach later this week. It was also likely that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, would be appointed to advise the management team. Mr Childs said that, since the administrative receivers from accountancy firm Arthur Andersen were called in on February 4, the van plant management's main concern was to keep some production going. The receivers and the management had been in contact with those component suppliers which had stopped delivering to the van plant. It was hoped that these efforts would bear fruit this week and production, which had been intermittent, would re-start smoothly. That would have to wait until Wednesday however because the first two days this week would be spent on retraining the remaining employees as 520 workers, one third of the workforce at the plant, were made redundant on Friday. Mr Childs said the management team was now able to concentrate more attention on the potential buy-out. Some of the van sales and marketing people based at Thame in Oxfordshire were also involved. He said Mr Amey 'is very confident he can put together a management buy-out'. It was proving difficult to disentangle the van plant's financial performance from the rest of Leyland Daf, however. When it operated as a separate company, Freightrover, it was profitable from 1983 to 1988. 'We understand it went on making a profit under a new structure introduced in 1989, but it is difficult to pin it down,' said Mr Childs. The van business has always been one of the receivers' most pressing problems because it is excluded from moves backed by the Dutch government to create a company out of the core Leyland Daf truckmaking business. Also, as far as the Birmingham plant was concerned, an ambitious joint venture with Renault seems to be dead. From the outset, the receivers suggested that the van plant's best chance of survival was for it to produce very basic, low-cost, utility vans, essentially for the UK market only and for a core of loyal, large fleet customers such as the Post Office. This plan would need a management buy-out and might need to be kick-started by some form of government selective regional assistance. Mr Childs pointed out the Birmingham plant also generated income from its very large press shop which did a great deal of work for the Rover Group, including pressing panels for Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles. Mr Tony Woodley, national motor group secretary of the TGWU general union, welcomed the prospect of a buy-out. He said: 'I hope that even at this late stage the Department of Trade and City institutions will co-operate with any management buy-out. 'In the interim, I appeal to all the van plant suppliers to continue supplying the factory in order to give it a fighting chance of survival.' The result of a ballot of workers at Birmingham on taking strike action will be announced today.</p>

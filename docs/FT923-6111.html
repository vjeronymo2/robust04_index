			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices fall as sterling remains fragile EUROPEAN government bonds were hit by French opinion polls showing an increasing 'No' vote for Maastricht. Sterling, lira and peseta bonds fell by between a half and one point, French bonds fell sharply although German bunds held steady. Rumours of the poll results were in the markets by lunch time, and prices were dragged further down on confirmation of the first poll's findings that 51 per cent of people intending to vote would oppose the treaty. A later poll showing a small majority in favour of ratification lifted sentiment slightly. In London, the poll results came on top of worries about sterling, which fell to within a pfennig of its lower limit against the D-Mark of DM2.778. Gilt prices fell across the yield curve, with the benchmark 9 3/4 per cent due 2002 down half a point to 101 17/32 . In very active futures trading, the Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.07 to 95.20 in late trading. 'Sterling is still looking very fragile and the bias for gilts remains downwards,' said Mr Philip Tyson, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Spanish and Italian government bonds, also perceived as more at risk from an ERM re-alignment, fell on Maastricht and currency worries, with the Italian futures contract down more than a quarter of a point from its opening of 92.75 to about 92.47. French government bonds fell by up to half a point because of the polls and a weakening franc. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent 2002 bond rose from 9.13 per cent at the opening to 9.21 by late afternoon. The 10-year French German yield spread moved from 122 basis points to more than 130 basis points. Dealers said a French interest rate rise was still some way off, but the franc was beginning to behave like weaker currencies in the system such as sterling. A rise in interest rates could further boost the anti-Maastricht vote, one observer said. German government bonds held steady on the strength of the D-Mark and investors switching out of other European government bonds. The Liffe bund futures contract edged up from 88.13 at the opening to 88.15. AFTER rising in early trading in the wake of a stable dollar and a weak consumer confidence report, US Treasury prices fell on news of poor demand at the afternoon auction of Dollars 15bn in two-year notes. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 97 27/32 , to yield 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower at midsession, however, down  1/32 at 100, yielding 4.231 per cent. For the first half of the day the bond market was tied to the dollar's performance. Despite an early dip in the US currency - it dropped below DM1.40 briefly before recovering to stand virtually unchanged - bond prices held up well, posting modest gains by mid-morning. Sentiment was helped by news of a weakening in the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey from 61.2 in July to 58.0 in August - analysts had expected a slight increase in the figures. Prices retreated following the two-year auction, which drew only moderate demand from investors. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher following afternoon buying on continued expectations of lower interest rates. Analysts said gloomy economic news due in the next couple of weeks could prompt the authorities to cut rates sooner rather than later. This should lift the shorter end of the market, although longer dated issues may be held back by worries about oversupply. The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a 4.73 per cent yield and closed at 4.64 per cent, just below the day's high. It continued to firm to 4.63 per cent in London trading. The Ministry of Finance's announcement that no further shares in NTT will be sold before fiscal year 1994/95 came too late for the market. But dealers said the 247.19 point fall in the Nikkei to 16,380.77 showed the market is sceptical whether further measures to be announced on Friday to boost the economy and stock market will be enough.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by NTV editor </F> in chief Peter Staisch at the Christian Democratic Union party  conference in Hamburg, date not given; monitored in progress --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Staisch] ....but the main emphasis must be on  relief in this particular situation in this region.    [Ruehe] Yes, the people of Sarajevo have won, because we all  remember the terrible scenes. This was possible only through a  mixture of diplomacy and the threat of military force. It seems  that the vast majority [of Bosnian Serb artillery] has been  withdrawn, or put under UN control. This is important progress.  Now, similar living conditions have to be created in Bihac,  Tuzla, Srebrenica, and elsewhere and progress has to be made at  the peace negotiations.    [Staisch] The great catchword, the historical catchword,  which one thinks of is appeasement. A shell fell on Sarajevo  market and suddenly the conscience of the world, the West, NATO,  and the United Nations, or however you want to call this  conscience, has finally stirred. Could this mixture of  diplomacy and military threats that you described not have been  thought of a lot earlier?    [Ruehe] Yes, of course. There were proposals of this kind,  but there was always a tense relationship between the countries  who have troops on the ground and are giving humanitarian aid  and the others who pursued a mixture of diplomacy and the threat  of military strikes. Then things got so bad that an agreement  was reached on this policy, thank goodness. However, it was  also important that Russia joined in the diplomatic process.  This is still not a solution to the conflict, of course, but a  limited and important success, and this has to be continued. It  is true that mistakes were made in the past, that the Europeans  did not share the same political views and that there was  conflict which meant that such conclusive action was not  possible any earlier.    [Staisch] So what can we learn from last Sunday night [20  February] to Monday morning for Bihac and Tuzla?    [Ruehe] The situation in each of these towns is different,  but one thing seems clear to me: It is not enough just to  protect the UN troops. When we talk about safe areas, this  should not mean safe areas for UN troops, but it should mean, as  has been enforced in Sarajevo, safe areas for people. And these  towns mentioned and a few others, I think, are such safe areas  and the safety of people there must also be enforced.    [Staisch] But this would mean that -- and we read yesterday  and the day before yesterday in news agency reports that while  the ultimatum was being met in Sarajevo, the bombing of Bihac  and Tuzla had been stepped up -- basically the ultimatum  strategy should be extended to the whole of Bosnia with the same  determination as shown in Sarajevo.    [Ruehe] We will have to see whether this will also be done  using ultimatums. But it is true that it is good for the people  of Sarajevo who have probably suffered most, or where at least  this has been most visible to the international public.  Television cannot reach all areas. Things cannot stay as they  are. This mixture of diplomacy and military pressure must be  continued. But this can only work ultimately if people learn to  live together again and we need a peace treaty to bring this  about.    [Staisch] What is the significance of the return of the  Russians to the diplomatic and also the military stage? There  have never been blue helmets from the United States or from the  Western powers and Russians under the same UN umbrella on the  same spot.    [Ruehe] This is also an important step for the Russians,  because I remember the talks I had when they said we need our  soldiers in the southern area of the former USSR. That was why  they were kept in the background internationally. And finally  NATO's decision-making powers made this change in Russian policy  possible.    [Staisch] There is a NATO council meeting tomorrow. What  will be discussed? What will be analyzed? What will the future  course be? What will NATO say: Good, we have been successful.  But what will be the next diplomatic and military steps? What  concrete demands will have to be made?    [Ruehe] We will first take full stock of the results and  will  certainly come to the conclusion that this was the correct  strategy. And then we will have to discuss how we can improve  the situation in other areas but I cannot anticipate what that  will entail at present. [passage omitted]</p>

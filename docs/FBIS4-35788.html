			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 27 May issue  of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Last Hours of Lawyer Madani    2. Interrogation of Brotherhood Leader Called Off    3. Editor Warns Government Not To Smother Liberties    4. Egyptian Sudanese War Feared    5. Al-Ghazali Sermon Banned    6. Mufti's Views on Jews, Palestine    7. Copts Not a Minority  <H5>  LAST HOURS OF LAWYER MADANI </H5>   The death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police  custody remains in the news and AL-SHA'B publishes on page 1 a  500-word report on the last day of his life. Citing sources at  Cairo's al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital, the paper says a police  colonel brought a blindfolded man, unable to speak or move, to  the hospital at dawn on 27 April, telling the intern on duty:  "See if this kid is playing the fool or what is wrong with  him." The intern discovered that the man's body was covered  with bruises.    The report adds that the colonel refused to reveal the man's  identity. He also would not allow the man's blindfold to be  removed until he was seen by two resident physicians, one of  whom suspected internal chest bleeding and wrote a note to this  effect to the resident heart and chest surgeon. This note was  disregarded and the patient was transferred to the detainees'  ward where he died in the afternoon.    The report continues that when one of the resident doctors  who had seen him in the morning reported for duty again in the  afternoon, she was asked to write out a death certificate saying  that the "unidentified" case who had been moved to the  detainees' ward had died of an asthma attack.    AL-SHA'B says that Madani had never complained of asthma in  his life.  <H5>  INTERROGATION OF BROTHERHOOD LEADER CALLED OFF </H5>   A brief item on page 1 reports that al-Jizah's public  attorney, following a meeting with Muslim Brotherhood General  Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr's lawyer Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna,  rescinded his earlier order to summon the general guide for  interrogation. Abu-al-Nasr had been sought for interrogation in  connection with the distribution of a leaflet carrying his  signature shortly before the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast. He had  committed a technical illegality by signing the leaflet as the  Muslim Brotherhood general guide. The Muslim Brotherhood is not  formally recognized by the government as a legal movement.  <H5>  EDITOR WARNS GOVERNMENT NOT TO SMOTHER LIBERTIES </H5>   Chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses in a 2,500-word  editorial on pages 1 and 2 the "official media's campaign  against the Muslim Brotherhood" following the government's  "dismal failure" in dealing with the Lawyers Association and its  legally elected Council.    He says: "The government is creating a climate suggesting  that it is time to pounce on the moderate Islamic stream by  means of a media campaign that uses all methods except the  truth. The claim is being emphatically made that the Muslim  Brotherhood is part and parcel of the terrorist movement,  although all those who write about this issue, relying on  security reports, know in their hearts that this is not true."    Husayn warns the government not to encroach on the already  narrow margin of liberties and says its vicious campaigns will  merely serve to isolate it further from the citizens. He cites  the government's decision to ban Islamic preacher Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali from delivering a sermon on 'Id al-Adha, its  arrest of Socialist Labor Party young members without specific  charges, its hostile attitude to the Lawyers Association, and  its contempt for journalists like himself. He declares: "You  are ridiculing us and telling yourselves that this newspaper has  been clamoring for months and years while we enjoy the seats of  power. You say: Let them clamor while we rule. We can silence  them at any time."    Husayn continues: "I tell you that the sense of the passage  of time is a relative matter. When the day of which we warn you  finally comes, you will regret but it will be too late."  <H5>  EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE WAR FEARED </H5>   A 400-word article in the "Topic of the Hour" column on page  7 by Tal'at Rumayh warns of a possible Egyptian-Sudanese war  over Hala'ib or over the Egyptian buildings and other  installations that the Sudanese authorities periodically take  over. He says he suspects that the "United States and Israel  have a magical recipe to strike a decisive blow against Egypt's  current and future role in the Arab world and to abort the  Sudanese experiment at the same time."   <H5>    AL-GHAZALI SERMON BANNED </H5>   A detailed report of 2,000 words on page 3 speaks of the  government's "recent provocative acts against the Islamic  stream" including the tight security measures in various places  of worship during the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast and the banning  of well-known Muslim preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali from  leading the 'Id al-Adha prayers and delivering a sermon in the  square of the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's al-Muhandisin  District. The government sent an Awqaf Ministry preacher to  lead the worshipers in prayer.    The report describes the security measures around various  mosques during the feast's religious observances and says the  security forces tried to prevent worshipers from forming large  crowds in village squares or in open areas before the mosques.  There are references to the substance of the sermons made by  various imams in various parts of the country. Shaykh  'Abd-al-Mu'izz 'Abd-al-Sattar, a prayer leader in Hulwan  advocated the application of Islamic shari'ah and the nation's  return to Islam. Members of East Hulwan's Youth Center  distributed a leaflet which said, in part: "This is the current  condition of the Islamic nation and Palestine is being sold."    A 700-word commentary next to the above report is entitled:  "The Accredited Preacher and the State-Owned Prayer Rug." The  writer, AL-SHA'B journalist Khalid Yusuf, who was under police  custody during the 'Id al-Adha observances, describes how he was  allowed to worship surrounded by police officers, many of them  plainclothes security personnel, and how he overheard them  saying that the imam who was going to deliver the sermon was  "the accredited speaker," meaning a preacher considered safe by  the authorities.  <H5>  MUFTI'S VIEWS ON JEWS, PALESTINE </H5>   In the newspaper's "Dialogue" section on page 9, Dr. Mahmud  Himayah, an al-Azhar academic, writes a 4,500 article which  appears to be a book review of an unnamed book by Mufti of the  Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi. Himayah does not say he  is reviewing a book but the headline of the article reads: "The  mufti said: The Zionists Are People of Treachery, Espionage,  and Corruption." In his introductory paragraph, Himayah again  says "in the mufti's words" and halfway through the article this  sentence appears: "Toward the End of the Book the Mufti Wonders:  What Are the Main Reasons for the Palestinian Catastrophe?"    A two-column photograph of the mufti accompanies the  article.    The apparent review outlines the mufti's views, based on  Koranic verses, on the Jews's "killing of prophets" and their  espousement of espionage methods to "promote their interests and  work corruption on the earth".    The review then discusses the conversion of some Jews to  other religions with the aim of promoting Jewish and Israeli  interests. Dr. Ahmad Shalabi is quoted as saying that in several  Far Eastern countries there are Buddhists of Jewish origin or  Buddhists married to Jewish women who work in their countries'  embassies in Indonesia and rather than serve those countries'  interests, they are always seeking to promote the Israeli cause.    Part of the review is devoted to 19th century British Prime  Minister Disraeli who is said to have converted to Christianity  to help Jewish causes, including emigration to Palestine. He is  also blamed for "stealing" Egypt's share of the newly built Suez  Canal in the late 19th century by purchasing that share for a  mere 4 million pounds from Khedive Isma'il.    There is a section about the "evils and sins" that the Jews  are encouraged to perpetrate by their scriptures and other  books. In this connection the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"  are mentioned and the first, second, third, eleventh, and  seventeenth "protocols" are cited. These are said to refer  respectively to the clash between morality and politics, the  power of the press, the benefits of the diaspora in enabling the  Jews to "attain world dominance," and the need to undermine  clerics of other religions.    The Jews are accused of "seeking to undermine religions,  morals, and spiritual values" and using the media, including the  cinema and theatre, to disseminate "debauchery and moral  dissolution among individuals, communities, and nations."    Concerning the Palestinian issue, the mufti is cited as  saying that the efforts of world Jewry to Judaize Palestine, the  feeble religious sentiment among the Arabs, and Arab disunity  were behind the loss of Palestine. He criticizes the fact that  the defenders of Palestine at the time of Israel's establishment  were motivated by nationalist, political sentiments alone to the  exclusion of religious feeling. He stresses the need to  correct this attitude and to keep the memory of Palestine alive  until the time comes for its liberation.    As noted above, the name of the mufti's book is not given.  Nor is there any indication of when the book was published.   <H5>    COPTS NOT A MINORITY </H5>   Also on page 9, Ibrahim al-Bayyumi Ghanim discusses in a  3,000-word article entitled: "The Conference on Minorities and  the Policy of Division" the status of Egypt's Coptic community.  He refers to the attempts of foreign powers to use the minority  issue to "serve their ambitions and promote their objectives in  some of our countries where some minorities live, this being a  well-known and long-established policy of Western and U.S.  colonialism."    The article recalls the controversy surrounding the plan by  Cairo's Ibn-Khaldun Center and the London-based Minority Rights  Group to hold a conference on minorities in Cairo and issue a  declaration called "The Cairo Declaration on Minority Rights."  The controversy forced the organizers to change the meeting's  venue from Cairo to Cyprus.    The writer points out that "the issue of minorities is an  extremely sensitive issue and one of the most controversial  worldwide." He adds that "foreign colonial and Zionist powers  seek by actual intervention to foster ethnic and religious  conflicts with the aim of turning these groups into new  statelets and warring factions that will be easy to swallow."    He expresses reservations about the UN declaration of 18  December 1992 about the rights of "individuals belonging to  national, ethnic, and linguistic minorities" and says it cannot  serve as a reference for handling minority issues in "our Arab  and Islamic societies."    The writer denies that the Copts are a minority in Egypt and  recalls how they were removed from the agenda of the conference  in question following the uproar that surrounded their original  inclusion in it. He writes: "They are not an ethnic minority  or the descendants of a different national group. Actually the  Muslims of Egypt are the descendants of the Copts of the  pre-Islamic era. The Copts have no special language or culture  that would isolate them from others but are a basic component of  Egypt's social and cultural fabric."    He asserts that an Islamic system joins Muslims and the  adherents of other religions in a united homeland and in a  framework of common interests and emphasizes that an Islamic  society always guarantees freedom of worship for non-Muslims.    He remarks: "The relationship between Egypt's Muslims and  Copts was not disturbed until foreign colonialism entered our  land. Nowadays a vicious foreign element or a disloyal domestic  element is sowing suspicion among the sons of the same homeland  and provoking disputes among them, thus serving the interests of  colonialism and Zionism."    He continues: "It is our view that if the minority concept  prevails in any society, it will have unlimited destructive  repercussions that will eventually waste the united majority and  lead to its dissolution. This can only be followed by its  disappearance and assimilation into greedy foreign entities that  seek to dominate us and control the whole world."    He ends the article by calling for the inclusion of all  citizens in a free discussion of national issues.</p>

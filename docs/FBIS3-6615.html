			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 March Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] In an interview given to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  reporter in Tokyo, Algerian Economic Minister Mourad Benachenhou  commented on negotiations for deferring the repayment of debts  worth $30 billion, which is his objective in his visit to Japan,  saying: "Japan showed a favorable attitude at the talks."  However, Benachenhou pointed out that the Algerian economy will  be faced with difficulties in the future due to sluggish sales  of crude oil, and stressed again: "I would like to ask for  understanding from Japan, to which our country owes the second  largest amount of debts, next to France."    He pointed out that prospects are not optimistic for the  debt  issue. He said that Algeria's debt service ratio (ratio of  foreign debt repayment to exports) reached 86 percent in fiscal  1993, and predicted that "in 1994, the debt service ratio will  be 90 percent or more."    With regard to the reasons for this, he said: "The oil  market, (in which oil producing countries are hesitating to  cooperate with each other in cutting oil production), is now  falling into disorder. We cannot take an optimistic view either  on the short-term or the long-term situation."    Benachenhou further stated: "I would like to invite European  and Japanese companies to take part in the development of  abundant deposits of LNG (liquefied natural gas) in Algeria."</p>

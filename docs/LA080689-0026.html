			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> G'DAY AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> In the article on immigration to Australia the persons interviewed did not  represent all major Australian cities and states, so I can understand the  writer's omission of Tasmania as a place where Americans have found a new home.  However, the failure to include Tasmania, probably the most beautiful and  geographically varied of Australia's states, on the map of the country is  inexcusable.  </P> <P> PAUL O.

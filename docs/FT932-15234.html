			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Higher bond prices help lift US equities Wall Street FOR the second day running US stock markets moved higher in tandem with government bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.94 at 3,444.05. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.86 higher at 449.23, while the Amex composite finished up 2.43 at 420.51, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.71 at 673.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was 286m shares. Once again, rising bond prices and falling yields helped stock market sentiment, even though part of the upward momentum in bonds came from bad news on retail sales, which fell 1.0 per cent in March. Ultimately, however, bond prices were rising steadily because recent news on consumer and producer prices allayed fears that inflationary pressures have been building up in the economy. Stocks were also boosted by big gains in overseas markets, notably in Tokyo, where the main index jumped 4.3 per cent after the Japanese government unveiled an ambitious fiscal stimulus package aimed at helping the ailing economy. The market held its form even after bond prices fell back mid-afternoon, with prices supported by some program buying. Brokerage and investment banking stocks were in particularly good form, lifted by news of another quarter of record earnings at the securities industry's biggest company, Merrill Lynch, which reported profits of Dollars 342m for the period, up 57 per cent on a year earlier. The earnings helped Merrill shares rise Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 in busy trading. Also firmer were PaineWebber up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 27 1/4 , Morgan Stanley Dollars 2 5/8 higher at Dollars 64 7/8 , Dean Witter Discover Dollars 1 1/8 stronger at Dollars 38 1/8 , and JP Morgan up Dollars 2 at Dollars 72 3/8 . while Primerica rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 49. Motorola remained buoyed by Monday's news, released after the close of trading, of strong first quarter earnings. The stock rose more than Dollars 2 initially, before dropping back to end up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 1/8 in volume of 3.2m shares. Other big computer issues were flat or weaker, with IBM down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 49 3/8 , Digital Equipment Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 39 7/8 and Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 at Dollars 74 5/8 . Other notable stocks to be aided by first quarter earnings were Westinghouse Electric, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 1/4 , and CBS, Dollars 7 1/8 higher at Dollars 237 1/8 . Citicorp rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 as reports continued to circulate that Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the bank's largest individual shareholder, had sold almost 9m shares on Monday. Canada TORONTO stock prices closed higher in heavy trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 index rose 9.83 points, or 0.27 per cent, to close at 3,624.84. Newbridge Networks jumped 4 to CDollars 76. SoundView Financial Group of New York rated Newbridge a "buy" for the short term and a "hold" for the long term in its rating of the stock.</p>

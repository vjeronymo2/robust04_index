			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Guatemala reaches deadlock on refugees THE Guatemalan government has refused to guarantee the safety of some 4,000 refugees who are intending to return home this week, thus threatening to postpone their repatriation and further isolate the government from the international community, writes Damian Fraser. The peaceful return of 45,000 refugees is seen as a crucial test of government willingness to end the 32-year-old civil war. The refugees fled, mostly to Mexico, early in the 1980s to escape army-backed atrocities. The government agreed last October to guarantee the safety of the refugees, and find ways for them to obtain land. But it wants them to return via side roads near the Peten jungle; the refugees wish to take the Pan-American highway. Until the dispute is cleared up the government will not guarantee their safety. Thousands have already left their camps in Mexico, and are making their way towards the border town of Mesilla. But authorities in Mexico have not offered them transport while there is no agreement with Guatemala.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BN: "Superphenix Restarted. Six Months of </F> Operation As Fast Breeder Reactor"; as released by Bern  ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Paris, 23 Feb (ATS) -- The French Government decided  to restart the Superphenix with a "research and demonstration"  mission. Designed to produce more fissionable material than it  consumes, the installation has been shut down since 3 July 1990.  It will only have operated at full power as a fast breeder  reactor for six months.    According to its promoters, Superphenix, a project launched  more than 20 years ago and presented in 1970 as the "big hope"  of French industry, was to "play the same role in the 21st  century as the steam engine in the 19th century." Ten years  later, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said, after the first  oil crisis, that the fast breeder reactor "would give France  energy reserves comparable to those of Saudi Arabia."    Superphenix was damaged around 12 times, suffered two  prolonged shutdowns, and, from the start of work 17 years ago,  prompted opposition and discussions between opponents and  supporters of this nuclear network.    Linked to the EDF [French Electricity Company] network on 14  January 1986, Superphenix experienced problems from May 1987. A  sodium leak between the walls of the cylinder which allows the  loading and unloading of the fuel, led to an initial shutdown of  two years. The cylinder was replaced at the end of 1991 by a  fuel transfer pump of a new design.    Meanwhile the EDF set up a temporary unloading structure in  January, 1989, which was to last two years. Superphenix was  ready to resume operation but in October it was shut down for  maintenance work.    On 3 July 1990, there was a second serious incident and  another shutdown. The sodium which ensures the transfer of heat  from the heart of the reactor to the steam generators, became  oxidized. The EDF attributed the incident to a maintenance  defect. The Superphenix has been shut down ever since.</p>

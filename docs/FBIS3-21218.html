			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Toshiba Tungaloy Co., Ltd. (Toshiba Tungaloy),  jointly with Cho-Onpa Kogyo K.K. (Cho-Onpa Kogyo), has developed  an instrument for measuring ``high-temperature total dynamic  elastic moduli and vertical and horizontal internal wear,''  which is expected to become a powerful, supportive tool for  R&amp;D  concerning new materials including structural ceramics.    This epoch-making ultrasonic device is capable of  simultaneously measuring nine material dynamic parameters,  including various elastic constants and internal friction, over  a temperature range of from room temperature through  1,550C. With this device, it is now possible to easily and  simultaneously determine elastic moduli and internal friction  unique to a given material, which had previously been difficult  to measure. Thus, materials design should be made easier than  before, and useful information can be obtained for clarifying  material behavior. Toshiba Tungaloy is scheduled to present a  paper on this development at the sixth Fall Symposium of the  Japan Ceramics Association, which will start on 6 October 1993.    The Toshiba Tungaloy group developed a compact, ultrasonic  device capable of dealing with small samples. With this device,  the group succeeded in simultaneous determination of nine  parameters for structural ceramics, such as _a_-alumina,  _b_-alumina and cubic zirconia polycrystal [(Y)TZP], from room  temperature through 1,550C in an argon atmosphere. These  parameters were seven, elastic modulus-related parameters  (Young's modulus, shear modulus, volume modulus,  compressibility, Lame parameter, Poisson ratio and acoustic  velocity anisotropic constant) and two parameters of vertical  and horizontal internal frictions. The group found that, for  _a_-alumina, Young's, shear and volume moduli decreased, while  Poisson ratio increased parabolically, as temperature increased.  From these results and with a decrease in the acoustic velocity  anisotropic constant, the group obtained data for _a_-alumina  that hinted the activation of shear mode at high temperatures.    The group also obtained data clearly indicating behavior of  (Y)TZP from the super-plastic phenomenon and the grain boundary  sliding-involving phenomenon, while pursuing parameter changes  with increasing temperature. The elastic moduli of a solid, like  its dielectric constant, are the fundamental properties unique  to the material, and they are extremely important for evaluating  the material and designing with the material. Today, not many  data on various elastic moduli have been published, and no  high-temperature data are available since it has been impossible  to determine parameters at a high temperature and to  simultaneously determine elastic moduli in horizontal and  vertical directions. It has been known that the internal wear  can be widely used for studying glass transition, lattice flaws,  residual stress, structural state and grain boundary dispersion,  and can be useful in determining correlation with various  physical properties over an entire temperature range of  measurements. However, no discrimination has been made for  various physical phenomena occurring within a material due to  vertical (elongation) wear and horizontal (shear) wear. No  simultaneous measurement of these parameters to 1,550C has  been made either.    The development of this new measurement device is expected  to  significantly spur materials R&amp;D. Toshiba Tungaloy plans to  aggressively sell the device to universities and major  manufacturers at a price of &yen;30 million for the device  capable of measuring to 1,550C and &yen;20 million for the  one capable of measuring to 800C.</p>

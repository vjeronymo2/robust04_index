			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Berlusconi heads off unions' pensions protest Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has temporarily headed off a showdown with the powerful trades union movement over proposed cuts in the generous state pensions scheme. Cutting pension benefits is an essential element in the right wing coalition's plans to reduce public sector spending in the 1995 budget. Over the past eight days there has been a series of industrial stoppages organised by angry trade unionists. This included yesterday's action at Fiat's usually tranquil Mirafiori plant in Turin. But after their first meeting on the issue yesterday with Mr Berlusconi, the heads of the three main trades union confederations talked of having made a 'step forward'. Both Mr Berlusconi and the union leaders said it was important first to establish the principles of how the system was to be reformed, and then discuss the nature of the cuts. This represents an important change in the government's approach. Until now the emphasis has been on finding a specific sum of money from the cuts. The Treasury has been pushing for cuts of over L8,000bn (Pounds 3.31bn) while the labour ministry whose brief directly covers pensions, has suggested the figure be held below L6,000bn. 'We must avoid a negotiation over how much money we are going to cut from welfare payments and instead we must face up to how we are going to reform the system in a way that is compatible with resolving the problem of our public finances,' Mr Berlusconi said. The two sides are due to meet again next Monday. In the meantime union leaders will be meeting ministers discussing other aspects of the budget, especially fiscal policy. Mr Berlusconi's hands were slightly tied at yesterday's encounter. He had hoped that a special 18-person commission set up in early August to examine pension reform would have completed its report. However, Monday's completion deadline slipped because commission members, who included technicians and trades union representatives, failed to agree on its contents. The report - or probably two separate reports - are now due to be ready by next Monday. The government is seeking to find up to L50,000bn through increased revenues and spending cuts in the 1995 budget. The spending cuts account for two thirds of this and a quarter of these are expected to come from welfare payments and especially pensions.</p>

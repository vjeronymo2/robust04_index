The  main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for satellite  communications payload work and McDonnell Douglas and  Arianespace for the launch vehicles. This is an important  contract which will ensure the continued well-being of the UK's  space industry and contribute to its long term future."  <H5>  Notes To Editors: </H5>   Skynet 4 Stage 2 will be accepted into service in March and  December 1998. The satellites will be for the sole use of the UK  military forces and are expected to be positioned in  geostationary orbit at 1 degree west for the first satellite and  either 53 degrees east or 34 degrees west for the second.</p>

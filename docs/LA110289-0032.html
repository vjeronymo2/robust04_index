			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Hahn's Muddy Encounter: Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual  encounter with television evangelist Jim Bakker started the downfall of his PTL  empire, will be hosting a pay-TV special Nov. 10 that features heavy-metal rock  and female mud wrestling. "It's not 'Masterpiece Theater.' It's a little  crazy," Hahn says of the show, "Thunder and Mud." "I've got mud in front of me  and heavy metal behind me. The girls all look great -- I felt like their  grandmother." Asked if her rock and mud show is denigrating to women, Hahn, 30,  says no. "It's simply fun television. We're not claiming to be brain surgeons."  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

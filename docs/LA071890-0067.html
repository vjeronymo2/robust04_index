			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> VAN NUYS FORLORN OVER FORFEIT  </P> <P> Chris Prince sprinted in from center field, palms and eyebrows raised, looking  for an explanation. He didn't like what he heard. And he doesn't like having so  much time to think about it.  </P> <P> Prince and his Van Nuys-Notre Dame teammates were trailing Panorama City, 3-1,  in the sixth inning of the second game of a doubleheader Saturday when their  stand-in coach, assistant Mitch Graff, booted the bat rack in the dugout.  </P> <P> The umpires, who earlier had ejected Graff for arguing a call, awarded a  victory to Panorama City on a forfeit and left the field. For Prince and his  teammates, it was more than the end of a game -- it was the end of a season.  </P> <P> Van Nuys had won eight consecutive games to move into District 20 playoff  contention before dropping a game to Woodland Hills West on Friday, and needed  a mere split of Saturday's doubleheader to stay in contention for a wild-card  berth.  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-1, after five innings of the opener, Panorama City rallied to win,  9-8. Down by two runs in the nightcap, Van Nuys had one more scheduled at-bat  when the umpires called the game.  </P> <P> Graff was running the team for Coach Jody Breeden, who was attending a wedding.  When Graff re-entered the Van Nuys dugout in the sixth to issue instructions to  the team, the umpires ordered him to leave. Graff initially balked, then kicked  a stack of aluminum bats.  </P> <P> When the umpires halted the game and Prince figured out what was taking place,  he stormed in and demanded an explanation.  </P> <P> For Prince and four other Van Nuys players -- all of whom graduated from Notre  Dame High last month -- it was the last moment in Legion baseball. A  less-than-favorable impression will last for some time.  </P> <P> "It's the coaches who are responsible for the players, not the players who are  responsible for the coaches," Prince said. "There's no way it's right for the  umps to just walk off and leave."  </P> <P> Bad form: Newhall-Saugus' playoff fortunes were saved by an error. Not one of  the standard E-6 variety, but an administrative error.  </P> <P> The San Fernando coaching staff did not return its Form 1 registration  application -- the officially recognized roster that is placed on permanent  Legion file -- until after the June 20 deadline. Therefore, any game San  Fernando won after June 20 was ruled a forfeit, district Commissioner Mel  Swerdling said.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Swerdling informed Newhall-Saugus Coach Tom Pedersen that his  team's recent loss to San Fernando had been overturned. Because of the ruling,  Newhall-Saugus (15-8) qualified for one of two wild-card playoff berths, one  game ahead of Van Nuys-Notre Dame and Reseda.  </P> <P> All-Stars: The first Southern California All-Star Game has been scheduled for  Aug. 11 at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> All-stars from the 6th Area -- which includes Districts 16 and 20 of the Valley  area -- will face players from the 4th and 5th areas, according to Swerdling,  who helped organize the event.  </P> <P> The 4th Area is in southern Los Angeles County and includes teams from the Long  Beach region. The 5th Area is in the eastern part of the county and includes  teams from the Claremont and Upland regions.  </P> <P> Wild life: Mario Joy tossed a two-hitter in Burbank's 10-4 victory over North  Hollywood on Saturday and had a no-hitter through six innings, but the tension  that mounted as the game progressed wasn't typical of most no-hit bids.  </P> <P> In fact, Joy may have been fortunate to have won at all; any hand-wringing had  more to do with whether he would be removed because of wildness.  </P> <P> The right-hander walked 10, struck out 11 and uncorked six wild pitches. Two  wild pitches came on strikeouts, with the batter reaching first base. Whatever  the methodology, the hits weren't coming.  </P> <P> Joy, normally a shortstop, allowed a bunt single by John Levine to open the  seventh. In the ninth, the Burbank first baseman seemed to be in position to  flag Cassidy Pope's dribbler down the line, but the grounder bounced off the  bag for a scratch single.  </P> <P> Making his pitch: Joe Tushnet had been after Reseda Coach Howard Randall all  season. "Gimme the ball," Tushnet said. "How tough can it be?"  </P> <P> Tushnet, who was selected to the District 20 All-Star Game as an outfielder,  wanted to try his hand on the pitcher's mound.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the final day of regular-season play, Tushnet got his shot. He  started and lasted 1 1/3 innings in an 11-3 loss to Chatsworth, allowing two  runs in the first and three in the second.  </P> <P> The reviews were mixed, which is more than Randall could say about Tushnet's  repertoire.  </P> <P> "He doesn't throw slow enough to have a good changeup," Randall said, "and he  doesn't throw fast enough to have a good fastball."  </P></p>

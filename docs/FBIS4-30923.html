			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 27 (CTK) -- Resuming arms production  to a "sensible" extent in enterprises affected by conversion to  civilian production, where "good capacities and possibilities"  exist, can be seen as useful, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said  today.    "Conversion as we were doing it was bad," Moravcik said at a  briefing after a meeting in Detva of directors of state-owned  enterprises, bankers and business owners in the central Slovak  region of Detva. However, he went on, the government has not  enough money for converting arms manufacturing to civilian  production to the necessary extent.    "We want to release certain funds within several months, but  this will not be enough to cover all requirements," Moravcik  added. A possible early resumption of arms manufacturing could  provide additional funds for speeding up the conversion process,  he said.    The government is currently working out the principles of  privatization policy in the armament sector, which are to be  ready by the end of June, said Moravcik. He added that in his  opinion this sector can be revived through privatization and the  transfer to private ownership, while maintaining reasonable  state participation.</p>

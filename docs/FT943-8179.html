			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Telebras falls 25% to RDollars 131m at interim stage Telebras, Brazil's government-controlled telecommunications holding company, reported underlying consolidated profits after tax of RDollars 131.3m (USDollars 146m) for the first half, down 25 per cent on the same period last year. This was in spite an increase in net sales of 12 per cent, largely due to an increase in local telephone traffic of 7 per cent, and an increase in long-distance calls of nearly 20 per cent. Without providing details, the company said staff and depreciation costs and spending on equipment and services had increased during the first half of this year. It added that its financial costs had been affected by the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which increased costs on a euroyen issue, and by high local interest rates. Mr Sergio Goldman, an analyst at investment bank Bear Stearn's Sao Paulo office, said the results were weak considering the growth in telephone traffic and an 8 per cent increase in the number of lines in the past year.</p>

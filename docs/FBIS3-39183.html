			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Spanish Ultimatum on Norwegian Fish"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- "Everything is negotiable and this  includes Spain's demand for quotas in Norwegian waters in the  context of Norway's wish to become a member of the EU [European  Union]. But if Norway continues to insist on its completely  impossible position that it does not have a single fish to give  away, it will be Norway and not Spain that is blocking the way  for membership," European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp  told AFTENPOSTEN.    In the midst of yesterday's busy round of negotiations  between the EU and the four applicant nations, AFTENPOSTEN was  granted an exclusive meeting with an extremely relaxed European  affairs minister and his closest aides, Franscisco Elorza and  Alberto Navarro. This troika is currently firmly pushing large  numbers of Spanish demands in the negotiations with the  applicant nations. They are doing so in what seems to be such an  uncompromising manner that many observers in Brussels are  shaking their heads in resignation and wondering how it is to be  at all possible to reach a solution that both the applicants and  Spain can accept.    However, this practiced Spanish negotiating trio -- long  since pointed to in Norway as the archenemy -- gave the  appearance of being friendliness itself. With one voice and  with a sparkle in the eye, they assured me that they want Norway  as a member of the EU, and they insisted on being believed when  they claimed that they are willing to negotiate everything. But  in the negotiations both sides must make some concessions, and  so far they have not seen a single signal of a Norwegian  determination to negotiate, they said.    "No Norwegian EU membership without fish for Spain,"  Francisco Elorza said determinedly. He claimed that he has  already been in contact with Norway to signal a clear and  unambiguous willingness to negotiate, but threw his hands up in  a gesture of resignation at what he views as Norwegian  implacability. But does Spain really dare block Norwegian  membership, if Norway stands up for itself?    "We are convinced that we do not need to block membership.  Look what happened during the EEA [European Economic Area]  negotiations. Eventually the EU won some fish from Norway.  Spain had to share this with others. This time we want our own  quota from Norway. If it was possible to reach agreement during  the EEA negotiations, why not this time too?" Westendorp asked.    The Spanish European affairs minister compared Norway and  Spain to two trains that are approaching each other at full  speed, but that still have time to apply their brakes to prevent  a collision. "I do not think that there will be a collision,"  Westendorp said. He does not rule out the possibility that  Spain will be put under great pressure from the other EU  countries to abandon its demands.    "We could become isolated in the EU, but remember that  unanimity is needed to reach a joint position vis-a-vis Norway,"  he stressed. Westendorp added for safety's sake that the demand  for Norwegian quotas is the only Spanish demand in the fisheries  field. "Norway also refuses to allow foreign investment in its  fishing fleet. This goes completely against the EU's  regulations, so here Norway will have to give in," he said.    On the other hand Spain has no problems with allowing Norway  full duty-free market access for fish and fish products from day  one of membership of the EU, Elorza said. Nor has he heard that  any other EU countries will oppose this, but does not rule out  the possibility that such demands could surface.    The difficult topic of yesterday's negotiations with the  applicant countries was first and foremost the applicants'  demand that parts of their territory should be included among  so-called Objective 1 regions and be allocated funds from the  EU's structural fund. The EU's formal requirement is that the  average income in such regions must not be more than 75 percent  of the EU average. The Commission has proposed that the four  northernmost Norwegian provinces be entitled to support under  this criterion.    Spain takes a very different view and claims that there can  be no suggestion of agreeing to allowing Finnish Lapland and  Norway's four northernmost provinces to receive support under  Objective 1. Francisco Elorza made it crystal clear that Spain  does not intend to allow Objective 1 to "be polluted," as he put  it. "These Norwegian provinces do not meet the requirements."    "But you people in Norway will receive financial support  nevertheless," he said, smiling. "The point is that this  support must be financed via other areas of the EU budget, and  must be called something else. Call it a special program or  something like that," he suggested.    "We in Spain understand extremely well that you have  problems  in your regions, and we want you to receive money. In the years  leading up to 1999 we must find a way to reach a transitional  solution. After that, you will be treated in line with other EU  countries," he stressed several times. His unspoken point is  that Spain is such a major recipient of EU support under  Objective 1 that the country does not want new members to help  themselves to money from this particular fund.    "Remember that here too unanimity is also needed in the EU  if  a joint position is to be reached," he said meaningfully. On  the subject of Norway's demand that it be allowed not to have to  adjust agricultural prices from the first day, he said that this  is something Spain can understand very well. "Here we will  agree to a transitional arrangement. But do not forget one  thing: As far as fruit and vegetables are concerned, Spain is  demanding full duty-free access to Norway from day one of  membership."</p>

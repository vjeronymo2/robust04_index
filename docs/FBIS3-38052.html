			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow  newspapers focus on decisions taken by the lower house of the  Russian parliament on amnesty in connection with the adoption of  the new Russian constitution and on political and economic  amnesty, as well as on the state of the nation speech by Boris  Yeltsin at the Russian parliament.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features the complete text  of both decisions by the lower house. In an article headlined  "Algebra of the Compromise", the same newspaper prints  statistical data on how factions of the lower house voted on  these documents.    The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI newspaper prints an opinion by  presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, saying that  "the decision on the political amnesty is immoral". The same  newspaper also carries an opinion by Yuriy Baturin, the Russian  president's national security assistant, who claims that "the  Duma (eds: lower house) exceeded its powers".    Editor-in-chief of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper Vitaliy  Tretyakov, commenting on the Duma's amnesty decision, holds a  diametrically opposite position. He notes that "no juridical  chicanery can put into doubt the Duma's important political and  psychological victory.    "If the Duma, in compliance with the constitution, has the  right to amnesty both the convicted and those under  investigation, and if it has done so, those who come under the  amnesty should be released. If this does not happen, then the  rights of the Duma and the rights of citizens are infringed  upon."    Commenting on the president's speech at the Russian  parliament on Thursday, the PRAVDA newspaper stresses that the  president's state of the nation address "is interesting due to  the fact that Boris Yeltsin spoke not the customary language of  the Russia's choice movement but the language of those who  consistently opposed the destructive policy imposed by radical  democrats".    ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries a series of comments on the  president's state of the nation speech under the general  headline "Parliament Should Shake the Extended Hand". Most  comments note that "the presidential message is of general  character".    However, they point at the same time to the fact that "most  deputies regard the key points in the presidential message as a  result of adjustments in line with political realities which  changed after the December 12 elections".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls its readers' attention to the  aggravation of relations between Ukraine and the Crimean  Republic, a constituent part of Ukraine, as well as to possible  confrontation inside the Crimean leadership in connection with  Kiev's demand to streamline The Crimean constitution in  compliance with the Ukrainian basic law.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an essay about  Yuliy Khariton, chief designer of the first Soviet atomic bomb,  who will turn 90 on February 27.    Under the title "Stalin's Death", the TRUD newspaper  features  with some abridgments the first part from a hitherto unpublished  chapter of a book by former Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet  Navy Nikolay Kuznetsov who personally knew Stalin for many years.    The chapter describes some almost unknown particulars from  the last days of Stalin's life and other events of that time.    In the section "Essay of Russian Geopolitics", SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIA completes the publication of an analytical article by  Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, the first part  of which was printed in the previous issue.</p>

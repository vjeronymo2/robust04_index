			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF CROSS-BURNING STUDENTS URGED  </P> <P> State park authorities said Thursday that they will call for the prosecution of  each of the 27 University of San Diego fraternity members who participated in a  cross-burning ritual last month that threatened the rare trees of Torrey Pines  State Reserve.  </P> <P> Originally, rangers said they would level misdemeanor charges only against one  or two members of Sigma Chi fraternity -- those considered most responsible for  the act. But, upon further investigation of the incident that occurred on May  20, authorities determined that each participant is equally at fault.  </P> <P> "We feel that everyone who was there shares equal blame," said Jim Van Schmus,  chief ranger for the San Diego Coast District, California Department of Parks  and Recreation. "It was not an individual act, it was a group act."  </P> <P> The rangers are recommending that the city attorney charge each of the 27  participants with two misdemeanor counts: committing a public nuisance, and  building and using an illegal fire on the beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's Up to City Attorney  </P> <P> Van Schmus said the park authorities' report of the incident, including  prosecution recommendations, will be delivered to the city attorney's office  early next week.  </P> <P> "It will be up to the city attorney to review the report and determine if  there's enough evidence to file these charges," Van Schmus said. If such action  is taken, and the fraternity members are found guilty, each participant could  face a maximum sentence of six months in County Jail and/or a maximum fine of  $1,000.  </P> <P> According to authorities, the fraternity members entered the reserve late at  night and planted a wooden cross on an isolated bluff overlooking the beach.  Then, as part of an initiation rite, they ignited the cross, which was wrapped  in bedding material drenched in gasoline.  </P> <P> The cross burning, which fraternity members maintain was not racially motivated  or cult-linked, was quickly condemned by university officials, who have  promised to take disciplinary measures against the group.  </P> <P> Shortly after the incident, Sigma Chi members released a written apology for  their actions. The ritual "was meant to inspire our new associates. Obviously,  the fiery cross, a symbol which Sigma Chi legend states is rooted in a vision  by Roman emperor Constantine, was not a good choice, and we regret our  actions," the apology states. "We now realize that to the public this event can  be perceived in different ways and we have no intentions of ever using it  again." Members told police at the time that initiates make a list of their  faults, then burn the list in the fire of the cross.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doesn't Mean a Lot  </P> <P> The fraternity also apologized for the carelessness in starting a fire in the  natural reserve, which is covered with dry brush and is home to the rare Torrey  Pine tree.  </P> <P> Such apologies, however, did little to placate park authorities.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean a lot to us at this point," Van Schmus said.  </P> <P> "It was offensive to the community, and it interfered with the public enjoyment  and use of Torrey Pines State Reserve. Beyond that, it endangered the plants  and trees of Torrey Pines itself. The action we have taken, speaks for itself,  about how we feel about this incident."  </P></p>

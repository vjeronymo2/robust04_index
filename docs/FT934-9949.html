			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Dollar in focus ENCOURAGING US employment figures at the end of last week are set to underpin the dollar while the D-Mark could experience continued pressure. The release of the non-farm payroll data for October resulted in a choppy performance for the US currency on Friday. But the impact of investors taking profits and squaring their book was exaggerated by thin volumes. Several economists hope the improved job figures will be reinforced by this week's data on producer and consumer prices tomorrow and Wednesday. Also, Friday's retail sales statistics will show how much demand is picking up in the nation's stores. There is a growing feeling that the dollar could hold comfortably between DM1.70 and DM1.7250, which is seen as the next significant resistance point on the way up. It could also gain ground against the yen as the worries over the Japanese economy percolate through to the currency. In the UK, speculation on the Budget and its potential impact on financial markets is likely to increase. Sterling has performed well against the D-Mark and against the index of leading currencies although it has slipped against the dollar. Its strength stems partly from the weakness of the D-Mark as investors decide that the Bundesbank is in rate cutting mood. By contrast there has been a slight drop in expectations of an early UK interest rate cut. Last week there were conflicting signals from the government. On one hand, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attempted to dampen speculation of easier monetary conditions. However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, hinted at the the need for increased taxes. Economists believe that any tax hike will have to be complemented by lower interest rates.</p>

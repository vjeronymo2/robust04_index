			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's rise devalued by low volume Wall Street SHARE prices firmed yesterday, but the strength of the gains was somewhat undermined by the lack of volume in the lightest week of trading this year, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 27.28 higher, at 3,235.91. Big board volume was meagre, 176.6m shares changing hands on the day as advances led declines by 985 to 671. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.95 higher at 405.84, while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.70, at 618.62. On Thursday, the Dow had closed unchanged, at 3,208.63. Equities received some support from the release of the February producer price index. This rose 0.2 per cent, or 0.1 per cent excluding the volatile food and energy components, adding to the picture of a recovering economy. Bonds also posted gains initially on the PPI release, but technical selling pushed yields higher. Pfizer was one of the most active NYSE issues of the day, tumbling Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71 3/8 , as the market registered concern that risks related to the company's Shiley heart valve were higher than previously estimated. Late on Thursday, the Food &amp; Drug Administration asked Pfizer to warn patients that the rate of fracture for some of the valves was as much as five times higher than previously thought. The FDA said that some patients should consider having their implanted valves replaced. Among other heavily-traded big board shares, Dayton Hudson regained some of its Thursday losses by climbing Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 . The stock had fallen Dollars 5 3/4 after the retailer turned in its 1991 results, which included lower operating profits in all three of its divisions. A number of blue chip issues ranked among the most active on the NYSE. These included IBM, Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 89 5/8 , American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 38 1/4 , and Ford Motor, off Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 . General Motors slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 after credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the car maker's senior debt. GM posted a 17.4 per cent increase in early March car sales and a 10.9 per cent rise in truck sales. Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 3/4 , as company directors prepared for a special weekend meeting to find a successor to Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman. Mr Iacocca is due to step down at the end of the year. In the secondary market, high tech and biotech stocks dominated trading. Lotus Development added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 , after an analyst at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock's rating to 'buy' from 'hold'. DDI Pharmaceuticals plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 3 1/4 , after the company said that a phase III study of its bovine superoxide dismutase, to treat osteoarthritis, had showed negligible effectiveness. Canada TORONTO's 300-composite index lost 4.05 points, closing at 3475.79. The index was off about 55 points on the week. Declining issues topped advances by 305 to 223. Volume was 35.1m shares and trading value was CDollars 315.8m. International Corona shot up 80 cents to CDollars 4.95, with about 7.1m shares changing hands. Homestake Mining and Corona said that they had agreed to a business combination through a share exchange, whereby Homestake will offer 0.35 of its shares for each Corona common share.</p>

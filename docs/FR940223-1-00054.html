			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, the adoption of appendix S by reference as a State rule fails to satisfy permitting requirements under subpart I of 40 CFR part 51. In particular, appendix S exempts certain source types and is insufficiently clear on some issues. A letter from USEPA dated May 17, 1991, recommended the following modifications:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The requirement for LAER must apply to all new sources or modifications meeting the applicability requirements of 40 CFR 51.165. Footnotes 4 and 5 must be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Requirements for offsets must be clarified to ensure that offsets are based on actual emissions as defined in 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3). This clarification must also be made in Part IV, section C. Footnote number 7 must be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Footnote 8, which provided an exemption from the requirement for net air quality benefit, must be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section B of Part IV, which exempts certain source types, must be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Section C, paragraph 5, which allows ``banking'' of emissions offset credits, must either be deleted or supplemented with approvable banking regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minnesota has made each of these modifications to its rules. Most of these modifications were included in the rule revisions submitted August 5, 1992. In addition, pursuant to communications from USEPA subsequent to the May 1991 letter, the State made further modifications, including deletion of the general provisions for banking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship to Subsequent Rule Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At present, the rules in the Minnesota SIP governing permit processing are the Consolidated Permit Rules adopted by the State on July 24, 1984, and approved by USEPA on May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033). The subject of today's rulemaking is a supplemental rule known as the ``Offset Rule,'' which establishes the substantive requirements for new sources in nonattainment areas. Minnesota then adopted significant revisions to its regulations on permit processing on August 24, 1993, which it submitted for SIP rulemaking on November 23, 1993. The primary purposes of these regulations were to satisfy requirements in Title V of the Clean Air Act for a State operating permit program and to amend the new source permitting regulations to provide an integrated set of permitting regulations. In developing these regulations, the State incorporated language intended to address various concerns USEPA had identified with respect to the prior permitting rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rulemaking does not address the approvability of the submittal of November 23, 1993. Nevertheless, this latter submittal is germane to this rulemaking, insofar as these more recent revisions assure that certain potential problems which could have arisen under the prior general permitting rules will not arise. It should be noted that the November 1993 submittal does not amend the rules under consideration in this action, i.e. the ``Offset Rule'' submitted by the State in August 1992 and amended in August 1993, but instead revises the general provisions in the Consolidated Permit Rules concerning permit processing. The following paragraphs identify the issues that were of concern and how the November 1993 submittal affects these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first issue was provision in the prior general permitting regulations for expiration of permits, and a concern that expiration of a permit could cause the construction permit conditions to expire. The State's general permitting regulations now define ``Title I conditions'' to include conditions established to satisfy new source review requirements, and state that ``[a]ny Title I condition shall remain in effect without regard to permit expiration or reissuance, and shall be restated in the reissued permit.'' Therefore, USEPA believes that requirements imposed on sources during new source review clearly do not expire as a result of permit expiration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

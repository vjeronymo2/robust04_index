Kubo, appearing on a Fuji Television program, reiterated his  opposition to a cabinet reshuffle designed to remove specific  ministers, alluding to a reported move by Hosokawa and Shinseito  co- leader Ichiro Ozawa to dump Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura.    Hosokawa and his supporters in the seven-party coalition  have  differences with Takemura over Hosokawa's plan to introduce a  so- called "national welfare tax" to replace the consumption  tax, the future of Japanese politics and other key issues,  political sources say.    Kubo said the SDP, the largest force in the seven-party  coalition, is against a cabinet reshuffle before the start of  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program but that it will  not part with the coalition government in protest against a  cabinet shake-up.</p>

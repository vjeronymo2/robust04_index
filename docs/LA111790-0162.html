			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUPLE HONORED FOR SAVING 7 FROM SEA  </P> <P> Local residents Mary and Bob Shackleton were honored Friday by the Coast Guard  for their August, 1989, rescue of seven stranded sailors.  </P> <P> The Shackletons had been heading home from a Sunday afternoon sail to Santa  Catalina Island when they spotted a 40-foot powerboat anchored off Avalon with  smoke coming from the cabin.  </P> <P> As they headed toward the craft, the seven people put on their life vests and  jumped overboard to escape the flames.  </P> <P> "As it turned out, the owner of the boat was an FBI agent and had about 500  rounds of ammunition on board," Mary Shackleton said. "That's why they all got  off the boat so fast."  </P> <P> All seven people escaped unharmed before the "Quentgalic" exploded. The  Shackletons rescued the group from the water and took them to shore while fire  boats battled the blaze.  </P> <P> The Shackletons were awarded the Coast Guard Certificate of Merit at a ceremony  in Long Beach. The award recognizes skill, courage and humanitarianism. LAURA  MICHAELIS  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (2): Telephony broadens cable's appeal - The challenge that the operators face The UK's cable operators are generally called 'cable TV companies'. This is a misnomer, for telephony is almost as important to them as television, and they market the two services hand-in-hand. Indeed, of the three largest cable operators in the UK, one - Nynex - is a regional Bell phone company in the US, while the other two - Telewest and Bell Cablemedia - are joint ventures between telecommunications and cable operators. The confusion is explained partly by the fact that telephony came later than television. Until 1991, telephony in the UK was a duopoly between British Telecommunications and Mercury, a rival to BT set up in 1982. One of the principal aims behind the abolition of the duopoly was the promotion of competition in local phone services by encouraging cable operators to lay telephone wires down the same ducts as their TV cables. Mercury's network is for long-distance traffic, and relied on BT for local access to all but a small number of very large users. To further encourage the cable companies, the government banned BT from using its existing network to offer broadcast entertainment services to the residential market. Those two steps - the BT ban and the abolition of the duopoly - made cable investment a far more attractive commercial proposition than previously. But most of the cable operators were surprised at the take-off of cable telephony. At the beginning of September, the cable operators had sold 534,000 telephone lines, about 54,000 of them business lines and the rest residential. That compared with 745,000 cable TV subscribers. Some cable operators now boast more telephone than TV subscribers. Nynex, the second largest operator, claims that 25 per cent of the homes it has passed in its Portsmouth franchise now take cable telephone, against 22 per cent taking cable TV. A year ago, 58 per cent of new customers were taking both products; now it is up to 70 per cent. The social make-up of cable customers is changing too. When cable was clearly TV-led, it had strongest appeal in areas of low-income housing where the extra TV channels were particularly popular. Telephony is broadening cable's appeal. 'At the prosperous end of the demographic continuum we are now selling well above average,' says Mr Peter Lynch, Nynex's director of residential marketing. Sales are below average among older residents, 'but it is a more a concern about change, not a clear socio-economic divide,' he believes. BT is clearly worried by the success of cable companies in luring away some of its more affluent customers. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, brands cable the most serious of BT's competitors for the medium and long term. 'Whereas with Mercury we lose the long-distance revenue but keep the line connection, with the cable companies we lose that too - and with it the opportunity to sell and market all our services.' BT has set up 'cable defence' teams to target urban areas where cable companies are building their networks. It has also launched a high-profile campaign to secure a lifting of the entertainment ban, claiming that it could generate local cable monopolies unless lifted soon. BT executives are also concerned that BT cannot vary its prices regionally, fearing that as price competition intensifies BT will be disabled by the requirement to charge the same for a local call in Portsmouth as in the Scottish Highlands. However, the 'cable threat' needs to be put in perspective. BT has 27m lines and 85 per cent of the UK's telecoms market. It is currently adding new lines at a faster rate than the cable companies: its net monthly growth is running at about 60,000 lines against 40,000 for the cable companies. BT has a mobile phone offshoot, Cellnet, which alone has 1.2m subscribers - more than twice as many as all the cable phone users put together. Furthermore, the entertainment ban is unlikely to endure indefinitely. The House of Commons trade and industry select committee recently urged the government to set a firm date of 2002 for lifting the ban. Even the Cable Television Association accepts that the cable industry has little to gain from continued uncertainty. 'BT is in a very strong position, which is not seriously jeopardised by the cable operators,' says Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the brokers. BT trades heavily on its customer service, which is generally accepted to be good. By contrast, some cable operators have had serious teething troubles with their billing and fault-repair systems. Even fiercer price competition may work to BT's advantage: as the price differential between BT and its rivals falls, so does the incentive for customers to switch from one supplier to another. Already, price differentials are often small, especially for long-distance calls. Straight price comparisons are problematic, given the multiplicity of cable operators. But generally speaking, while cable line rental charges are lower than for BT, and local charges cheaper, the price of long-distance calls is not much different between cable and Mercury using a BT connection. In some franchises long-distance calls are actually cheaper if made by Mercury via a BT line than by cable. Tariff sheets resemble railway timetables, so only the most dedicated of residential customers will be inclined or able to work out such differences. For most customers, headline savings are all. For now, cable company claims that they are around 10 to 15 per cent cheaper for a typical BT phone bill appear to be holding sway, but they may not continue to do so. The challenge for the cable companies is to become more than a 'cheap BT' as telecoms suppliers. On the residential side, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services across telecoms wires are being tested, with operators promising commercial services in the near future. But dates are vague, and precise prices for such services have yet to be revealed. At the outset cable operators concentrated on the residential market, where joint marketing of TV and telephony appeared to have most to offer. They are now taking the business sector seriously. London's operators have come together in a 'London Interconnect' consortium, and offer city-wide datacoms services. Videotron, which holds a telephony franchise in Westminster and City, has launched a desk-top television/information service, upgrading PCs with a special card to give users access to TV and information databases on their screens. But the corporate sector is the fiercest part of the telecoms market, with a host of new operators - most of them US-owned - building networks and offering services. At least in the residential sector the cable companies have only BT to fight.</p>

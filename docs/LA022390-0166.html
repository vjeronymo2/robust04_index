			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH AIDE TAKES JAB AT LAWYERS  </P> <P> President Bush's press secretary gave a lighthearted tongue-lashing today to  the nation's lawyers, saying they "deserve all the criticism they can get."  </P> <P> Marlin Fitzwater made his comment at his regular daily briefing when a reporter  asked if Bush was criticizing lawyers when he said in a Baltimore speech  Thursday that the government would help "restore common sense and fairness to  America's medical malpractice system."  </P> <P> Fitzwater, who is not a lawyer, said, "Lawyers certainly deserve all the  criticism they can get."  </P> <P> Asked if Bush, also a non-lawyer, shared his feelings, Fitzwater laughingly  said: "Those are universally held feelings by everyone who's ever dealt with  the legal establishment. . . . I'm sure all my good friends who are lawyers  understand."  </P> <P> Fitzwater, who is divorced and recently closed on a new house, did not explain  the basis of his feelings.  </P></p>

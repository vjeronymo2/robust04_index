			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELBY STEELE ON PREFERENCE  </P> <P> The commentary on affirmative action programs by Shelby Steele ("The High Price  of Preference," Bookmark, Opinion, Sept. 30) was especially disturbing in that  it rehashes the old stereotypical racist view that affirmative action programs  promote the hiring of less competent minority workers at the expense of more  qualified whites. As a personnel specialist in public sector hiring, I can  assure the readers that we are choosing from equally unqualified candidates.  </P> <P> JONATHAN DOUWE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

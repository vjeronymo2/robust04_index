			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / John Elliott charged with Pounds 30m theft: Australian federal authorities launch prosecutions against two of the country's leading businessmen Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former head of the Elders IXL brewing and agribusiness group, was yesterday charged with two counts of theft, involving ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 30m), and with conspiring to disguise the theft under the guise of two fictitious foreign exchange transactions. He was freed on ADollars 450,000 bail. Similar charges were brought against Mr Kenneth Jarrett and Mr Peter Camm, two other former Elders IXL executives. Mr Jarrett was charged with theft and conspiracy, Mr Camm with conspiracy only. Both were also granted bail. The charges were served hours after a High Court judge refused to grant a temporary injunction barring the National Crime Authority and the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions from bringing a criminal case against Mr Elliott. Mr Elliott, who vehemently denies any wrongdoing, has successfully kept injunctions in place for several months, arguing that the NCA had overstepped its authority in pursuing these matters and alleging that he had become the victim of a political conspiracy. Last month, however, a federal court decided to lift the injunctions, and the full federal court then rejected Mr Elliott's application to appeal. This meant that the High Court became Mr Elliott's last hope - and that was dashed by Justice Gaudron's ruling yesterday. The charges relate to two foreign exchange transactions between Elders and the Bank of New Zealand, and then between the Bank of New Zealand and companies connected to executives of Equiticorp, the failed New Zealand-based group, in 1988. The transactions resulted in losses to Elders of ADollars 39.5m and ADollars 27m respectively, and similar gains to the Equiticorp-related companies. The authorities allege that these were ficticious deals, designed to funnel money from Elders to Mr Allan Hawkins, Equiticorp's now-jailed former chief executive, or to companies connected with him. When yesterday's High Court decision became known, Mr Elliott - a former president of the Australian Liberal party - quickly reasserted his innocence. 'The contest for justice is far from over and will continue,' he said in Melbourne, adding that he 'rejected the charges, whatever they are'. But when the three men later appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court to seek bail, one lawyer for a prosecution witness described the charges as 'one of the largest cases of theft ever to come before an Australian court'. He claimed that Mr Elliott had been the 'linchpin' in the two transactions, and Mr Jarrett, a 'major player'. Mr Elliott was remanded to reappear for a committal hearing on April 14 next year. The other two men were also bailed to reappear next April, with bail for Mr Jarrett set at ADollars 450,000 and at ADollars 225,000 for Mr Camm.</p>

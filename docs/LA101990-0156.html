			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS: STAYING ON CAN HELP EX-OWNER AND FIRM  </P> <P> Five years after Ed Kramar and his partners founded Cypress Electronics in  Santa Clara, they knew that they needed more cash to expand their wholesale  electronics distribution firm. They borrowed some money, then began casting  about for a buyer, figuring that they would stay on or go, depending on who  bought the company.  </P> <P> In 1985, Cypress agreed to be acquired for $4 million by Brajdas Corp., a  public company based in Woodland Hills. Kramar agreed to stay on as president  and asked his attorney to draft what is known in the world of mergers and  acquisitions as an earnout agreement.  </P> <P> Under an earnout agreement, the seller accepts a lump sum up front, and more  cash down the road, with the amount usually pegged to the company's future  profits.  </P> <P> As small-business owners find venture capital and private funding sources more  difficult to tap, financial advisers familiar with earnouts predict that they  will greatly increase in popularity.  </P> <P> "An earnout fills the gap in price between the buyer and the seller," said Gary  Mendoza, an attorney who specializes in mergers and acquisitions for Riordan  &amp; McKinzie in Los Angeles. In a well-drafted earnout, the buyer of a  growing company benefits by having to put up less cash in the beginning. The  earnout agreement also keeps key people around for a few years, increasing the  chance of a smooth transition. Most earnouts serve as an incentive for the  previous owners to work hard -- because their future compensation is hinged to  the company's profit.  </P> <P> Advisers caution that earnouts don't work for everyone, especially  strong-willed entrepreneurs who would bristle at taking orders from new owners.  Because there are so many legal and accounting factors, an earnout agreement  should be written by experts.  </P> <P> It should also include ways to undo the agreement if the deal doesn't seem to  be working out.  </P> <P> "You should have an unwind provision that specifies whether the seller gets the  company back -- and at what price -- if things don't work out," said Mendoza.  "If you sold good goods, you don't want to buy back bad goods."  </P> <P> Cypress' Kramar asked Brajdas to reduce his earnout agreement from three years  to two because he was facing certain ethical dilemmas related to the future of  the company's operations.  </P> <P> For example, Kramar said, he was torn between spending money to hire people and  open new offices to bring in new business, or cutting back on expenses to  improve the company's profitability. If he cut expenses, he could increase the  amount of money he would receive under the earnout agreement.  </P> <P> "But what might have been the best for me personally was not the best thing for  the company," Kramar said.  </P> <P> Allan Klein, chief financial officer of Brajdas, said the ethical situation  that Kramar was in illustrates a problems with earnouts. The buyer must be  careful to structure the deal so that the earnout does not interfere with the  company's growth.  </P> <P> But overall, Klein said, Brajdas is pleased with the way the Cypress earnout  has worked, especially since Kramar is still part of the management team three  years after the earnout expired. Kramar currently receives a salary and a  percentage of the profits.  </P> <P> "We were very fortunate that the former owners wanted to be part of a growth  scenario," said Klein, who was responsible for presenting the former owners  with monthly financial reports. Today, Cypress Electronics is one of three  divisions of Brajdas, which had 1990 annual sales of $58 million and about 165  employees.  </P> <P> For Kramar personally, the first year after selling out was the hardest.  "Before the sale, if I wanted to spend $200,000, I just did it," he said. After  the sale, he had to ask the new president for his approval on major issues,  although day-to-day operations were left to Kramar.  </P> <P> "If we had sold the company to a more hands-on person, I probably wouldn't have  lasted more than a year," admitted Kramar.  </P> <P> Because earnouts are complex legal agreements, they are best drafted by a  skilled attorney working with a good tax accountant. The accountant must  consider all the tax ramifications of the lump sum payment and be sure the  future compensation package is structured to give his or her client the best  tax advantages.  </P> <P> "Most earnouts are set up to last between two and five years," said Robert  Untracht, the partner in charge of the diversified industries group at Ernst  &amp; Young in Century City. Untracht, an attorney and a CPA, has structured  several earnout agreements for big and small companies.  </P> <P> Even the most well-written agreements can end in disaster if buyers and sellers  have different ideas about how the company should be run. There also tend to be  more problems when the seller is given a big chunk of cash up front and a  paltry compensation package. With this approach, there is little incentive for  the former owner to stay on and work hard.  </P> <P> UP FOR AN EARNOUT?  </P> <P> Before considering an earnout agreement, ask yourself these questions:  </P> <P> * Will you be able to relinquish control and work with the new owner?  </P> <P> * Are you willing to accept part of the sales price up front and the rest at a  future date?  </P> <P> * Will you be motivated to keep working after you put the initial payment in  the bank?  </P> <P> * Would you want the company back if the arrangement doesn't work out to your  satisfaction?  </P> <P> * Can you find a skilled accountant and attorney to draft an earnout agreement?  </P></p>

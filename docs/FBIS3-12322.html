A responsible source at the Bahraini Ministry of Foreign  Affairs has described this massacre as a terrorist act and held  the Israeli Government and its security organs fully responsible  for the terrorist acts these terrorist settlers carry out, which  violate all international laws, norms, and charters and endanger  the comprehensive, just, and lasting peace process in the region.    The source called on the international community and the UN  Security Council, particularly its permanent members, to fully  assume their responsibilities toward this act by not just  denouncing and condemning it but by taking measures to protect  the Palestinian people and secure their legitimate right to the  establishment of their independent state on their national soil.</p>

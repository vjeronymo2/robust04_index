			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Pakistan raises drug penalties PAKISTAN last night announced a new law introducing the death penalty as the maximum punishment for drug traffickers. The minimum punishment was also raised from two years to life imprisonment. The move came ahead of next Wednesday's national elections. At least eight tribal elders from the rugged Northern Frontier region have been barred from the contest amid allegations of their involvement in production and trafficking of heroin. Islamabad has also stepped up an initiative to extradite at least 16 drug barons wanted in the US on drug-related charges. A government announcement after a cabinet meeting in Islamabad, chaired by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister, said: 'These enhanced punishments provide the much needed legal framework to effectively deal with the narcotics traffickers and their associates who have proliferated drugs in Pakistan and have seriously eroded Pakistan's prestige abroad.' The campaign against drug barons is a response to concerns from the US, Canada and Europe that Pakistan has become an important conduit for heroin trafficking. Most heroin leaving Pakistan is produced in the semi-autonomous Northern Frontier tribal belt, from opium grown in nearby Afghanistan.</p>

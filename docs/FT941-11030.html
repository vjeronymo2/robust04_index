			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / BNF in studies on Thorp successor British Nuclear Fuels is already carrying out research into a possible successor to the long-delayed Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, which faces a final challenge at the High Court in London today. The state-owned company said: 'Like any international company that leads its field, we're looking into new technologies as they progress, but we are not planning a second Thorp plant and not designing anything.' Thorp is designed to operate for at least 25 years but it is based on research done in the 1960s and 1970s. The process of designing, planning, building and commissioning the plant has taken almost 20 years - delayed partly by strong opposition from environmental campaigners. The last move in that opposition takes place at the High Court today when Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, and Lancashire County Council seek a judicial review of the government's decision to allow Thorp to start operating. The challengers say there should be a new public inquiry.</p>

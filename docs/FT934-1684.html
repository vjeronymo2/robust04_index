			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The west and Zhirinovsky If any good comes out of the electoral triumph of the ultra-nationalist Russian right in last weekend's elections, it will be because it finally focuses the minds of Russia's reformers and their western backers. For, while the reform parties squabbled, while President Boris Yeltsin remained aloof and the western governments kept their distance, Vladimir Zhirinovsky was hard at work. He cleverly played on the electorate's fears about the threat of unemployment, rising lawlessness and loss of self-esteem. What should the west and its institutions do next? It was bad enough for International Monetary Fund officials to monitor progress and lend money when a supposedly pro-reformist government was in place. But now, with the complexion of the post-election government still unknown and the president's commitment to future reform uncertain, the dangerous temptation is to wait and see. What they should do is to act. First, they can recognise that the rules of the reform game have changed. The grave threat of a further boost to extremist politics if reform is perceived to make things worse over the next year means that a substantial rise in open unemployment is now politically intolerable. The standard IMF strategy of stabilisation, withdrawal of subsidies to state industries and the establishment of a social safety net to catch the casualties is now too risky for anyone other than the most apolitical reformer to contemplate. Indeed, anything which even smells of an IMF-run austerity programme is almost certainly off Mr Yeltsin's agenda. Pointed criticism US vice-president Al Gore has already got this message. In Moscow, yesterday, his pointed criticism of the failure of IMF officials to be sensitive to the effects of harsh budget cuts on individual Russians suggested a sharp change in western rhetoric. But, as US Treasury officials will well understand, it is important that the west does not throw out the baby with the bathwater. The IMF may be a convenient scapegoat for lack of progress so far. But to suggest, as Mr Gore also did, that Russia should abandon rapid reform is badly misguided. Too little reform, not too much, is the reason for the persistently miserable performance of the Russian economy over the past year. Rapid inflation remains a significant obstacle to private sector expansion and foreign investment as well as a tax on Russian citizens. Lack of progress on land and financial sector reform are other impediments. The IMF can be criticised for taking an over-bureaucratic approach to conditionality and for failing to provide the Russians with sufficient technical support. But it is the Russian government that must take most of the blame for the lack of progress. Fascist advance Western leaders cannot afford, for their own security as well as Russia's, to allow Mr Yeltsin to abandon the reformist road. Without action to slow credit creation, hyperinflation is inevitable. Without structural reform, the growth of new private employment will remain stunted. Without a legal system, the power of illegal racketeers will grow. In short, without rapid reform the conditions for a further fascist advance will emerge. The west can help stabilisation to occur and reform to progress without the kind of open unemployment seen in Poland since 1989. It can do so by enabling the government to replace inflationary bank credits to loss-making industries with non-inflationary western credits. These should be released through a new G7 agency, rather than via the IMF. These credits should be made conditional on market-oriented reform as well as continued stabilisation and, as far as possible, they should be time-limited and linked to restructuring of specific enterprises. If China's success contains a lesson for Russia, it is not - as Mr Gore appears to believe - that gradualism works but, instead, that radical reform to encourage the growth of the non-state sector is consistent with apparently wasteful but politically essential subsidies for inefficient state industries. The west has not yet had time to gauge fully the implications of Mr Zhirinovsky's success. But the G7 has no alternative but to act while it can.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Contracts infuriate depot drivers: As commuters across Britain face widespread disruption, FT writers assess the strategies of the unions DRIVERS at a north London bus depot yesterday accused managers of blackmail as they prepared for a one-day strike over new working conditions. Although many of the drivers at the Holloway depot have accepted new employment contracts from London Buses, they said there was no contradiction in taking strike action over the terms. 'It was legalised blackmail the way they forced us as individuals to accept these new contracts,' said Mr Clive Reid, who has driven buses in London for 26 years. 'It was a case of you could keep your job if you accepted the new contract and if you do not you are out. We accepted the contracts as individuals but this is collective action to try and persuade the management to come to the table and renegotiate the contracts.' During the two 24-hour bus stoppages last month all but one of the depot's 374 staff withdrew their labour. There has been equally strong backing for the latest strike call. The one man who crossed the picket line, and who is expected to work today, has not accepted the new contract and is on notice of dismissal. 'He is like that,' said Mr Vic Hawkins, a colleague.</p>

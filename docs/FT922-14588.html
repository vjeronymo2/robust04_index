			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Management: Getting directors on board - The deliberations on the Cadbury Committee Corporate governance is all about finding ways to make companies run better. But while the virtues of good governance are as controversial as apple pie and motherhood, the mechanics are another matter. 'Boards of directors must have the freedom to drive their companies forward, but within a framework of accountability.' So says the opening paragraph of the latest draft of a report on corporate governance from Sir Adrian Cadbury's Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance. Yet maintaining a board's vitality while ensuring that it is answerable to its shareholders is not easy. There are wide disagreements among the affected parties as to the best way forward. Sir Adrian's committee, which bears his name, has been grappling with just that for nearly a year. In addition to the Accounting Standards Board, the accountancy profession and the London Stock Exchange which sponsored the committee, its members come from the Institute of Directors, the Bank of England, the Institutional Shareholders Committee, the 100 Committee of Finance Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and academics. What distinguishes this committee from others is that it represents all the affected parties. And each has its own goal. Jonathan Charkhom, the Bank of England's man on the committee, says: 'The Bank has a natural interest in the strength of British industry. We so often see the results of bad corporate governance.' The stock exchange and the ISC say their goals are to improve the information for shareholders, while the IOD would like to find a framework that is as loose as possible for better board governance. A final version of the committee's recommendations is due in late May; Sir Adrian fears the public may be expecting far more than the report will deliver. For one thing, it will not address the headline-grabbing issue of executive pay, except to suggest that best practice is to disclose it. 'Executive pay is part of the much bigger question of board accountability,' Sir Adrian said. He claims that despite the disparate membership, there have been no significant disagreements. However, private conversations with members suggest another story. While most members agree that 'prescriptive' solutions are impractical, some clearly favour greater regulation than others. Perhaps unusually for a such a committee, none of its discussions have yet been aired publicly. However, it is expected that the final report will include A code of practice for directors. A suggestion that audit and remuneration committees consist entirely of non-executive directors - a requirement which would force listed companies to have at least two non-executives. A requirement to disclose all non-auditing functions performed by the auditing firm for a fee. A recommendation that directors terms be three years at most A new stock exchange listing requirement which would force companies to disclose the extent to which they comply with best practice recommendations. The last of these is, according to Sir Adrian, the guarantee that the report will effect change. 'I believe standards need to be raised,' he said. 'I have no interest in just producing another piece of paper.' But privately, some groups of institutional shareholders have dismissed the listing requirement as falling short of what is needed. The Institutional Shareholders Committee, for instance, has called for disclosure of directors' performance-related pay and some of its more hard-line members want that disclosure to be a requirement of stock exchange listing. That view is also likely to be supported by the Institutional Fund Managers Association. However, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the stock exchange, argues that 'directors' pay is not in my view a great issue'. There is no need, he says, to require companies to place remuneration packages before shareholders at annual general meetings or even to make their disclosure a listing requirement. Simply requiring companies to explain their failure to disclose key bits of information is sanction enough, he argues. 'If companies are coming under criticism from shareholders, they don't like to be seen as different from other companies,' he says. Sir Andrew dismisses suggestions from some committee members that it was concern for the stock exchange's competitive standing - the fear that it would be unable to attract foreign companies for listing - that led him to that stance. Indeed, he says, it was the desire to improve disclosure to shareholders that led the stock exchange to urge the committee's formation in the first place. Sir Adrian says that he believes the committee's most important work lies in the area of financial reporting. The largest part of the report will deal with directors' responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of information contained in financial accounts. 'There is a financial tag to everything which happens in a company. We have concentrated on the obligation to report and the accountability which goes with that,' he says. A third draft of the report, currently circulating to members, is nearly 40 pages long with appendices. The Confederation of British Industry, whose members will be most directly affected by the recommendations, is pressing within the committee for no recommendation of any specific board structure, nor any requirement for minimum numbers of non-executive directors. The arguments against regulation are those with which Sir Adrian has expressed sympathy. 'My view is that prescriptive solutions do not work,' he said. Furthermore, even requiring set numbers of non-executive directors is no guarantee that they will be of sufficient quality. That view is echoed by Blynth Jenkins, director of corporate affairs at the IOD. 'If one was to impose a code of practice by regulation, it would stifle enterprise and innovation,' he argues. The desire to reach a consensus may account for the committee's reluctance to get tough on disclosure or other thorny issues. For many of the measures proposed by others on the committee are opposed by the CBI - seen as the main constituency for the report's final conclusions. The CBI opposes proposals to expand the auditing functions, to ban auditors from performing non-auditing services or to disclose the terms of directors' service contracts. Some of the thorniest questions raised in committee meetings relate to the role of non-executive directors and whether granting them any special monitoring or oversight role undermines the concept of the so-called unitary board. While two-tiered boards are common practice in the European Community, unitary boards giving equal responsibility to all directors are favoured on both sides of the Atlantic. While the committee has rejected any departure from the unitary board - the CBI and the Institute of Directors remain concerned about the the role of non-executive directors. 'If you give non-execs a policing function, are you not admitting two-tiered boards as a de facto situation?' Jenkins asks. The CBI agrees: 'We believe that a single-tier structure with no legal or formal distinction between the role and duties of executive and non-executive directors makes it clear where responsibilities lie; with the board both collectively and individually'. In its last few weeks, the committee is going to have to grapple with the question of how boards must be structured to enable them to police themselves.</p>

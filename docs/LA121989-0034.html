			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALUMNI HELP YOUTH SYMPHONY MARK ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> After 25 years together Mehli Mehta and the American Youth Symphony offer few  surprises. Their concerts are predictably well-played and enthusiastically  delivered and much more than your average rehashing of symphonic masterpieces.  The Sunday night concert in Royce Hall, UCLA, part of the orchestra's  anniversary celebrations, was no exception, with highly accomplished, vital  readings of familiar music before a large and appreciative audience.  </P> <P> While one must be impressed by the orchestra's continued high technical  standard, it is Mehta's interpretations that lend these concerts more than  passing interest. Sunday he conducted the entire concert from memory, and all  of the music flowed with the naturalness and authority of his long association  with it.  </P> <P> The evening's big symphonic work was Cesar Franck's Symphony in D minor. In his  own program notes, Mehta revealed his strong identification with this music,  and his performance bore this out. He gave its fervent, mystical language full  sway, with unforced but dramatic pacing and lavish phrasing. He brought out its  rich colorings by enforcing clear textures and subtle dynamic shadings.  Climaxes were massive and momentous. The orchestra played with exuberance and  conviction, and if the brass proved overenthusiastic on occasion, they erred on  the side of intensity.  </P> <P> The first half of the program presented two AYS alumni and a current member as  soloists. Harpist Marcia Dickstein confidently took on the solo duties for  Ravel's Introduction and Allegro. Her technical ease and sure sense of line  gave clear direction to the music, while Mehta and his players were elegant  though urgent in support.  </P> <P> Ex-concertmaster David Stenske, now a free-lance musician, and ex-principal  violist Richard Elegino, now with the L.A. Philharmonic, were featured in  Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364. They proved directly communicative,  unfussy soloists, particularly effective in their warm, singing account of the  Andante. Mehta and orchestra gave the accompaniment a joyous reading with  bright accents and emphatic outlines.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

Perry in Moscow, </F> comprising report by Aleksandr Khokhlov and report by Leonid  Krutakov and Dmitriy Kulik under the general heading: "The  Russian Army Will be Getting Patrons From the United States"]    [Text] [Khokhlov report] After the talks in Moscow with  U.S. Defense Secretary W. Perry, Pavel Grachev said that Russia  could join the NATO "Partnership For Peace" program at the end  of the month. But, as might have been expected, there are many  difficulties and provisos.    Grachev was not very complimentary about the NATO  "Partnership For Peace" program in his conversation with his  U.S. colleague.    In the very near future, Pavel Grachev said, Russia will be  presenting to NATO (and to the United States as well, of course)  its "amendments" to the "Partnership," to the effect that it  does not wish to and cannot sacrifice its geopolitical interests  to the interests of other states.    When Russia will be submitting its proposals on  implementation of the NATO program the Russian Federation  defense minister did not specify.    After a reasonably brief conversation in the company of  others, Grachev and Perry withdrew. The word is that the  ministers went through the Ukrainian nuclear weapons situation  and Russia's geopolitical problems in the Caucasus and Central  Asia with a fine-tooth comb.    [Krutakov and Kulik report] According to senior Pentagon  officials accompanying W. Perry, the "Partnership" program will  develop in two basic areas: U.S. assistance in the conversion  of the Russian defense industry and the creation of private  Russian-American joint ventures based on Russian  military-industrial complex enterprises. One promising area is  the closure of research laboratories and curtailment of  scientific studies in Russia as no longer needed, for example,  in the nuclear weapons sphere. It was stressed that the United  States will get access to the Russian market and Russia will get  goods.    It is a tempting prospect, particularly as the Americans are  promising assistance in the construction of housing for  discharged Russian servicemen. But it looks very much like  one-way traffic. For example, Pentagon representatives did not  explain why the program does not provide for the establishment  of joint enterprises based on U.S. military-industrial complex  plants. And asked why the rate of conversion last year was 68  percent in Russia compared with three percent in the United  States, the answer was that in the United States conversion  problems are linked to the problem of employment. In this  context, it would be more logical to call the "partnership"  "patronage."    We are not calling for a return to the days of the cold war.  But, to use William Perry's expression, Russian and the United  States are acting simultaneously as partners and rivals within  the framework of the new program.    Until recently U.S. assistance to Russia took the form of a  few inspection tours of Russian military-industrial complex  enterprises and nuclear centers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Song Ning: "Agriculture Needs Overseas </F> Cash"]    [Text] Agricultural technology is the most favoured form  of overseas investment sought by the government.    Technology is required for high yield seeds, animal feed,  low-poison pesticides, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery,  said Lin Kun, deputy director general of the Foreign Investment  Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation.    Lin revealed the government's list of overseas investment  priorities on Tuesday.    Other areas which need foreign cash include infrastructure,  high technology development, export production, and know-how to  recycle industrial waste.    So far, China has approved 186,062 foreign-funded  enterprises, with an accumulated contractual investment of  $241.5 billion. The actual foreign investment amounted to $67.2  billion since 1978, Lin said.    In the first three months of this year, overseas investors  pledged $19.6 billion in 11,834 projects. And more than $5.4  billion flooded into the country during this period.    Foreign companies have been keen to enter the vast and  rapidly developing Chinese market.    And numerous multinationals have made long-term investment  plans in China. They include General Electric, American  Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and Ford of the United  States; Northern Telecom of Canada; Matsushita, Nippon Electric  Corporation, Mitsui and Company Limited, and C. Itoh of Japan;  Citroen of France; Volkswagen and Siemens of Germany; Royal  Dutch Shell of Britain; Philips of Holland; and Ciba-Geigy of  Switzerland.    Eighty of the top 500 companies ranked by Fortune magazine,  have invested in China.    "We will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in sectors  like infrastructure, basic industries, technical renovation, and  capital and technology-intensive industries," Lin said.    Special government approval is needed to invest in banking,  insurance, securities, retail sales, foreign trade, audio-visual  products, printing and publication, and air cargo service.    And overseas firms are barred from running enterprises which  affect social security and national economic development, those  that pollute the environment, as well as those which mine  radioactive minerals. They are also prohibited from running  posts and telecommunications services, radio and television  stations, newspapers, and enterprises producing military goods.    "We encourage foreigners to invest in existing Chinese  enterprises and produce goods for Chinese and foreign markets,"  Lin said.    "The vast Chinese market is open for foreign-funded  enterprises provided they can balance their foreign exchange  earnings and expenditure."    Besides agricultural technology, China also needs overseas  funds for projects like energy, transport, and raw material  production.    It will invite foreign firms to take part in the  construction  and management of power plants, highways, bridges, ports the  development of coal products and coal mining equipment.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING / KIRBY LEE;  </P> <P> CITY, OPERATOR AT ODDS OVER LENGTH OF PERMIT TO STAGE RACES IN PARK  </P> <P> To Larry Hoffman, Weddington Park South in North Hollywood is the perfect place  to hold a BMX race.  </P> <P> It is accessible by freeway; it is bordered by the Los Angeles River, the  Hollywood Freeway and a dead-end street to insulate it from noise complaints;  and it is located in a depression out of the neighborhood's view.  </P> <P> Herb Grade agrees, and the L. A. Recreation and Parks Department supervisor  actually encouraged Hoffman to apply for a permit to use the park, located near  Universal Studios.  </P> <P> That much is clear, but the picture becomes cloudy when both sides discuss  duration. Hoffman says the permit was for a year while Grade claims it was for  a weekend.  </P> <P> With the help of volunteers, Hoffman began grading the land three weeks ago and  the track was almost completed last Monday when his phone rang.  </P> <P> It was Martin Castillo, a maintenance supervisor for the city, informing  Hoffman that his application had been voided after Councilman John Ferraro,  whose Fourth District includes the site, expressed concern over the development  over the park.  </P> <P> Mary Presby, field deputy for Ferraro, said that her office received "numerous  complaints" from residents in the area concerning noise and construction at the  venue, which had been designated as a passive park and was not zoned for  development.  </P> <P> "There was a misunderstanding and the Recreation and Parks thought it was going  to be for a weekend," Presby said. "There is no way we can give up land without  a contract."  </P> <P> Said Grade: "My understanding was that it was it was going to be a one-shot  deal and when his application came in with one year on it, there was no way it  could be approved. We grant one-day or weekend permits for carnivals and  similar events despite the possibility of complaints. There's a big difference  in holding title for the park and using it for a day.  </P> <P> "It's just a comedy of errors. He had one thing in mind and did not  communicate."  </P> <P> Hoffman, who lives in North Hollywood and owns a bicycle shop there, agreed  that he initially considered holding one weekend race in the park, but insists  that Grade knew his application was going to be for a year and proposed the  yearlong lease.  </P> <P> "I still want a track somewhere," said Hoffman, who added that he has received  close to 100 inquiries about the status of the track, which was scheduled to  open in September. "I don't care if I run it or if the city runs it. I'm not  into it to make a dollar."  </P> <P> Blowin' in the wind: Don Carey, 61, of Camarillo placed third in the  40-kilometer time trial at the recent Masters national championships in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Carey, who won the race in 1987 and holds the national record in the event  (58:24, set in 1988), experienced difficulty with the winds and the hills on  the out-and-back San Diego course. He finished in 1:04.47, 90 seconds behind  winner William McClosky of Sacramento.  </P> <P> Carey is preparing for the World Senior Games in St. George, Utah, in October.  He will compete in the 40-kilometer time trial.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Ron Skarin of Van Nuys and Eric Hollander of Marina del Rey set  the one-hour world record for distance in a human-powered vehicle in 1980 at  Ontario Speedway.  </P> <P> The duo, beginning from a standing start, covered 46 miles, 537 yards in a  fiberglass-enclosed tandem, recumbent bicycle.  </P> <P> What is the record for maximum speed in an HPV?  </P> <P> Face lift: If all goes as planned, Encino Velodrome won't be just for cycling  anymore.  </P> <P> The Southern California Cycling Federation, which owns and operates the  nonprofit velodrome, submitted a $725,000-plus renovation proposal two weeks  ago to the Amateur Athletic Foundation.  </P> <P> The AAF was created to disburse surplus revenue from the 1984 Olympics. It also  sponsors classes at the velodrome.  </P> <P> Included in the wide-ranging proposal were resurfacing of the existing track  and construction of a roller-hockey and speed-skating rink. Construction of  locker-room facilities and renovation of the snack bar also were proposed.  </P> <P> The AAF has expressed interest in the project and has agreed to provide  matching funds. Cycling federation President Sandy Bevan said she is hoping to  find corporate sponsorship by October to claim the AAF funds and have the  improvements completed for next season.  </P> <P> "It's all starting to come together," Bevan said of the proposal, researched  and formulated in large part by Dan Clinger, an architect who donated his time  to the project.  </P> <P> "(With the improvements), it would become an easy access cross-training  facility. We'd be able to get much more use from the facility than is presently  conceivable."  </P> <P> Family affair: The Clinger family made respectable showings at the junior  national championships in San Diego recently.  </P> <P> David, 12, buoyed by a third-place finish in the points race, finished seventh  in the omnium, which also included the 500- and 2,000-meter time trials and  match sprints.  </P> <P> Dan Jr., 15, placed sixth and seventh in the 500- and 2,000-meter time trials  and Jennifer, 13, was seventh in the 500-meter time trial.  </P> <P> At the Tour of the Future in Bisbee, Ariz. last week, David placed seventh in  the six-day, six stage, 135-mile race for ages 13-16.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Fred Markham of Aptos, Calif., reached a speed of 65.484 m.p.h.  on a level course, unpaced and unaided by wind, at Big Sandflat, Calif., in  1986 on a 31-pound recumbent bicycle. The cycle was enclosed to reduce wind  resistance and the frame was constructed out of lightweight titanium and  aluminum.  </P> <P> Markham took approximately two miles to build up to top speed.  </P> <P> Add juniors: Katie Beck, 17, of Simi Valley finished third in the 2,000-meter  time trial and fourth in the match sprints and points race at the junior  nationals.  </P> <P> Beck, a Simi Valley High senior who rides for the Quick Release Bicycle Club,  also placed fifth in the individual pursuit and 40-kilometer road race and  sixth in the criterium.  </P> <P> Scott Skellenger, 17, of Thousand Oaks, winner of the Moreno Valley criterium  last Sunday, placed third in the match sprints.  </P> <P> Add tour: John Mutolo of Thousand Oaks (12th), Steve Province of Santa Clarita  (46th) and Scott Neumann of Northridge (50th) paced the Chatsworth-based  Rainbow Sports Team to 13th place in the team competition at the Tour of the  Future in the age 17-18 division.  </P> <P> The U. S. national team won the team title of the eight-stage, 265-mile race.  </P> <P> Triple vision: With less than five weeks remaining in the Encino Velodrome  racing season, three riders with the same first name are atop the senior men  season point totals.  </P> <P> Chris Johnson of Santa Barbara leads with 100 points, followed by Chris Bevan  of Woodland Hills (70) and Chris Gaido of San Luis Obispo (54).  </P> <P> Points are distributed for a top-five finish on a 7-5-3-2-1 basis.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Intelligence Service Murder: Wife </F> Trampled to Death"]    [Text] The murder of the German intelligence service man  in Libya is becoming increasingly mysterious! BILD heard:  Before his death, brutally slain Silvian Becker was in a coma  for four weeks. His wife was trampled to death. The German  Embassy only heard of the deed 14 days later. The latest  speculation in Bonn is that the Beckers were slain by Libyan  agents because they had been on the trail of 25 Germans who  produce poison gas for al-Qadhdhafi.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: No ignoring the actuarial facts of age Sir, Your correspondents, M H Upson and Mark Scheinbaum (Letters, March 24) are missing the point. A 39-year-old highly skilled applicant is most unlikely to be significantly less suitable than an equally experienced one of 49, for any job. However, if the employer operates a 'final' pay pension scheme - and most substantial companies in the UK do - the older individual will be far more expensive in prospective pensions liability for, say, 15 years' service to come. No amount of legislation concerning age limits in advertisements will alter the actuarial facts, and any system which inevitably imposes costs on employers that climb with age and time, irrespective of workers' productivity, is a sure catalyst for the destruction of older people's careers. Alan Smallbone, 30 Temple Fortune Lane, London NW11 7UD</p>

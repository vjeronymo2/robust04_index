The inflation reduced drastically to record  low at 1.3 percent in 1992-93, said the annual report of the  Bangladesh Bank for 1992-93 released on Wednesday [5 January].    The Bangladesh Bank report said that the foreign exchange  reserve in the country registered an unprecedented increase at  2,121 million U.S. dollar equivalent to six months' import  expenditure in 1992-93. But the report depicted a dismal  picture in the total investment and said that it did not achieve  the desired success in spite of the deregulation and free market  economic policies. The reasons for the low investment were  attributed to dilatory process in the implementation of the  policies, rigid and extra cautious stand of the banking  institutions, strict lending policies without risks and  introduction of harder rules in the realisation of the bank  loans. Total law and order situation and the labour unrest were  also shown in the report as other reasons for the slow  investment. The entrepreneurs apprehending tough competition in  the liberalised foreign trade did not show adequate interest for  investment, the Bangladesh Bank report observed.    The rate of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) registered a  growth of 4.3 per cent as against 4.2 per cent in the previous  year. The per capita income in 1992-93 stood at 212 U.S. dollar  as against 208 U.S. dollar in 1991-92. The report said that the  demand for bank loans remained tremendously low as the  investment did not gain momentum.    The broad money supply registered a rise of only 10.6 per  cent reaching a total of Taka 31,535.6 crore. The money supply  increased by Taka 3,009.7 crore in 1992-93.    The foreign exchange reserve in the country registered a  rise  by 513 million dollar. The rise included receipt of 81 million  dollar from International Monetary Fund (IMF), 30 million from  IDA [International Development Association], 59 million dollar  from Japan. Above that the rise in the remittances from the  Bangladesh expatriates and export earning were 84 million and  234 million dollar respectively. The import expenditure  increased by 523 million dollar in 1992-93. The reserve money  in the Bangladesh Bank increased by Taka 2,082.7 crore. The  huge cash of the commercial banks and financial institutions was  deposited with the Bangladesh Bank since they could not invest  it in the economic activities.    The export earnings in 1992-93 increased by 12.3 per cent  over the previous year. The total earning from the export  during the year was 2,138 million dollar. The deficit in the  current account balance increased to 780 million dollar in  1992-93 from the previous 605 million dollar. The overall  surplus in the balance fell by 19 million dollar and stood at  595 million dollar from 614 million dollar.    A total of Taka 814 crore was disbursed in the country as  agricultural loan as against Taka 749.59 crore in 1991-92.    In the foreign trade the deficit in 1992-93 rose by 289  million dollar and stood at total 1,848 million dollar. In  spite of the increase of 234 million dollar in export earning  the import expenditure was higher by 523 million dollar.    In 1992-93, the export earning was 2,138 million dollar  while  the import expenditure was 3,980 million dollar leaving a total  deficit of 1,848 million dollar.    The report apprehended that the effort to make the country  self-reliant in food production might be obstructed as the  farmers failed to make over the production cost of their  produce. This would constraint them to use increased inputs  including adequate fertilizer, seeds and pesticides.</p>

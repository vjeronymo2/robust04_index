			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Rifkind set for talks on peace effort Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is expected to meet United Nations military commanders in former Yugoslavia today as pressure mounts for a rapid withdrawal of UN peacekeepers if renewed peace efforts in Bosnia fail. Mr Rifkind said yesterday that the increase in fighting between the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems was making the task of the UN 'infinitely more difficult'. If Serbs followed up threats to target UN troops, withdrawal would become inevitable. His warning came as the foreign ministers of Britain and France met Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in Belgrade to press on him the urgent need for a ceasefire in the enclave of Bihac and throughout Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said after the talks: 'We don't feel that we have much time. We don't feel all these matters can be discussed in a leisurely way.' The threat of a UN withdrawal - which might pitch Bosnia's warring parties into a more violent conflict - is one of the few cards the international community can still play after the failure of last week's meeting of the five-nation contact group to agree on a joint strategy. In the wake of the group's failure, Washington at the weekend made direct contact with the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Charles Redman, a former US special envoy on Yugoslavia, travelled to their self-declared capital Pale, but talks made no headway, US officials said. The western allies appear to be diverging on how to stop the conflict deteriorating, and Mr Milosevic was last night understood to have been angered by the approach to the Bosnian Serbs. Political discord on Bosnia also deepened within the US. Senator Robert Dole, who will soon be majority leader in the upper house, yesterday advocated a three-point plan. It would start with a pull-out of the United Nations peacekeepers, involve a lifting of the arms embargo, and a 'robust' Nato bombing campaign on Serb military targets in Bosnia. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, speaking on the same television programme, portrayed the senator's policy as 'essentially a war strategy' which in the end would require the commitment of 'hundreds of thousands of US ground troops'. Mr Newt Gingrich, the leading House of Representatives Republican, said the allies should train and arm the Bosnian government - with money and weapons provided by Islamic countries which he thought would 'gladly pay'. British officials said talk of a troop withdrawal was not intended as a threat, but was a realistic assessment of the increasing danger to Britain's 3,300-strong force. Mr Milosevic told Mr Hurd that a UN withdrawal would be 'very bad', said British officials. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, praised Mr Milosevic for accepting a peace plan devised in July, and they stressed that the warring parties could negotiate swaps of territory, or constitutional deals, once the basic plan had been accepted. In a new demand, Mr Milosevic called for all the parties fighting in Bosnia to be involved in negotiations. Leaders aim to upgrade CSCE role, Page 3</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: Master of simple authority - William Packer admires a magnificent review of Poussin's work in Paris Nicolas Poussin is one of the great panjandrums of the history of painting. Almost the exact contemporary of Rembrandt in Holland and Velasquez in Spain, he was the greatest French painter of the 17th century, indeed the first great French painter of the modern, post-Renaissance era. That he came out of France both figuratively and literally, spending all but a couple of years of his mature career in Rome, simply confirms his European reputation and influence. For he united within a single oeuvre the warmer, more sensuous and instinctive Italian tradition with the cooler, more cerebral tradition of the north. He also set the programme for the development of neo-classicism that ran on through David and Ingres and has continued in constructivist and analytical practice and tradition, from Cezanne and Mondrian to the minimalism of our own times. Indeed the problem with Poussin, if problem it be, has largely been a function of his acknowledged importance and the general seriousness in which he is held. 'Signor Poussin', said Bernini tapping his forehead, 'is a painter who works up here.' Such respect is all very well, but it is inclined to get in the way of the work itself. The scholars of art have a field day with Poussin, loving him for the recondite complexities of his references, and absorbed by the problems of attribution and chronological development he sets them. As for the artists, to them Poussin is the supreme organiser and constructor of the image, the supreme analyser and integrator of form and space, the supreme controller of tone and colour. There is to his work a simple authority, assured and inevitable, that quite takes the breath away. How calm it all is, how exactly right in every gesture and expression, how entirely free of fudge and hurry and histrionic. All is worked out, definitive in its presence, ideal in its essence, artless in its apparent simplicity and completeness, yet so full of art. No wonder that Cezanne was moved to say, two centuries on, that his only wish was 'to do Poussin again, but from Nature', as though to suppose in all sincerity that Poussin had taken nothing from the real world, had made it all up. The thrill of the magnificent and comprehensive review of Poussin, now on in Paris, is that while it gives us these two views of this great master's work exactly - the scholar's and the artist's to both their hearts' content - it goes far beyond each limited response to give us the whole artist. Here he is, cerebral and technical to be sure, but also free and experimental, sensuous and intuitive, and full of wit. The drawings are an especial interest and pleasure and, quite rightly, are given due prominence - though I would question the wisdom of showing such naturally dense and absorbing material en bloc, most of all the early drawings that fill the first room, for they inevitably create a traffic jam of visitors at the very outset of the show. That said, they are not to be missed, for they are not only extremely rare, delicate and beautiful things but they offer a peculiar insight into Poussin's working methods. Here, lightly and freely stated, we see the first intuitive registering of his pictorial ideas, with each then radically simplified, almost to modern eyes to the point of abstraction - shades of Cezanne, Picasso, Bomberg - by the application of a stark chiaroscuro wash for the shadows. Thus are the essential structure and dynamic of each composition established, here a battle, here a bacchanale, reduced to a set of vigorous directional strokes. The paintings take us through the full range of the work, from the earliest mythologies and history paintings before the migration to Rome, to the mysterious and elegiac landscapes with cities and figures of the later years. Poussin had stopped at Venice for a period on his way to Rome, and the influence of the idealised arcadian vision of such as Bellini, Giorgione and the young Titian is clear enough. So much is known and recognised, but always rather in the letter than the spirit. Here it is the evident sensuousness of Poussin himself, Venetian perhaps in origin but transformed by his own clear purposes and intellect, that comes as the glorious surprise. So much for the stoical Poussin, looking rather to the classical than to the Christian model for his austere moralities - yet how lightly his nymphs and goddesses flirt and turn, or stretch and dream beneath the trees. And how beautifully seen they are, and so lovingly drawn and painted. The two great sequences of the sacraments are shown complete, and in the earlier 'Extreme Unction', from Belvoir Castle, the dying man lies surrounded and urgently attended on the bed. Alone to the right, the pretty serving-maid slips out to fetch more wine, turning to smile at us as she goes. Life goes on.

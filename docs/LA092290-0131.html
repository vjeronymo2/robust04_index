			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;  </P> <P> PUBLIC USE OF PRIME LAND MUST COME BEFORE PRIVATE  </P> <P> California coastal communities are continually caught in a tug-of-war between  protecting a natural resource and exploiting one. With population increasing  and available land decreasing, the pressures on local governments are  formidable.  </P> <P> The leasing of public lands for commercial uses adds money to local city  coffers, but the price is paid by everyone whose natural resources are  diminished. The heart of the conflict is land-use and who makes the decisions.  At issue is the conversion of public land to private use.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach is a perfect example. Since 1986, the city has been embroiled  in civil war over a proposed "Pierside Village" commercial development on  beachfront property just south of the Huntington Beach pier.  </P> <P> The struggle over this property dates back to 1932 when the city sued  landowners for the beachfront property. A settlement granted the city public  access and a beach recreation easement, leaving title held by private interests  and the city steward for the public trust. Since then, much of the sandy beach  and bluff top was paved over for parking and concessions; restrooms and showers  were added.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, the city, looking for a spark to ignite downtown  redevelopment, proposed massive commercial building on its beachfront that  would reopen the door to its development. "Pierside Village" was approved, but  coastal permits have since expired and the project is up for reconsideration.  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission and the attorney general's office, reluctant to see  public land converted to a private use, resisted the city's efforts to clear  title. It was then that the public recreation easement was uncovered.  </P> <P> The state of California is not the only formidable opponent fighting beach  development. Citizens groups have reared up in revolt. When our elected  officials fail to look after public interests, citizens take the initiative. In  Huntington Beach, a local group called Save Our Parks qualified a Charter  amendment (Measure C) which, if passed in November, would give voters the power  to approve or deny projects of the scale of "Pierside Village." But this  project is on the fast track to be approved before the November election.  </P> <P> So who decides when public land will be available for private use? Local  government is supposed to be the most responsive, but it is also the most  controlled by special interests. Usually the control is financial. State  government sees a bigger picture, yet some recent Coastal Commission appointees  are members of the same financial fraternity that controls local government.  The final decision may take place in a courtroom, but it shouldn't have to be  that way.  </P> <P> Planning guidelines clearly give priority to coastal recreational uses. No  government has ever defined restaurants as recreation. Yet all along the coast,  developers would have the public believe that "power dining" at pricey  restaurants with an ocean view is the highest form of coastal recreation. In  Huntington Beach, there is more than enough room for restaurants on the inland  side of Pacific Coast Highway. If public beach uses are to be served and public  views are to be protected, then commercial opportunities are extremely limited.  </P> <P> When it comes to the development of public lands, the public needs to be  involved early in the planning process -- before the plans are drawn up, before  money is invested and before expectations are inflated. Public recreational  uses must be given priority. Instead of figuring how much commercial  development can be squeezed onto public lands, the planners should maximize  public recreation uses. Then and only then should commercial opportunities be  considered.  </P></p>

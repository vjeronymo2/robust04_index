			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The "Political Viewpoint" column on  pages 1,2 of the 27 Feb 94 PRACHEACHON carries a 700-word  article entitled "What To Do To Get Real Democracy." The  author, Im Sonchearea, somments that democracy is not simply the  right of freedom of expression, a free press, or freedom to  stage demonstrations. Nor is it something that can be imported  from abroad and applied 100 percent in Cambodia. The writer  views democracy as tied to the availability of employment and  says that each country must create democracy by itself.    The author sees as "very correct" First Prime Minister  Ranariddh's "recent" comments in which he said that "Democracy  is not just the freedom of expression, but also rests on  [people] being educated, happy, and proper attention being paid  to avoiding cleavages between rich and poor." The author  comments that if the gap between haves and have-nots is large,  true democracy will not exist for long. True democracies abroad  do not merely have freedom of expression, but also a gap between  rich and poor "that does not keep growing." The writer says that  in Cambodia "if this gap continues, it will be impossible to  stamp out corruption, people's happiness will certainly be  threatened... and democracy will be simply a matter of lip  service."</p>

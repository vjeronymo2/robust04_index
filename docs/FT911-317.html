			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shearson faces losses after Dollars 144m charge for quarter SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking subsidiary of American Express, is to take a Dollars 144m pre-tax charge against second-quarter earnings because of a clampdown last Friday by California's insurance regulators on a troubled life company in which Shearson holds a large stake. Analysts expect the write-down to push Shearson into the red, despite the markets boom which has been boosting Wall Street profits this year. The brokerage made Dollars 51m in the first quarter. The losses will also lower the profits of American Express, which faced severe problems with Shearson in early 1990, when it was forced to inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the business following a Dollars 915m loss. Mr John Garamendi, the recently appointed Californian insurance commissioner, issued a 'cease and desist' order on Friday against First Capital Life Insurance, a San Diego-based company whose parent, First Capital Holdings, is 28 per cent owned by Shearson. The previous week First Capital Life had faced a flood of customers seeking to cash in their policies amid reports the company - which has a large exposure to the junk bond market - faced severe financial problems. The commissioner's move prevents the company from writing new business or making payments to its parent, and places a moratorium on policy surrenders and life insurance policy loans. The commissioner is seeking longer term solutions to the company's problems, which could include asset sales and a capital infusion. Unfounded rumours on Friday that the company had begun selling off its junk bond portfolio contributed to a sharp afternoon decline in bond prices and a sympathetic drop in equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 50.98 points on the day. Shearson's write-down covers all its investment in First Capital Holding. However, Wall Street analysts say the brokerage house could face further losses if it had to compensate those holders of First Capital policies who brought them through Shearson. Shearson, however, says it believes the insurer has 'the resources to meet at least the principal payments of policyholders' and it is not in a position to make any open-ended commitments to them. The company has also been resisting the commissioner's appeals for it to inject fresh money into First Capital.</p>

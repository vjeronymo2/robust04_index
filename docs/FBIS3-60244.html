The two nations will announce the plan in February at a  summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington, Deputy Foreign  Minister Koichiro Matsuura told a joint press conference.    Japan and the U.S. reached the agreement during a second  round of talks on a common agenda for global cooperation under a  trade framework agreement reached between the two nations in  July.    The meeting was held Wednesday morning at the Foreign  Ministry. Matsuura headed the Japanese delegation and the U.S.  side was led by Timothy Wirth, a State Department counselor.    During the meeting, Japan and the U.S. agreed that Russia's  dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan was a  "regrettable" act and agreed to continue exchanging information  and discussing the matter, Matsuura said.    James Baker, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for oceanic and  atmospheric affairs, told the news conference the countries  strongly oppose any dumping of radioactive waste under the  London Dumping Convention.    "We believe that Russians have acted in violation of the  agreement by the London Dumping Convention," Baker said.    "Our joint support of the ban on dumping has been an  important new step here," he said.    The two sides agreed to start a fellowship program for  engineers from January. Some 30 U.S. engineers from companies  such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will study for a  year at Japanese firms like Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor  Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Sony Corp.    For the next fiscal year, about 100 engineers will come to  Japan under the fellowship.    Japan and the U.S. also discussed setting up a committee to  cooperate on improvement of the environment in central and  eastern Europe and are close to agreement on its establishment,  Matsuura said.    Wirth said the two nations' cooperation in the area will  make  a "significant contribution in helping clean up enormous  environmental problems that plague" the region.</p>

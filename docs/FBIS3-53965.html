Ambassador  Rabinovich also told reporters in Washington that a national  referendum would force Syria to take Israeli public opinion into  account because voters would not support any kind of withdrawal  unless they were certain of getting real peace in exchange.    The message to the Syrians was that they would have to do  more if they wanted Israeli society and Israel's political  establishment to meet them half way, Itamar Rabinovich explained.</p>

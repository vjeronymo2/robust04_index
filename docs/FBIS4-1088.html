			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in  Angola, today met with the negotiating teams. At the Mulungushi  International Conference Center this morning, Beye met the  government delegation in the morning and the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team in the afternoon.  No details have been disclosed, though it is believed that the  mediator wanted to hold separate meetings on outstanding issues  -- namely, the specific principles and ways of completing the  presidential elections and national reconciliation. No basic  document has been issued regarding the specific principles on  the completion of the presidential elections. A source close to  the negotiations said that it in view of that, it is not  possible to make further comments. The mediator is still making  efforts to bring the government and UNITA negotiators together  to deal with the outstanding issues. Beye is still optimistic,  saying he believes the negotiations will end soon. Yesterday  Beye said Lusaka is about to write its name in the history of  the Angolan people. Let us wait and see.</p>

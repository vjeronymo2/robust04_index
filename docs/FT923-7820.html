			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Stars in a political drama - David Spanier on Bush, Reagan - and others who didn't make it WHAT IT TAKES: THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE by Richard Ben Cramer Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 1,040 pages PRESIDENT REAGAN: THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME by Lou Cannon Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 17.99, 948 pages THE TURN by Don Oberdorfer Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 514 pages AMERICAN journalists love to write big books. What It Takes - which is a description, at length, of how George Bush and other aspirants campaigned for nomination as presidential candidates - runs to more than 1,000 pages. President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime, which views his eight years at the White House as starring role in a political drama, weighs in only a little shorter. A lot of Americans feel over-awed, if not mesmerised, by the office of the presidency, as if it is more than a mere political job. Otherwise, why produce such tomes, which have to be lifted with two hands? The merits of brevity seem never to have crossed their publishers' minds. At least The Turn, an insider's account of the Cold War, manages to pull up at a mere 500 pages. There is another reason why these sort of books are produced by members of the White House press corps. Political life in Washington is so much more open than in Whitehall, where the first instinct of officials is to pull down the blinds on insider gossip and put any comments they do venture off the record. By now, experience surely has shown politicians of presidential calibre that everything they do or say it is going to be noted down and, quite soon, written up. Granted, there is a kind of 'true life confessions" appeal in the revelation of the minutiae of politicans' tactics, their back-room confabs and front office poses. What It Takes, by a former Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, seeks to answer the question 'What are these guys like?' in relation to Bush and Dole on the Republican side and four Democrat aspirants (a couple of whom already have faded into obscurity). Bush is now the only relevant figure. From his going out on the baseball field and fluffing the first pitch in a ceremony opening the new season, an inordinate amount of close observation is devoted to him. But even when Bush finally sees he can make it to the White House, he remains a hollow man. Is this the man or is it the style of the telling? For the overwhelming detail of this book is like a diet of meringues. Here, to take one of a thousand instances, is Dole combing his hair: 'Now Dole stood and cranked his left arm around his back, stretching to his right-rear pants' pocket, and pulled out his barber's comb . . . Four strokes with the comb through the thick black hair . . . He twisted to replace the comb again and, as his left arm came around front again . . . the arm shot out ahead of him in a strange, twisting lunge . . . ' And so on. It is vivid, it is realistic, it is done admirably - the narrative is based on interviews with more than 1,000 people - but this is, properly, the techique of fiction. The inspiration for such writing comes, obviously, from Tom Wolfe: but then, he knew how much to leave out. By contrast, President Reagan by Lou Cannon, a senior correspondent of the Washington Post, is a classic reporter's biography. Balanced, affectionate, but not afraid to be critical, it offers a mature account of the man and his presidency. Reagan, with his crinkly smile and cowboy gait, his quips and his courage and - as is clear - his ignorance of so much of the affairs of state, never lost the affection of the American people. Yet, there is a part of the man which no one could reach, not even Nancy (whose supporting role emerges as much more likeable and sensible than has been supposed). He liked to see the bright side of life but he was more complex than is realised; ' . . . he was a classic adult child of an alcoholic who had learned early in life to retreat from discord and unpleasantness.' This book, focusing on key episodes of the presidency, offers a series of extended close-ups. Reagan's greatest achievement was in moving so decisively to bring the Cold War to an end. In another insider's account, Washington Post journalist Don Oberdorfer slips in and out of the Oval Office and the corridors of the State Department as if he were there in person. Diplomatic exchanges and private conversations are reported in detail. The sources are first-hand. The result is informative but the technique, weaving in so much anecdotal material, is rather tiring in the end. The folksy old president, whose simple view of the Soviet Union as 'the evil empire' set the stage for confrontation in a new arms race, was turned by the experience of super-power diplomacy into a family friend. It was like a happy ending in one of his old movies. At the Washington summit, when he trotted out the old Russian maxim 'trust but verify,' Gorbachev protested good naturedly: 'You repeat that at every meeting.' When the laughter died down, the old Hollywood trouper replied with a grin: 'I like it.' The key to these momentous events, which were to transform the former enemy and super-power into not merely an ally but a recipient of American aid, lay in Reagan's own conversion. He saw the new opportunity, rose to meet it, and set the impress of the American eagle upon events. In the process, he confounded the many experts who derided his evident limitations.</p>

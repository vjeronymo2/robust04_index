			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts shrug off production figures to continue rise UK GOVERNMENT bonds shrugged off industrial price and production figures released yesterday which suggested that inflation and output may be recovering more sharply than anticipated. The benchmark 9.75 per cent gilt maturing 2002 opened at 104.00 and rose to 104 5/32 by the close for a yield of 9.11 per cent. At the close on Monday the benchmark stood at 103 15/16 . The June gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, closed at 99.07, from 98.18 at the opening. Volume was 39,500 contracts. Manufacturing output rose by 1.1 per cent during February, after recording a 0.6 per cent decline in January. Most analysts had anticipated a zero rate of growth. Factory gate prices rose 0.8 per cent in March, from 0.3 per cent during February, for a year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent  - the first rise in factory gate prices since last October. Market-makers were yesterday revising forecasts to take account of a slower fall in underlying inflation. For example, Warburg Securities is now forecasting 'core' UK inflation of 4 per cent by the end of this year, compared with a previous forecast of 3.7 per cent. However, the data had little negative impact on gilts. The market was supported by positive sentiment following the Conservative election victory, and an improvement in the German government bond market during the afternoon. GERMAN government bonds recovered from a gloomy start to close slightly higher on the day, following news that an immediate political crisis in Russia had been averted. During early trading, sentiment was depressed by the prospect of domestic strike action by 2.3m public sector workers. Late on Monday, the public sector union walked out of pay negotiations with employers and will now ballot members on industrial action. The union has claimed an average 9 per cent pay increase, with the employers only willing to offer 4.8 per cent. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 fell to 100.54 in the morning session, from 100.60 at the close on Monday. However, sentiment improved later as news filtered through that the government of Boris Yeltsin had won additional powers to pursue economic reform. The benchmark bond closed higher on the day at 100.66, for a yield of 7.89 per cent. The bund futures contract on Liffe opened at 88.06 but slipped to 87.89 during early trading. It recovered through the afternoon to close at 88.08. Money market conditions remain tight, suggesting little room for an easing of monetary conditions. Despite an injection of funds yesterday under section 17 of the Bundesbank Act, which allows the central bank to transfer to the banking system cash held on deposit for public sector institutions, short money rates rose slightly. Overnight call money traded just below the 9.75 per cent Lombard Rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions. US Treasury prices fell slightly, despite retail sales data which provided evidence of continued sluggishness in economic activity. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 101 15/32 , yielding 7.865 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/16 at 101 1/8 , yielding 5.121 per cent. For the second consecutive day, trading was subdued by the closure due to flooding of the Chicago Board of Trade, which trades the main Treasury bond futures contracts. This helped explain the lack of reaction to the news that March retail sales fell 0.4 per cent, a figure that might normally boost bond prices. The decline in sales, however, had been expected and already discounted in prices. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve completed a round of two-day system repurchases, with Fed funds trading at 3 per cent. Although the repos were not anticipated, analysts said the intervention did not suggest that the Fed was easing monetary policy again. Last week the Fed signalled it wanted the Fed funds rate at 3 3/4 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds were supported by the authorities overnight in Tokyo but failed to sustain a rally, with sentiment dominated by concern over the wider health of the financial system. The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 5.46 per cent, slightly better than 5.495 per cent on Monday. The Ministry of Finance supported the market for the fourth time since the end of last week, offering to buy up to Y50bn of government issues Nos 129, 126 and 119. It is not known how many bonds were bought in under the offer. However, against the background of a weak stock market, both cash and bond futures slipped. The June 10-year bond future fell to 101.53, from 101.61 on Monday, as the Nikkei stock market index fell below 17,000. The futures contract later recovered ground to finish at 101.64. Traders expected the market to remain within tight ranges until the outlook for interest rates and the financial system is clearer. Yesterday, inflation data for March showed domestic wholesale price inflation running at a negative rate of 0.8 per cent year on year, from a negative 0.6 per cent in February.</p>

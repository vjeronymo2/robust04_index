			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 18 Jun (MENA) -- Former South Yemeni  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has denied that his supporters in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] or the General People's  Congress are involved in the current tragic events in Yemen.    In statements he made to the MENA correspondent in Damascus,  'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that his supporters are the victims  of this bloody conflict between the sons of the Yemeni people.  He said that he is very pained by the reports by press agencies  and international and humanitarian organizations on the tragic  situation in Aden.    President 'Ali Nasir was commenting on a recent newspaper  report that former leaders from South Yemen are involved in the  fighting against the YSP so as to rehabiliate themselves and  avenge the incidents of January 1986 that led to his ousting  from his position.    The former south Yemeni president held some parties in the  Yemeni leadership, which he did not name, responsible for the  political and military conflict in Yemen.    He stressed that there must be a return to dialogue and a  cease-fire, that the Yemeni leaders have to abide by the spirit  of the Pledge and Accord Document, and that they have to deal  flexibly and realistically with the UN envoy's endeavors.    He reiterated that he will not assume any responsibility in  Yemen while there is fighting or secession, adding that the  problem is a political one, not a military one.</p>

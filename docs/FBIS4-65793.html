			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Newsreel:" Limassol Dispatch by Sotiroula </F> Khristofidhou--recorded]    [Text] [Khristofidhou] President Glavkos Kliridhis said  today that any attempt to alter the 21 March document would  release us from our acceptance of it. The President made this  warning clear today in an address at a luncheon hosted by the  Limassol Bar Association. The topic of his speech was on the  latest developments in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Kliridhis stressed  in his address that the Turkish side is trying to avoid the  implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's], but  without being condemned for its intransigence. He added the  Turkish side is taking advantage of the delayed release of the  UN secretary general's report to create the impression that it  has accepted the 21 March document. By asking for  clarifications for points of the document, the Turkish side is  actually attempting to alter them, President Kliridhis stressed  and then warned:    [Kliridhis] I have told the United Nations and I say again  that we abandoned certain stipulations that we wanted under the  condition that the Turkish side would also accept the document  as is. Any attempt to alter the 21 March document by Mr. Rauf  Denktas or Turkey, would release us from our acceptance of it.  Despite our reservations, for the sake of progress in the  Cyprus issue, we accept the document as it is.    [Khristofidhou] The president then called upon the United  Nations to submit the report without any further delay and  warned:    [Kliridhis] I would also like to stress that we have both  protested and stressed that these delaying tactics do not find  us in agreement. They say they are not postponing it to see  whether or not the Turkish side will accept it. I would like to  inform them that we are not children, some of us have long  familiarity with how the United Nations operates, and that we  are not sure if this is so. For a while, it was true that the  secretary general was away from his headquarters and he needs to  approve the final form of the report, but I think this excuse no  longer exists. I am not convinced that the report will be  translated into various languages and I publicly call upon the  United Nations to submit its report without any further delay as  I have also called upon it in private.    [Khristofidhou] Mr. Kliridhis further pointed out that the  Cyprus issue has reached a crossroads which should make both the  Greek Cypriot side and the Security Council ponder. The  president stressed: The time has come for the Security Council  to think of alternative ways of promoting a Cyprus solution,  given the fact that the other side follows filibustering  tactics. Referring to the significance of the European element,  President Kliridhis said that we must convince Europe that only  when Turkey realizes that talks on Cyprus' accession have begun  will it then abandon any expansionist designs on Cyprus in that  such designs could not be realized if Cyprus is a member of a  united Europe.    Referring to the Turkish policy, Mr. Kliridhis said that the  Turkish side is not interested in a Cyprus solution but in a  period of avoiding a solution and also perpetuating the problem  with the aim of having the pseudostate recognized or, at a later  stage, the recognition of a federation. President Kliridhis  also added in his speech that we are not seeing light at the end  of the tunnel of the Cyprus problem due to the lack of political  will by the Turkish side. He stressed: It is necessary for the  Security Council to adopt the appropriate measures which would  create the prerequisites for the Turkish side to acquire  political will.</p>

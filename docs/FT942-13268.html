			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Arts: Billy Budd in Geneva - Opera It takes a woman to illuminate a man's world. That, at least, is the moral of Francesca Zambello's new staging of Billy Budd in Geneva. Aided by her designers Alison Chitty and Heather Carson, Zambello strikes to the heart of the all-male world in Britten's naval opera. She treats it as a parable of human relationships - how men persecute and crush, inspire and cherish one another. The accent is on narrative simplicity, more telling than any interpretative gimmick. The suggestion of repressed feeling or moral ambiguity is left to Britten's music, which has all the space it needs to sink in to the audience's consciousness. The result is mightily impressive. On this evidence, Budd could indeed be Britten's greatest opera, musically more subtle than Grimes, bigger and deeper than the chamber operas. Chitty's decor and costumes provide the bare essentials of the historical sea-setting. The action unfolds on a rectangular wooden platform, jutting diagonally towards the pit and bordered by blue neon light. It serves as a roomy quarter-deck, all hatches and coiled rope, before heaving up like a ship's prow at the start of Act two to reveal gunners preparing for battle. Quite apart from its startling portrait of above-and-below-decks, this scene is a tour de force of theatrical atmosphere, shrouded in blue-green light and mists of dry ice. After a tepid start, Zambello unfolds the plot seamlessly, choreographing the chorus with sleight of hand and deftly picking out each minor character. To establish an early link between Billy and Vere, the exuberant Billy appears on deck during the big shanty interlude, a vision in the philosopher-captain's mind. And the epilogue is all the more poignant for the sight of Billy's body hanging in the background. The conductor, Roderick Brydon, works in complete harmony with the stage. He emphasises fluency and simplicity of line, sails through the choral cross-currents with breezy buoyancy and gives his singers exemplary support. There is a tautness and unobtrusive musicality about the whole performance. Robert Tear has developed into an ideal Vere. We see the solitary leader of men, the headmasterly senior officer, the contemplative observer, the moral coward, the wise old man. To his customary vocal intelligence Tear adds a new inwardness and gravitas. With Zambello's help, he makes Vere the presiding influence, as Britten intended. Willard White's Claggart has massive stage presence and a potent way with the words. This is no pantomime villain, but an Iago-like impersonation of evil, all the more threatening for his restraint. Rodney Gilfry is the lean, lanky Billy, making up in musical taste for his lack of charisma. David Wilson-Johnson and Paul Whelan cut a strong profile as Redburn and Flint, while Frank Egerton, Grant Dickson, Doug Jones and Neil Jenkins contribute lively cameos below decks. The Geneva audience gave Billy Budd an unusually warm reception. Continental managements have always been deterred by the need for such a large male cast  -but recent stagings in France, Germany and now Switzerland suggest it is finally winning the wider popularity it deserves. The quality of the Geneva cast spoke for itself, and Los Angeles will be the lucky inheritor of the production in 1996.</p>

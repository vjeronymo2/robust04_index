			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Nightmare in Bombay for bank chief MR Malcolm Williamson's worst nightmare has come true. Since late 1989 when he joined Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, he has been trying to convince shareholders and rival banks that Standard's accident-prone days were over. However, late on Wednesday Mr Williamson, now managing director, disclosed that the bank was making a Pounds 50m provision to cover possible losses on an arcane form of securities business carried out by the bank's branch in Bombay. Indeed, yesterday he admitted that the Pounds 50m estimated loss was an arbitrary figure. The loss should not be 'more than Pounds 100m' and it 'could be less' than the Pounds 50m. Such uncertainty will not reassure the bank's shareholders, but it is understandable. Mr Williamson got wind of the problem only last Wednesday, when he was entertaining government officials in Brunei. 'When I was told, my initial reaction was shock, disbelief, lack of comprehension,' he said. The source of the problem was a form of securities business unknown to him. Indeed, it appears that no one in Standard's City of London head office was aware the bank was involved in this business. He then thought about flying to Bombay immediately, but could not get a visa in Brunei or in Manila, his next stop. So in the event Mr David Brougham, the bank's treasurer, and Mr Erick Naslund, its chief firefighter, were flown out with more than a dozen other executives to investigate. What they found was 'trunk-loads of paper', Mr Williamson said. 'Sorting it all out could take months'. These banker's receipts are a form of IOU issued by banks in India. Settlement of Bombay stock exchange transactions is a lengthy and convoluted process. In order to create a more liquid market, banks issued IOUs to each other, which were promises to deliver shares or stock at some distant date. The recipient of such an IOU was not supposed to transfer it to any other institution. But Mr Williamson said that a market developed in the paper. 'It became a form of currency.' The amount of paper circulating then exploded from the beginning of the year, as Bombay share prices began to soar. The only check on the integrity of the market was a monthly attempt by the Reserve Bank of India to verify whether there was a balance between banks claiming to be owed stock by virtue of the receipts they held, and those banks recognising a liability to deliver stock. 'At the end of last month, the Reserve Bank noticed there was a massive imbalance', said Mr Williamson. 'All the banks then started to assess their positions'. What Standard Chartered found was shocking. It has an exposure to Pounds 100m of transactions where it cannot be certain of receiving payment. Mr Williamson said there were three possible explanations for this discrepancy: It may be holding forged IOUs. The counterparty named in an IOU may not have the financial capacity to complete the transaction. It may have received a claim from another bank and not have the securities claimed. Not all the Pounds 100m is likely to be lost. Over coming months Standard should be able to make some further recoveries. However, it does not know whether other banks are holding further IOUs making claims on it.</p>

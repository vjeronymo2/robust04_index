			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A man who allegedly suffered from psychosis triggered by cough medicine  addiction and a fall from bed was convicted of second-degree murder in the  shooting death of his best friend. James George Sussman, 39, faces 15 years to  life in prison for the slaying last year of George Moore, 50, at Sussman's Los  Gatos home. The sanity phase of Sussman's trial in Santa Clara County Superior  Court will begin Monday. The prosecution contended Sussman killed Moore during  a lover's quarrel. But defense attorney Pat Tondreau said the men were not  lovers, and that Sussman had a "psychotic delusional episode" in which he  thought he had to kill Moore to prevent the world from ending. Tondreau said  the episode was brought on by a high level of dextromethorphan, an active  ingredient in some cough syrups, and a blow to the head when Sussman fell out  of bed shortly before the shooting.  </P></p>

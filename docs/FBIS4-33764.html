			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alberto Fujimori of Peru arrived in Japan  on the afternoon of 5 June. He gave an exclusive interview to  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters in Tokyo.    The president talked about the presidential election  scheduled for April 1995. While he said: "I have not decided  whether to run as a candidate," he also emphasized: "The  reforms we implemented in the past four years have been very  successful. The present regime has improved the life of the  majority of Peruvian people. No political regime has been able  to affect reforms in such a short period." He showed strong  confidence in his reelection chances based on his record of  successful reforms.    This is Fujimori's fifth visit to Japan, including visits he  made before becoming president. He is scheduled to hold talks  with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 6 June.    President Fujimori stressed: "We implemented several  successful stabilization programs, including one on eradicating  violence. If a weaker regime should come into power, it will be  dangerous for Peru."    Commenting on rumors that former UN Secretary General Javier  Perez De Cuellar intends to run for the presidency, Fujimori  limited himself to saying: "I know about that. I expect all  sorts of people to announce their candidacy from now on."    Discussing economic reforms, Fujimori pointed out that "we  have almost resolved the debt issue; the inflation rate, which  used to be 50 percent a month, is down to 1 percent." He also  predicted: "Gross domestic product (GDP), which declined each  year under past regimes, attained a growth of 7.5 percent in  1993, and will achieve a similar, or an even better growth rate  in 1994."    Regarding foreign investments, Fujimori complained that  "Japanese investors are conservative, compared to U.S. or  Spanish investors." He indicated he would again request  investments from Japan during his meeting with Prime Minister  Hata on 6 June. He also said: "We hope the Export-Import Bank  of Japan and Overseas Cooperation Fund will increase their  assistance for medium-scale investment projects."    Regarding the unemployment issue, which has not seen any  improvement, Fujimori claimed: "The solution depends on how  successful we are in attracting foreign investments. If we are  able to invite investments into Peru, which has rich natural  resources, it will be possible to solve the problem of poverty."    At present, the Fujimori government is being strongly  criticized by the United States and other countries for  violating human rights because many civilians have been killed  during campaigns to exterminate leftist guerrillas; and a new  constitution providing for the revival of the death sentence for  terrorists was enacted in late 1993. Fujimori asserted: "Human  rights have achieved remarkable improvement in Peru, compared to  the past 10 years. When you talk about human rights, first, you  have to respect the rights of the Peruvian people, and not those  of the terrorists."</p>

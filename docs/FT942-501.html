			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Summit deal a matter of 'face': The background to agreement After decades of intermittent talks that all failed, leaders of North and South Korea yesterday agreed to their first summit meeting since both sides fought to a standstill, at a cost of 3.5m lives, in the 1950-53 Korean war. They agreed to meet between July 25 and 27 in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. They could not agree, however, on the South's proposal for a return engagement in Seoul after the first meeting. Although the atmosphere at the working-level session was cordial, the depth of mutual suspicion and fragility of the agreement could be seen in a North Korean demand that the summit be cancelled in case of a 'provocative' act by either side between now and July 25. The North has used the excuse of alleged provocations to derail previous dealings with the south. This time, cynics might be forgiven for suspecting the North wants an easy out in case things do not go its way in high-level talks with the US, set to begin on July 8 in Geneva and continue for a fortnight or so. Pyongyang for years had made clear its preference for bypassing Seoul, which it derided as a mere 'puppet' regime, to deal with Washington directly. Washington as consistently had maintained Seoul must not be left out. The issue of the summit's venue is one that involves 'face', a consideration important among Koreans. North Korean President Kim Il-sung, 82, has been in power for nearly 49 years. South Korea deferred to his seniority in agreeing to hold the first meeting in his capital. The question is whether Kim Il-sung would then deign to visit the home turf of South Korean President Kim Young-sam. The issue is sensitive for Kim Il-sung since North Korea's 'Great Leader' has indoctrinated his own, isolated subjects with a view of South Koreans that is outdated, to say the least. In Pyongyang's propaganda, southerners are portrayed as poverty-stricken, oppressed by military dictators and in need of the peninsula's reunification so they can live under the Great Leader's benevolent socialist rule. Thus Kim Il-sung and his handlers may foresee a public relations nightmare over his first appearance in prosperous, car-clogged Seoul. Such knotty problems of dignity must be addressed before the two leaders can get around to deciding whether to carry out a previous pledge to create a nuclear-free Korea. The South must make a careful assessment of whether it has sufficient conventional military deterrent to agree to relinquish the protective US nuclear 'umbrella' in response to Kim Il-sung's request to former US President Jimmy Carter for a US pledge not to launch a nuclear first strike. It appears the South is confronted with multi-track development of various North Korean weapons of mass destruction. In the runup to the US-North Korean talks and the inter-Korean summit set to follow it, officials in Seoul will be engaged in some difficult calculations. Could they be paying pay too big a price for a look at the possibly unimpressive cards in Pyongyang's nuclear hand? To some, this issue has been brought home by a report from a North Korean army sergeant who defected to the South. Lee Chong-guk said he had been at a meeting last August at which a prominent colonel boasted North Korea had enough chemical and biological weapons to kill the entire 40m population of South Korea. Col Hwang Chang-pyong advocated just such a Final Solution to the Korean division, arguing South Koreans were too imbued with anti-communism to come to terms with the northern regime, Mr Lee said in an interview. No wonder Seoul's gas-mask suppliers are sold out.</p>

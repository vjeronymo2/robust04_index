			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US Confused over farm talks with EC US officials say talks with the EC about farm output statistics have been 'very confusing', David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports from Washington. 'We have often not been sure the Europeans are talking about the same thing, particularly at the top,' one official said. The numbers are confusing because 'they all have little tails on them, like 'swing', 'aggregation' and flexibility'.' As a result, US farm trade negotiators have been careful to provide tables supporting every set of proposals 'so no doubt exists about what we proposed. The EC hasn't exactly accepted or rejected these concepts, so we don't know that when they tell us a percentage has swing or aggregation whether they're talking about the same swing or aggregation. These things make a difference to what happens each year, and cumulatively over six years.'</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Hire business drags down Christian Salvesen profits Christian Salvesen shares fell 62p to 314p after the UK distribution, specialist hire and food services group issued a profits warning. The Edinburgh-based group said Aggreko - its specialist hire business, which has been a star performer in recent years - was suffering from increasing competition in the US and Europe. Salvesen warned that pre-tax profits for the year to March would be below market expectations and 'slightly lower than the Pounds 74.8m reported last year'. Analysts, who had been expecting around Pounds 80m, reduced their forecasts to between Pounds 70m-Pounds 72m. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, identified four other factors hitting profits: Unacceptable losses in Spain had led to the withdrawal of the Aggreko business, with consequent redundancy costs and provisions for possible bad debts; The unexpected termination of a hire contract in Croatia, which was producing all the electrical power for the town of Split; A Pounds 1m stock write-down at Light and Sound Design, which the group bought in 1991 and has since restructured after losses caused by a downturn in the number of pop concerts; Reduced volume in the group's vegetable processing activities because of poor weather. Mr Masters said most of the problems were one-offs, but Aggreko faced continuing margin pressure in North America. Small operators had begun to challenge at the bottom end of the hire plant market in power generators. At the top end, competition was 'aggressive' from Caterpillar, the US plant manufacturer. Mr Masters said steps have been taken to reduce Aggreko's cost base, cutting the US workforce of 350 by about 10 per cent. Sales were being refocused towards bigger, higher-value contracts such as the US Superbowl, for which Aggreko supplied the power at the weekend, and temperature control. Salvesen said: 'By contrast, the group's distribution businesses around the world, which comprise 45 per cent of trading profits, continue to make good progress.' Mr Masters said Swift Distribution, acquired in October for Pounds 84m, was performing ahead of expectations and Salvesen Brick was continuing to experience increased demand and firmer prices.

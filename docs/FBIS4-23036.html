Tikhomirova, National  Scientific Research Institute of Food Biotechnology, Moscow; UDC  577.156:664.2.03:668.394]    [Abstract] The outlook for developing new methods of  bioconversion of various types of agricultural products for the  purpose of lysine production, thus making it possible greatly to  expand its raw material production base, and the possibility of  increasing the carbonlysine bioconversion yield and improving  the synthesis efficiency as well as saving the consumption of  plant substances necessary for lysine producers, e.g.  Brevibacteria, prompted a study of the effect of  proteases with a varying action specificity on the plant protein  proteolysis degree and subsequent substrate bioconversion by  lysine-producing bacteria. To this end, the  Brevibacteria sp. lysine-producer is cultivated in  750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of nutrient medium in a  circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM speed for 66-72 h at a  30 temperature. The nutrient medium preparation,  experimental procedure, and carbohydrate concentration  measurement methods are outlined. The total amount of amino  acids formed as a result of proteolysis is used as the basic  indicator of the proteolytic preparation suitability for plant  raw material conversion. Fungal protease from Aspergillus  oryzae 251-90 (G10kh) and bacterial protease from  Bacillus subtilis G10kh which have the necessary  proteolytic activity level for animal proteins within a 4.7-5.3  pH range are used for comparative characterization. The A.  oryzae 251-90 proteolytic enzymes containing a highly  active protease complex are the most active. The behavior of  amine nitrogen concentration in nutrient media under the effect  of proteolytic enzymes and the utilization efficiency of the  resulting hydrolysates in lysine biosynthesis by the  Brevibacteria sp. culture, the effect of A.  oryzae 251-90 proteases on the amino acid composition of  the plant nutrient medium, the protein amino acid content in the  Brevibacteria sp. culturing liquid in various media,  the free amino acid concentration in the culturing liquid during  the growth of Brevibacteria sp., and the growth amino  acid concentration in the nutrient media are summarized. The  growth, carbohydrate consumption, and lysine accumulation  dynamics are plotted. The A. oryzae 251-90 fungal  proteolytic enzymes also indirectly but significantly affect the  lysine-producing bacteria's biosynthetic activity. Nutrient  medium enrichment with well-metabolized amine nitrogen increases  the bioconversion efficacy of cereal and root tuber raw  materials and intensifies lysine and protein biosynthesis and  bacteria accumulation.

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Test for firm money policy THE success of the transfer to New Zealand's central bank of control over monetary policy will be fully tested in the next few years by more rapid economic growth, the OECD says in a review of the country's Reserve Bank Act, writes Terry Hall. In its latest survey of New Zealand, the OECD says the act, which makes price stability the sole objective of monetary policy, has 'significantly enhanced' policy credibility over the past two years in securing low inflation targets. 'Despite the exchange rate depreciation of 1991, the adjusted CPI increase, used as a measure of underlying inflation, is still running at the bottom of the Reserve Bank interim target band for 1992 of 1.5 to 3.5 per cent, and is expected to remain within the target range of nil to 2 per cent to the end of this year.' The OECD said the recession had contributed to the achievement, but the existence of the target had seemingly strengthened the resolve of the authorities to take necessary (monetary policy) measures. 'The importance of the act lies in its future contribution to sustained price stability.' It said this will be tested in the coming years.</p>

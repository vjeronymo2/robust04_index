			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Continental Baking Loses Lawsuit: A U.S. District Court jury in San Francisco  found that Continental Baking Co., maker of Wonder Bread, violated California  antitrust laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  </P> <P> The jury awarded $390,000 to Gordon Bread Co., a Los Angeles-based family-owned  bakery that was bought by Certified Grocers in 1974, according to a lawyer for  Gordon. Gordon was one of several independent bakeries that sued Continental  and other big bakeries in 1971, alleging a plan to drive small rivals out of  business by monopolizing the private-label bread business. Both sides are  expected to appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / IBM to withdraw Ambra PCs in Europe International Business Machines is withdrawing its Ambra range of low-cost personal computers in Europe and closing Individual Computer Products International (ICPI), the subsidiary it set up to market Ambra products. It intends to concentrate on its own brands of low-cost PCs. Industry experts said the move underlined consumer preference for well-known brands of PC over less well-known ones, ucts, where there is little price difference. Competitors, including Compaq of the US which is vying with IBM for global leadership in PCs, said it removed an aggressive competitor at the lower end of the market. They were concerned, however, that IBM's own brands would prove stiffer rivals. IBM said 64 jobs would go at ICPI, but most were fixed contract or agency staff. It said that its own low-cost branded products had proved so successful that it made no sense to maintain two competing lines. ICPI has sold some 140,000 computers and gained 1 per cent share of the European PC market since it was launched in June 1992. According to Dataquest, a US marketing consultancy, IBM has 14.7 per cent of that market. Mr Bill McCracken, head of European operations for the IBM PC Company, said changes in the structure of the market forced the closure: 'It is clear we can optimise both our customer offerings and financial returns by focusing on our IBM branded products.' The closure of ICPI ends one of IBM's more unusual European marketing strategies. Its market share had been under attack from 'clone' manufacturers, which build PCs to IBM designs but at much lower cost. IBM's strategy through the 1980s had been to build premium products at premium prices. The clones undercut this as customers realised there was little difference in quality between low-cost clones and expensive premium machines. IBM launched the Ambra range - IBM clones without IBM's name - as an interim measure in Europe and Canada while it developed its low-cost ValuePoint, PS/1 and ThinkPad ranges. Dixons, the high-street retailer, sells Ambra computers under its Advent brand. It said yesterday it intended to continue selling the Advent range and was selecting a new supplier, with IBM as a possibility.</p>

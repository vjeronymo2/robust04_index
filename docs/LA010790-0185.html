			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN LEAVING CLEVELAND STADIUM IS KILLED IN FALL FROM ESCALATOR  </P> <P> A man who attended Saturday's NFL playoff game at Cleveland Stadium was killed  when he fell from the side of an escalator, police said.  </P> <P> The Cuyahoga County coroner's office identified the man as Daniel Bulmahn, 52,  of Tonawanda, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb.  </P> <P> The incident occurred moments after the Cleveland Browns defeated the Buffalo  Bills, 34-30.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no indication of any horseplay or fight," said police  dispatcher Michael Goga. "It was purely an accident, according to his friends."  </P> <P> Goga said Bulmahn and several friends were on the escalator from the upper  level of the stadium when Bulmahn apparently stumbled and fell over the side,  18 to 25 feet onto William Bauer, 31, of Vickery, Ohio. Bauer suffered a minor  head injury, Goga said.  </P></p>

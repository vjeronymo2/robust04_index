			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / State-run groups get used to new identity: Europe's governments are finding both political and commercial reasons for turning to privatisation Privatisation in Europe seems to have acquired an unstoppable momentum. Across the Continent, the idea that the state should own or operate commercial assets has lost its political force. In some cases, governments are driven to privatise by the need to reduce their ballooning deficits. But there is another powerful and deep-seated argument, that of commercial logic. In a growing number of sectors, from telecommunications to cars, there is competitive pressure on companies to form cross-border alliances. The private sector is reluctant to get involved with state-owned companies. For many of Europe's state-owned giants, privatisation has thus become a condition for staying in the game. If the political argument is secondary, it is still important. In Italy, for instance, it matters a great deal whether privatised companies should end up controlled by a handful of old-style industrial empires or should have a wide shareholder base. If the former, runs the argument, the country cannot put its scandal-ridden past behind it. Thus, privatisation becomes in itself a political weapon, as it was in the UK in the early 1980s. FRANCE: The French programme, launched last October by the centre-right government of the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, is Europe's largest. It involves 21 public sector groups and should raise more than FFr250bn (Pounds 28.70bn). The implications go far beyond a much-needed boost to budgetary receipts. Some of France's most powerful industrial and financial groups, such as Elf-Aquitaine, Renault and Union des Assurances de Paris, should soon be in private hands. The government is also motivated by a desire to ease the shackles on state industry and encourage efficiency. 'The French government should not be in the business of making cars,' said industry minister Mr Gerard Longuet, referring to plans to privatise Renault. The programme has got off to a strong start. The first two privatisation issues - Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the country's biggest banks, and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group - were heavily oversubscribed by both individual and institutional investors. The biggest operation on the list, the sale of most of the government's 51 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, was launched last week. The sale of a large part of public sector industry will mean an extension of alliances between French business groups. The absence of powerful pension funds, and the government's desire to ensure management stability and the French identity of privatised companies, has led to the development of the so-called noyau dur - core groups of long-term investors. Some companies on the privatisation list, such as Rhone Poulenc, have behaved like private sector companies for many years. But the state will retain an influence. In the first few privatisations launched by the Balladur government, for example, some of the core shareholders are themselves state-owned companies. More directly, the government will retain a golden share in some of the privatisation candidates deemed to be strategically important or politically sensitive, such as Elf. Political influence may also work at a personal level. While avoiding a witch hunt of chief executives of public sector groups, Mr Balladur has installed his own appointees at several key posts. GERMANY: The federal government in Germany is pressing ahead slowly but steadily with its privatisation plans, including its jewel, Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly. The 16 state governments, as well as local authorities, are showing far less enthusiasm, with the notable exception of Bavaria. The privatisation process for Deutsche Telekom, valued at between DM40bn (Pounds 15.60bn) and DM60bn, is at the point of decision. Cross-party agreement is necessary to change the constitution, as it will be to sell the 51 per cent stake the government still holds in Lufthansa, the loss-making national airline. In both cases, it is not so much concern over future ownership of the assets that is holding up the process, as fears over the jobs and pensions of state employees. The government's chief success so far has been in selling off random bits and pieces of the portfolio, rather than headline-catching jewels. In December, it sold its remaining 50 per cent of the Industrieverwaltungsgesellschaft (IVG), a property holding company, for some DM700m. The most mature plans now are for the sale of the government publishing venture, Bundesanzeiger Verlagsgesellschaft, motorway service stations (Autobahn Rast und Tank AG) and Rhein-Main-Donau AG, which built the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, jointly owned with Bavaria. The latter has promised to dispose of some DM2bn of its assets, with a deal already done on the sale of Bayernwerk, Germany's third-largest electricity utility. Other plum state shareholdings under fire include Lower Saxony's 20 per cent holding in Volkswagen, and North Rhine-Westphalia's 43.5 per cent stake in the Westdeutsche Landesbank, the most acquisitive of Germany's public sector banks. Neither of those Social Democrat-ruled states shows any sign of wishing to dispose of their lucrative investments, in spite of the acute financial squeeze on all their exchequers. ITALY: After a series of false starts, Italy's ambitious privatisation programme began in earnest last year. The list of assets for sale covers the most successful subsidiaries of the big Iri and Eni state holding companies. Disposals began late in 1993, with the privatisation of Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh-biggest bank, raising about L1,750bn (Pounds 697.10m). In December, Eni followed with its Nuovo Pignone engineering arm for about L1,100bn. The focus this year is on the banking sector. On January 31, the treasury will float about half its controlling stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big Rome-based financial services group, for up to L2,200bn. Banca Commerciale Italiana, another IRI-controlled bank, will follow in February. IRI will dispose of its entire 57 per cent stake, valuing the transaction at about L2,500bn. The remaining deals are less advanced. Investors should be offered a first tranche of shares in the big Ina life insurance group by the middle of this year. And 1994 should close with the sale of a first slice of shares in Enel, Italy's electricity generating authority. The timing for privatisations scheduled for 1995 is less certain. According to the treasury's forecast, the year should bring the disposal of much of the Stet telecommunications group, restructured into Telecom Italia, and the sale of a large proportion of Eni's oil and gas activities, probably under the well-known Agip banner. The deals have been accompanied by measures to stimulate popular share ownership and increase liquidity on the relatively small Milan bourse. Not all these plans have been successful. But probably the biggest stimulus has come from outside the government's orbit. The fall in interest rates worldwide has revived interest in the equity market, pumping billions of lira into equity funds and leading to a much greater public awareness of the potential attractions of the bourse. PORTUGAL: The weight of state-owned companies in the Portuguese economy is due to be halved by the time the current term of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, ends in October 1995. The main aim is to reverse a wave of Communist-led nationalisations that turned key industries and almost all the financial sector over to state control following the 1974 revolution. A key aim of the centre-right government is to promote the growth of private Portuguese entrepreneurial groups. It has imposed limits of around 25 per cent on foreign holdings in most privatised companies. Forthcoming privatisations include the second phase of the sale of the state oil company Petrogal, Banco Sotto &amp; Pinto Mayor and the steel company Siderurgia Nacional. GREECE: Greece's privatisation programme has been thrown into disarray by the victory of Mr Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government in last year's elections. No renationalisation is expected. However, the Socialists called off the proposed sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE, the telecoms company, and have frozen agreements with foreign financial advisers.

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local should mean local Sir, My observation of local government re-organisation in Cleveland leads me to believe you are wrong in arguing for two-tier strategic and service authorities ('Local difficulties', December 22). The evidence suggests that by moving to unitary authorities substantial administrative savings can be made, producing a lower tax burden for individuals and businesses. Most services will benefit from being provided by a single authority. The overlap between authorities leading to public confusion and duplication of bureaucracy can be removed. The question is, should the move to single-tier authorities be upwards to the 'strategic' level, or downwards to the public. You argue, unconvincingly, for both. Surely the most desirable level of local government corresponds to its principal role - provision of practical and personal services to the local population and to groups in particular need in the community. You can argue about economies of scale, pointing to the creation of large, mega-authorities such as the Teesside-wide authority being advocated by some to replace Cleveland County Council. But the logic of 'local' services suggests that, as far as possible, they should be delivered by councils which are elected by local people and remain as near, accountable and sensitive to the needs of those people. What, then, should be the 'strategic' dimension at local government? I think it is wrong to argue, as you do, that this can be genuinely accommodated by a council the size of a county or slightly larger. Cleveland County Council, for example, adds little in any economic or other planning sense to what the district councils are doing among themselves already or what they could achieve through shared arrangements with much less rigmarole than at present. A truly strategic dimension might then be reflected in a regional level of government but still with local services provided by unitary authorities which mirror local communities and public preferences. Where possible, that is the downwards direction in which reorganisation should go. Peter Mandelson, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELEGANT HOMES HIDE PLUNDER IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> Massive iron gates seal off the luxurious quarters here where senior officials  of the East German government and Communist Party have made their homes for  years.  </P> <P> Behind the gates and a concrete wall, amid stands of birch, pine and spruce,  are the elegant homes of the now-discredited leaders, including deposed  President Erich Honecker, who on Tuesday was placed under house arrest.  </P> <P> Throughout the country, the old leaders are being angrily condemned for living  in a grand manner while much of the populace scraped by. And they are accused  of much worse: of plundering public accounts and socking away their illicit  fortunes in foreign banks, of engaging in profitable but illegal export  schemes, of building lavish retreats with public money.  </P> <P> Since the party's grip on East Germany began to unravel in October, previously  unimagined luxury has been disclosed. New reports of scandalous activity  surface almost daily, and they have had a powerful impact on ordinary East  Germans. For, under state socialism, everyone was supposed to have lived more  or less on the same scale.  </P> <P> It is the flagrant style of living that has enraged East Germans. Some  examples:  </P> <P>  -- Officials living in the Wandlitz compound, just north of Berlin, were  provided with large houses equipped with cable television and access to stores  filled with Western goods priced at about a seventh of what they would cost on  the open market. Among these officials are Honecker and former economics chief  Guenter Mittag. Until recently, Honecker's successor, Egon Krenz, lived there,  as did Guenter Schabowski, a senior member of the Politburo.  </P> <P>  -- Sumptuous hunting lodges were maintained at state expense near  Neubrandenburg for Honecker and Mittag.  </P> <P>  -- Former Prime Minister Willi Stoph had weekend retreats at Mecklenburg and  -- more upsetting to many -- in the forest preserve at Schorfheide, where  hundreds of square miles were set aside for the hunting of deer, boar and  birds. Millions of marks were said to have been allocated for the upkeep of  these retreats.  </P> <P>  -- Elaborate houses reportedly were built with state funds at Oranienburg for  relatives of Politburo members, including Mittag's daughters. Building  materials included Canadian hardwoods, and luxury features included inlaid  baths.  </P> <P> In the forest, an area was set aside for the private use of Harry Tisch, the  former state labor boss, with a "hunting castle" and a staff of 35 rangers.  </P> <P> On Vilm, an island in the Baltic Sea, the party maintained 11 residences with  marble baths, convection heating, saunas and tennis courts. The island was  declared a military zone in order to ensure privacy, while not far away, the  fishing harbor of Lauterbach was decaying due to neglect.  </P> <P> In addition, Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, former head of the department that  regulates foreign currency holdings, had various state-owned residences  including a showy home in Leipzig that was used only during the semiannual  trade fair. And Guenther Kleiber, a former first deputy prime minister, has  been accused of building a "supply facility" for a government ministry that  turned out to be a house with a sauna for his son.  </P> <P> One report in Berlin said residents of the Wandlitz compound have been selling  their stocks of luxury goods for hard currency, presumably to build a nest egg  against the possibility of having to flee the country.  </P> <P> According to reports that have just come to light, Honecker and Mittag were on  the payroll of a building society, as honorary members, and each received  20,000 marks a year -- almost $10,000 at the official exchange rate. Honecker  was ousted from his top post Oct. 18 and also has been expelled from the  Communist Party.  </P> <P> The East German news agency ADN said that all former members of the Politburo  "who after Oct. 19 were no longer members of the Politburo and who are still in  Wandlitz" were under house arrest. Deputy chief prosecutor Harri Haarland  called the house arrests an act of "national self-defense" resulting from "the  will of the people."  </P> <P> The chief prosecutor, Guenter Wendland, and one of his top deputies resigned  under fire after severe criticism of their failure to investigate widespread  corruption among current and former Communist officials.  </P> <P> Their resignations were followed by those of the entire leadership of the  despised security police, known as Stasi, who quit because of their own  inability to act against corruption, the official ADN news agency said late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Michael Goebel, assistant director of the Art and Antiques Museum in East  Berlin, told authorities that a firm controlled by Schalck-Golodkowski has been  forcing the museum to give up art objects for export in exchange for hard  currency.  </P> <P> Goebel said the company gave the museum works that could not be exported  because they are part of the national heritage in exchange for similar objects  that had not yet been so designated by official art historians.  </P> <P> He said agents representing the Schalck-Golodkowski firm put pressure on  private citizens to sell artworks at far below the market price. The owners, he  said, were told that they had not paid a required tax on their possessions and  would either have to surrender them or go to prison for tax evasion.  </P> <P> Schalck-Golodkowski was also said to have been involved with IMES, an arms  firm, which had a depot near the Baltic port of Rostock filled with weapons and  ammunition for export. People of the area were not notified that dangerous  materials were stored virtually on their doorstep.  </P> <P> Schalck-Golodkowski has left the country within the past few days. Some believe  he was helped by other officials in order to prevent him from implicating them  in his operations.  </P> <P> His lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was detained on suspicion of "criminal extortion."  Vogel, a confidant of Honecker, has been involved in a number of spectacular  East-West prisoner swaps.  </P> <P> According to investigating officials, Schalck-Golodkowski appears to have had a  hand in foreign trading operations worth billions of marks, most of which has  not been properly accounted for.  </P> <P> Even sports has not been spared. The Berlin soccer team Dynamo has been accused  of winning its many championships in the East German league by means of fixed  contests.  </P> <P> Dynamo's president, Erich Mielke, was until recently a member of the Politburo  in charge of state security. His team won the national championship in 10 of  the last 12 years but failed regularly to do well against foreign competition.  </P> <P> Wolfgang Spitner, head of the East German Soccer Assn., has pointed out that  Dynamo's domestic victories often came in overtime, after questionable  penalties had been assessed against the opposing team.  </P> <P> A recent search of the sports association offices turned up 291,000 marks  (almost $150,000) in currency in various desks. There was no accounting for the  cash.  </P> <P> Corruption also reached into the rural areas. In the village of Rottleberode,  in the Harz Mountains, former Mayor Edeltraut Tielo was brought before an ad  hoc court, stripped of her title and charged with personal enrichment at public  expense. She is now taunted and threatened in the streets.  </P> <P> Such situations are said to be commonplace in much of the country.  </P> <P> The reaction has been fierce. The daily Berliner Zeitung, which formerly  supported the regime, said in an editorial: "We -- and that means all honest  Communist Party members and the entire people -- say, 'This swamp must finally  be drained, no matter how much mud has to be dredged out.' "  </P> <P> The newspaper of the National Democratic Party commented that "millions of  people in this country feel that they have been seduced and victimized in a way  that reminds them of 1945 (the year World War II ended)."  </P> <P> A journalist said privately: "These reports of corruption have moved us to the  edge of the abyss."  </P> <P> The average East German is also shocked. A university graduate student  complained: "The question of corruption means the dissolution of the Communist  Party. It's the blue-collar workers and people like nurses who are very, very  upset about stories of corruption. We are seeing reality as it is."  </P> <P> A worker at a building site in East Berlin said: "It's disgusting the way (the  party leaders) live -- and meanwhile they were preaching to us to work harder  for socialism."  </P> <P> A low-level government official: "I have to wait up to 15 years for a car or an  apartment, and now I see what they had. Nobody is going to vote for a party  with people like that in it."  </P> <P> Museum director Goebel's wife told a reporter: "My husband has been in the  party for nearly 30 years, and I for 20 years. Things are coming out that  nobody dreamed of. We are very disillusioned people."  </P> <P> In the town of Wandlitz, adjacent to the elite housing compound, Mayor Reinhard  Haennerling takes pains to let visitors know that the town "has nothing to do  with the 'settlement.' "  </P> <P> "Everyone," he told a visitor, "is angry about the way they lived here. I  condemn it."  </P> <P> Haennerling, who displayed a party pin in his lapel, slapped his desk and  declared:  </P> <P> "I'm getting calls every day from around the country telling me to do something  about the situation. But this Communist bosses' settlement is not even in my  city limits.  </P> <P> "These settlement people never even came to our town -- just drove through.  This is a very bad thing for the party. Many people here are leaving it. I  still wear my party pin, but many other members no longer do. This corruption  has left me personally very disappointed.  </P> <P> "We in the party have to come absolutely clean. Everything must now be made  public. The citizens don't believe in us any more. In an election now, we  wouldn't win."  </P> <P> CZECHS FORM COALITION -- The Czech Lands area OKd a non-Communist Cabinet. A12  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / ANC rejects de Klerk's call for resumed talks MR Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, last night angrily rejected President F W de Klerk's call for a resumption of constitutional negotiations and said a campaign of mass action against the government would go ahead. In the latest of a series of accusations and counter-accusations between the two men, Mr Mandela said 'the path of negotiations to bring about democracy is deadlocked'. 'The essence of the crisis,' he told a press conference in Johannesburg last night, 'is that the ruling National Party keeps looking for ways to exercise power even if it loses a democratic election.' The often bitter and ill-tempered exchange triggered off by last month's massacre of 42 residents of the black township of Boipatong has not only confirmed the wide division between the ANC's demand for a constitution based on majority rule and Mr de Klerk's concept of power-sharing. It has also poisoned the political climate and destroyed much, if not all, of the trust and goodwill that once existed between the two leaders. Unless international efforts to break the deadlock succeed, it now seems inevitable that August 3, the date on which a general strike is scheduled to begin, together with other forms of 'mass action', will mark the start of a dangerous confrontation between the ANC and government. Although Mr Mandela last night called on all South Africans to 'ensure that the mass campaign for democracy is peaceful and disciplined', most observers believe that outbreaks of violence in the current highly charged atmosphere are almost inevitable. In a 24-page memorandum to Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela said that although there was agreement that South Africa faced a 'serious crisis', when it came to charting a way out of the crisis 'it is clear that there are hardly any points of convergence'. Going on to reiterate the ANC belief that the government's objective is to secure a minority-party veto in a post-apartheid constitution, and renewing allegations of government complicity in the violence, Mr Mandela said: 'To call for face-to-face talks in such a situation is entirely unacceptable.'</p>

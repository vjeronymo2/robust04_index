			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Figures on minimum wages and jobs released Most leading market economies with national minimum wage laws achieved higher employment growth rates than Britain in the past 14 years, the Department of Employment has admitted. The official government figures show that between 1980 and 1990 employment grew 25.4 per cent in Australia, 18.4 per cent in the US, 12.9 per cent in Japan and 7.3 per cent in Spain. This compares with 1.5 per cent in the UK. The figures were provided in a parliamentary answer by the department to Mr Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham. Between 1990 and 1993, while there was a small net increase of 1.2 per cent in the US employment growth rate and falls of 2.6 per cent in Australia and 5.9 per cent in Spain, there was a net decline of 4.6 per cent in Britain. The employment department statistics appear to conflict with the government's fundamental belief that the existence of national minimum wage laws lead to job losses. Mr MacShane said yesterday: 'No minister in the future should have the cheek to stand up and tell the lie to the House of Commons that a legal minimum wage is a job killer.' He added, however, that while a legal minimum wage did not cost jobs, it would do so if it was set at 'an absurdly high level close to national average earnings'. The Labour party is discussing what figure should be set for a national minimum wage. Many union leaders believe it should be about Pounds 4 an hour while a number of senior Labour MPs say that it should be closer to Pounds 3 an hour. Mr MacShane said: 'The Tories think that their claim that a national minimum wage in Britain would cost jobs is, in the words of their deputy chairman Mr John Maples, a killer fact to be used against the Labour party. Now the government's own figures show ministers have been lying.' The employment department figures come as an embarrassment to Mr John Major and his senior cabinet colleagues, who have continued to say in recent weeks that the Labour party's general commitment to the introduction of a national minimum wage would destroy employment in Britain. Mr MacShane said last night: 'If other countries which have more dynamic economies and better job creation records than the UK can have a national minimum wage, it is high time that British workers enjoy one too.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bobkov, chairman of the Central Committee </F> of the "Trade Unity" Trade Union: "The Course: Transformations  and Reforming"]    [Text] To work so that every trade-union member is  convinced: professionals sincerely devoted to their jobs and  capable of protecting the economic, social, and labor rights of  their members work in our trade union.    However, I will not hide the fact that every forward step  will not come easy. The plenum took the course of reforming the  entire activity of the trade union, determining the basic  directions in reform: personnel, organizational structure,  social partnership, receipt and use of membership dues, and  information support. Therefore, we will have to work, as the  saying goes, rolling up our sleeves and not complaining about  difficulties. Everyone will have to work--from the chairman of  the trade-union central committee to the chairman of a republic,  kray, and oblast trade-union committee and of a primary  trade-union organization.    The plenum of the trade-union central committee did not  become an ordinary event held according to the traditional  scheme. In my opinion, the speeches by my colleagues are  interesting and their thoughts and deeds are not standard.    The following is the plenum's special feature: having given  recommendations and having adopted decisions, the plenum--and  this is the basic thing--developed the mechanism of reforming  and the principles of transforming and changing trade-union  activity. The plenum also gave the following advice: to work  more actively with government structures, using only a  constructive and reasoned dialogue. Applying this form of mutual  relations, we have already solved a number of problems in favor  of the sector's workers. I will recall the recent one: jointly  with Russia's State Committee on the Administration of State  Property an agreement on principles of interaction under  privatization was signed. What does this document give? First of  all, it makes it possible to more efficiently protect the  interests of labor collectives against arbitrary decisions of  the local administration and regional committees on property and  to carry out privatization on the basis of law and order. You  will agree that this is not all that little.    The following opinion has existed since time immemorial:  there is a central apparatus, let it think. And if something is  amiss in the trade union, it will be made responsible for this.  The plenum posed the question differently. In no way relieving  the trade-union central committee of responsibility for work on  protecting the interests and rights of trade-union members at  the federal level, the plenum, proceeding from the objectively  existing situation, considered it necessary to increase the  responsibility of republic, kray, and oblast committees in the  solution of socioeconomic problems affecting the vital interests  of workers in regions and in the establishment of an equitable  system of social partnership.    Is this necessary? Yes. I will say openly: the sector does  not have an efficiently operating system of social partnership.    An analysis shows that at almost every second enterprise  collective contracts are drawn up formally, almost one-half of  our workers do not know at all that at present the collective  contract is the only legal form of collective regulation of  mutual relations between entrepreneurs and workers at  enterprises, and only 10 percent of the workers effectively  realize their rights through collective contracts. Statistics on  territorial and sectorial agreements are also distressing. They  were concluded in only 10 regions! What did the plenum decide?  What life itself and the interests of trade workers demand under  market conditions: in 1994 it is necessary to regulate relations  and social guarantees through collective contracts of  enterprises and to ensure the signing of territorial tripartite  agreements. A complex task? It is not simple, but we must  accomplish it in order to serve our purpose.    The trade-union central committee made proposals for the  general agreement for 1994 concluded among the government,  trade-union associations, and Russia's entrepreneurs. All of  them were examined and taken into account. The composition of  the Russian Tripartite Commission was formed. More than 70  all-Russian trade unions and associations have formed the  trade-union unit of the Russian Tripartite Commission out of 28  trade-union leaders. It also includes a representative of our  trade union.    What is my forecast? Work in the commission will make it  possible to raise our problems before the government and to seek  ways of solving them.    The plenum also approved the position of the trade-union  central committee with respect to elections to the State Duma. I  will recall that we not only actively supported the political  movement "Russia's Women" during the preelection campaign, but  also concluded an agreement on cooperation. Today candidates for  deputies from the movement "Russia's Women" have received more  than 20 mandates. A working meeting with the leaders of this  movement--A. Fedulova and Ye. Lakhova--was held. The principles  of our relations were refined and a program of actions was  outlined at it.    The plenum also made the following conclusion: the trade  union will be able to operate only if it is strong financially.  What must be done for this? First of all, it is necessary to  reform the entire system of collection and expenditure of  trade-union dues and to create financial stability from the  primary trade-union organization to the trade-union central  committee, concentrating the bulk of the funds at the  territorial and sectorial level in special trade-union funds. If  we do not do this, we will be doomed. Of course, the essence of  the problem lies in how to do this. It is impossible to ignore  the settled traditional view of the role of the trade union as  an organization where one can receive some social and material  benefits (passes, places in children's preschool institutions,  and so forth). Such an attitude toward trade unions is not  speculative. Not long ago about 60 percent of the members  confirmed it when they were questioned at the Moscow Oblast  Regional Trade Union of Trade Workers. It is impossible not to  take this into consideration, as well as the fact that the  financial situation in the trade union is critical. Many primary  organizations have not developed a system of monthly collection  of membership dues and of control over the completeness of  collection with due regard for the total income of trade-union  members and spend trade-union funds inefficiently. The  possibility of receiving income from the deposit of temporarily  free balances of monetary assets in banks is not utilized. There  are numerous cases (especially where chairmen are not exempt  from primary jobs) of delay by the administration in deductions  of dues and their use for economic needs. Many primary  organizations transfer part of the funds to republic, kray, and  oblast trade-union committees irregularly and, moreover, not in  a full volume.    The plenum determined the basic directions in the  strengthening of the trade union's financial stability--rise in  the level of organizational work and permanent control over the  course of collection of membership dues and over prompt  deductions into trade-union committees. Gradually, while  constantly informing primary organizations of the results  attained by the trade union with respect to the protection of  workers' interests, to strive for the redistribution of funds  between the primary organization and oblast, kray, and republic  trade-union committees.    Are we on the correct path? The plenum answered: Yes! Today  there is no other path.    Under market conditions the role of the trade union is  changing fundamentally. A new financial policy should correspond  to this change. Now finances are needed not so much in order to  provide assistance to primary organizations for conducting all  kinds of cultural activities (although this is important in  itself) as to train trade-union workers, to establish a strong  legal and economic service, and to form special funds.    The plenum approved the practice of a number of trade-union  committees, which use the collective insurance of trade-union  members at the expense of part of the trade-union dues for the  establishment of a real mechanism for their social protection,  redistribution of trade-union dues, and increase in the  motivation for membership in the trade union. Among the reform  paths of development of the trade union, for the purpose of  increasing the mutual responsibility of primary trade-union  organizations, republic, kray, and oblast trade-union  committees, and the trade-union central committee for the  fulfillment of statutory requirements, the plenum considered it  useful to change over to a system of contractual relations. The  trade-union central committee worked out and sent a draft  contract on mutual relations to all trade-union  committees--membership organizations.    The establishment of a single information field is one of  the  basic directions in reform. It is extremely important that the  trade-union aktiv and every trade-union member know their rights  and the forms and methods of protecting their interests. For  these purposes a plan of publications by specialists of the  trade-union central committee was worked out. TORGOVAYA GAZETA  constantly acquaints you with their materials. The issue of an  information bulletin of the trade-union central  committee--TORGOVOYE YEDINSTVO [TRADE UNITY]--was organized. The  issue of our first number--GOLOS PROFSOYUZA [VOICE OF THE TRADE  UNION]--was prepared.    Will we fulfill what has been envisaged? I am confident that  we will, if in the new year we work a great deal and with  efficiency. It is impossible otherwise. Trade, public catering,  consumer cooperative, and entrepreneurship workers must have a  strong authoritative trade union. Our duty is to justify their  trust.</p>

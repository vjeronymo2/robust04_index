			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Eduard Popov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok March 18 TASS -- A rally in support of  ex-Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov was held on Thursday night  on Vladivostok central square. The ex-mayor's supporters  estimated his removal from the post as a "gross violation of  human rights, non-observation of the Russian constitution and  laws and the return to 1937".    The rally attended by several hundred persons adopted a  resolution to demand that the higher instances remove Maritime  governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and Maritime procurator Valeriy  Vasilenko from their posts.    A reason for the demand of Vasilenko's resignation is "the  lack of the territorial procurator's office control over  lawfulness and permission of the eviction of the legitimately-  elected mayor from his study with the use of force".    According to reliable sources, Viktor Cherepkov has gone on  a  hunger strike and is staying at home.    As for ex-mayor's Deputy Vladimir Gilgenberg, pushed out  from  the mayor's office, he has not been produced any documents to  substantiate his removal from the mayor deputy post. Asked  about reasons for this situation, senior assistant of the  Maritime Territorial Procurator Veniamin Chichayev told  ITAR-TASS "It is not the business of the procurator's office,  and acting Vladivostok Mayor Konstantin Tolstoshein has the  right to choose his deputies himself".    Criminal proceedings instituted against Viktor Cherepkov on  charge of major bribe-taking in February 1994 have been taken  over by the Russian procurator general's office.</p>

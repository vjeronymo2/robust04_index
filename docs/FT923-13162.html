			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola improves 20.4% to Dollars 581m COCA-Cola, the Atlanta-based soft drinks group, yesterday reported a 20.4 per cent improvement in second-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 581m. Earnings per share improved by a slightly larger 22.2 per cent, to 44 cents, compared with 36 cents a year ago. Sales during the second quarter reached Dollars 3.55bn, up 16.8 per cent over the same period in 1991. Coca-Cola said that unit case sales in its domestic market fell by 1 per cent, and gallon sales of concentrates and syrups by 2.5 per cent, as stocks were run down. However, in Europe warm weather and heavy marketing lifted second-quarter unit sales by 14 per cent year-on-year. This included gains of 25 per cent in France, 17 per cent in Britain and 12 per cent each in Germany and Italy. Coca-Cola said worldwide soft drink volume continued to advance in the second quarter, with international unit case sales increasing 4 per cent and gallon sales advancing 3 per cent despite softness in the high volume markets of Brazil and Mexico. First-half net income advanced to Dollars 964.1m from Dollars 803.3m in the previous year on sales which rose to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.5bn. Earnings per share for the period were lifted to 73 cents from 60 cents.</p>

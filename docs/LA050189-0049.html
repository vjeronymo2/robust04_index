			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AF SEEKING $1.2 BILLION TO FIX TROUBLED B-1B BOMBER  </P> <P> The Air Force has proposed to spend $1.2 billion to repair and improve the  troubled B-1B bomber over the next five years but has acknowledged that none of  the $250-million planes may ever work as promised, congressional sources said  Sunday.  </P> <P> One key lawmaker has balked at the cost of the fixes, most of which would be  paid for by funds already approved by Congress more than four years ago.  </P> <P> Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told  members of the panel that the B-1B's inability to penetrate Soviet airspace as  advertised at the outset of the program may force Congress to redefine the  plane's mission.  </P> <P> "Is this the time, then, to make the fundamental decisions about the role of  the B-1B?" Aspin asked in a memorandum circulating Sunday among committee  members. "Should funds be spent on it to maintain its role as a penetrating  bomber, or should it be used in a standoff role?" Aspin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delivery of Missiles  </P> <P> In a standoff role, the aircraft would be used as a delivery platform for  cruise missiles, which would be fired at targets within the Soviet Union from  outside Soviet airspace.  </P> <P> The Air Force has informed Congress that it will use $725 million in  appropriated but unspent Pentagon funds to correct problems with the plane's  electronic jamming system -- almost $200 million more than anticipated just two  months ago.  </P> <P> In addition, the service has proposed a $489-million "improvement program" in  which new radar warning receivers would be installed in the nation's 97 B-1Bs  over the next five years.  </P> <P> A radar warning receiver would alert B-1B flight crews to potential attackers  on the ground below or in the air ahead.  </P> <P> The Air Force has argued that neither proposal would breach a $25-billion cost  limit that former President Ronald Reagan had imposed and Congress had approved  for the program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technically Correct  </P> <P> By using $725 million in funds already appropriated and by defining the  $489-million radar warning receivers as an "improvement" rather than as a  repair, the Air Force is technically correct. But, Aspin said, if the proposed  fixes are accurately characterized as addressing shortcomings in the Air Force  program, they would amount to a breach of the cost limit.  </P> <P> Aspin and others have noted that decisions about repairs to the plane -- as  well as about the uses to which it would be put in a nuclear war -- must be  made now. If they are not, the B-1B may not be able ever to minimally perform  its mission after 1994, Aspin said. The plane's performance in 1994 has become  more crucial since the Air Force began encountering technical difficulties in  developing the successor to the B-1B, the stealth B-2 bomber, which is  scheduled to be in service shortly after 1994.  </P> <P> Those difficulties became evident to Aspin's committee from a recent Air Force  request to shift $297 million from B-2 production funds back into research and  development of the craft.  </P> <P> The Air Force has delayed the stealth bomber's first flight, citing an  accumulation of software problems. Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force chief of  staff, however, defended the program Saturday, predicting that the first flight  of the B-2 would take place within 60 days.  </P></p>

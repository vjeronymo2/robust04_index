			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NCAA'S PROP. 42 MAY BE SET FOR OVERHAUL  </P> <P> The impact of John Thompson's one-man strike will come into clearer focus  starting Sunday, when the NCAA Convention opens in Dallas.  </P> <P> Thompson walked out of the Capital Centre last season just before tip-off of a  Georgetown-Boston College game. He was protesting the NCAA's passage of  controversial Proposition 42.  </P> <P> That measure would prevent freshmen who do not meet minimum academic standards  from receiving scholarship aid. The standards -- a 2.0 high school grade-point  average and a score of 700 or better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- were  adopted under Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Now, the Big East Conference is sponsoring legislation to rescind Proposition  42, largely on Thompson's argument that it is racially discriminatory. A  committee of university presidents also wants to change Proposition 42,  allowing such freshmen to receive financial aid based only on need.  </P> <P> Confused yet? By this time next week, the saga should make more sense.  </P> <P> "I think the presidents' proposal will be passed," Pac-10 Conference  Commissioner Tom Hansen said.  </P> <P> That proposal seems logical: "partial qualifiers" would still lose a year of  eligibility, but those in need would not be financially abandoned. That would  be unfair, given the $1 billion television contract the NCAA recently signed  with CBS.  </P> <P> By next year, the future of freshmen will come under closer scrutiny. The NCAA  is studying the possibility of making all freshmen ineligible, a policy  abandoned in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> "You won't see it this year," Hansen said. "But there's continuing concern  about putting 18-year-olds out there, with Dick Vitale screaming and millions  of people watching."  </P> <P> Back on the court, Louisiana State guard Chris Jackson adds admirers by the  day. He took a mild slump with him to Houston on Tuesday night, when LSU beat  Texas, 124-113.  </P> <P> Former NBA standout Calvin Murphy attended the Tigers' shoot-around earlier in  the day. He noticed that Jackson wasn't extending properly on his jump shot.  </P> <P> Problem corrected. Jackson scored 28 points -- in the first half. Texas then  went to a stifling box-and-one defense, keeping Jackson scoreless for the first  10:05 of the second half.  </P> <P> Big deal. Jackson scored 23 in the final 9:55 to finish with 51.  </P> <P> "Chris is better than I ever was," Murphy said. "He's a complete player. He had  51, and it was an easy 51. It was nothing spectacular. He got 51 tonight, and  tomorrow he could go out and get 50 assists."  </P> <P> A random observation: the class of '92, widely heralded as the best ever, has  justified its advance billing.  </P> <P> The biggest names -- Jackson, Syracuse forward Billy Owens and Georgetown  center Alonzo Mourning -- deserve first-team All-America consideration. But the  class' real strength lies with an abundance of less visible, very good players.  </P> <P> Duke's Christian Laettner, Notre Dame's LaPhonso Ellis, UCLA's Don MacLean and  Stanford's Adam Keefe anchor a strong group of low-post players. Outside  flashes such as Missouri's Anthony Peeler and the Arkansas tandem of Todd Day  and Lee Mayberry complete an impressive package.  </P> <P> This season's freshman class (of '93) appears guard-heavy. Georgia Tech's Kenny  Anderson already is a star, and classmates Bobby Hurley (Duke), Terry Dehere  (Seton Hall) and Calbert Cheaney (Indiana) have made a similarly smooth  transition to the college game.  </P> <P> Indiana's strong freshmen -- even without the departed Lawrence Funderburke --  have carried the Hoosiers to an impressive 10-0 start entering the Big Ten  season.  </P> <P> In the hoop-rich Hoosier State, though, rivalry can distort perspective. Asked  recently to evaluate the Big Ten race, Purdue Coach Gene Keady conveniently  omitted Indiana.  </P> <P> "As I thought at the beginning of the season, there are three teams in our  league that can win the national title -- Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota,"  Keady said. "Those are the teams everybody's looking for to win the Big Ten."  </P> <P> USC Coach George Raveling has denied rumors that he's talking to Miami Athletic  Director Sam Jankovich about taking over the Hurricanes.  </P> <P> Miami Coach Bill Foster is retiring at season's end, and Raveling remains on  shaky ground at USC. His contract runs through next season, when he expects a  strong recruiting class to infuse life into the perpetually bad Trojans.  </P> <P> "I think we're a year away," Raveling said. "Then if we can't do it, it ain't  nobody's fault but Raveling's."  </P> <P> Jankovich was the athletic director when Raveling coached at Washington State  (1972-83). Former Kentucky coach Eddie Sutton also has been mentioned as a  possible successor to Foster.  </P> <P> We leave you with this weird tale from Santa Clara:  </P> <P> Ron Reis, the Broncos' 7-foot-1, 285-pound center, recently was introduced to  professional wrestler Big John Studd (6-9, 350). Reis emerged toying with the  thought of giving wrestling a shot.  </P> <P> Kay Reis, Ron's mother, offered only one piece of advice.  </P> <P> "My mom said I should wrestle with a mask on, so I don't embarrass the family,"  Reis said.  </P></p>

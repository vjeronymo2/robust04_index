During a meeting with visiting Azerbaijan Foreign Minister  Gasan Gasanov at the Great Hall of the People this morning, Rong  said it was the common aspiration of the two countries to  further promote the development of bilateral economic and trade  ties with substance.    He proposed that bilateral cooperation be developed in  various ways and some joint ventures be set up in accordance  with the actual needs of both sides.    "The Chinese Government encourages its departments,  companies  and enterprises to carry out multi-form economic cooperation  with Azerbaijan," he said, while voicing the hope that the  Azerbaijan Government would in turn create a favorable  environment for this cooperation.    Reviewing the bilateral ties, Rong said the Chinese people  cherish fond feelings toward the Azerbaijan people and that  bilateral ties have marked progress in every field since the  setting-up of diplomatic relations.    In response, Gasanov said the Azerbaijan leaders put China  on  the list of priority countries with which Azerbaijan should  develop ties.    The two countries should foster even closer ties in more  fields, he said, adding that the Azerbaijan Government speaks  highly of China's policy of non-interference in other countries'  internal affairs and of developing friendly ties on the basis of  the five principles of co-existence.    During the meeting, Rong also briefed the visitors on  China's  reform and opening to the outside world.    He expressed the belief that Azerbaijan's economy would pick  up quickly, given a stable domestic situation and a favorable  international environment.    This morning, Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and  economic cooperation, also met Gasanov. They exchanged views on  the expansion of bilateral economic and trade relations.</p>

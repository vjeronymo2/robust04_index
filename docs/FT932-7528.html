			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Cookery: A perfect risotto from Italy's best THE International Food Exhibition is a biennial event at which producers and manufacturers hawk their wares to potential buyers in the retail and catering trades under the watchful eyes of the media at Earls Court, London. Some of the products are best-selling household names; others are still at the development stage, testing the market. As in a junk shop hunt or a bran tub lucky dip, there are plenty of no-nos to be found and a few gems. Happy discoveries for me this year included razor clams and other spankingly fresh seafoods from Padraic Mulloy of Co. Mayo, Ireland (tel: 098-41328); wild capers on the stalk, pickled in wine and as pretty as cherries, from VEA Lerida of Catalonia, Spain (3473-126 000); and splendid anchovies (whole salted and fillets in oil) plus Blancafort Madurat goat cheese imported from Spain by Brindisa of London (071-403 0282). The Italian contingent was bigger and stronger than ever before. I particularly liked the exquisitely creamy buffalo mozzarella from ABC co-operative farms centred on Caserta (0823-621 560); truffle products from Brezzi of Grosseto (0564-456 800); and a notable debut of offerings from Sardinia. Among these were a fine range of honeys (Agri-Sar: tel. 070-662 302); the best pecorino sardo I have ever tasted - a version intended for the table rather than cooking (Argiolas: 070-740 293); and a feather-light panettone made by the sourdough method and topped with sugar granules and almonds, like the Milanese Easter cake called Colomba (Murgia Salvatore: 070-924 5000). At the end of the day, the Italian Trade Centre hosted a reception for all the exhibitors in its pavilion plus a sprinkling of outsiders; several hundred people in all. The menu included truly excellent bruschetta; focaccia with sun-dried tomatoes; polenta wrapped round fontina cheese and prosciutto, egged and crumbed and fried; Parma ham with hand-made grissini; assorted salami and regional cheeses; lots of rocket and little artichokes fried in the Roman manner; pasta 'nasciata (moulded and baked Sicilian style); and risotto primavera. The highlight for me was the risotto - really delicious and a culinary near-miracle given the number of guests. Thirty kilos of rice was used, cooked in massive muscle-flexing panloads of 10-12 lb at a time. I went behind the scenes to watch work in progress and found the jolliest kitchen team imaginable, including: chef Mauro Bregoli of the Old Manor House in Romsey, Hampshire, tel: 0794-517353, (in whose kitchens I once spent a happy day lending a hand with salami-making after a pig-killing); Franco Taruschio of The Walnut Tree Inn near Abergavenny, in Gwent (0873-852797), whose fans will rejoice in the news that Pavilion Books is shortly to publish his Leaves From the Walnut Tree; and Pietro Pesce, of Danmar International, importer of much of the best Italian produce into the UK - and mastermind behind the risotto recipe below - and food writer Anna Del Conte. Franco Taruschio had brought his entire brigade with him, a bright, enthusiastic and hardworking bunch of young people, all British save one, an American girl. It was a long and arduous day for them. They had set out from Wales at crack of dawn bringing everything with them bar the kitchen stove. After the reception Taruschio was taking them out on the town far baldoria (to have fun), before driving back to Abergavenny. That's what I like about the Italians: their sense of enjoyment of everything to do with good food. RISOTTO PRIMAVERA This is the delectable risotto as cooked by Bregoli and Pesce, scaled down to modest quantities suitable for the domestic kitchen - enough to serve four people as a first course or three as a main dish. Ingredients: 5-6 oz asparagus; 3-4 baby artichokes; 4 oz very small courgettes; 4 oz peas (shelled weight); 1 garlic clove, chopped finely; 2 tablespoons finely-chopped onion; 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 oz butter; 2 tablespoons wine; 9 oz carnaroli rice; 2 pt chicken or vegetable stock; a bunch of flat-leafed parsley, chopped; 1 1/2 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Method: Shell the peas and trim the asparagus, artichokes and courgettes as appropriate. Blanch all four vegetables separately and drain well. Cut the asparagus into short lengths and dice the courgettes. Chop the artichokes into small pieces and scoop the flavoursome marrow from the stalks. Heat the stock until just simmering and keep it at simmering point. Heat the oil and half the butter in a heavy-based pan and saute the onion and garlic until tender. Stir the rice into the onion pan and cook for two minutes. Splash on the wine and boil rapidly until reduced. Add a ladle of stock and let the rice absorb it, stirring constantly. Continue to add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring frequently until the rice is cooked. Halfway through cooking, start adding the blanched and chopped vegetables. Begin with the asparagus stalks, as they are hardest and will take longest to become tender. Next add the artichokes and peas, then the courgettes and, finally, the asparagus tips and artichoke marrow. When the rice is done, draw the pan away from the heat, season with salt and pepper and add half the chopped parsley. Stir in the remaining 1 oz butter (cut into small pieces) and the Parmesan. Cover the pan tightly with its lid and let it stand for a couple of minutes. Then stir the risotto vigorously again, transfer it to a heated dish, decorate with the remaining parsley and serve straight away.</p>

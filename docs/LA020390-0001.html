			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODBYS TO THE SHOE, FOND AND OTHERWISE  </P> <P> If I still had all the money I've lost wagering on favorites ridden by Bill  Shoemaker plus the cash he's beaten me out of atop longshots, I could retire,  too.  </P> <P> Now that the Shoe is calling it a career, do you think he would consider  spending his retirement standing out in my front yard in his jockey silks? I  think he owes me that much.  </P> <P> CHARLES M. ROSE, Temple City  </P></p>

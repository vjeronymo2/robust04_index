			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: Allied pushes upmarket with the RSC - Sponsorship It is six months now since Allied-Lyons announced the biggest arts sponsorship in the UK - Pounds 1m a year, for three years, to support overseas touring, educational work and new productions at the Royal Shakespeare Company, plus another Pounds 100,000 to help advertise the company. How is it shaping up? Well, the budget has already grown by a couple of hundred thousand a year, thanks partly to Allied's acquisition of Domecq which will mean plenty of reprinting of the sponsor's new name, but mainly to an enthusiastic early response to the consumer promotions linked to the sponsorship. Allied-Domecq is an unusual arts sponsor, being a packaged goods company with millions of consumers each day. This month its first promotion exploiting the RSC connection starts to appear in its chain of Victoria Wine off-licences, which it is pushing upmarket: buy RSC tickets for this August and you get a free programme, a free interval drink, and Pounds 5 off your next purchase of wine. In the near future similar special offers on tickets for the RSC are likely to appear in its smarter pubs, and on Allied brands, which range from Tetley tea bags to Teachers whisky, in the more middle class supermarket chains, like Sainsbury's. The company is deliberately using the sponsorship, and the reputation of the RSC, to raise its image. The first promotions were aimed at shareholders and employees, and offered free membership of the RSC and discounts on tickets. The initial take up exceeded forecast, hence the need to raise the budget. The main benefit from the link, helping Allied to expand into overseas markets on the back of visits by the RSC, has yet to happen, although the RSC is booked to visit California in October. The only problem to arise to date is that the meticulous advanced programming of a packaged goods company does not match the more immediate, improvisational, scheduling of a theatre company, but Allied-Domecq already sees the sponsorship extending way beyond the initial three years. It also envisages extending its theatrical links to embrace the Fringe as well as the RSC. Allied owns three of the main pub theatres in London: the Bush, the Gate, and the Kings Head. It has already helped the first two and intends to support the Kings Head, as well as getting behind pub theatre nationally. A few years ago there was deep concern about the future of the great British university museums. As the universities were starved of funds to educate students, shoring up the collections at the Ashmolean, the Fitzwilliam, the Courtauld, and others, came low in their order of priorities. But the museums themselves seem to have risen magnificently to the crisis, thanks mainly to the rallying round of sponsors, both corporate and charitable. The Courtauld is currently displaying some of the finest Impressionists in London, thanks to Pounds 250,000 funding from Cantor Fitzgerald, the American finance company, which supports art in the US but has never before backed a show in the UK, while the Ashmolean at Oxford has just announced one of the most lavish bequests in its history. The Headley Trust, the personal charitable foundation of Tim and Susie Sainsbury, has put up Pounds 4.5m to create beneath the museum forecourt a cafe, shop, lecture room, and more. This is the biggest donation by the trust since it made the major contribution to the Sainsbury wing at the National Gallery. In the last six years the Ashmolean has raised Pounds 8.5m from sponsors and is well on the way to securing the Pounds 1.5m needed to build four new galleries for Eastern art and antiquities. Reuters has never been a major arts sponsor in the UK but it is getting behind the Endellion String Quartet for its four concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, starting on Wednesday. To add spice to the events it is mounting an exhibition in the QEH foyer of photographs and videos with a musical theme drawn from its archive, including the young Menuhin, Bernstein at 70, and more. Reuters will also support the Endellion Quartet in a residency at MIT in Boston next April, with a total budget approaching Pounds 40,000. The National Lottery seems likely to make life even tougher for those companies with a reputation for sponsoring the arts. For the government is intent on linking the money destined for the arts and heritage to the success of arts organisations in drumming up matching funding. Last week, for example, the National Theatre announced that it was planning a Pounds 7m rebuilding programme, and anticipates lottery money, but it knows that it must raise half the total, Pounds 3.5m, by appealing to its corporate friends, rich patrons, and Trusts. So companies will be courted twice - for sponsorship to make possible live performances, as at present, and for donations to act as the trigger for lottery cash for capital developments. It may work for the big organisations, like the Royal Opera House, which has already assembled a band of rich patrons ready to write out their cheques when the lottery money arrives, but it could prove an impossible challenge for smaller and medium sized regional arts companies - and for their long suffering sponsors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three more members have been appointed to the  Palestinian National Authority Council. This was announced in  Tunisia yesterday. The Council will be in charge of the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho area following Israeli withdrawal.    An informed Palestinian source said the three members -- who  were appointed during a PLO Executive Committee meeting held the  day before yesterday under the chairmanship of President Yasir  'Arafat -- are brothers Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, chief of the PLO  Information Department; Sari Nusaybah, a teacher at the Bir Zayt  University; and Munib al-Masri, a businessman in the West Bank  city of Nabulus.    The Palestinian source said Nusaybah and al-Masri informed  the PLO Executive Committee of their agreement on the  appointment while 'Abd-Rabbuh asked a period of time to think  the matter over before giving his final consent.    With the appointment of those members, six other members are  still to be appointed to the Palestinian National Authority  Council, which consists of 24 members and is chaired by leader  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. Fifteen members of the council had  already been appointed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ambassadors of the five UN Security Council  permanent members in Nicosia said their governments are  disappointed and concerned over the situation described by Joe  Clark concerning his efforts for the confidence-building  measures. This was noted in a communique issued late this  afternoon after the five ambassadors met at the British High  Commission with the UN official on the Cyprus issue.    The communique, which was read to the journalists by British  Deputy High Commissioner Colin Jennings, also notes that Joe  Clark informed the five ambassadors that after his meeting with  Rauf Denktas he has decided that there is no reason at this  stage to continue the consultations. The communique recalls  that the Security Council members fully support the UN Secretary  General's efforts and it was they who had asked Butrus-Ghali to  submit a complete report to the Security Council.    In a statement to journalists after the communique was read,  Mr. Clark reiterated that he would like to give some thought to  the recommendations before submitting them to the secretary  general. He added that when this process is complete, there  will be a clear record of what was proposed, what was rejected,  and by whom. Mr. Clark also said that there is no reason for  him to enter into discussions about who is responsible.    The UN official on the Cyprus issue will leave Cyprus  tomorrow morning.</p>

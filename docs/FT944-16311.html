			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Ukraine avoids currency panic Ukraine's volatile currency, the karbovanets, has fallen sharply in recent days, losing 6 per cent of its value against the dollar yesterday and 12 per cent since Monday, raising fears of higher inflation this winter. The karbovanets, also called the coupon, sold at 100,000 to the dollar on the open market yesterday, a 50 per cent fall since September 12. The currency's latest fall follows Ukraine's decision last Friday to abolish the government's artificial exchange rate and reopen free currency auctions. The move was the first step in a comprehensive economic reform programme announced by President Leonid Kuchma earlier this week, but, thanks to inflationary credits inherited from the previous administration, the initial impact of reform has been further destabilisation. Unlike the panic caused by the Russian rouble's sharp fluctuations, Ukrainians this week remained nonplussed about the latest devaluations. Public confidence in the karbovanets has never recovered from last year's hyper-inflation - when the annual inflation rate exceeded 10,000 per cent - and, although many purchases are made in karbovantsi, few Ukrainians hold their savings in the national currency. This autumn's devaluation stems largely from a massive credit release to agriculture this summer. The credits, authorised by parliament, derailed the Ukrainian central bank's tight monetary policy, which brought the inflation rate down to single digits during the first half of the year. As a result, commercial banks are releasing around Kbv5,000bn (Dollars 53.2m) onto the currency exchange market each week, according Mr Mykola Melnychuk, a Ukrainian national bank official.</p>

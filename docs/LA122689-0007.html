			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILE ELECTION  </P> <P> I ask that you take notice of the following factual errors in the editorial  "But Watch It If Pinochet Grumbles" (Dec. 18).  </P> <P> * President Augusto Pinochet will be the commander of the Chilean army after  the March, 1990, transition. President-elect Patricio Aylwin will be the  commander of the armed forces. In fact, President Pinochet has publicly  acknowledged this relationship in the past several days.  </P> <P> * The restoration of democracy in Chile, in fact, fulfills the commitment made  by the Pinochet government in 1980. Chile's consensus for restoration of  democracy includes a large plurality (40%-45%) who did not vote for Aylwin and  support the conservative policies the Pinochet government has followed. For  example, I would draw your attention to the strong showing by conservative  candidates in congressional elections.  </P> <P> Your paper and others in the United States continue to look for possible  conflict between the Chilean armed forces and the victorious political  coalition behind Aylwin, yet fail to notice that the December elections  represent victory for the center, not extremes. The bright future of South  America's most prosperous free-market democracy deserves critical, but  objective attention that acknowledges all aspects of the Chilean political  scene.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER WHALEN  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

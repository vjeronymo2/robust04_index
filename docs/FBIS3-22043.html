			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Quito--The Ministry of Government, State Attorney  General's Office, and Superintendency of Banks have agreed to  put into effect a series of legal and technical measures to  prevent, investigate, repress, and eradicate the conversion and  transfer of money from the drug trade within the financial and  banking systems, or through other legal instruments operating in  the country.    Those responsible for conducting the investigations will be  the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and  Psychotropic Substances [CONSEP] and the National Police.    Based on these new measures, when the National Police have  well-founded records showing that an individual or corporate  body is using any entity in the financial system subject to  control and surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks to  convert or transfer assets from the drug trade, they will  request, through the national director of narcotics  investigations and Interpol, that the CONSEP executive secretary  demand of the financial institution that is apparently being  used any data and information required for the investigation.    These investigative processes are to be carried out jointly  with representatives of the police, the Superintendency of  Banks, the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and  Psychotropic Substances, and the banking institution, as the  case may be.    Such inspections will be confidential in nature, and their  results must be turned over directly by authorized personnel  from the National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and  Interpol to the CONSEP executive secretary or, in his absence,  to the legal counsel office director. No other unauthorized  person may participate.    If the CONSEP executive secretary deems the request made by  the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol  for inspections in any bank to be in order, he will officially  notify the financial institution's legal representative. The  latter will be required to submit directly the data and  information detailed in the request prepared by the police.    The enjoined institution's legal representative must send  the  data and information requested by the CONSEP executive secretary  directly to that official within a 10-day period. This interval  may be extended at the request of the financial entity. The data  and information submitted will be confidential in nature.    Immediately after the CONSEP executive secretary receives  the  requested information, he will make it known to the national  director of narcotics investigations and Interpol, or to the  person authorized by the latter.  <H5>  Final Report </H5>   The National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and  Interpol will be obliged to send to the CONSEP executive  secretary's office and to the Superintendency of Banks a copy of  the final report on the investigations conducted.    In instances wherein the presence of members of the National  Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol is required  in the institution in which the investigation sought by the  CONSEP executive secretary is to be made, this fact will be  announced to the enjoined institution's legal representative. It  will be stated in a message informing him that the investigation  is to be conducted and will include the list of personnel who  will be visiting the institution.    If, at the request of the CONSEP secretary, an agent from  the  Superintendency of Banks is to participate, that person will  attend with written authorization from the superintendent.    The data and information obtained by members of the National  Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol will be  reported directly to the national director of narcotics  investigations and Interpol. They will notify the CONSEP  executive secretary that the procedure has been implemented.    If one of the institutions subject to control and  surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks is suspected of  making conversions or transfers of funds to the financial  system, the Superintendency of Banks, at its own initiative or  at the request of the CONSEP executive secretary, will conduct  the pertinent examinations in cooperation with the National  Police. They will be based on the parameters stipulated in the  General Law on Banks and the other laws governing the subject.    The message in which the CONSEP executive secretary notifies  the superintendent of banks of the aforementioned suspicion will  contain suitable grounds, and must specify the causes and  records that have prompted those suspicions.    Once the examination has been made, if there is evidence  that  the institution under investigation has converted or transferred  money, securities, freely convertible instruments, and those of  legal tender originating in the drug traffic or its related  activities to the financial system, the Superintendency of Banks  will make the report on the examination known to the competent  authorities.    This measure also will be in order when the Superintendency  of Banks, upon making a routine examination of the institutions  subject to its control and surveillance, detects a possible  participation by the examined institution in the crimes of  conversion, concealment, or transfer of assets classified and  penalized in the Law on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances.  This includes the institution's financing for the commission of  the crimes specified in that law.</p>

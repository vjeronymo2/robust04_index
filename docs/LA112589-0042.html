			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JULIAN SURPASSES AIR BATTLE AS LA QUINTA WINS  </P> <P> La Quinta and Newport Harbor high school's quarterbacks combined for more than  400 yards passing in their second-round Division VI playoff game Friday in  front of 2,200 at Bolsa Grande.  </P> <P> But it was Trent Julian's 18-yard breakaway run for a touchdown with about a  minute to play that decided the outcome, a 23-16 victory for La Quinta. The  Aztecs (8-4) will play La Mirada, a 14-0 winner over Western, in the semifinals  next week.  </P> <P> La Quinta went into the fourth quarter leading, 16-9, and had mounted a drive  from its 37 to the Newport Harbor 26, but Newport Harbor's Ryan Abby  intercepted a pass by Richard Weaver and returned it 40 yards. That set up  Stephen Scheck's six-yard touchdown pass to Matt White. Josh Klein's  point-after tied the score, 16-16, with just under 3 1/2 minutes to play.  </P> <P> La Quinta then took possession on its 31 and took eight plays to get into the  end zone. One key to the drive was a Newport Harbor's penalty.  </P> <P> La Quinta had a third and two at the Newport Harbor 44, but a five-yard penalty  against Newport Harbor gave La Quinta the first down. On the next play, Weaver  hit Wes Kollar for a 26-yard reception. And two plays later, Julian cut up the  middle for the 18-yard touchdown and the game.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor had one last chance with possession at its 32 and less than a  minute to play, but Scheck threw two incomplete passes, and was sacked on third  down. His completion to Todd Farley on fourth and 15 was short of the first  down as time ran out.  </P> <P> Julian, who has been playing on a knee that has damaged cartilage and will  require surgery after the season, rushed for 93 yards and two touchdowns in 19  carries. He also caught five passes for 47 yards. Weaver completed 17 of 30  passes for 219 yards and an interception; Newport Harbor's Scheck completed 19  of 31 passes for 187 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor took the lead early. Ken Osako blocked Justin Sagoin's punt at  the Sailor 35 and six plays later Todd Farley (16 carries, 48 yards) scored on  a one-yard run. La Quinta tied the score, 6-6, on a six-play, 73-yard drive  capped by Weaver's six-yard keeper for a touchdown. Weaver also completed a  44-yard pass to Jason Cherms (5 receptions, 91 yards) in the drive.  </P> <P> La Quinta scored in the second quarter on Julian's two-yard run to cap an  80-yard drive, and Matt Logan added a 23-yard field goal to start the second  half. Newport Harbor's Klein kicked a 27-yard field goal before the Sailors  tied the score on White's touchdown reception.  </P></p>

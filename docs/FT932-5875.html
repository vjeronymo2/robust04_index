			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World News In Brief: The European Commission The European Commission denied a report in yesterday's Financial Times that it supported in a new document sterling's exit from the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism last September. 'The conclusions drawn by the Financial Times on a technical document drawn up by the Commission . . . are not correct and do not correspond to the conclusions in the document', a Commission spokesman said. EC officials confirmed privately, however, that the document refrains from criticising Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, as several member states had sought.</p>

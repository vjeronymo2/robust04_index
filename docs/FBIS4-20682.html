The treatment performance of this system is getting good  results in treated water quality, because the facility can  remove not only the musty odor substance (2-methyl isoborneol),  but can also reduce the Anionic surfactants, Ammonia nitrogen  and Trihalomethane formation potential consistently and  effectively. In the year since the facility was introduced, the  musty odor has been removed from purified water, according to  our expectations, at the Kanamachi Purification Plant.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Waterworks  supplies purified water to about 12 million citizens in Tokyo.  The total distributed amount per year was 1,783,310,000 cubic  meters in fiscal 1992 and this year the maximum distributed  amount per day was 5,780,000 cubic meters. The Bureau has 11  purification plants including Kanamachi, Asaka, Higashi-murayama  and others. The total purification capacity is 6,959,500 cubic  meters per day (cf. Table 1). The raw water is obtained from  three river systems as follows, the Tone River (80 percent), the  Tama River (17 percent), and the Sagami River (3 percent).       Table 1.

It  has a daily purification capacity of 1,600,000 cubic meters --  that is about 23 percent of the Bureau's total purification  capacity. This plant supplies purified water to about 2,500,000  citizens. In recent years, at the Kanamachi purification plant,  the pollution of raw water has occurred due to urbanization of  the Edo River valley (cf. Figure 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-53A>      Figure 1. Fiscal Change of Raw Water Quality (Kanamachi P.P.) </FIG>     In particular since 1972, the Kanamachi purification plant  had been faced with the problem of the musty odor of the  purified water in the summer season. As the result of an  investigation, it was proved that the musty odor source  substance is 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB). So since 1984, we have  coped with the musty odor problem with a powdered activated  carbon adsorption treatment. But, the variation of 2-MIB  concentration in raw water is so remarkable that the powdered  activated carbon adsorption treatment did not prove sufficiently  effective in musty odor removal (cf. Figure 2). So, in August  1989, the Bureau started the construction of an advanced water  purification facility, which is a combination system of  ozonation and biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment to  remove musty odor more effectively and consistently in the  Kanamachi purification plant. As the first phase, an advanced  water purification facility with the daily purification capacity  of 260,000 cubic meters -- that is about one-sixth of the total  daily purification capacity and is about one-fourth of the  average daily distribution amount -- was established on June 25,  1992. We are now supplying the advanced purified water by mixing  uniformly with water purified by the conventional processes.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-54A>      Figure 2. A Case of Relation Between 2-MIB Conc. in Raw </FIG>     The advanced water purification facility removes musty odor  efficiently and also is effective in producing safer and tastier  water, because it reduces Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH[.sub]3[/]-N),  Anionic surfactants and Trihalomethane formation potential  (THMFP). This facility's design and construction was based on  the results of investigations and experiments conducted at the  pilot plant for six years from 1984. As this facility is the  first commercially operating plant for the Bureau, we are  continuing various investigations and experiments to verify the  results of experiments with the pilot plant and to get data and  practical knowledge for the application and introduction of  future phases and new projects.    Meanwhile, we would like to give a summary of the advanced  water purification facility and the quality of the water  purified with this facility.  <H5>  The Summary of the Advanced Water Purification Facility and </H5> Its Operational Condition    The advanced water purification facility in the Kanamachi  purification plant consists of ozonation and BAC treatment and  is installed between the sedimentation and the filtration  processes.    The treatment process is as follows: Settled water is  directed to the advanced water purification facility after  coagulo-sedimentation without pre-chlorination. At this time,  odor components and others are decomposed effectively by the  strong oxidizing power of ozone and removed by activated carbon  adsorption and biological oxidation with microorganisms. Next,  the treated water is chlorinated (middle stage chlorination) and  conveyed to the rapid sand filters. The purified water is  distributed to users after disinfection with post-chlorination  and pH adjusting.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-54B>      Figure 3. Flow Chart of Advanced Water Purification </FIG>     The ozone contact basins (5 basins) are up-and-down flow  type  with three stage chambers. The effective depth of water is 6.0  m, the contact time is 12 minutes, and the maximum ozone feeding  rate is 3 mg-ozone/l (ppm). The each contact basin have a  retaining chamber (retention time: 6 min). [as published] The  ozone feeding rate varies due to the ozonized air feeding ratio  in each chamber of the contact basin. The ozonized air feeding  rate is three-sixths of the total feeding in the first chamber  of the contact basin. In the second chamber, it is two-sixths,  and it is one-sixth in the third chamber. The ozone feeding rate  is controlled to keep the dissolved ozone concentration constant  -- that is 0.2 ppm in treated water at exit of the retaining  chamber. Generally, the ozone feeding rate is around 1 ppm, but  it is changed according to the water quality (cf. Figure 4).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55A>      Figure 4. Ozone Contact Basin </FIG>     The activated carbon adsorption facility consists of 12  basins, and the effective filter area is 100 square meters. The  granular activated carbon used here is made of coal. The  effective size is 1.2mm, the uniformity coefficient is 1.3, the  bed depth is 2.5 m, and the linear velocity is 250 m per day  (the empty bed contact time is about 15 minutes). The  backwashing is carried out once every three to four days. The  BAC filter is washed with air and water for four minutes, and  then washed with water for 10 minutes (cf. Figure 5).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55B>      Figure 5. A Backwashing Program of the BAC Adsorption Basin </FIG>   <H5>  Treatment Performance </H5>   (1) 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB)    In 1992, the condition of the Edo River was good because of  the high level of precipitation from June to the middle of July  -- the end of the rainy season. For this reason, 2-MIB in raw  water showed a comparatively low value which was 65 ng/l at  maximum value in July. The maximum value of 2-MIB in raw water  rose up to 77 ng/l in August, and 140 ng/l in September, because  there had been very little rain after the end of the rainy  season. However, even though the 2-MIB concentration in raw  water changed significantly, the removal of 2-MIB was carried  out completely. About 20 percent of the 2-MIB is removed by  coagulo-sedimentation and all of the rest is done by the  combination of ozonation and BAC adsorption (cf. Figure 6). The  maximum load of 2-MIB in the advanced water purification  facility has been 120 ng/l. At that time 2-MIB was 7 ng/l in the  ozone treated water and it was all removed all in the BAC  treated water.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55C>      Figure 6. 2-MIB Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water </FIG>     (2) Anionic surfactants (MBAS: Methylene Blue Active  Substances)    The concentration of MBAS in raw water became comparatively  higher in winter. It is assumed that the dilution rate is lower  due to the decrease of the river flow and the biological  decomposition activity in the river is lower due to the decrease  of water temperature. The monthly MBAS average in fiscal 1992  gradually became higher. For example: 0.09 mg/l in November,  0.16 mg/l in December, and 0.21 mg/l in January. The maximum  value was 0.52 mg/l in January. However, the water temperature  was low (average water temperature was 6.4C in January  1993), the MBAS removal rate of BAC treated water against raw  water was about 40 percent, and the treated water maintained a  low concentration extremely well (cf. Figure 7).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55D>      Figure 7. MBAS Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water in </FIG>     (3) Extinction coefficient at 260 nm (UV260)    It is said that the created quantity of trihalomethane is  affected by the existence of organic substances which have  unsaturated bond. Therefore, we measured UV260 value to  supplement THMFP data and to make a representative index of  organic substances.    Each one-third of UV260 value of raw water were decreased by  the coagulo-sedimentation treatment and the ozonation treatment  respectively. The UV260 value was very low after BAC adsorption  treatment (cf. Figure 8).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56A>      Figure 8. Extinction Coefficient at 260 nm off Process Water </FIG>     Although in early passage the UV260 value of BAC treated  water tended higher gradually, the rate soon become stable. It  is supposed that this indicates the decline of the adsorption  capacity of the granular activated carbon and that the BAC  treatment performance becomes stable because of the oxydizing  effect of microorganisms.    (4) Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP)    The removal rate of THMFP by the advanced water purification  treatment was nearly 100 percent at the first passage, because  the activated carbon was fresh. But, after that the removal rate  decreased gradually and it has been consistently at about a  little over 60 percent since about six months after the first  passage (treated water quantity is 15,000 times as much as the  activated carbon quantity). The phenomenon that THMFP increases  in ozonation did not appear in our investigation, in which the  ozone feeding rate was changed from 0.5 to 2.0 ppm (cf. Figures  9 and 10).    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56B>      Figure 9. Transition of THMFP Removal in Advanced </FIG>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56C>      Figure 10. THMFP in Process Water; ozone dosage is varied. </FIG>    (5) The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal and biological activity in  the BAC    NH[.sub]3[/]-N can not be removed by ozonation treatment,  but it can be decomposed during BAC treatment by the  microorganisms which grow on the granular activated carbon.    After the first passage, the NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal rate  gradually rose in the activated carbon adsorption basin, and in  about two weeks it reached 100 percent (cf. Figure 11). It was  assumed that in about two weeks in summer, the function of the  BAC would be as indicated (cf. in Figure 11 -- the test passage  term was before June 24). The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal  maintained a good rate. Also in winter, NH[.sub]3[/]-N was  removed completely (cf. Table 2). Considering other analysis  results -- such as the decrease of the dissolved oxygen and the  heterotrophic bacteria colony counts -- it is supposed that the  biological activity in the BAC layer was also very active even  under low water temperature.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56D>      Figure 11.

One result  is shown in Figures 12 and 13.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-57A>      Figure 12. 2-MIB Removal in the Ozone Contact Basin Under </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-57B>      Figure 13. Dissolved Ozone in Contact Basin Under Several </FIG>  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The advanced water purification facility is consistently  getting good results in regards to 2-MIB, which is the principal  subject material to be removed; as well as with anionic  surfactants, THMFP and NH[.sub]3[/]-N.    We have insured ``safer and tastier'' which has no musty  odor  by operating the advanced water purification facility for  one-fourth of the total amount and carrying out the powdered  activated carbon treatment for the other three-fourths.    In future, we would like to analyze a number of questions  such as: the optimum ozone feeding rate; the time to the  breakpoint of granular activated carbon; the suitable washing  method of the BAC adsorption bed and the characteristic change  of the activated carbon. In addition we would like to make use  of the results for the proper operation of the facility and  further advanced water purification process introduction.</p>

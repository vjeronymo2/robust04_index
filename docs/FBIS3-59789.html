The primary implement in modern digging work is the  shield-tunneling machine. Used to dig deep underground tunnels,  they are known as ``gigantic moles.'' These excavating behemoths  spiral out in all directions at the construction sites of  subways, underground flood-control ponds and undersea tunnels.  Japanese shield machines were used in the construction of the  English Channel tunnel.    The greater underground chambers have become, the larger  these moles have grown. The latest models weigh in at 3,000  tons, are 14 m high and 14 m wide.    The world's largest shield-tunneling machine with a diameter  of 14.14 m was completed at the Kanagawa Works of Hitachi Zosen  Corp. on Nov. 11. It will be delivered to a joint venture of  Kumagai Gumi Co., Hazama Corp. and JDC Corp. to be used in the  construction of the Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway linking Chiba  Prefecture and the metropolis.    The huge machine is equipped with a device which  automatically assembles 11 segments, each weighing 10 tons, in a  circle in about 90 minutes.    The previous heavyweight title-holder was a 13.94  meter-diameter mole developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.  This machine has been used since last February by the Tokyo  Metropolitan Government to carve out a pond about 50 m  underground in Suginami Ward for flood control of the Kanda  River.    Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Kajima Corp. worked together  to  develop the automatic assembly machine mounted on the Kanda  River mole. This has allowed remote-control assembly by workers  and on-site engineers are no longer needed for the task.    Kawasaki Heavy Industries also engaged in the development of  some of the eight shield-tunneling machines for the Trans-Tokyo  Bay Highway project. Though the difference in the diameter of  the world's large machines and their predecessor is only 20 cm,  the new machines are 50&percnt; better in performance, according  to a  Kawasaki official.    The latest machines can automatically assemble a ring of  10-ton segments in about 100 minutes, while it takes the Kanda  River mole two hours and 40 minutes to assemble its 7.4-ton  segments. The digging speed has also been improved from 2 cm per  minute to 3 cm per minute. The capacity of the jack has been  raised by 20&percnt;. Accordingly, the price and weight of the  machines have also risen.    The next model of shield-tunnel machines will have a  diameter  of 16 m, according to a Hitachi Zosen official.</p>

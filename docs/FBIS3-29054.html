			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chon Taek-won from Beijing] </F>   [Text] The opening of Sinuiju means the start of North  Korea's opening of areas near the West Sea following the opening  of Najin and Sonbong near the East Sea [Sea of Japan]. The  development of the economic zone around the Tuman River, which  finds its way to the East Sea, is still merely a plan without  any clear prospect for investments although it has been promoted  by the UNDP [United Nations Development Project]. The Sinuiju  development plan is, however, likely to be realized soon and  produce visible results because this area is connected with  China's West Sea economic zone, which is under a full-scale  development. This fact draws public attention. People are  interested, in particular, in the possibility that North Korea  will partially introduce the Chinese-style opening policy  because the opening of Sinuiju is going to be promoted in  relation with China's opening policy.    In fact, rumors on the development of Sinuiju began last  year, and have been popular for a long time among people in  Dandong, the Chinese city across Sinuiju, at the other side of  the sea, but there was no way to confirm it. Real facts of the  rumor began to emerge as North Korea recently set out its  second-stage opening plan in a full scale.    North Korea opened the Najin-Sonbong area on 28 December  1991  according to Decree No. 74 of the State Administration Council.  Thus, the three North Korean ports along the East Sea coast,  including Chongjin located in this area, are now open. When  Sinuiju and Nampo open in the second stage, North Korea will  have open areas in, both, the East and West Sea coasts.    In spite of this fact, we could not realize North Korea's  opening up because of the deadlocked North Korean nuclear issue  and because of no visible progress in the plan to develop the  Tuman River area, including Sonbong and Najin, due to the  contradiction in interests of the countries concerned.    Moreover, North Korea has been very cautious of the  Chinese-style way of opening up based on the socialist market  economy, and it was hard to believe that North Korea would  really open the West Sea area -- its opening would inevitably be  related with China -- under the situation in which relations  between the two countries became delicate because of the North  Korean nuclear issue. North Korea, however, could not help but  seek its way in the changing situation represented by the  collapse of the Soviet Union and East Europe and China's reform  and opening up.    North Korea finally worked out a "region-lockout opening  policy [kukchi pyeswoehyong kaebangchaek]" as a means to protect  its system from the shock caused by the opening up as well as to  break the economic deadlock.    This policy was experimentally applied to the Najin-Sonbong  area. The policy is aimed at preventing the wind from an open  area from blowing over to other areas by completely banning the  people's contacts with open areas and by having unfaithful  residents in open areas and those in the region neighboring an  open area move out.    North Korea forced residents in the region around Najin and  Sonbong to move out and replaced some of them, and now is  reportedly having the residents of Puksinuiju move out.    Why has North Korea worked out this opening policy  internally  although the nuclear issue, externally, is running into a  tougher phase? Public interest is focused on this. Some people  guess that though it assumes a nuclear confrontation policy,  North Korea is well aware that it has no choice but taking a  line of peaceful coexistence based on economic exchanges. It  can be said that the opening of Sonbong, Najin, and five cities  for border trade with China is nothing but preliminary  arrangements for the second-stage opening of Sinuiju and Nampo.    Sinuiju is as important to North Korea as Pusan is to the  ROK. This border city competes with China's Dandong and  Donggou. This city can play a role in beefing up North Korea's  opening up. This city has abundant hydraulic power (Supung  power station), abundant water supply, and the railway system,  and is convenient for maritime and river navigation.    A pipeline for oil, which China exceptionally supplies to  its  brotherly country [North Korea], runs from the Daqing oil field  to the Pakchon refinery via a bottom section of the Yalu River  in front of Sinuiju. Needless to day, Sinuiju's industries,  including the textile industry, are important to North Korea.    China, a world-class base of non-ferrous metals, is  developing borax, magnesium, talcum, and graphite. Japanese  trading corporations have so far been making profits by  re-exporting these minerals to the ROK. Dandong has an  international airport directly linked to Hong Kong; Shanghai;  and Beijing; and the Donggou port, where four 40,000-tonne boats  can berth simultaneously, is nearby. Therefore, Dandong is  equipped with all conditions for development.    Dandong was formerly Andong. A historic irony is that the  military airport, railway, bridges, and roads which were used  when the Chinese Army was invading the Korean peninsula are now  being used for opening North Korea and promoting exchange with  North Korea.    China seems to believe that if it links China's three  northeastern provinces [Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang] in  which Shenyang is a central city, Dandong, Dalian, and Donggou  to Sinuiju, this will contribute to developing the Yellow Sea  sphere, unlocking North Korea's economic potential, promoting  regional economic cooperation with the ROK, and, thus, promoting  stability on the Korean peninsula.    It is presently far from certain that North Korea will  further open up. Still, indications have appeared that North  Korea is moving toward carrying out practical economic policies.  And, the opening of Sinuiju must be assessed in this context.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Clinton names farm minister President Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr Dan Glickman, a veteran Democratic congressman defeated for re-election last month, to succeed Mr Mike Espy as US agriculture secretary. Mr Glickman's 'knowledge, experience and understanding of the needs of the American farmer make him exactly the right person to become secretary of agriculture when we write the farm bill in 1995,' Mr Clinton said. At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden Mr Glickman referred to the challenge of the five-year farm bill that he must help craft. 'Agriculture is not and should not be immune to change,' he said. Mr Espy resigned in October after an independent prosecutor began examining his acceptance of gifts from individuals and companies doing business with the agriculture department.</p>

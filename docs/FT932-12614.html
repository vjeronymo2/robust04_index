			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / VW tries to calm worried suppliers THE top management of Volkswagen yesterday attempted to calm the nerves of key component-makers rattled by the company's dramatic plans to slash costs and reduce outside suppliers. Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of VW since January, told representatives of 29 companies from the group's home state of Lower Saxony that Volkswagen was ready to help them meet new conditions. The meeting was called by VW and Mr Gerhard Schroder, the regional prime minister, who is also a senior member of VW's supervisory board. It was intended to counter ill-feeling and fears stirred by the arrival at Europe's largest car maker of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez, recently recruited from General Motors in Detroit, and installed as production and procurement director. It is also a response to private complaints from other German car manufacturers that VW's over-aggressive and highly-publicised approach to cost-cutting was terrorising the components industry and damaging confidence when the whole motor industry was struggling to restructure. Mr Lopez was dubbed 'the Russelsheim strangler' in recognition of the cost-cutting expertise he demonstrated while head of buying at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. He told the meeting that processing from raw materials to the end product had to be optimised in order to give the customer increased value in terms of quality, service and price. 'We can only win together,' he added. VW, which dived DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) into the red in the first quarter of this year, following an 87 per cent profits plunge to DM147m in 1992, is planning to reduce suppliers on its books from around 1,500 to 200. At the same time, according to Mr Piech, parts prices are to be driven as low as possible without pushing suppliers out of business. The tone at yesterday's meeting was milder than that at earlier 'consultations' at which Mr Lopez reportedly told his audience that he required 'the highest quality, the best service, the lowest prices. . . . and soon'. According to analysts, at least 30 per cent of Germany's 3,000 automotive parts suppliers is threatened by the motor industry's restructuring plans. Most at risk are the 2,900 small and medium-sized companies, which, according to Price Waterhouse, account for only DM21bn of the components industry's total annual sales of DM130bn.</p>

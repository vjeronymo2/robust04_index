Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, Gen.  Jean Cot has called on the Bosnian Croats to stop continued  shelling of the Muslim section of Mostar, a city in southwestern  part of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. An UNPROFOR statement, a copy of which was  submitted to TANJUG on Thursday, said the French general  addressed such a demand to the commander of the Bosnian Croat  army (HVO), Gen. Ante Roso, during his visit to Mostar earlier  this week. Cot said no provocations by the local Muslim forces  'could justify the kind of retaliation endured by the population  of Mostar (Muslim-controlled) east.'    The Bosnian Muslims and Croats, the erstwhile allies against  the Serbs, have been waging merciless battles since the spring  of 1993 for control over territories with a mixed Muslim-Croat  population. According to Spanish U.N. troops' reports, Bosnian  Croats in January fired more than 1,400 shells on the Muslim  section of east Mostar, while Muslims fired no more than 75  shells on the Croat-held west Mostar.</p>

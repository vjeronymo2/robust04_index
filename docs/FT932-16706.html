			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon disposes of French packaging stake MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group, yesterday sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox the French packaging group, raising FFr3.9bn (Pounds 473m) before costs. The group is expected to use the money to finance acquisitions but said yesterday it did 'not have any major acquisition in mind at present'. Even so a number of companies in the building materials sector saw their share prices rise in anticipation. MB-Caradon's shares rose 2p to 320p. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said 'the disposal gives us substantial cash resources. We are confident that we can deploy these into businesses that we manage, and whose cashflows we control, for the long-term benefit of our shareholders'. The buyers of the holding of 20.5m shares, included CGIP, the French industrial holding company which added 7 per cent to its existing 25.3 per cent stake. The interest dates back to the merger in 1989 of Metalbox Packaging, part of the former MB Group which then bought Caradon, and Carnaud, the French group in which CGIP was a large investor. Although CarnaudMetalbox had a somewhat shaky start, new management has improved profits in the last 18 months and the share price has risen. On Wednesday it announced results for 1992 which showed net profits up by 15 per cent to FFr976m. The stake was valued in MB-Caradon's 1991 accounts at Pounds 337.5m, and it contributed Pounds 31.8m to profits that year. But the dividend received in 1991 was only Pounds 7.8m. Mr Jansen said he had been under pressure from shareholders to sell the stake since 1990, when he would have been glad to get Pounds 250m for it. In February MB-Caradon called a meeting of shareholders for March to give it authority to sell the stake. Despite this signal that the shares were for sale, Mr Jansen said that there had been no firm offers for the complete hold-ing. Now, he said, it was 'cyclically a good time' to buy building products businesses in the UK, but that MB-Caradon would also be looking in continental Europe and North America. With its borrowing facilities and the cash, it could spend Pounds 1bn. Although the deal will give CGIP 32.3 per cent of the shares, it will hold 46 per cent of the votes in CarnaudMetalbox because shares held for more than two years have double voting rights. Parfinance, a company controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the Canadian businessman, and Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian businessman, bought 6 per cent. Parfinance was found by CGIP which wanted an 'associate investor' but the two holdings are not deemed by the French stock exchange to constitute a concert party. The remaining shares were placed by Warburg. Warburg bought 10m shares at FFr190 each and placed them at FFr197, against Thursday's close of FFr217, taking a gross profit of FFr70m. See Lex</p>

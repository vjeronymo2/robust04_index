			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES"] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan's 12th Parliament ends its first  regular session today, with expectations high that it would be  recalled for an extraordinary session next month to formalise  several pieces of legislation that the government has forwarded  to it as emergency laws. [passage omitted]    On Monday, the House unanimously approved a proposal made by  Deputy Samir Habashinah to form a parliamentary delegation to  visit "understanding" countries to explain the "suffering of  Iraqis" in view of the U.N. Security Council's recent decision  to maintain the 43-month-old international sanctions against  Iraq.    Mr. Habashinah (Karak) noted that U.N. inspectors have  reported that Iraq had complied with the Security Council  conditions for lifting the sanctions and referred to the futile  efforts last week by countries such as France, China, Russia,  Turkey and Iran to issue a Security Council statement  acknowledging Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. Special  Commission charged with eliminating its weapons of mass  destruction.    It was not immediately known when the House would form a  delegation to lobby on behalf of Iraq.    During Monday's session, the government answered several  questions raised by deputies concerning services in their  districts.    Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Dughmi said he reserved his right to  officially interpellate the government concerning the legality  of licencing companies offering security services.    Mr. al-Dughmi (Mafraq) charged that such companies abuse the  authority given to them by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in  a manner that "threatens our security and safety" and get paid  for it.    The deputy asserted that it was no coincidence that his car  was damaged and Deputy Habashinah's was stolen after the two  legislators publicly criticised security service companies.    The two lawmakers are demanding that licenses issued to the  private security firms be withdrawn and government forces  undertake the responsibility of providing security wherever  needed.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: 'Green' VAT move defended THE imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power would help towards a 'cleaner, greener world', Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday. He told a fringe meeting in Blackpool: 'We as Conservatives are committed to putting our money where our pollution is. If we pollute, we pay.' He told the Tory Green Initiative meeting: 'We are harnessing the market to create a greener, cleaner Britain and a cleaner, greener world. 'That's why we as a party must throw our full might behind the Budget decision to extend VAT to domestic fuel.' He added: 'The fact is that nearly all of us spend too much on heating our homes.' The heating bill for a three-bedroomed semi-detached house was more than Pounds 500 a year, he said. But a modern energy-efficient house with full insulation and modern boiler could be heated for Pounds 150. He confirmed the government's commitment to using market instruments, such as tradeable permits, to meet environmental goals. He said the Department of the Environment was considering introducing such permits, which control the amount of a pollutant that is allowed to be discharged, for sulphur dioxide emissions. 'The principle here is that if the emissions from your factory are lower than they might otherwise be, you have surplus pollution permits which you can sell to some other factory who are exceeding their allowances,' he said. 'Your company makes money out of your environmental awareness, the other guy pays - in cash - for his environmental profligacy.' Among other similar initiatives, Mr Yeo said the government was also investigating incentive charges to control water pollution and charges for water abstraction. On waste disposal, he said the introduction of a landfill levy would 'increase the cost of this method of waste disposal and thus increase the financial attractions of more environmentally desirable alternatives'. He added: 'Producer responsibility would give a further and substantial boost to recycling by giving packaging producers and fillers (including retailers) an incentive to reduce packaging waste and recycle it wherever practicable.'</p>

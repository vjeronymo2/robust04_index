			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters noted that no chronic health effects have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with long-term exposure to high levels of sulfate. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate can have acute adverse effects on non-acclimated persons. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population at risk is readily identified and targeted for protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures. While the laxative effect eases and disappears as the person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acclimates to the high sulfate concentration, the individual is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debilitation during the acclimation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diarrhea and/or laxative effects have been reported in infants ingesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water with high levels of sulfate and in adults at concentrations in the 500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 1000 mg/L range. EPA believes an MCL level of 500 mg/L will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently protective of infants and adults. An RfD for sulfate has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SMCLs for aesthetic qualities relating to the public acceptance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water are not federally enforceable, and intended only as guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the States. SMCLs do not meet the statutory requirement to set an NPDWR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for sulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements for transient and non-transient, non-community water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems which do not serve the target population frequently would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They could achieve compliance by placing permanent signs at drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fountains and having bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has updated the occurrence data and the cost analysis since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Phase V proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Today's Proposed MCLG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today EPA is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L which represents the level at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which no known or anticipated adverse effects on human health occur, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which allows for an adequate margin of safety based on current data. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for choosing this level, EPA notes that the survey conducted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952) indicated that the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people reporting laxative effects greatly increased at sulfate concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above 500 mg/L. This concentration is considered protective of infants based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the information reported by Chien et al. (1968).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the MCLG for sulfate should be based on the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for causing loose stools and diarrhea. Infants are at risk from diarrhea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the cause, and unacclimated adults may also be at risk. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to limit the intake of sulfate will protect the infant population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unacclimated adults from potential adverse effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on this proposed MCLG. EPA particularly requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any new data or any other new information that may be submitted in support of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or opposing the reproposed sulfate MCLG of 500 mg/L. In light of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposing the regulation of sulfate, the Agency is also requesting any new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data or information that would support a higher level for the MCLG. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is particularly interested in comments that raise issues other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those that EPA has already considered and responded to above and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record for today's proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Establishment of NPDWR for Sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Methodology for Determination of MCLs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SDWA directs EPA to set the MCL ``as close to'' the MCLG ``as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible.'' The term ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology, treatment techniques, and other means, which the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under laboratory conditions, are available (taking costs into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration)'', (SDWA section 1412(b)(5)). Each NPDWR that establishes an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL lists the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator finds to be feasible for meeting the MCL (SDWA section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1412(b)(6)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reckless Fascist Outrage" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean police  recently mobilized a huge force to brutally suppress rail  workers affiliated with the National Council of Locomotive  Workers on a sit- in strike for wage hike and improvement of  working conditions.    In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this is an illegal  fascist outrage and inconsiderable fascist violence.    The news analyst says:    The council urged the authorities to raise its workers'  wages, improve the working conditions and reinstate the expelled  workers. This, the minimum demand of the workers for their  existence as human beings, should have been met by the South  Korean authorities.    Nevertheless, the South Korean rulers have put workers on  the  altar of suppression, refusing to accept their just demand.  Then, how can their behavior be construed?    It is ridiculous for the South Korean rulers, the guilty  party, to threaten that they would "bring legal actions" against  innocent workers, charging them with the "railway paralysis."    The fascists are calling the workers' sit-in an "illegal  violence" and blaming them for the "railway paralysis,"  motivated by a criminal intention to shift onto the workers the  responsibility for all the grave consequences to be entailed by  the railway paralysis and harshly suppress and penalize them.    The fascist suppression leads to self-destruction.    The South Korean authorities would be well advised to  promptly stop the fascist suppression, clearly mindful that the  more harshly they crack down on the people, the more fiercely  the people resist.</p>

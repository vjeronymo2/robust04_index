The Department's experience indicated that the inclusion of donations within the TDC of projects has created unwarranted delays in the development process, and, in some cases, has been a contributory reason for cost increases in the low-income housing development process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For Public Housing, Janice Rattley, Director of the Office of Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 4136, Washington, DC 20410.

The November 29, 1993 Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62522), HUD published an interim rule to remove donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds) from the Department's calculation of total development cost (TDC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before publication of the November 29, 1993 interim rule, the regulations for HUD's public housing development program and Indian housing development program (codified, respectively, in 24 CFR parts 941 and 905) provided for the inclusion of donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds), in calculating the total development cost (TDC). The project TDC would then be compared to the published TDC limitations currently in effect, which could result in actual development costs that are less than, the same as, or more than the published TDC limitations. Under this procedure, if the project TDC exceeded 100 percent of the published TDC limitation, notwithstanding the reason for the increase over the TDC limitation or the source of funding for the increase, the Field Office was unable to approve the project TDC without authorization of the Regional Administrator or the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. This approval procedure was intended to verify Field Office processing, and to ensure that the project TDC would provide modest, non-luxury, durable housing at a reasonable cost. In actual fact, however, the TDC approval process, which did not take into consideration that donations may be the reason for, or the source of payment of, the increase over the TDC limits, resulted in unwarranted delays in the development process because of the amount of time it takes for the request to move through the system. In some cases, these delays were a contributory reason for cost increases in development of public and Indian housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to be made by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final by this rule, permit HUD Field Offices to calculate the project TDC relative to published TDC limitations, and to authorize housing agencies to proceed with developments, without referral to Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary, where funds in excess of TDC limits are provided through donations. Where funds in excess of TDC limits will not be provided through donations, Field Offices must continue to seek authorization from the Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary. HUD will not provide funds to housing agencies under section 5 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 in excess of TDC limitations without such authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific sections in 24 CFR parts 905 and 941 amended by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final by this rule, are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 905.102 and 941.103 are each amended by revising the definition of ``total development cost'' contained in these sections to clarify that maximum total development cost excludes any donations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 905.255 and 941.204 are amended to add a new paragraph to each section that will clarify that although donations are not included in the project TDC calculations, donations must be included in the project development cost budget. A new paragraph (j) has been added to &sect;905.255 and a new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;941.204. Additionally, &sect;905.255(a)(2) is amended to clarify that the ``inclusion of all costs'' discussed in this paragraph does not include donations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, &sect;941.406 is amended to clarify that the total project cost refers to HUD funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The November 29, 1993 interim rule solicited public comments through January 28, 1994. By the expiration of the comment period, only one comment was received. The commenter, a public housing agency, stated that it was in full agreement with the interim rule, and supported the amendment to HUD's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no other comments were received on the interim rule, and since the Department intends to make no further changes, the Department will adopt as its final rule the November 29, 1993 interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

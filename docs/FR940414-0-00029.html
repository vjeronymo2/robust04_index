One supplemental NADA was filed by Wade Jones Co., Inc., and covers the use of the drug product in the drinking water of calves and swine for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases and in the drinking water of poultry for the control of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to the drug. The other supplemental NADA was filed by Pfizer, Inc., and also covers use of the drug in the drinking water of poultry for the control of certain susceptible bacterial diseases. Both approvals reflect compliance with the results of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group's (DESI) evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and FDA's conclusions concerning that evaluation. Additionally, the agency is technically amending the regulations to make other needed corrections.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dianne T.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Wade Jones Co., Inc., 409 North Bloomington, Lowell, AR 72745 (Wade Jones), filed a supplement to approved NADA 65&hyph;140 for a soluble powder containing 324 grams (g) of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC HCl) activity per pound (lb). The drug is available in several product container sizes, 2 and 5 lb tubs and 2.53, 5, and 10 ounce (oz) packets. The drug is indicated for use in chickens at 200 to 400 milligrams per gallon (mg/gal) for control of infectious synovitis caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Mycoplasma synoviae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and at 400 to 800 mg/gal for control of chronic respiratory disease caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> M. gallisepticum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and E. coli. The drug is indicated for use in turkeys at 400 mg/gal for control of infectious synovitis caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> M. synoviae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and at 25 mg/lb of body weight for control of complicating bacterial organisms associated with bluecomb. It is also indicated for use in swine and calves at 10 mg/lb of body weight for control and treatment of bacterial enteritis (scours) and bacterial pneumonia. The NADA was originally approved July 5, 1966.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017 (Pfizer), filed supplemental NADA 65&hyph;123 for TC HCl soluble powder (6.4 ounce (oz) packet) to provide for use in chickens and turkeys under the same conditions of use expressed above for the Wade Jones application. The NADA was originally approved April 27, 1955. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  II. The NAS/NRC DESI Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The drug products were subject to a NAS/NRC DESI evaluation of effectiveness (DESI 0012NV). The findings were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 8, 1970 (35 FR 10966). NAS/NRC evaluated the products as ``probably effective'' for oral treatment of animal diseases when such diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to tetracycline hydrochloride, diseases such as: (1) Enteric and respiratory diseases in poultry; (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in swine; (3) infected wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep, and goats; (4) digestive system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis, peritonitis, infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary bacterial invaders in dogs and cats; (5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in turkeys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAS/NRC reached the following conclusions applicable to the subject TC HCl drug products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Most of the dosage directions provide for a less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for large animals is 10 mg/lb of body weight daily in divided doses and for small animals 25 mg/lb body weight daily in divided doses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as ``appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug),'' and if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) claims made ``for prevention of'' or ``to prevent'' should be replaced with ``as an aid in the control of'' or ``to aid in the control of''; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should warn that treated animals must consume enough medicated water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail_as a precaution, the label should state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective use of the preparation in drinking water or feed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings, interpreting the phrase ``cannot be so qualified'' in item (3) of the paragraph immediately above to mean ``is not supported by adequate data.'' FDA proceeded to review all available data relating to the effectiveness of similar products to determine which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of effectiveness. The review resulted in the agency concluding that the data supported effectiveness only for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to TC HCl in calves, swine, chickens, and turkeys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, Wade Jones and Pfizer complied with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions by filing supplemental NADA's which revised the drug products' labeling as follows: (1) Adopting the dosage recommended by NAS/NRC; (2) dropping all claims for viral diseases; (3) properly qualifying disease claims; (4) revising prevention claims to read ``Control of''; and (5) adding to the manufacturer's label the warning statement concerning factors influencing adequate consumption of medicated water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAS/NRC evaluation is concerned only with the drugs' effectiveness and safety to the treated animal. It does not take into account the safety for human food use of food derived from drug-treated animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wade Jones' supplemental NADA is approved as of September 15, 1993, and Pfizer's supplemental NADA is approved as of March 18, 1994. The regulations are amended by revising &sect;520.2345d (21 CFR 520.2345d) to reflect the approvals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's approval of the supplemental NADA's does not involve a reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food safety data in the parent applications. Tolerances for residues of the drug and its metabolites in chickens, turkeys, swine, and calves of 0.25 part per million are currently codified in 21 CFR 556.720. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of approving the Wade Jones Supplement. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to approving the Pfizer supplement, the agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these approvals do not qualify for exclusivity periods because their applications do not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in the case of food-producing animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to approval of the supplements and conducted or sponsored by the applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), summaries of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of these applications may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. The Technical Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conjunction with amending &sect;520.2345d to codify the NAS/NRC DESI finalization of Wade Jones' and Pfizer's NADA's the agency is using this occasion to rewrite &sect;520.2345d to clarify the regulations. Section 520.2345d is the recodified version of section 546.180d(c). This latter section was one of many antibiotic drug sections affected by the final rule that published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37318) for the purpose of: (1) Removing the technical regulations that included the requirements for certification and tests and methods of assay and (2) recodifying, based on route of administration, the remaining provisions concerning conditions of marketing. However, when &sect;546.180d was recodified, the agency did not include other technical changes to update changes in the approved conditions of marketing. Accordingly, FDA is revising &sect;520.2345d to codify the currently approved conditions of marketing and to make the following needed corrections: (1) The section heading is revised to fully identify the drug as the hydrochloride; (2) the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specifications <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' paragraph is removed and information concerning drug concentrations is incorporated into the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sponsors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' paragraph; (3) the second sentence of the NAS/NRC status paragraph is removed because it has been superseded by enactment of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988; (4) the drug labeler code for Upjohn Co. (000009) is removed because the firm was incorrectly listed as the sponsor of approvals for the use of TC HCl soluble powder in the drinking water of calves, swine, chickens, and turkeys; (5) the drug labeler code for Vetri-Tech, Inc. (058752), has been changed to that for Arkansas Micro Specialties, Inc. (047863), since Vetri-Tech, Inc., has transferred ownership of its NADA (use of drug in chickens) to Arkansas Micro Specialties, Inc., (57 FR 12711, April 13, 1992), and (6) in the calf and swine claims, the name of the causative agent,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hemophilus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is changed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the current scientific name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 520 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Animal drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 520 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 520_ORAL DOSAGE FORM NEW ANIMAL DRUGS <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

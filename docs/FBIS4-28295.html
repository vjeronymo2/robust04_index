			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["They Must Not Miscalculate" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the U.S. act in driving the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the phase of war.    Warning that it must stop its harebrained act, facing  squarely the reality, the analyst says:    The United States is planning to additionally deploy a task  force comprising a carrier flotilla, tactical flying corps, "B  52" strategic bombers, etc. In South Korea, Japan and the west  Pacific region. The U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said "a  preemptive strike at Pyongyang's nuclear facilities remains an  option" and U.S. Senator McCain called for "a military  strong-arm action," crying that "North Korea must be bombed."    All this patently proves that the United States does not  have  the intention to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula by peaceful means and is using the "nuclear issue" of  the DPRK as a card in the war gambling to stifle it.    The U.S. ruling quarters, for all their lipservice to  "peace" and "relaxation of tensions" on the Korean peninsula, is  actually seeking heightened tensions and military adventures,  remaining captive to the consciousness of confrontation and war  psychology.    The United States is even scheming to send U.S.  reinforcements to the Korean front from Alaska and Germany and  50 warships, more than 200 warplanes and a U.S. naval force  25,000 strong based in Hawaii have started for the Korean waters.    It is a mistake to try to subdue and stifle the DPRK by  strength. The hardline conservatives of the United States seem  to be ignorant of our faith and might. We regard independence  and socialism as our life and blood. We are resolved and ready  to counter any military option of the United States.</p>

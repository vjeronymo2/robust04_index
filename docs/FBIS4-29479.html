			<p>BFN     [Text] Permanent Secretary of the Communications Ministry  Mahidon Chantharangkun said Thailand will maintain its old  position at the second round of aviation talks with the United  States on 28-29 June. Thailand will stick to its positions  concerning the third and fourth airline freedoms, that is, at  least 55 percent of through passenger traffic load and 70  percent of cargo as conditions for the fifth freedom. The  matter was discussed at the negotiation two years ago.    He said it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. position in  the forthcoming negotiation. According to a most recent report,  the U.S. Congress was not happy with its delegation in the  previous talks, which gave in too much to the countries involved  in the negotiations. Thailand therefore expects that this  forthcoming round of talks will be tough, with the United States  taking a tougher stand there being a possibility that Thailand's  conditions will not be accepted.    The Thai delegation will be led by Sisuk Chantharangsu,  director general of the Commercial Aviation Department.    In the previous round, both sides discussed the matter of  principles, and reportedly the United States adopted a sincere  and amicable position. The upcoming negotiations will deal with  the details and Thailand will seek to know the U.S. response to  its proposals. Thailand does not expect any discussions about  flight routes or flight increases because this area should be  dealt with only when an agreement has been reached in principle.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: SCHOLARLY CAT CRITIC LANDS ON HIS FEET  </P> <P> Having recently mentioned the reflex gyrational mechanism by which cats right  themselves when falling, perhaps I owe my readers a more thorough examination  of this phenomenon and its consequences.  </P> <P> Rod Casper has sent me an article from Nature magazine (April 14, 1988), by  Jared M. Diamond, on the results of a study on falling animal bodies by W. O.  Whitney and C. J. Mehlhoff as reported in the Journal of the American  Veterinary Medicine Assn.  </P> <P> (Casper, by the way, is the one who sent me that clipping about a dog in Buenos  Aires that fell from a 13-story window, hit a 75-year-old woman, killing both,  and causing another woman to be killed by a bus and a man to drop dead of a  heart attack.)  </P> <P> Happily, Whitney and Mehlhoff worked in an animal hospital in New York City,  whose skyscrapers, open windows and hard pavements produced a data base of 132  cats that were killed or injured by falls of two or more stories, with a  maximum of 32 stories and a mean of 5.5 stories (one story equaling 15 feet).  </P> <P> Excepting 17 cats whose owners could not afford veterinary treatment and had  them euthanized, 90% (or 104 of 115) survived; 11 died, mostly of shock and  thoracic injuries.  </P> <P> What Diamond found most remarkable in the results was that the incidence of  injuries and death peaked in falls of about seven stories; cats falling from  greater heights suffered less severe injuries and were more likely to survive.  </P> <P> One cat, for example, fell the maximum height of 32 stories, onto concrete, and  "was released after two days in the hospital, having suffered nothing worse  than a chipped tooth and mild pneumothorax."  </P> <P> Human beings, on the other hand, rarely survive falls of more than six stories  onto concrete. Higher falls are increasingly lethal. Death is caused most often  by head injuries and bleeding from internal injuries.  </P> <P> The doctors found that injuries were affected by three sets of variables: the  height of the fall determines the impact velocity; the softness of the landing  surface affects the impact force, and five properties of the falling body are  relevant, including its mass, shape, bone strength, cushion of fat, and use of  muscles and joints to reduce impact force.  </P> <P> Large animals (including human beings) suffer greater injuries in falls than  smaller ones, their less favorable area/mass ratio causing higher velocities.  </P> <P> Like all of us, cats have only one life each, not nine, but this popular  misconception evidently comes from their frequent escapes from injury through  the use of their remarkable gyroscopic system that enables them to turn in the  air and point all four feet downward, thus dissipating the landing impact over  all four limbs.  </P> <P> Falling adult human beings tend to tumble uncontrollably, landing usually on  their two feet, next most often on their heads. Babies, because of their larger  heads, fall on their heads, with their arms reflexively extended to break the  fall.  </P> <P> After about 100 feet, cats reach a terminal velocity of about 60 m.p.h., adult  humans about 120. The doctors theorize that when accelerating, cats may extend  their limbs reflexively, but on reaching terminal velocity they may relax and  extend their limbs more horizontally, like flying squirrels, thus reducing  velocity and spreading the impact over a greater area of their bodies. This may  explain why cats suffer less in falls of more than 100 feet.  </P> <P> Diamond, a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School, says cats share  advantages with other small animals of similar mass and shape, but their  gyroscopic righting reflex and their limb flexing on landing are unique. Thus,  small dogs that fall from buildings are more prone to serious injuries or death  than cats.  </P> <P> Diamond theorizes that specific cat advantages have undoubtedly evolved through  natural selection. "Most felid but few canid species are arboreal, so that  millions of years of springing or falling from trees have favored those felids  with the best vestibular systems. Thus, the nine lives of cats are a product of  their evolutionary history." (The vestibule is a portion of the inner ear that  is involved in balance.)  </P> <P> I hope this study will not prompt anyone to drop a cat from a second-story  window. Whatever the statistics, it doesn't do them any good, and I have an  idea that they don't like it.  </P></p>

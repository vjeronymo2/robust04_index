			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Cash may be better for the nerves - The FT-A World index finished the quarter 10 points down in sterling terms, as global equity markets produced a negative 7.5 per cent return / Equities THE SECOND quarter was another miserable one for equity investors, and the choice of markets didn't matter much - provided you avoided Japan, yet again. The Nikkei index, which had dropped through the psychologically important 20,000 support level in the first quarter, ended the second below 16,000. Over the quarter, Japan had a negative total return, measured in sterling, of minus-16.2 per cent. Most other equity markets did a lot better, although still in negative territory. In sterling terms, the FT-Actuaries World index closed the period at 107.87, or some 10 index points off its level on March 31. In terms of total returns, global equity markets produced a negative 7.5 per cent for sterling investors. All in all, it's been a bad first half, although there were a few moderately bright markets over the past quarter, notably Hong Kong, the UK and Switzerland. In the last Quarterly Review, this column foresaw uncertain times immediately ahead, and advised private investors and cautious fund managers to stay overweight in cash. Anyone who did so was ahead of the game at the end of June. Why the dismal performances? In a word: uncertainty. The unexpected return of a majority Conservative government in Britain did produce the almost inevitable bounce in UK equities, but much of it did not hold against continuing concern about the economy. Nonetheless, there was a positive total return of 4.7 per cent. On the wider European front, Danish voters' rejection of the Maastricht treaty put a big question-mark over moves towards European monetary union, a mood only partially relieved by an enthusiastic Irish vote in favour. France holds its Maastricht referendum in September, amid fears that the specific issue could be clouded by the domestic unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand. This is likely to keep the European equity sector uncertain over the next quarter. Investor confidence was not helped when a major share flotation by Ireland's GPA Group, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was pulled at the last minute for lack of institutional interest, particularly in the US. This has cast a shadow over an even bigger share sale, scheduled for July 27, by the Wellcome Trust, of a large slice of its holdings in the British drugs company that bears its name. Wellcome is no GPA, but jumpy equity markets would like to see the sale safely away. The Wall Street picture seems no more secure. Election jitters are in the air, with the maverick Ross Perot unnerving President George Bush from the right and the Democrat, Bill Clinton, snapping from the left. The proclaimed US economic recovery appears anaemic, or at best only modest, and Wall Street over the last quarter moved sideways. Dollar investors saw a mere 1.6 per cent in total return. Tokyo, measured by the Nikkei, actually chose the last trading day of the quarter to record a three-month low at 15,785, with the few remaining optimists there hoping for some kind of market support from the supplementary budget promised for later in the summer. Where do the markets go from here, amid all this political and economic uncertainty? The big global players report that they are cutting back on equity holdings, switching to bonds and cash. But some German houses claim to be buying selectively in London and in a number of other European markets  -the rationale being that lower German interest rates (when they eventually materialise) could start off an equity buying spree in many continental markets. But with so much gloom and uncertainty about, it is mainly the contrarians who see good buying opportunities at the moment. For the rest, and especially over the next quarter, staying overweight in cash may be best for the nerves.</p>

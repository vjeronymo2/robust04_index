			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Evans of Leeds 6% higher at Pounds 3.67m EVANS OF Leeds, the family-controlled north of England-based property company, shrugged off depressed conditions in the property market with a 6.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.67m for the six months ended September 30. Turnover rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.33m). The rent roll stood at Pounds 19m on an annualised basis compared with Pounds 18m in the year to March. Mr John Humphries, chairman, said the results were 'very satisfactory' given the difficult market conditions. In the past, the company has remained relatively immune from the recession because it has negligible exposure to property investments in the south of England, and through its focus on pre-let projects. The interim dividend is lifted by 10 per cent to 1.43p from earnings per share of 4.28p (3.95p). Mr Ian Hartwell, finance controller, said Evans was experiencing good demand for its industrial property. The company also announced the launch of a further Pounds 75m offering of 33-year 11 per cent debentures, secured on a portfolio of 66 properties. The issue, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, was placed with UK institutional investors. The money raised will be used to refinance borrowings and provide funds for the expansion of the group's property portfolio.</p>

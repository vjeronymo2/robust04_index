			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J. Jesus Rangel M.] </F>   [Text] The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP)  has published in the official gazette the rules, 29 reforms  outlining method, seven on concept, by which foreign financial  institutions may establish branches in the country. These  reforms will provide more flexibility, according to interested  parties.    Among the benefits, a list of shareholders will no longer be  required by those who own at least 1 percent of the shares of a  foreign financial institution; instead, it will be demanded of  those who own at least 5 percent. An application to open a  branch will be considered complete even if it lacks the  authorization issued by authorities at the location where the  institution was founded, and its consolidated financial  statements will be reduced from five to three years.    Beginning today, requests can be made to establish bank  branches, financial corporations with limited objectives,  general warehouses, mortgage companies, financial agent  companies, exchange houses, stock-trading companies, stock  exchange experts, investment corporations, corporations that  operate investment corporations, insurance companies, or  guarantor institutions in the country.    The SHCP has stated the goal of these measures is to locally  increase competition within the Mexican financial system. It  has also said a first package for approving the branches will be  passed during the second half of the year. The deadline for  requests is 31 July.    The rules will apply not only to U.S. and Canadian  institutions but to all those anywhere in the world that have  branches in any of those two nations.    Among the requirements that must be met is the delivery of a  list of the financial institutions and trade and industrial  companies in or outside the country in which the company owns  more than 10 percent of shares with a right to vote.    The following stand out as some of the most flexible  rules:     -  The SHCP will ask for a list of shareholders who  constitute a controlling group as well as a list of shareholders  who hold more than 5 percent of the shares of the foreign  institution. In the original draft bill, a list of shareholders  who held more than 1 percent of the shares was requested.    -  The  obligation to deliver forecasts on the amount of capital and  assets will be for three years instead of six [number as  published], as proposed in the draft bill.    -  A copy of the foreign  financial institution's latest prospectus on the issuance of its  shares and, if applicable, the related corporation will be  needed.    -  Limits applicable to the branches, in accordance with  the corresponding international treaty or agreement, will be  based on information provided by the local supervisory  commission of the type of branch being dealt with.    -  Concerning  the sole results of the presentation to which this rule (second  transitory) refers, a request will be considered complete  whether it has the authorization referred to in various clauses.  Concerning the results stemming from a calculation of the time  limits referred to in NAFTA Article 1411, when applicable, an  authorization and legal opinion must be presented; these are  essential for authorizing the corresponding request.</p>

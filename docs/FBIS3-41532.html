			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria, Nov 22 SAPA -- South Africa [SA] has  become a member of the International Union for the Conservation  of Nature [IUCN] and Natural Resources, the leading global  conservation authority.    Announcing the breakthrough on Monday, the Environment  Affairs Department said South Africa had until now been  represented at the IUCN by various government and  nongovernmental organisations. The newly acquired state  membership, however, would involve more votes for SA at IUCN  general meetings, the next of which would be in January in  Buenos Aires.    The IUCN's seminal 1991 document Caring For The Earth set  practical guidelines for sustainable living on a global scale.    The union has played a leading role in the formulation of  international conservation conventions such as Cites [Convention  on International Trade in Environmental Species] (which monitors  illegal trade in wild animals and plants), the Ramsar Wetlands  Convention and CMS (the Convention on Migratory Species), to all  of which SA is signatory.    The IUCN was created in 1948 and 111 countries and a total  of  682 organisations are reperesented.</p>

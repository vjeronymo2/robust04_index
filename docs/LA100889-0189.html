			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HAMMOND BEATS DARKNESS TO LEAD  </P> <P> Donnie Hammond, battling darkness and a couple of erratic Ryder Cup stars, shot  a five-under-par 65 Saturday and took a two-stroke lead in the rain-delayed  third round of the $600,000 Texas Open golf tournament at San Antonio.  </P> <P> Hammond, who last won in the 1986 Bob Hope Classic, parred the final hole for a  54-hole total of 16-under-par 194 on the short Oak Hills Country Club course.  </P> <P> Hammond and Ryder Cup competitor Paul Azinger, playing in the final twosome,  defied all odds by completing the round, which was delayed nearly three hours  by an early-morning downpour.  </P> <P> Hammond fashioned a two-shot advantage over Azinger, veteran Bob Lohr and  former UCLA star Duffy Waldorf. Azinger matched par-70 while Waldorf and Lohr  carded 66s.  </P> <P> Azinger, a winner at Hartford this year, started the third round with a  three-shot lead, squandered it with a 38 going out, then bounced back with an  eagle-3 at the par-5 10th hole and a birdie at the 11th before finishing with  seven straight pars.  </P> <P> Lanny Wadkins, Azinger's Ryder Cup teammate, was equally as erratic, slipping  in and out of the lead several times before a double bogey at the 15th dropped  him to 13-under and torpedoed his round.  </P> <P> A bogey at the 18th added insult to Wadkins' injury and a 68 left him tied with  Tom Sieckmann at 198. Sieckmann had a 67.  </P> <P> Rives McBee capped a wild finish with a chip-in birdie to take a one-stroke  lead over Gary Player after two rounds of the $1.5-million RJR Championship for  seniors at Clemmons, N.C.  </P> <P> McBee, a rookie on the Seniors PGA Tour, managed a three-under-par 67 despite a  double bogey on the 17th hole and completed two trips over the revamped  Tanglewood Park course in 135.  </P> <P> "I didn't deserve the double bogey on he 17th, but I didn't deserve the birdie  on the 18th either," McBee said. "I'm tickled to death to be where I am."  </P> <P> Player, a two-stroke leader when the day's play started, shot a 71 including  bogeys on the final two holes.  </P> <P> Doug Dalziel, who had a 69, was the only other man in the field able to break  par for two trips over the 18 new putting surfaces that frustrated and  infuriated the 72-man field.  </P> <P> Dalziel was at 139, one under.  </P> <P> Dave Hill, who finished second and third in the last two years when this  tournament was known as the Vantage Championship, matched par for the second  day in a row and was at 140.  </P> <P> PGA champion Payne Stewart was on course to become the fourth American winner  on the European golf circuit this season, moving ahead after three rounds of  the West German Masters tournament at Stuttgart, West Germany.  </P> <P> He shot 70 for a 10-under-par total of 206, two strokes ahead of defending  champion Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain, who shot a 69, and tournament  co-promoter Bernhard Langer, who had a 70.  </P> <P> Second-round leader Nick Faldo of Britain shot 40 on the front nine and  finished with a 74 and a share of fourth place at 209 with Australian Rodger  Davis, 72.  </P></p>

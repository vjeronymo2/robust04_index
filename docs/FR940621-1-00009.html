			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Act provides for civil and criminal penalties (16 U.S.C. 4711(c) and (d)). Any person who violates the regulations shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000. Each day of a continuing violation would constitute a separate violation. A vessel operated in violation of the regulations would be liable in rem for any civil penatly assessed for that violation. Any person who knowingly violates the regulations would be guilty of a class C felony. A class C felony is punishable by imprisonment of not more than 12 years (18 U.S.C. 3581(b)(3)) and a fine of not more than $250,000 for an individual or not more than $500,000 for an organization (18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Act, the Coast Guard proposes the regulations discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->  Discussion of Proposed Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This proposal, if adopted, would propose changes to subpart C of 33 CFR part 151 to extend the applicability of the ballast water management requirements to vessels operating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating on the waters beyond the EEZ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed changes to &sect;151.1504 would add ``the Captain of the Port, New York,'' to the definition of ``Captain of the Port (COTP)'' and add the ``Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge,'' to the definition of ``Voyage''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed change to &sect;151.1510(a)(1) would require that an exchange of ballast water be carried out on the waters beyond the EEZ, in a depth exceeding 2000 meters, prior to a vessel traveling on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed change to &sect;151.1510(a)(2) would authorize the COTP to seal the tanks of vessels subject to the Act, in which ballast water is retained, for the duration of the voyage within the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By proposing to apply subpart C of part 151 to the vessels subject to the amendments to the Act, the Coast Guard is proposing that each of the requirements of subpart C, including collection-of-information requirements which will be discussed below, apply to vessels navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.'' The Evaluation is summarized as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, 112 visits were made by vessels to the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The most recent data available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning Hudson River vessel traffic reveals that vessels operating on the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ are primarily foreign importer vessels. Vessels carrying cargo, such as vessels engaged in importing, are generally not carrying ballast water. Accordingly, the Coast Guard has identified no vessels that have actually discharged ballast into the Hudson River. Vessels that do not discharge ballast, do not have to exchange ballast water and would incur no costs due to the proposed regulations. Therefore, the only aspect of the proposed regulations that these vessels would be subject to is the recordkeeping requirements of 33 CFR 151.1516. It is estimated that it takes one half hour to complete. At the cost of $35.00 per half hour and assuming 120 visits by vessels subject to these regulations, the annual cost will be $4,200. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Strike ballot at National Grid Unions representing 4,500 workers at National Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system, have rejected a 'final' pay offer and will hold a ballot on industrial action, David Goodhart writes. The company offered a general pay rise of 2.6 per cent - the rate of inflation - as well as lump sums varying from Pounds 200 to Pounds 700. Last year National Grid gave a rise of 3.9 per cent, well above the inflation rate, but that included a move towards single-table bargaining and a new pay system. Mr Danny Carrigan, national officer of the AEEU craft union, said: 'This offer is unacceptable in view of the huge increases in productivity and profitability since privatisation. The company has also recently announced a 15 per cent increase in dividends and a rise in pre-tax profits of Pounds 150m.' The other unions involved include the EMA management union, the GMB and TGWU general unions, and Unison, the public-services union.</p>

She was  addressing a seminar on clash of civilizations at the World  Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today. She said the task  of the world leaders is not to make tragedies like Bosnia and  Kashmir appear inevitable, normal, and least of all acceptable.  She stressed the need to reverse this trend. Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said joined by her Turkish counterpart, Dr. Tansu Ciller,  she will visit Bosnia tomorrow. They will express solidarity  with the mothers and children of Bosnia who have suffered ethnic  cleansing, torture, aggression, and molestation at the hands of  blatant aggression. She said that during the continued human  rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Western countries  have stood with arms folded, although they were in a position to  stop the holocaust in their European Continent. The prime  minister said this attitude is a blot on the conscience of the  mankind as a whole and not a cause for Islam alone.    She said Pakistan and India have been in a state of  confrontation for nearly five decades. Settlement of the core  issue of Kashmir can help improve regional stability in South  Asia. She said this is a goal to which leaders of the region  are supposed to work. Solution to the Kashmir problem is the key  to regional peace, which must be pursued with utmost  determination. The prime minister said that the realization of  justice and equity within and among nations constitutes the most  viable organizing principle for a new order in the emerging era.  Human rights, democratic rights, and the quality of life for  mankind must become vital factors in global policies. The prime  minister went on to say that these values must cut across  cultural and economic blocs. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the rights  of women and children, minorities, basic freedom, and  humanitarian concerns must become the concern of a global  village which becomes smaller and more intimate everyday with  the advance of modern technology.</p>

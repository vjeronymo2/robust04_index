			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Burns Philp sells its hardware retail unit Burns Philp, the Australian industrial group which has been restructuring to focus on the food and fermentation sector, announced yesterday it was selling its BBC Hardware retail business to Howard Smith for ADollars 244m (USDollars 173.7m). Howard Smith, a diversified industrial group based in Sydney, will also take on BBC Hardwares' ADollars 216m debt, bringing the total consideration to around ADollars 460m. Howard Smith said it saw 'substantial synergy' with its existing J. Blackwood &amp; Son industrial supplies division. The BBC Hardware business is reckoned to be the sixth largest retailing operation in Australia with around 156 outlets, and a further 42 outlets in the North Island of New Zealand. Sales in the year to June 1993 were almost ADollars 870m, while earnings before interest and tax were ADollars 33.6m. Blackwood supplies engineering, industrial and electrical goods from 79 branches in Australia and New Zealand. Burns Philp signalled its intention to float or sell the hardware division last summer. It said it would realise a ADollars 142m profit on the sale announced yesterday.</p>

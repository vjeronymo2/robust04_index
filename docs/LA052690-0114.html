			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Insurance commissioner. Whose ads? Democratic candidate Bill Press.  </P> <P> Press has two 30-second commercials that try to make the point that he has long  been a consumer champion on various issues, and, if elected commissioner, will  take on the insurance companies on the consumers' behalf.  </P> <P> Campaign manager Michael Ganley said the cost of these commercials will be at  least $100,000. He added that these two commercials will be replaced by others  before the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich:  </P> <P> Ads: Press, appearing in one of the commercials, declares that "for almost 20  years I've been fighting for consumers . . . fighting big oil companies to stop  offshore drilling, winning against developers to protect our coastline, taking  on the big insurance companies to stop redlining." Now, he adds, "I want to be  your insurance commissioner, not just to cut auto rates but to deliver basic  quality health care to everybody." The other commercial features an announcer  making the same points. He adds at the end that Press is "the man the insurance  companies will fear the most." Both commercials note that Press has been  officially endorsed by the California Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Analysis: These ads recite Press' record correctly. As director of the state  Office of Planning and Research in the Administration of Gov. Edmund G. Brown  Jr., Press was active against offshore drilling, and he was press secretary of  the initiative campaign that established the California Coastal Commission. He  has frequently spoken as a television commentator against insurance company  redlining of minorities and others, and assisted a private political group to  establish a hot line for people complaining of redlining. The phrase about  delivering "basic quality health care to everybody" is a promise. The new  insurance commissioner does not have the authority to establish new health  insurance plans, although, of course, the commissioner could lobby for  legislation or draft and campaign for an initiative on the subject. As for the  contention that Press is the one the insurers "will fear the most," he is at  odds with another Democratic candidate, Conway Collis, who contends that he is  the one the insurers will fear the most.  </P></p>

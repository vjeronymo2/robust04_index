			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Brazil takes assets freeze to court THE Brazilian government will appeal to the Supreme Court this week to stop a wave of judgments allowing people to withdraw cruzados blocked in an Dollars 80bn (Pounds 47.3bn) asset freeze last year, alleging that the resulting increase in money supply could scupper its economic stabilisation plan, Christina Lamb writes from Rio. Ms Zelia Cardoso, the economy minister, said on Brazilian television: 'If the court decides that all the money should be liberated I wash my hands of all responsibility over what may happen to inflation.' The government appeal comes in response to a series of regional court decisions declaring its asset freeze, the centrepiece of a drastic anti-inflation plan, unconstitutional. This has led people to ask the courts to free their money. There are 70,000 cases pending.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Selected German cyclicals take heart Mixed US jobs data were viewed as a source of confusion in Europe, rather than any real stimulus to equities, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended Thursday's short covering process in the morning and the Dax index rose 16.08 to 2,067.56 on the session, nearly 10 points carried over from Thursday afternoon. In the post bourse the Dax closed at 2,069.39, barely higher on the week. Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.6bn. In London, James Capel's economist, Mr Stephen King, said that the German recovery had regained momentum after a soft performance in recent months and suggested that the overall continental European recovery was driving German exports. Selected cyclicals took heart, both during the session and after hours: Hoechst in chemicals rose DM4 to DM325.50; and Daimler and MAN in automotives and Deutsche Babcock among engineers each rose by DM7.50, to DM770, DM409 and DM233.50 respectively. However, there was more pain in retailing which had seen sell recommendations this week from various investment banks and a Thursday report showing retailers' sales down by a real 1 per cent in the first nine months of 1994. Asko closed the session DM25, or 3.2 per cent lower at DM790; after hours Karstadt and Kaufhof were down DM9 at DM610, and DM14.90 at DM494. PARIS saw an improvement after the release of US data following a nervous morning session. The CAC-40 index added 20.52 or 1 per cent to 1,931.65, for a rise of 1.4 per cent on a holiday-shortened week. Turnover was estimated at over FFr4bn. Rhone-Poulenc slipped 70 centimes to FFr133.20 on profit-taking following Thursday's better than expected nine-month results. Goldman Sachs revised upwards its full year eps forecasts for the chemicals group to FFr6.50 for 1994 from FFr4.40 and to FFr11.80 for 1995 from FFr9.80. Peugeot dipped FFr6 to FFr801, partly in reaction to investors switching into Renault, whose institutional subscription period closed on Thursday and which was 15.5 times subscribed. ZURICH finished higher in active trading, lifted by the firmer dollar and content with the US jobs data. The SMI index picked up 6.2 to 2,541.0, up 2 per cent on the week. Holderbank rose SFr59 or 6.1 per cent to SFr1,020 after the building materials group forecast that consolidated net income for 1994 would rise by 37 per cent. The group has seen earnings upgrades from a number of analysts in recent weeks, but the forecast still proved sharply above even the best expectations. Landis &amp; Gyr, recently near its low for the year, picked up SFr70 or 10.5 per cent to SFr735 after Thursday's profits forecast, and a statement which cleared the air after worries about its pension fund. Winterthur registered added another SFr10 to SFr651 in further response to Thursday's interims while Swiss Re gave up SFr7 of recent gains to SFr748 on further switching into Winterthur. AMSTERDAM's AEX index added 0.40 to 410.76 to gain 0.5 per cent on the week. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 82.00 on rising aluminium demand and its reiterated forecast that it expected a substantial second half improvement. Among second line stocks Volmac, the Dutch computer services group in which Cap Gemini Sogeti of France has a majority stake, rose to a new year's high of Fl 24.50, up Fl 1.10, on reports of increased order books. MILAN was still fixated on banks as the Comit index added 5.43 to 629.30 for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. Credito Romagnolo rose L429 to L16,962, investors digesting news that a 2 per cent block of its shares had changed hands at L19,500. Credito Italiano, pressing ahead with its bid for Romagnolo, fell L13 to L1,571. Ambroveneto gave up L106 to L5,232 on the view that there was little upside left after BCI's bid for at least 50 per cent of the stock. BCI lost L37 to L3,533. Premafin fell L153 or 9.4 per cent to L1,482 after news that its planned to raise up to L222bn through the issue of shares with warrants. Olivetti rose L50 to L1,888 and Cir was L54 or higher at L1,809, although analysts said there was no news to account for the rises. COPENHAGEN's the KFX index fell only 0.64 to 93.19. However, serious problems at the shipper and shipbuilder, B &amp; W, dropped the latter by 54 per cent and hit its bankers. B &amp; W B fell DKr65 to a new 1994 low of DKr55, compared with a high of DKr533 in February. Den Danske Bank and Unibank dropped DKr7 to DKr224, and DKr6 to DKr313 respectively.

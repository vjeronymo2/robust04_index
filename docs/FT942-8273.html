			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Japan surplus 'threatens' global trading Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world is threatening the global trading system, Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador in Tokyo, said yesterday. 'We have a Dollars 130bn (Pounds 86.60bn) trade account imbalance. This threatens the world trading system. It fuels protectionism. It exports unemployment. It's got to change,' he said. The attack came moments before Japan's ministry of finance released figures showing a higher than expected trade surplus during April. The surplus reached a record Dollars 11.12bn, up 8.1 per cent year on year. Analysts had been expecting a year on year decline of 1.3 per cent to Dollars 10.3bn. Japan's surplus with the US, the source of continual political conflict with Washington, rose 8.9 per cent to a record Dollars 4.38bn. The surplus with the EU reached Dollars 2.31bn, while that with Asia was Dollars 5.3bn. Economists said the latest increase had been caused almost exclusively by the continuing rise of the yen and corresponding depreciation of the dollar. Although the yen's appreciation reins back exports by making Japanese goods more expensive overseas, it also reduces the dollar value of imports. In yen terms, the overall surplus fell 1.6 per cent to Y1,160bn. Only one more set of trade figures is due before the next round of formal negotiations between the US and Japan and the G7 meeting in Naples during June and there were few conclusive signs of adjustment, said stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd. It warned that the surplus remained uncomfortably high, with little evidence of trade volumes having an effect on headline dollar numbers. There would be little respite for the yen, it added. Imports had been weaker than expected, increasing only 6.6 per cent to Dollars 21.76, while exports rose 7.1 per cent to Dollars 32.88bn. In yen, exports fell 2.7 per cent to Y3.434bn, while imports declined 3.2 per cent to Y2.273bn. Mr Mondale said exploratory talks between the US and Japan in Washington on Thursday suggested progress could be made. The discussions, which continued yesterday, followed the breakdown of formal negotiations in February. 'Based on the first reports I have received, I am hopeful that progress would be made. It's too early to say, but there is some movement,' he said. The US has been demanding that the Japanese government reflate the economy to draw in more imports as a way to reduce the trade surplus. But yesterday the Bank of Japan said the economy was recovering. The Bank of Japan's comments came as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said industrial production had increased 4.6 per cent in March compared with the previous month.</p>

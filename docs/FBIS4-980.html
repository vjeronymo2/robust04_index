			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The government and National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] teams to the Lusaka peace talks  were scheduled to meet today, but that did not happen because it  was only today that the mediators delivered the intermediate  document on specific principles, modalities for their  implementation, and the conclusion of the electoral process.    UNITA handed its proposal over to the mediators on 15 April.  The government did the same the next day. This morning, UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye held separate  meetings -- first with the government team and then with the  UNITA delegation. The observers attended both meetings, where  Blondin Beye delivered a document reflecting the mediators'  views regarding the proposals advanced by the government and by  UNITA.    No meetings were held this afternoon. The negotiating teams  took time off to reflect on the document and suggest possible  amendments. The UN special representative is scheduled to meet  with the two sides tomorrow to get their responses. Should  there not be too many differences, Blondin Beye is likely to  call for a face-to-face meeting between the government and UNITA  teams.</p>

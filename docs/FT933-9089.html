			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Taipei agrees Paris flights TAIWAN has signed an agreement to start direct air links with France next month, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei. Flights between Taipei and Paris will start in September, and weekly flights will increase to three next year from two this year, Mr Charles Lin, CAA's aviation division chief, said. Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines, and Air France will not use aircraft carrying national flags of the two countries to fly the route, to avoid wounding political sensitivities. Air Charter, a subsidiary of Air France, will begin cargo flights between Paris and Taipei in September and passenger flights in November. Taiwan has not yet decided when and which airline will fly the route. Taiwan has difficulty establishing air links with foreign countries because of political pressure from its rival China. China, which has claimed sovereignty over the island since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, has sought to prevent other countries from expanding links with the island. However, Taiwan's economic influence and growing overseas travel have won the island direct air links with several countries in recent years. It currently has direct links with six European countries, including Austria, Britain, Bulgaria, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. It also plans to begin flights to Russia this year.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbekistan cottons on to marketing opportunities - A farm sector that is looking forward to reaping the benefits of the break from centralised control BACK IN the pre-putsch days of the Soviet Union, the word cotton used to sum up everything that Uzbekistan felt was wrong about its relationship with Moscow. Cotton, Uzbeks claimed, was not only responsible for the region's disastrous ecological problems - most notably the drying up of the huge Aral Sea because of over intensive cotton monoculture - but also the source of Uzbekistan's poverty. Under the old system of centralised planning, Uzbekistan's rich cotton crop was almost entirely controlled from Moscow, where the central authorities decided how much cotton would be planted, where it would be sold and at what prices. But now change is afoot. In the wake of its August independence declaration, Uzbekistan has seized control of its cotton production and is already laying plans to sally forth into the international export markets. Uzbekistan currently produces two thirds of the overall cotton crop of the former Soviet Union, or 5m tonnes of raw fibre a year. Under the old centralised system, less than 10 per cent of Uzbekistan's cotton was actually spun and woven in the republic, the bulk of it being sent to textile mills elsewhere, notably Russia. Similarly, although the Soviet Union had previously exported between 500,000 and 750,000 tonnes of cotton a year, very little of the hard currency profit found its way back to Uzbekistan. Now however, the Uzbeks are determined to control their cotton exports themselves. 'We intend to trade cotton like any normal country, for the good of Uzbekistan,' explains Mr Anvar Makhmudov, chairman of the Uzbek government's economic committee. Uzbek economists refuse to reveal at the moment how much cotton they actually plan to export this year - or indeed how much they are already selling abroad - for fear of depressing world cotton prices. But nevertheless, the leadership is now buzzing with a host of cotton-based schemes designed to boost the Uzbek economy and allow the republic to develop its own textile production. Raw cotton is being offered - along with Uzbekistan's gold - as a guarantee for foreign investors wishing to invest in Uzbekistan. Although this has been conducted on an ad hoc basis so far, an American-Soviet joint venture, Sibir, which is itself now trading in cotton, is currently working with the Central Uzbek Bank to establish a full legal framework for this, according to Mr Victor Fishman, Sibir's Tashkent-based director. The Uzbek government also has plans to start trading on international commodity exchanges, such as the Liverpool exchange, in addition to the direct barter deals that are already being arranged to bring in a limited supply of technology, consumer goods and badly-needed grain into the republic. According to Mr Makhmudov, deals have already been signed with Hungarian and other East European countries to exchange an undisclosed quantity of cotton for nearly 2m tonnes of grain before the end of the year. With the breakdown of inter-republic trade links and the poor soviet grain harvest, supplies of grain to Uzbekistan from Russia and the Ukraine have fallen dramatically. 'We look on our cotton as a strategic reserve which we can use to bring essential products into Uzbekistan,' says Mr Safayev, who says that he hopes that cotton will provide one of the main bargaining chips in Uzbekistan's negotiations with Russia - not least because of the large number of Russians employed in Russia's textile factories, which have previously depended on supplies of Central Asian cotton. But in spite of all these plans, so far relatively little seems to have changed for the cotton farmers themselves. The Uzbek government says that it intends to privatise limited quantities of land and - somewhat unrealistically - reduce the land under cotton cultivation from 70 per cent to 40 per cent of the arable land. They intend to replace it with grain and vegetable cultivation, to reduce the disastrous ecological effects of the previous cotton monoculture. But, so far, nearly all cotton cultivation remains in the hands of the collective and state farms, who are working, as before, to a fixed cotton plan - now determined not by Moscow, but instead by the government in Tashkent. Under one set of the frequently changing regulations, the farms are forced to sell 95 per cent of their planned cotton to the state, at a fixed price that is still considerably lower than world market prices. The remaining 5 per cent, along with any cotton harvested in excess of the plan, can be sold freely, either through direct barter deals with enterprises in other soviet republics to obtain scarce consumer goods, or on the new commodity exchanges that have recently been set up in Tashkent to deal in cotton. As the cotton prices on these exchanges are up to three times higher than the official government prices, it seems that many farms have been increasingly resisting the Tashkent government's state orders and quietly selling a growing proportion of their cotton on these exchanges and through direct barter deals with enterprise in other Soviet republics. Similar checks exist on the export of cotton. Individual farms can only sell their cotton abroad through the official, Uzbek government-backed, cotton trading associations. According to one set of regulations, for example, any cotton export deal over 1,000 tonnes has to be endorsed by the Uzbek president himself. 'It still takes a long time to get cotton out - and it's virtually impossible without good government connections,' commented a foreign cotton dealer in Tashkent.</p>

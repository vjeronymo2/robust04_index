			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mobile telecoms boost for Olivetti Shares in the Olivetti computers and office equipment group rose sharply against the trend yesterday as investors reacted to its improved prospects of running Italy's second mobile communications network. Olivetti stock jumped L55 to close at L2,359 following this week's news that Pronto Italia, one of the three bidders for the cellular licence, was joining forces with the Olivetti-led Omnitel consortium. The move by Pronto Italia, an alliance of Germany's Mannesmann and Pacific Telesis of the US with a group of Italian banks and medium-sized companies, reduces the contest to a two-horse race. The other contestant is Unitel, a consortium combining Fiat, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire and Vodafone of the UK. In January, Etra, the fourth serious bidder, dominated by subsidiaries of the state-controlled Eni energy and chemicals concern, joined forces with Unitel. Pronto Italia's decision has been seen as a big boost for Omnitel, which has been pushing strongly for the licence. Italy is now Europe's third biggest cellular communications market after the UK and Germany, with about 1.2m subscribers Demand might have increased even faster had Italy's anti-monopoly authorities not stopped the state-controlled Sip telephones utility from soliciting new subscribers. Sip monopolises the existing analogue network and had started experimental services with a system based on the new Europe-wide GSM digital network standard when it was told not to solicit for GSM business. The ban followed a European Union ruling demanding an end to state monopolies in mobile communications and the introduction of private sector competition. After some delays, the decision to break Sip's monopoly is now moving ahead in earnest. The latest jockeying for position among the contestants comes ahead of a March 1 deadline for final proposals. Bids will then be put to the team of consultants and bankers commissioned by Italy's posts ministry to assess the plans. A winner is expected to be named by the end of April. That deadline is by no means certain, however. Should a choice not be made in time, the prospect of a new government after the March 27 general election could tempt the existing government, which will stay on as caretaker until a new administration is sworn in, to put off a decision. Postponement has its merits; choosing a winner is a political minefield given the prestige and political clout of the companies involved. Mr Maurizio Pagani, the post minister, indicated earlier this month that a choice could come before the end of April if ministry specialists found that one bid was patently superior to the others. A finely-matched contest, on the other hand, would make the decision that much harder, he implied Analysts are unable to pinpoint a clear front runner on either technological or financial grounds. Although each of the consortia has tried to distinguish itself from its rivals, all have stressed their avant-garde technology, experience, financial muscle and marketing and distribution skills. However, this week's apparent boost to Omnitel does not leave Unitel entirely down and out. Within minutes of the news, it responded by announcing a deal with IBM's Italy-based regional headquarters to develop and use special IBM software for its new network. Although IBM is not taking a stake, the association of such a prestigious name with Unitel was seen as a speedy attempt at limit the damage of the surprise Pronto Italia-Omnitel alliance.</p>

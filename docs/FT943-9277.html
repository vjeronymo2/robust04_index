			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / City regulator imposes life ban on former investment advisers Regulators yesterday barred two former investment advisers from the industry for life, bringing to four the individuals banned under section 59 of the Financial Services Act. The Securities and Investments Board earlier this year made convicted fraudster Mr Roger Levitt the first target of its barring powers. The two named yesterday are Mr Peter Glennie - the target of a High Court injunction last year preventing him from collecting insurance premiums for policies that did not appear to exist - and Mr John Charles Miles, who was convicted in 1989 of theft and sentenced to five years in prison. Mr Miles, who also operated as John Carrington Miller and Jonathan Charles Miles, later became an independent financial adviser associated with Knight Williams, a chain of independent financial advisers, providing false references to facilitate his employment. Knight Williams filed a writ last year against Mr Miles seeking damages for fraudulent misrepresentation of his employment history and providing fraudulent references. While employed by Knight Williams, the writ alleged, Mr Miles induced his clients to invest funds in a company which he controlled. That investment business was not authorised under the Financial Services Act and violated the terms of his employment by Knight Williams. In the case of Mr Glennie, who traded as John Allen and Co, SIB investigators had been looking into the cases of an estimated 200 clients for whom insurance premiums had been collected but not passed on to the relevant insurance company. The second of the four to be barred came earlier this year when SIB also made a permanent disqualification order against Mr Christopher Fallon, a financial adviser jailed for nine months for conducting unauthorised investment business after having been the subject of a High Court injunction barring him from doing so. After the injunction was served on Mr Fallon he took Pounds 24,000 from two individuals. This was not recovered and because the investment business was unauthorised, they could not seek compensation under the Investors Compensation Scheme.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. The Commission's staff is continuing to work with NTIA to make government spectrum available for relocation of existing 2 GHz operations. Further, the Commission believes NTIA will make a good faith effort to accommodate as many as possible of the links recommended for relocation by the Commission. The Commission will request that special consideration be given to reaccommodating links that are technically difficult to accommodate elsewhere, including those that operate in bands allocated for unlicensed services, those of public safety services, and those that require long paths. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. AMSC Subsidiary Corporation (AMSC) requested that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding not apply to the 1970&hyph;1990 and 2160&hyph;2180 MHz bands. AMSC stated that these bands were allocated internationally at the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference to the mobile satellite service (MSS) and plans to petition to have them allocated to MSS domestically in the near future. AMSC argued that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding were developed for local markets and terrestrial technologies and that they may not be feasible for MSS, which operates nationwide or, in some cases, worldwide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. This proceeding establishes relocation rules for the emerging technologies bands and does not address what types of services should be authorized in these bands. Other rule making proceedings, such as 2 GHz PCS, address specific services. Thus, AMSC's request is beyond the scope of this proceeding and therefore is not being adopted, but may be considered in a later proceeding that addresses MSS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordering clauses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it is ordered <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , That the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed to the Second R&amp;O by Comsearch, Digital Microwave Corporation, and Western Tele-Communications, Inc. and the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed to the Third R&amp;O) by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Special Committee on Communications, Public Safety Communications Council, Public Safety Microwave Committee, Forestry-Conservation Communications Association, Association of American Railroads, Unlicensed PCS Ad Hoc Committee for 2 GHz Microwave Transition and Management, Utilities Telecommunications Council, Apple Computer, and AMSC Subsidiary Corporation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> are granted <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the degree stated above and are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> denied <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all other respects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29.

ET Licensees may also negotiate agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Domestic Public Fixed Radio licensees in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology services, and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations. When it is necessary for an emerging technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

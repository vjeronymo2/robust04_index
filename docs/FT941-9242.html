			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: Sir Sonny had special loan The former secretary-general of the Commonwealth received rental income and deferral of interest on two loans from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International while negotiating a consultancy contract during his last five years in office. Sir 'Sonny' Shridath Ramphal, Commonwealth secretary-general during 1975-90, received a loan for Pounds 200,000 from BCCI in 1984 and a further Pounds 100,000 in 1985 on which all interest was deferred. The bank also paid him rent on two houses: one in Barbados from 1983 which had risen to Dollars 66,000 a year by 1990 net of taxes and rates; and one in London from 1985 amounting to Pounds 43,500 a year by 1990. Sir Sonny was one of several figures courted by BCCI as consultants on international affairs. Others included Lord Callaghan, the former Labour premier, and Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president. The loans and interest - worth more than Pounds 536,000 - were to be written off as part of a Pounds 300,000 a year consultancy contract when he finished his term in 1990. He was to provide leadership through a consultancy organisation for a Third World foundation planned by BCCI. The contract was never fulfilled because of management changes at BCCI in 1990 and its closure by banking regulators in July 1991. Sir Sonny this week confirmed details of the package and denied there was anything unethical in the agreement. 'I could not possibly be blameworthy,' he said. He said he had not performed any work for the bank during his time as Commonwealth secretary-general except as chairman of the Third World Prize established by BCCI in 1979. He said he had negotiated a settlement to repay most of the money owed to the BCCI liquidators, less an offsetting amount to compensate him for the failure of the contract on which he was relying to be honoured. The Bingham report into the supervision of BCCI, published in 1992, says that a session at a Commonwealth Secretariat-sponsored crime symposium at Cambridge University on money laundering and BCCI in 1989 was cancelled on the directions of the secretary-general's office. Sir Sonny said he had no knowledge of the decision to cancel the session. Internal documents prepared by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, suggest that the bank had been attempting to hire Sir Sonny as an adviser since 1980. The recruitment was delayed after he was re-elected but the documents say he 'continued to appropriately project (its) image and policies.'</p>

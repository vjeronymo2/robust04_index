			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / OECD sees Austria as a top economic performer AUSTRIA'S economy should continue to be one of the best performers among industrialised countries, with real growth this year likely to be close to last year's 3 per cent, according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD, in its annual examination of Austrian economic policies and prospects, chides the country for some slippage in its medium term programme to reduce public sector deficits and for grossly excessive and anachronistic agricultural support policies, but otherwise gives it a remarkably clean bill of health. 'The Austrian economy has continued to do well in terms of all major macroeconomic performance indicators: growth, employment and external and internal financial stability,' the report concludes. While exports have declined with the slump in demand from Germany, tourism earnings have remained high. Domestic investment, especially in construction, has been resilient despite higher interest rates caused by the firm link between the Austrian schilling and the D-Mark. The 24.5 per cent share of fixed investment in GDP last year was one of the highest in the OECD. Wage settlements have moderated, and their impact has been softened by continuing improvements in productivity, as Austrian industry prepares for integration with the European community. Also, the large numbers of immigrant workers entering the market are depressing average wage rates. The OECD projects a 1 per cent decline in Austrian relative unit labour costs in common currency terms in both 1992 and 1993. Exports are expected to decline further this year and the investment climate may be adversely affected by lingering high interest rates. However, the OECD believes a strong backlog of construction orders should limit the fall in capital spending, and GDP should grow at 2.8 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent next year. Still, the report criticises the government for extending its target of reducing the federal deficit to 2.5 per cent of GDP from this year to 1994 and for tolerating budget overruns.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Paying the price of being famous - Bethan Hutton looks at insurance premiums THE PRICE of fame could well be paid in highly expensive insurance premiums. Household names from sport, theatre or television are - perhaps surprisingly  -lumped with scrap metal dealers, bookmakers and journalists as 'undesirables' by many of the large insurance companies when they request motoring cover. Other occupations that may face higher premiums are market traders; casino, night club and amusement arcade operators; bartenders; disc jockeys; foreign diplomats; students, and members of the armed forces. A company's response to such applicants can vary from point-blank refusal, to requests for further information, to an automatic premium loading of 25 or 50 per cent. Famous people can pay more because companies reason that, if they depend on their face for a living and have an accident that damages it, an injury claim could be very expensive. The greater chance of driving while tired or after drinking lies behind higher premiums for such night workers as bar staff, disc jockeys, casino employees and some journalists. Scrap metal dealers, market traders, bookmakers and dog and horse trainers get a rough ride at most companies. Some point to all the driving between race tracks, or the possibility of causing or incurring injury when driving through a crowded street market. A more honest reply might be that people in these occupations are considered to be 'moral hazards' and not trustworthy. Any sideline, particularly if you use your car for it, can affect your insurance rating - say, if you take a stand occasionally at an antiques fair. You might find yourself classed as a market trader. After several bad years, companies are trying to clamp down on claims and increase revenue wherever they can. One dodge under particular fire is insuring a car in another person's name, and then naming the high-risk person as a driver. Companies, burnt by experiences of young drivers insuring cars in their parents' names, have taken to rating a policy according to the worst-risk driver named. Another hazard lies in changing employment after taking out a motor policy and neglecting to tell your insurer. If your new job is one the company frowns upon, it would be entitled to refuse to pay out after an accident because you had not disclosed relevant information. For the same reason, it is also better to resist the temptation to describe your job as something more innocuous, or to give it a deliberately vague title such as 'executive.' But the jobs which companies regard with suspicion, and the premium loadings for 'higher risk' occupations, vary between companies so it pays to shop around. SelectDirect, a new telephone broking service, found only 12 insurers willing to quote for a journalist but, of those that would, several charged less than for a financial adviser (for whom most insurers were happy to provide a quote). The new breed of direct telephone insurers, like GA 1-2-1 and Direct Line, can offer lower motor insurance premiums - but usually only to low-risk drivers. They can have much stricter underwriting criteria, too - rejecting anyone under 25, for example - and may also refuse occupations acceptable to other insurers. So, if a direct insurer turns you down, try a broker instead. If you are a member of a union or professional body, find out if it has any special insurance arrangements. Equity, the actors' union, is one that does because its members often find it impossible to get cover elsewhere. Retirement or redundancy can reduce the premium load, but some insurers are reluctant to cover the unemployed. And there may still be some weighting of premiums when you retire because of your former occupation. In the long term, there is the hope that insurance companies will alter their view of your job, but a lot depends on attitudes and the claims records of each insurer. Doctors used to be regarded with as bad risks because of their long hours and emergency call-outs, but that seems to have changed. Your occupation can also influence your acceptability to insurers when it comes to household contents. Here again, the famous come off badly. A major area of concern is whether your absences from home are well known - if, for instance, you present a live television programme, or are riding a horse in the three o'clock at Newmarket, or are answering questions in parliament. Insurers fear that an alert burglar might take the opportunity to call. Another worry is that souvenir hunters may pounce on the homes of entertainment and sporting stars. Antique dealers, jewellers, market traders, scrap metal merchants and the like also face problems with household insurance: criminals are known to target the homes of owners of cash-based businesses, or ones where valuable goods may be brought home. Jobs requiring long absences from home, such as airline pilots, oil rig workers, soldiers or sailors, also worry insurance offices. But you can make them happier if you can show that another family member or a housekeeper is likely to be there when you aren't.</p>

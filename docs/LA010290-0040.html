			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THOMAS BROS. BEGINS COMPUTER MAPPING  </P> <P> Thomas Bros., the venerable map maker that has helped guide generations of  Southern California drivers, entered the high-tech era last month with the  release of its first book of fully computer-generated maps.  </P> <P> The new guide for Sacramento is the first product of a three-year effort by  Thomas Bros. to develop a system for electronically storing and updating the  millions of pieces of information that go into a street map.  </P> <P> The first Los Angeles and Orange counties guide to use the new system will be  published in about a year. Warren Wilson, president and chief executive officer  of Thomas Bros., said the company hopes to have all of its 24 map books  computerized within two years.  </P> <P> The Sacramento guide features a new, brighter cover, and is slightly larger  than the traditional guide.  </P> <P> The map pages have a cleaner look, with more color and better graphics, and the  text is larger and easier to read.  </P> <P> Wilson said Sacramento is serving as a trial site because it has the right mix  of characteristics and is not an important market for the company, which serves  every county in California and several other areas in Western states.  </P> <P> Thomas Bros.' digital mapping system converts geographical information from  aerial photographs into millions of bits of information that can be stored and  manipulated by a computer. Once the basic data is in the system, it can be  augmented or amended easily with a few keystrokes.  </P> <P> Even more important, having a computer database of map information will enable  Thomas Bros. to generate special-purpose maps and other information that might  be useful to businesses, government agencies, universities or individuals.  </P> <P> As an example, Wilson said the company would be using data collected in the  1990 census and combining it with its map information to produce maps showing  the demographic characteristics of areas.  </P> <P> The company has set up a new subsidiary, called Thomas Bros. Information  Systems, to develop and market specialized products derived from the master  database.  </P> <P> "We will be moving into these ancillary product areas, as well as publishing  traditional guides," Wilson said.  </P> <P> He said Thomas Bros. has invested $3 million to $4 million thus far in  developing the digital mapping system.  </P> <P> One of Thomas Bros.' biggest concerns in launching the new guides is that they  will use a new page and grid system that will not correspond to the old system.  For customers who count on the Thomas Bros. reference points to find a  location, the guide provides a conversion chart, and the company has  established a toll-free phone number to respond to any questions.  </P></p>

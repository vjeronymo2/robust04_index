			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASING MANAGERS SEE MORE SIGNS OF A SLOWDOWN  </P> <P> In another sign of widespread weakness in the economy, the nation's purchasing  agents said Tuesday that their closely watched index of buying activity fell  below the critical 50% level in July for the third straight month.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said in its monthly report on  business that the index, compiled from purchasing executives at more than 250  industrial companies, fell to 46% from 48.8% in June and 49.7% in May.  </P> <P> A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing segment of the economy is  expanding, while one below 50% suggests that it is contracting.  </P> <P> The July reading was the lowest since January, 1983, when the index was also  46%, the association said. It was the third consecutive reading below 50%,  following 33 consecutive months above that level.  </P> <P> The report comes after a string of recent government reports indicating that  economic growth in the United States is slowing and may be grinding to a halt.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction spending fell 0.8%  in June, a sharper decline than the 0.3% decline that had been expected by  economists. On Friday, the department said growth in personal spending  practically came to a halt last month.  </P> <P> Reaction to the purchasing agents' report was strong in the bond market, which  took it to mean that a recession was imminent and that interest rates were  headed lower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Declines  </P> <P> In the stock market, the report initially had little effect as stocks rose  modestly. But by the close, the Dow Jones industrial index dropped 19.54 to  2,641.12, apparently on recession fears bolstered by the report.  </P> <P> The dollar also fell, trading at 1.8570 West German marks after closing Monday  at 1.86.50. Against the Japanese yen, it was at 136.45, down from 136.92, on  expectations of lower interest rates.  </P> <P> The purchasing agents said their index has averaged 50.6% for the first seven  months of 1989.  </P> <P> "Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the  balance of 1989, it would be consistent with real (economic) growth of about  2.1%," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee.  </P> <P> But Bretz said the index's average for the past four months, 49.4%, appears to  be more consistent with real growth in gross national product of about 1.7%.  </P> <P> The index would have to fall below 44% before indicating a real decline in the  nation's total output of goods and services.  </P> <P> The association said production declined in July, snapping a string of 35  consecutive months of expansion. The production index slid to 48.3% in July  from 52.4% the month before. The index last month was at its lowest level since  July, 1985, when it was 48.2%.  </P> <P> New orders fell for the second consecutive month, following 48 continuous  months of growth. The new order index fell to 44.8% last month, its lowest  level since November, 1982, when the economic recovery began.  </P> <P> The group also said prices fell for the second straight month after 34  consecutive months of increase. The price index slipped to its lowest level  since April, 1986. Corrugated shipping containers, considered an economic  bellwether, fell in price after many years of increases.  </P> <P> PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX  </P> <P> The index, based on a survey of 250 purchasing executives, is a composite of  five separate indicators: new orders, production, vendor deliveries,  inventories and employment.  </P> <P> July '89: 46%  </P> <P> Source: Associated Press  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the bloodbath by presidential guards in  which almost the entire government has been wiped out including  the prime minister, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a new group  has declared itself as members of the new government in Rwanda.    The new group is headed by Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, as the  new president, and Mr. Jean Kambanda as prime minister. The  government also includes Mr. Justin Mugenzi and Agnes  Ntamabyaliro from the controversial faction of the Liberal  Party. The new government is unlikely to succeed because all  the members have been strong opponents of the Arusha peace  agreement. The Arusha peace agreement is supported by the  majority of the Rwandan Republic and the agreement is now  enshrined in the fundamental law of the land.    This new government has been (?formed) by the opponents of  the Arusha peace agreement in a meeting of the party leaders  that was convened on 26 and 27 February 1994. In this meeting,  those who are opposed to the Arusha peace agreement wanted the  government of the late Agathe Uwilingiyimana replaced. They  called for the formation of a government of hardliners who would  force the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to accept the terms of  the extremists. [Words indistinct] they could not find any legal  framework in which to form their new government.    The government has only been formed after bloodshed that has  claimed almost the entire political leadership in Rwanda. The  methods are highly suspicious. But one thing is clear. The  so-called government in Rwanda cannot get Rwanda out of the  current crisis because this government consists of people who  are against national reconciliation, which is now cherished by  the majority of the Rwandan public.    The so-called government is made of people who are fighting  hard to keep the political power within the clique that has been  ruling for the last 20 years. The political struggle in Rwanda  and the wars that have lasted for more than three years have  been against the political monopoly by the ruling clique. This  new scheme calling itself the Government of Rwanda should brace  itself for a showdown with the democratic forces in Rwanda.</p>

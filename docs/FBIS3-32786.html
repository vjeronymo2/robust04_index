In an  exclusive interview by our reporter (Carea Bermudes), Lage  stresses the importance of the trip.    [Lage] "We are very satisfied with the trip. I believe the  meetings we held with the presidents of the three countries were  excellent. We established an excellent channel of communication  and I think the opportunities represented by these meetings are  very important for us. We had the occasion to explain our  situation, what we are doing, the measures we are adopting, and  the importance of the struggle against the U.S. blockade under  current conditions.    "We met not only with the presidents of those countries, but  also with other officials, with ministers and businessmen. I  think the environment is very positive for strengthening current  political, economic, and commercial relations with the countries  we visited. The fruit of this positive environment was the  visits to those countries, and I believe these visits can  contribute to improving relations.    [(Bermudes)] "In your opinion, what were the highlights of  those visits?    [Lage] "I think the most outstanding points were the respect  for the Cuban Revolution, the interest in our country's  situation, the increasing awareness of the need to fight against  the U.S. blockade, an understanding of the measures the country  is adopting to adjust itself to current circumstances, and the  possibility that the measures we are adopting can lead to  greater economic integration with Latin America. I think one of  the main results of the visits is the thrust we are giving to  inviting investment in the Cuban economy and strengthening  economic and commercial ties, as well as opening new  possibilities for the export of Cuban products to those  countries of the region."    Colombian Ambassador to Cuba (Ricardo Santamaria) also  returned to Havana. He participated in Lage's visit to Colombia.  Santamaria also conveyed his opinion to this station.    [(Santamaria)] "I would say that the visit was very positive  because bilateral relations were strengthened, especially in the  area of business. Vice President Lage met with Colombian  businessmen, six ministers, and President Gaviria. We must also  mention the visit of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and  the reestablishment of relations. We hope that after this visit,  we will be able to arrange a visit to Cuba between Colombian  businessmen and various ministers for closer identification of  points of cooperation.    [(Bermudes)] "And what about the invitation extended by Lage  to President Gaviria to visit Cuba?    [(Santamaria)] Well, we have a program which includes a  visit  by the transport minister and by the foreign trade minister for  the signing of a preliminary agreement, and finally the visit of  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. These arrangements are in progress  and we hope they will develop well. I am certain that the  development of these relations will be fruitful both for  Colombia and Cuba."</p>

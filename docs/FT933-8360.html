			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Spate of call-warrant issues as gold loses some of its lustre The decline in the price of gold in recent weeks has coincided with a spate of issues of gold warrants by banks. Most have been call warrants, allowing holders to buy gold at a pre-determined price. Essentially, call warrants are attractive to investors with a bullish view on the gold market. Deutsche Bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse Financial Products are among the houses to have issued one or more series of warrants in the past two weeks. So why has heavy issuance of warrants coincided with the market's decline, after the price of gold rallied from around Dollars 330 at the start of the year to just over Dollars 400 at the beginning of this month? And why has it come at a time when most analysts have decided that inflation, against which gold is often used as a hedge, is less of a problem than they had thought? The cynical answer is that the banks which issued (or wrote) the warrants felt that the rally was over and they stood to earn handsome returns by writing warrants without hedging their positions. However, there does seem to be demand for the warrants, both among continental European retail investors and some institutions. Investors tend to buy warrants - which are essentially long-dated options - when they are less sure of their view on the market. An investor holding a call warrant stands to lose the cost of the warrant - or premium - if the market moves the wrong way, but an outright purchase of gold leaves an investor with potentially unlimited exposure if the market collapses. Consequently, for investors who still believe gold could rally further, but are not firmly convinced, warrants offer an attractive alternative. They also allow investors to take a view on the market using only a small investment and maximising the amount of leverage. One analyst said that some investors with bond portfolios had bought gold warrants as a hedge against inflation. There is a growing wave of opinion that inflation in the most developed economies is likely to remain low, and many investors have positioned themselves by taking large positions in the bond market. However, a hedge against inflation could prove a useful insurance policy if their expectations are disappointed. Institutions may prefer to buy over-the-counter options on gold, rather than warrants, because OTC options can be structured to suit their needs. But the advantage of warrants is that they can be traded, since the banks that issue them are committed to making a market. Gold warrants can therefore be an attractive tool for taking a speculative position that the gold market will rally. A number of analysts are still quite positive on the prospects for gold. 'Our view is that this pull-back is a bit greater than we would have thought, but it is not unexpected,' said Mr Michael Coulson, at Credit Lyonnais. There are still reasons to believe that the market's potential is capped by factors such as potential selling by central banks, which need to shore up their foreign exchange reserves. Further, the inflation potential of OECD countries is indeed restrained. But gold is one of the most international markets, and active buyers can be found in countries where there are substantial fears about the inflationary outlook. In OECD countries, some analysts believe low interest rates will encourage investment in commodities, since investors are sacrificing only a small loss of income by buying gold.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Property: High premium for a Jekyll gem TUCKED AWAY at the bottom of most estate agents' particulars is a reference to 'pleasant landscaped gardens', or 'well-stocked borders'. Many indeed are the horticultural howlers - 'rhododendrums' and 'hydranjers' are not uncommon; as for the ginkgo tree, few can recognise it, let alone spell it. Horticulture dictionaries are about as common as unicorns in most property sales offices. However, the garden is the frame of the house and often, if it is well presented, it can catch the eye of a potential buyer. Where it is of exceptional merit or historic interest it may be listed, in the same way as important houses. And if it is one of the gems designed by Gertrude Jekyll, it will certainly enjoy the protection of the law. Jekyll, the myopic old lady whom Sir Edwin Lutyens referred to as 'Bumps', was a genius of the garden; she could recognise a tree by the sound of the leaves in the breeze. With Lutyens she formed an architectural/horticultural team that may never be matched. One of the finest examples of their collaboration is Fulbrook, high on the brow of a hill a few miles from Farnham, with distant southerly views over Sussex. The house was built in 1896 for Mrs Gerard Streatfield, in whose family it stayed for nearly 70 years. The 21-acre grounds include a fine terraced western hillside designed by Jekyll; the dry stone walls are planted with sedums and campanulas. There is also a trout lake, which the old lady would probably have liked; and a helipad and floodlit tennis court, which she probably would not. The house has 11 bedrooms plus an indoor swimming pool and billiards room. It cost Pounds 10,000 to build nearly 100 years ago; the price now suggested by Hamptons is 'in excess of Pounds 2.5m'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA does not concur with this commenter's suggestion that this AD action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not appropriate. The accident involving the Model DC&hyph;10 was the primary reason  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prompting this AD and the previously-issued AD's to mandate specific maximum brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wear limits on transport category airplane. During the process of promulgating those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended brake wear limits. For example, in one case, three different operators of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same model of airplane were found to be observing three different maximum brake wear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits. Further, the FAA is aware that, until recently, not all manufacturers had provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake wear limits that met the FAA criteria, e.g., landing distance predicated upon single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine-out, maximum takeoff weight, and fully worn brakes. The purpose of this AD is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no way an attempt to question the ability of U.S. operators to safely administer to brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wear limits criteria; its purpose is to establish what those brake wear limits are.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to replace the landing gear sliding member after an RTO event. One of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggests that, instead of requiring replacement, the proposed rule could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require inspections of the sliding member, using procedures that are currently included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 05&hyph;51&hyph;01. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter states that similar inspection procedures exist for most other commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft, and those procedures have proven to be a safe and effective method of evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landing gears for the effects of high brake heat. This commenter also suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional procedures could include inspection of the axles for evidence of discolored or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peeling paint with cadmium plating that is blistered, wrinkled, or mottled (signs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cadmium melting and resolidifying). Cadmium melts at 610  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F, which is very close to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tempering temperature of ultra-high strength steels; therefore, if the cadmium is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> melted, it is unlikely that any heat damage has been done to the steel sliding member axle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter notes that this criteria has been used for other aircraft, and this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter plans to contact Fokker to request that this type of inspection criteria be added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Fokker F28 Mark 0100 AMM. Further, another commenter states that, on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft models in its fleet, it regularly performs a visual inspection of the pistons following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an RTO to determine the amount of heat that the piston has been subjected to; the degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of discoloration of the paint on the axle and the amount of damage to the hydraulic hoses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are evidence of the amount of heat. This commenter also plans to contact Fokker to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request the inclusion of this inspection in the AMM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the suggestion to revise the proposed rule, at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this time. The FAA has queried Fokker directly about the inspection procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested by these commenters; however, Fokker was not aware of any effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nondestructive inspection technique that can be used to establish whether cadmium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embrittlement has taken place on the axle after an RTO. Fokker did indicate that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently working with the manufacturer of the brakes to devise a way to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure of the sliding member to heat from the brakes, which in turn would limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to replace the sliding member. Once an inspection or other procedure is developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would preclude the necessity of replacing the sliding member, the FAA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider further rulemaking on this issue. In the meantime, under the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d) of the final rule, the FAA would consider requests for the use of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of complying with this rule, provided sufficient data are presented to justify such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the proposed entry in the maintenance program [as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal] and the proposed entry in the AFM [as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal] be revised. This commenter states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations have shown that only when ``flap 0'' is selected, there is a possibility to reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an energy level that can cause the axle to overheat. Therefore, those entries should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a statement that, during the RTO scenario, the flaps would have to be at 0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degrees. The commenter suggests that the wording of both entries be changed to read as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> If flap 0 is selected,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> and if a takeoff is rejected at a speed greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90 percent of *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA concurs and has revised paragraphs (b) and (c) of the final rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This same commenter suggests that the AFM entry proposed in paragraph (c) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reworded to include language that is more familiar to pilots, who will be the primary users  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this information in the Limitations Section. Specifically, the commenter suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilots would be more familiar with the term ``V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (takeoff decision speed) than with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MBE <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (maximum brake energy limit speed). The commenter states that use of V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference is more appropriate than V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MBE <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in this context, as well, since it is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative with respect to the axle overheat problem. Along this same line, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggests that the AFM wording be revised to indicate that ``the rejected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takeoff conditions should be reported to maintenance personnel prior to the next takeoff''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that ``further dispatch may be affected.'' The FAA concurs with all of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions and has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  If a pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were to report a rejected takeoff event to maintenance personnel and refer the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  speed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved, maintenance personnel can recalculate the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  figure to a V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> MBE <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  figure by means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a graph incorporated into the AMM.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This commenter also suggests that proposed paragraph (b) be revised to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the part numbers of the main landing gears (MLG) equipped with the sliding members that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be replaced. Adding a reference to the MLG part numbers would avoid any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the currently-installed Dowty MLG's and other brands of MLG's that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expected to be certified and installed in the near future. The FAA concurs with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion and has revised paragraph (b) of the final rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

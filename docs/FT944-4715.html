			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Game beyond patience The government can go on like this. Alas, it probably will. The question is  -for how long? Yesterday the answer might have been clear. The assumption was that the Conservative term that began in April 1992 would last the full five years, if the party managers thought they could improve their chances of winning the next election by hanging on. That assumption is now history. Mr John Major can no longer bank on a full term. He is the plaything of fate. He cannot credibly aspire to be the master of events. His administration is not about to fall, but it is increasingly unsteady on its feet. We could, therefore, be in for an indefinite period of unstable government, one that should go but nevertheless stays. It is only when - if - a ministry is forced to abandon its budgetary stance that it can be said to have failed absolutely. In such circumstances it is obliged to resign. As matters rest, the prime minister can hold on, hoping for a turn in the Conservatives' political fortunes. His strategies may appear in ruins - a familiar sight - but in theory he could recover. Mr Major was careful to establish that the vote he lost last night was not a matter of confidence. He was, of course, technically correct. Labour's successful motion merely amended the parliamentary procedure for handling this year's finance bill. The Chancellor's sensible response to the vote was instantly to throw in his losing hand, and it should not take too much imagination for him to come up tomorrow with substitute taxes or further expenditure cuts to plug the financial gap. But in the real world of contemporary politics, nothing is that simple. The government was knocked sideways in September 1992, when, on Black Wednesday, sterling was summarily ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism. That set off a downward spiral of political misfortune from which the administration has spasmodically managed to extricate itself, always to fall back into a hole shortly afterwards. Mr Major may go down in history as the Phoenix with nine lives. He is ever picking himself up, always to be slammed over again. Every Conservative knows why. The party, divided on Europe before Black Wednesday, became more deeply schismatic after that searing experience. Most of its leaders achieved political maturity during the 1980s, when the Tories enjoyed 100-plus majorities. They have found Parliament more difficult to manage with the small and dwindling majority won in spring 1992. Mr Major would have resigned a few months later if he had lost the vote on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty, or last week if he had failed to win the vote on an increase in European Union funds. The government shrank from privatising the Post Office because, as it admitted, it did not command the necessary parliamentary support. It is moving in a world of shifting coalitions, familiar in other European countries and the US, but alien to the English mind. Whitehall is horrified at the prospect of power sharing. Yet on one issue the government must gain the support of Ulster Unionists; on a second it must declare a vote of confidence to avoid defeat; on a third it is obliged to engineer a further turn of the ratchet towards the Eurosceptics. Mr Major's posture on the EU, his arms around its heart while he kicks it in the shins, is increasingly difficult to sustain. Mr Kenneth Clarke's cunning Budget plan, building up indirect taxes today in order to bribe the voters with cuts in income tax next year, would make sense if the Tories were united, but plainly they are not. Previous lost budgetary votes are an unreliable guide to what happens now. Labour lost a clutch of them in 1977. It was turfed out two years later. In 1981 Lord Howe, then chancellor, raised several taxes, but was defeated by a Labour amendment that deleted an increase in the duty on diesel. He responded by increasing other imposts. Yet the most triumphant years of the Thatcher government of which he was then a pillar followed. Mr Major's present situation undoubtedly bears a closer resemblance to that of the Callaghan administration of 1978-79 than it does to the Thatcher ministry of the early 1980s. The last Labour government struggled on, with the help of Ulster votes, past everyone's patience. It is possible, but increasingly less likely, that the Tories will manage to do the same.</p>

Chachin] </F>   [Text]The conversion of defense enterprises to the  manufacture of civilian products has already been occurring for  several years. Nonetheless, the state conversion program has not  yet been developed, and discussions on ways to implement it  continue. While ways to solve the problem are being discussed,  conversion continues. Many major, well-known defense enterprises  which are part of the Aviation Industry Department, Radio  Industry Department and Communications Industry Department of  the Russian Industry Ministry (now the Russian Federation State  Committee on Defense Industries), are beginning to fill civilian  orders. Their activities in the telecommunications field can be  attested to by the exhibits shown at the end of last year in  Moscow at the ``Conversion-92'' International Fair Showroom, the  ``Science, Business, and Industry to Agriculture'' displays, and  the ``Communications-93'' International Exposition organized in  May of this year. Materials from these exhibitions were used to  prepare the article published below.    In the Russian Federation, where 69% of enterprises  and  organizations of the former U.S.S.R.'s military industrial  complex are concentrated, conversion encompasses a wide circle  of industrial enterprises, research institutes, and  construction, operating and other organizations. In order to use  their potential in the interests of developing a civilian  communications network, the following main conversion trends  have been provided for:        -  redirecting the industrial, scientific and technical  potential to produce and develop communications equipment for  civilian purposes;    %using military communications equipment that has already  been created and is already in production by making the  necessary modifications for the economy;    %using scientific and technical achievements obtained  during the development of military devices in order to create  modern civilian communications equipment.       The main trend in the work to convert enterprises from  military to civilian production is the creation of  telecommunications systems and equipment within the framework of  the Russian Federal Target-Oriented Program for Developing  Communications Equipment and Information Systems in 1992-1995.  The components of these programs (conversion programs for  individual enterprises and scientific research institutes) have  undergone an expert's analysis in the Communications Industry  Department and Ministry of the Economy of the Russian  Federation, the Ministry of Finance and Russian Central Bank.    Military communications equipment is being more widely used  in the civilian industries of the economy. Though operators on  geologic expeditions, on gas and oil pipelines, in energy  networks and so on previously thought it was an impossible dream  to acquire this military equipment, now many former limitations  have been removed.    A significant percentage of special radio communications  and radio relay communications equipment commercially-produced  by enterprises of the military industrial complex can be used  without any kind of significant modifications or modernization  in various spheres of the economy, especially in the  agro-industrial complex, where advantages of military equipment  such as operation in broad temperature ranges, dust and moisture  resistance and anti-shock qualities of the equipment,  independent electrical powering, easy maintenance, etc., may be  required to the greatest degree.    These types of devices are small ones (hand-held and  driven) for dispatcher communications, stationary radio  communications devices, radio relay and tropospheric  communication devices for arranging interregional, regional and  technical communications. In total, specialists of the  ``Telecom'' joint-stock company have calculated that about 40  types of communications devices can be supplied to consumers in  the economy without any type of alterations.    Some types of these devices are made by the Popov Factory  AN Production Association (Nizhni Novgorod). Among them are  R-980 ``Canoe'' mobile control centers, R-849M1 mobile  communications radio unit, and the R-986 communications unit.    Among the purely civilian communications equipment, the  ``Iset'' digital radio relay system must be mentioned. It was  developed by the ``Vektor'' State Enterprise (Yekaterinburg) and  operates in the 15 GHz range of telephone channels (with a  digital information transmission speed of 8.448 Mbit/sec)  between urban and rural automatic telephone stations and  telephone stations of individual industrial and commercial  facilities. The digital information transmission distance is no  less than 30 kilometers for one transit of the radio line. The  stationary equipment of the ``Iset'' radio relay station  connects with standard devices of IKM-120, IKM-30 and IKM-15  digital transmission systems, which markedly simplifies its  usage in local communications networks.    The ``Polet'' Scientific Research Institute (Nizhni  Novgorod) is one of the largest producers of aviation radio  communications equipment in the country. It is offering portable  radio stations, automobile data transmission terminals, etc., to  the economy.    The ``Moscow Scientific Research Television Institute''  Joint- Stock Company creates low-power television retranslators  and transmitters, cable television systems, television  monitoring receivers, and a specialized computer for colored  television studios.    The low-power television retranslator is designed to  provide television broadcasting to small towns blocked by the  local relief from the direct signal of a powerful television  transmitter.    A small-power television transmitter generates and radiates  standard high frequency television display and sound signals on  any given channel in meter and decimeter wave ranges. It can  also be used to provide television broadcasting to small towns  located along radio relay line routes, to create local  broadcasting television centers in small towns, collective  farms, and state farms, and to organize training television  centers, etc.    The commercial system of cable television is designed to  distribute television programs to subscribers along fiber-optic  communications lines via subscriber switches located remotely  from the program distribution point. This allows the  transmission of one of eight television programs with sound to  the subscribers' receivers at their selection. The number of  subscriber switches is not limited in this system.    Backward channel equipment for cable television systems  permits data to be exchanged between the head station and  distribution network devices, as well as subscriber devices, in  order to broaden the number of services provided to the  subscriber, and in order to make it possible to supervise the  status of the distribution network and the line, distribution  and house amplifiers, as well as other engineering facilities  located in homes serviced by that cable television system.    By using this promising equipment, subscribers can obtain  additional services, such as fire and intrusion detection for  rooms, medical assistance, and pay-per-view for commercial  television programs.    The KTV-1 specialized computer is designed for colored  television studios, mobile television stations, training  television centers and video libraries. It generates a TV signal  of text and graphic information simultaneously with the control  room signal and allows work to be carried out in the mixing,  special effects and rear projection modes. The KTV-1 can use a  variety of text and graphic editors and programming languages.  The use of this device allows the technical and creative  potential of television studios to be broadened.    The ``ASTRA'' Scientific Production Association has  developed a stationary transmitter-receiver control room called  ``Liliya-S,'' which is designed to be placed at terminals of  reporting radio relay junction lines of the ``Liliya'' and  ``Liliya-1'' type, and to service television channels and the  sound accompaniment channels of reporting radio relay lines. It  is possible to place from one to six reporting radio relay line  terminal units in the control room. Depending upon how it is  equipped, the stationary transmitter- receiver control room  services from one to three duplex communications channels. The  control room corrects, controls and switches video signals and  sound accompaniment signals, remotely controls the antennas,  loud speaker and telephone communications, and dispatcher radio  communications.    The ``Vektor'' state enterprise manufacturers TMS-1517 and  TMS- 1517V international and long-distance pay phones. Payment  for conversations is made with coins, tokens, or by credit card.  There is precise control of the tokens, money and credit cards;  slugs are weeded out; the deposited tokens are counted; the  number being dialed and the connection time remaining after the  next coin or token has been collected are optically displayed;  the sum remaining can be used to pay for making a connection  with another subscriber with the appropriate recalculation of  the tariff; conversations are automatically tariffed; and pay  phones are monitored from the automatic control panel.    The Lavochkin Scientific Production Association, the  Academician A. A. Raspletin Scientific Production Association of  the Russian Federation, the ``Radio'' Scientific Production  Association, MRTZ (Moscow) and a number of other organizations  are developing the ``Nord'' commercial satellite communications  system. This system is designed for the northern regions of  Russia, in particular the Tyumen region. The system will include  a full set of space and ground equipment created under a unified  project. This will allow qualitatively new services to be  provided to stationary (fixed) and mobile subscribers, and will  ensure the system functions no matter what state the traditional  domestic communications equipment is in. It will be possible for  users to have direct access to the satellite via their  individual stations, which will make two-way subscriber  communications possible almost throughout all of Russia and the  foreign countries, bypassing the existing communications  network. Individual fixed communications stations can be  interfaced with the local telephone network. An operating mode  and signals which correspond to international standards have  been provided for. The stations will provide telephone, telefax  and telex communications, and intercomputer data exchange  according to international protocol. Portable stations with  1.5-2 meter antennas will be developed. The frequency range is  11-14 GHz.    Satellites of the ``Nord'' system will be launched from the  territory of Russia into a high elliptical orbit with a 12 hour  orbital period. The highest point of the orbit (40,000  kilometers) is located in the northern hemisphere at 63 degrees  latitude. Within a 24 hour period, the satellite will rise above  the northern hemisphere two times. The length of the  communications session last 6.5 hours on each loop. Thus, one  satellite provides communicates for practically all regions of  the northern hemisphere in a 24 hour period, as well as a  portion of the southern hemisphere for two time intervals  lasting 6.5 hours each. The total time is 13 hours. If two  satellites are functioning, 24 hour communications is provided.    `` Nord'' plans to use three or four satellites in the  system for redundancy. The use of satellites in elliptical  orbits for timely communications in the northern hemisphere is  advisable for several reasons. First, all northern hemisphere  countries which are inaccessible to traditional communications  satellites located in geostationary orbits fall within the line  of sight of each satellite. Second, effective communications at  high latitudes are possible. Third, launching a satellite into  an elliptic orbit requires significantly less expenditures and  can be carried out in a compressed time schedule (the advantages  in launch time and cost of the carrier rocket are a factor of  five to six), and the cost of providing the services can be two  or more times less that the existing level of both world and  internal Russian prices. This year there are plans to assemble  and perform surface testing of two satellites.    The Makeyev Design Bureau (Miass) is developing a personal  satellite communications system. In order to implement this  system, the ``URALKOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company has been formed.  It has been directed to attract support for the project from  commercial structures.    The personal satellite communications system is similar to  the ``Iridium'' system of the American Motorola Firm. Since it  has its own carrier rockets which can launch satellites into low  orbits (approximately 700 km), the specialists of the design  bureau have decided to independently develop a domestic system.  V. Kalashnikov, the leading specialist of the marketing service  of the Academician Makeyev ``Space-Rocket System'' Machine  Building Design Bureau feels that, ``...there is no problem in  connecting these two systems.''    The cooperative of development engineers includes about 100  enterprises and organizations. The number of communications  satellites in the orbital group will be 32-48. The frequency  range will be 1.5-1.6 GHz. The information transmission speed  will be 32 kbit/second.    The creation of several types of terminal equipment has  been proposed, from stationary systems, which include a  computer, telex, printer, and fax, to simple portable stations  weighing from one to two kilograms. The latter can be of wide  use in expeditions, geological teams, for servicing gas and oil  pipelines, electrical networks, in special services, etc.    The Radio Device Construction Scientific Research Institute  (Moscow) is developing the ``Signal'' mobile satellite  communications system. The ``Energiya'' Scientific Production  Association and the ``Polet'' Production Association are among  those carrying out the project. It is a commercial system based  on low orbiting satellites. It contains a central amplifier  station, a flight control center, a space segment composed of 48  artificial earth satellites, a base station network consisting  of 5 stations, and subscriber stations. The number of orbits is  4, the inclination is 72 degrees, the elevation is 1,500  kilometers, and the satellite's orbital period is 116 minutes.  As a launcher, the ``Tsiklon'' carrier rocket will be used. A  launch is planned in 1993, and deployment into the national  system in 1995. Deployment into the global system is planned for  1997-2000.    Based on the space communications devices launched into  operational orbits by the ``Energiya'' carrier rocket, the  ``Globus'' space communications system is being developed.    Space devices for the system are being created on the basis  of achievements made by the ``Energiya'' Scientific Production  Association and on the basis of cooperation in the area of  complex space systems, including the ``Energiya-Buran'' shuttle  transport system and piloted orbital systems.    A spacecraft's potential to position heavy payloads with  large power-to-weight ratios of unified space platforms allows  retranslators to be furnished on one craft. These retranslators  simultaneously carry out several functions (fixed and mobile  communications, and direct television broadcasting). This  potential also allows the productivity of the satellites to be  sharply increased, and the number required in orbit to be  sharply decreased. Moreover, it simplifies and reduces the cost  of receivers.    The Moscow-based Radio Communications Scientific Research  Institute is creating the ``Oreol'' on-board retranslator, the  ``Kanat-1S'' on-board antenna system, the ``Potok-P1'' and  ``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications stations, the  ``Format-P'' device, the ``Shtrikh-P'' channel receiver and a  demonstration program for processing satellite information.  These are being created for a domestic space system for  observing the Earth's surface. This system is based on the  ``Planeta-S'' geostationary satellites and is similar to the  Meteosat European system now being operated at the present time,  the American GOES, the Japanese GMS and the Indian ``Insat.''    The ``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications station  (radio buoy) is designed to receive and transmit formalized  messages from meteorological data collection platforms. The  ``Potok-P1'' station only receives messages. Both stations can  operate on vehicles, on geological expeditions and in other  areas. They meet the requirements of the international  information collection system.    The on-board ``Oreal'' retranslator collects and transmits  data from data collection platforms and from ice exploration  aircraft on the hydrometeorological and heliogeophysical  situation on the Earth's surface and in the world's oceans. It  transmits televised information on cloud, ice and snow cover on  the Earth. Its functions also include the transmission of data  on the radiation and magnetic situation in near-Earth space, and  the distribution of weather maps and other processed  meteorological information to users.    With the launch of the domestic artificial Earth satellite  for operating in the global operational meteorological satellite  system, the country has obtained a large flow of meteorological  and geophysical information for use in the economy.    The Avtomatiki Scientific Industrial Association  (Yekaterinburg) has developed the IGLON inertial satellite  system. The system is designed for navigation of spacecraft,  aircraft, sea and lake craft, and automobiles, as well as for  determining coordinates when resolving mapping, geodesic and  geophysical tasks.    The system includes a small inertial gyrostabilized  platform and a multichannel receiver for radio navigation  signals of the GLONASS and NAVSTAR satellite systems.    Depending on consumer requirements, it is thought that  various models of the IGLON device will be manufactured. Each  has different characteristics and design.    Among the other interesting developments in communications,  there are the ``MAG'' subscriber station (President's Federal  Agency of Governmental Communications and Information of the  Russian Federation), the packet communications controller  (COMPAS-R., Ltd. packet communications company), the  multifunctional antenna system (``Fayvish Sheyner and Co.,  Ltd.'' joint stock company in Nizhni Novgorod and the Pravdin  Factory of Radio Relay Equipment), the ``STELA-64'' automatic  electronic telephone station (SVT Scientific Production  Association in the city of Kirov), the KST-300 telephone  scrambler (coding device on a digital channel) and the KST-101  device for closed communications (``KOMREK'' joint stock company  in Moscow).    The ``KOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company (in Krasnoyarsk) has  developed the ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system,  which is designed to: (1) organize communications in  inaccessible regions; (2) create organizations which make it  possible for banks, stock exchanges, trade houses and other  producers of goods and services to begin using the newest  electronic operating technologies; (3) create commercial  informational data bases on various fields for Russian and  foreign users; and (4) to open international computer networks  to Russian users.    The ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system is based  on the usage of stationary artificial Earth satellites of the  ``Gorizont,'' ``Raduga,'' and ``Express'' type, and it consists  of a network of ``Kosmos-SA'' ground subscriber stations which  operate under the command of a ``Kosmos-STs'' ground central  station. In 1993, 60 subscriber stations were deployed in  Russian territory and neighboring countries. In future, their  number will be increased to 1,000-1,500.    The DALS firm (St. Petersburg) is one of Russia's leading  developers and manufacturers of telecommunications systems and  equipment for various purposes. Using the potential that was  released under conversion, this firm has created a number of new  products.    The mobile radio fire and intrusion detection warning  system developed by the firm is a wireless system for fire and  intrusion detection for various industrial, cultural, and  agricultural facilities. It is significant in that the devices  can be deployed, dismantled and set up again in a new location  quickly. It has various configurations, depending on the  specific requirements for facility protection, and it operates  without regard for the serviceability of the facility's main  electrical power network.    There is one other product of the firm--the SA-1 hearing  aid for individuals with weakened hearing. It is made in a  small, over-the-ear case, and is held in place on the outer ear  with a sound wire that ends with an ear insert. The device is  equipped with a volume control, and a switch for conversation  modes where the speaker is present or is speaking on the  telephone, and a power switch.    The ``TEKOS, LTD.,'' Company (Moscow), which was created in  1992 on the basis of the Central Machine Building Scientific  Research Institute which studies space research, has developed a  telecommunications and message processing system. The system  uses effective, fairly inexpensive domestic technology which  combines a personal computer with a packet switching network  based on the MKKTT X.25 and X.32 recommendations. The system  insures the confidentiality and safety of information being  transmitted and processed by using special, certified software  and hardware. At the present time, TEKOS is widely used in  banking (clearing house) organizations for transmitting  information.    The RAZAN Radio Factory offers the R-173-1SV radio station,  which provides two-way telephone radio communications that do  not require fine-tuning or searching between stationary  stations, nor between mobile objects on any of the six  pre-established frequencies.    The Nizhegorod ``Kvarts'' Scientific Research Instrument  Building Institute has developed a BM-01 TMS pay phone which is  designed for long-distance conversations between cities using a  credit card distributed by the communications division.    The pay phone automatically establishes payment for a  conversation based on zone and time, independently establishes  tariffs for the automatically established connections and makes  the appropriate annotation on the credit card. The degree to  which the monetary assets of the credit card are used during the  conversation is displayed on the digital indicator.    The pay phone is connected to the subscriber lines, which  are equipped with a device for automatically determining the  number. Access to the long distance telephone network is  provided along the record operator's connecting lines.    The ``YARZ'' Joint Stock Company (in Yaroslavl) with the  St. Petersburg subsidiary of the RADIO Scientific Production  Association have created ``Kompleks-MG'' equipment for digital  radio relay lines, which provides communications along a narrow  radio beam in the 10.7-11.7 GHz range at a distance of 15-45  kilometers.    The series 300 modern equipment system for distribution  television networks and cable television has been developed  here, in conjunction with the Minsk ``Gorizont'' Production  Association. This system includes a head station, linear, main  line and home amplifiers, and television modulators.    Thus, hundreds of enterprises of the defense complex are  prepared to find peaceful uses for their resources, and they are  ready to cooperate with the communications industry, with new  commercial organizations and foreign business partners who need  their potential.</p>

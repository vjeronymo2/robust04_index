			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ANTI-GULF PROTESTERS SPILL OIL  </P> <P> Half a dozen demonstrators opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Persian  Gulf poured a quart of oil onto a patio in front of the American Petroleum  Institute today to show support for a Marine who refused to be sent to Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> The protesters read a message from the 22-year-old Marine, Cpl.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Paterson, who is confined to his base in Hawaii awaiting a  court-martial.  </P> <P> Paterson's message urged other Americans to join him in saying: "Hell, no, we  won't go, we won't fight for Texaco."  </P> <P> Two counter-demonstrators also showed up.  </P> <P> David Almasi, who said he worked in a building next door, came to the lunchtime  rally with a handmade sign asking: "Why did Jeff Paterson join the Marines? To  surf? Or the free paycheck?"  </P></p>

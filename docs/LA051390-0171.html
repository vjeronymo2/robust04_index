			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER'S DEATH ON HIKE INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Arizona authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death  last week of a 15-year-old Northern California girl who collapsed during a  desert hike overseen by a youth motivation group.  </P> <P> Michelle Sutton of Pleasanton had gone on the hike as a way to distance herself  from alcohol and drug use, friends said. She died Wednesday after she grew  dizzy and collapsed in a remote area north of the Grand Canyon while hiking  with four other youths and two adult counselors.  </P> <P> A close friend of the Sutton family said Saturday he hoped that police would  learn how the teen-ager died during an activity that was supposed to be  well-monitored.  </P> <P> "There's no question that the thought is, 'Why did this happen and was there a  mistake made?' " said Merrill Fisher, a bishop with the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints in Pleasanton, who notified the Sutton family of their  daughter's death. "I'm sure the details will be sought after and found."  </P> <P> According to an unconfirmed report, an autopsy by the Mohave County medical  examiner indicated that the girl's heart stopped as a result of dehydration and  heat exposure. But a spokesman for Summit Quest, a youth motivation group based  in St. George, Utah, that sponsored the wilderness trek, said she had been fed  food and water regularly since she joined the group two days earlier.  </P> <P> Mohave County Sheriff's Sgt. Dale Lent said counselors told investigators that  they became lost while camping near Mount Dellenbaugh, about 100 miles  northeast of Kingman, Ariz.  </P> <P> The survivors said they were almost out of water while on a long hike and that  the girl told them she did not feel well, Lent said. Two group members went  ahead to the next campsite to get water. However, before they returned, the  girl collapsed and her heart stopped, Lent said.  </P> <P> The counselors told authorities they tried to revive her. Summit Quest  spokesman Bob Morey said both counselors were trained emergency medical  technicians.  </P> <P> Because they had not brought communications equipment along, the hikers were  forced to light distress fires to attract an aircraft flying overhead. By the  time National Park Service rangers reached the group, they were almost out of  water, Lent said.  </P> <P> Bishop Fisher said he had been told by the Sutton family that under Summit  Quest's arrangements, Michelle had traveled by plane to Arizona, where she  linked up with the other hikers -- also troubled youths who had flown in from  other parts of the country.  </P> <P> "My understanding is that the hike is part of a commercial venture designed to  help youngsters who have had troubles in one area or another to gain  self-esteem and self-control," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Fisher said that Michelle had hoped to use the wilderness hike as a way to "get  a new start" away from a circle of friends with whom she joined in alcohol and  drug abuse.  </P> <P> "It was a way of getting away from peer pressure," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Fisher described the girl, a sophomore at Amador High School, as a "quiet but  delightful young lady" who had been active in church affairs until her problems  began. Fisher said that she had come to him shortly before leaving on the hike  and told him that "she made some decisions and was feeling a lot better about  her life."  </P></p>

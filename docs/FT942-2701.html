He is the focus of attention both off and on the field. He is notorious for crashing fast cars around Parma. In the Cup Winners Cup final he allowed himself to be distracted by Arsenal's defenders and spent much of the match involved in arguments with the referee. - He is a devil,' said Franco Baresi, the Italian defender. Yet Asprilla can also be divine. If he hits his best form he could lift this talented Colombian team towards the World Cup on his powerful shoulders. Key Game: US v Switzerland (June 18 - Detroit) This group will be decided as much by strength of nerve as depth of talent. Colombia and Romania both have a habit of failing to fulfil their potential. Switzerland and US are largely unknown quantities. Both have good players but both squads contain many players who have largely been sheltered from top level competition. This match will not only set the tone for this group but for how the whole World Cup is received by Americans. The host nation loves a winner and ignores a loser. A US victory could suddenly convince Americans that soccer is a worthwhile sport and not just a nice hobby for schoolgirls. - High-flyer: Ciriaco Sforza, star of Switzerland's midfield Home grown talent: John Harkes playing for the US is tackled by Paul Ince of England</p>

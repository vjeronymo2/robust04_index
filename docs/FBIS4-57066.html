			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mobile unit report by Rothschild Francois from the streets </F> of Port-au-Prince -- live, monitored in progress]    [Text] [Francois] ...should take place. We do not know  exactly where this session will take place, whether in one of  the two branches of the legislature -- that is at the Chamber of  Deputies or the Senate. In any case, the employees of the  Legislative Palace's security service told us just a moment ago  that military and police will be on the scene shortly to  guarantee the safety of the legislators on the occasion of the  installation of Judge Jonassaint as provisional president of the  Republic.    This morning, we see that the main gates to the National  Palace are open. We are waiting for noon, so as to attend the  installation of the new provisional president of the Republic,  attorney Emile Jonassaint, a decision made by the senators of  the Senate Office presided over by Senator Sansaricq. As Senator  Ebrane Cadet told us, certain deputies backed this initiative.    This has been Mobile Unit 20 for Radio Metropole. Listeners  are asked to stay tuned to Metropole for all the news regarding  this installation ceremony, which is to take place at noon in  Port-au- Prince.    [Announcer] Thank you, Rothschild. We have learned from  reliable sources that the Army General Staff will be present at  the ceremony to install the new provisional president. More  details will be provided in a later news bulletin.</p>

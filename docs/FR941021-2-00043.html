The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Exception <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Noltgas Propane Fuel &amp; Supply, 8/2/94, LEE&hyph;0098 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Noltgas Propane Fuel &amp; Supply filed an Application for Exception from the reporting requirement of Form EIA&hyph;782B. In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a serious hardship or gross inequity, as those terms have been defined by the DOE. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Whistleblower Proceeding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Dr. Naresh Mehta, 8/4/94, LWN&hyph;0003 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued an Order granting Dr. Naresh Mehta interim reinstatement to his former position at the Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory. On March 17, 1994, the DOE had found that Dr. Mehta's dismissal by Universities Research Association, a DOE contractor, violated the provisions of the Contractor Employee Protection Regulations, 10 CFR part 708. Although the DOE had ordered that Dr. Mehta be reinstated in March 1994, the reinstatement was stayed by a request for review filed by Universities Research Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY RICE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT REAL EMPTINESS  </P> <P> So Jerry Rice feels an emptiness because he's not getting enough ink in the  newspapers. And I always thought he was being paid handsomely for performing  with his God-given talents.  </P> <P> Poor baby, maybe he should check out the local homeless. Then maybe he'll see  what emptiness is all about.  </P> <P> FRANK CASILLAS  </P> <P> Mar Vista  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Christopher highlights rift with leading allies on Bosnia THE GULF between the US and its leading allies on Bosnia was underlined yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, who said Washington considered it impossible to implement the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia 'at the present time'. His remarks coincided with statements by the European Community and by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, declaring their continuing commitment to the international peace plan. Moscow wants to implement the plan by stages, even though it has not been accepted by the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Christopher told Congress yesterday it would be futile to attend the foreign-ministerial meeting at the UN on Friday, proposed by Russia to discuss implementing a plan 'so strongly rejected by one party'. At the UN in New York, it was announced that the session had been cancelled. Announcing the decision after a brief private meeting of members, Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian delegate, who is the present Council president, insisted that a ministerial session would still be held, but later. Mr Christopher nevertheless said he would meet Mr Kozyrev in Washington on Thursday and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, early next week in pursuit of a common allied strategy. But the US secretary of state said: 'We have not given up on what we think is the soundest approach - lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia with whatever compensatory air action may be necessary.' He conceded: 'Our allies and friends are not prepared to follow this course.' Mr Christopher added, however, that it was 'not surprising' that it was taking time to arrive at agreed positions to try and solve 'an historically difficult and tragic problem' in which atrocities were being committed by all sides. The US administration is determined to put Bosnia, albeit temporarily, on the back burner of policymaking. No questions about Bosnia were put to President Bill Clinton on Monday night in an hour-long San Diego 'town meeting' dominated by concerns about the domestic economy. Meanwhile, Bosnian Moslems and Croats agreed last night to implement parts of the Vance-Owen plan in areas of fighting between them and adhere to a ceasefire, Lord Owen said. Speaking in the town of Medjugorje after talks between the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, and Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Lord Owen called the agreement 'the first important step' towards implementing the plan. Joint committees are to be set up in three provinces - Travnik, Mostar and Zenica - to try and defuse tensions between warring Moslem and Croat factions. Allied divisions widen, Page 3</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal establishes guidelines on how a floor broker must improve on the stop price. Once accepting a stop, a floor broker may only bid one fractional trading increment less than the stop and may only offer one fractional trading increment greater than the stop. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  As a result of this requirement, the practice of granting stops will be limited to markets where the spread is twice the minimum variation allowable (under CBOE Rule 6.42). Accordingly, under the CBOE's proposal, the floor broker's requirement to gain price improvement for the stopped order will result in narrowing the spread between the bid and offer. This narrower spread in the quotes will be available on the quotation screen to all market participants, and should provide benefits to the market that offset any potential harm to the customer limit order book. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum fractional trading increments are governed by CBOE Rule 6.42. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also requires a floor broker to either immediately execute the stopped order at the stop price and size when a transaction at the same price occurs in the crowd, or to release the market-maker from the guarantee. The Commission believes that this requirement will ensure that a floor broker exercises due diligence in filling an order at the stop price while at the same time serving to ensure, once a transaction at the stop price occurs, that the market maker or DPM is not under a limitless obligation to guarantee the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that the CBOE proposal sufficiently limits the practice of stopping orders to situations where the market-maker or DPM granting the stop would not unduly impinge upon the fiduciary obligations to orders on the public customer limit order book. The proposal grants priority to stopped orders over new crowd orders only, and not the public customer limit order book. Additionally, when a floor broker attempts to improve upon a stop price guarantee and the subsequent bid/offer matches the best bid/offer in the customer limit order book, in accordance with CBOE Rule 6.45, the customer limit order will have priority at that price, should an execution occur. The Commission believes these are critical aspects of the CBOE proposal, in that they are designed to enable market-makers to grant stops while ensuring that customer's orders on the limit order book will not be disadvantaged. The time stamping of all stop orders when granted will establish an audit trail and provide a reliable method for establishing priority. Moreover, the Commission believes that the CBOE has adequately addressed customer notification concerns, the effect of a trading halt on the priority and pricing of a stopped order, and reporting requirements applicable to the execution of stopped orders on the tape. Finally, the Exchange has agreed to issue an Information Circular to its members which will specify the circumstances under which a stop may be granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that the proposal is consistent with the prohibition in Section 11(b) against providing discretion to a specialist (or market maker) in the handling of an order. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Section 11(b) was designed, in part, to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the specialist's dual role as agent and principal in executing stock or option transactions. In particular, Congress intended to prevent specialists from unduly influencing market trends through their knowledge of market interest from the specialist's book and their handling of discretionary agency orders. The Commission has stated that, pursuant to Section 11(b), all orders other than market or limit orders are discretionary and therefore cannot be accepted by specialists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful review, the Commission concludes that it is appropriate to treat stopped orders as equivalent to limit orders. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stated amount of option contracts at a specified price, or at a better price if obtainable. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  In this instance, the Commission believes that stopped orders are equivalent to limit orders because once the stop has been granted, the market maker or DPM is obligated to execute the order at the best bid or offer, or better if obtainable. As with limit orders, the market maker or DPM exercises no control or discretion over whether the order is subsequently executed. Therefore, the Commission believes the CBOE proposal establishes sufficiently stringent guidelines to ensure that a market maker or DPM complies with his market duties and Section 11(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rule 6.53(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;30) is approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

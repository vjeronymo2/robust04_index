			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Insurance group settles dispute Aegon Financial Services Group, the UK subsidiary of Dutch insurance group Aegon, yesterday settled one element of a bitter legal dispute with a former manager after a High Court bailiff arrived at the company's head office to begin confiscating goods. The bailiff had been instructed by Mr John Gaulton after a court ruling last Friday. The legal tussle is one of several hundred involving insurance groups and former sales agents that are disputing cash thought to total tens of millions of pounds. The sums mostly cover claims for lost earnings, or debts the companies say the former agents owe. Aegon Financial Services yesterday sent Pounds 23,638 to Bevans, the solicitors acting for Mr Gaulton. The cash was paid a few hours after the bailiff had entered the company's London headquarters, and before he started seizing goods. On Wednesday Bevans applied for a winding-up order against the company in an effort to force it to settle. Aegon said yesterday the matter had been resolved. It did not wish to comment further. Yesterday's actions came after a judgment by the Bristol commercial court last week that Aegon should pay more than Pounds 20,000 to a trust set up by Mr Gaulton to finance his children's education. Mr Gaulton was dismissed from Aegon in February. After this he tried to cash in an insurance policy taken out with Aegon and held in the trust's name. Aegon refused to pay, arguing that the cash ought to be used to pay back some of the Pounds 36,000 it claims Mr Gaulton owes as a result of a loan. The arguments over the Pounds 36,000 continue in separate High Court proceedings.</p>

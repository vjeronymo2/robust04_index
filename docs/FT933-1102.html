			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK small business needs industrial banking sector Sir, At last the Bank of England is taking some action to support small business in the UK ('Bank governor calls in clearers', September 21). The British financial system will impede the recovery from recession, as it has impeded the development of the British economy for decades. When five to seven years is regarded as long-term by the venture capitalists, who must have their exit route in place on day one of their investment, and who demand rates of return two or three times higher than those in Germany or Japan, how can any company organise itself for long-term structured growth and development in market share? The simple answer is, it can't. Instead it has to concentrate on avoiding risk, short-term cost minimisation (equals lack of investment) and production of 'satisfactory' results. We should be asking ourselves who these results are satisfying. The banks and investment institutions are not just providers of funds; they actively influence the investment decisions and priorities of business people by their short-term performance criteria, their demands for personal assets as collateral, their preference for the fast-buck sectors rather than the lower-performing manufacturing sectors, in terms of return and their investment decisions and allocations being determined by quarterly reports. In short, we need an industrial banking sector - a bank for business, creating solutions and opportunities, not liquidations and bankruptcies. Unless our financial institutions can become partners in the quest for jobs, expansion and economic prosperity, any 'recovery' will be superficial and transitory, with the real decline of UK plc in the world marketplace continuing remorselessly.

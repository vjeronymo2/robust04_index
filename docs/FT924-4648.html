			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox tries to dig itself out of a hole - London's troubled soft commodities exchange FOX HAS proved to be a singularly inappropriate acronym for the Futures and Options Exchange, which trades London's soft commodity contracts. Far from showing the traditional cunning of its namesake, London Fox appears to have loped off in totally the wrong direction. In the year to the end of last March the exchange reported a loss of Pounds 691,000 on revenues of Pounds 10m, largely because of the property futures debacle in September 1991, which led to exceptional costs of just under Pounds 1m. A round of job cuts followed in May. The boom years of the 1980s, when volumes soared on the London Metal Exchange and Liffe, passed London Fox by. It made pioneering, but ill-fated attempts to boost volume through contracts - including property futures - on a screen-based trading system. Now the only survivor on the screen trading system is ironically the first contract launched on it - white sugar, which trades up to 1,500 lots a day. Contracts for rice, rubber, arabica coffee and a base metals index all failed. The raw sugar contract, which on one day last week traded a mere 15 lots, was switched from floor to screen and back to the floor again in just 12 months. Such a scatter-gun approach to the markets was 'an absolute disaster', admitted Mr Michael Jenkins, the chief executive of Liffe who became chairman of Fox earlier this year. But he dismissed as 'pretty small' the effect of the property futures fiasco, which led to the Securities and Futures Association fining five brokers up to Pounds 80,000 each for creating a false impression of investor interest in the market. 'It undoubtedly damaged morale at the exchange and it left a nasty taste in the mouth. . . but I don't think people stayed away because they could not trust the market,' he said. However, it did fundamentally change the direction of the exchange away from innovation towards a re-examination of its central business, according to Mr Robin Woodhead, the chief executive who started work at the beginning of October. He replaced Mr Phillip Thorpe, deputy chief executive of the SFA, who took over on a temporary basis when Mr Mark Blundell and Mr Saxon Tate resigned over the property futures affair. There is little doubt that the appointments of Mr Jenkins and Mr Woodhead, who played a central role in setting up London's International Petroleum Exchange, are seen as the best chance for a long time to put Fox back on the right course. 'It's good news,' said one trader. 'They are two very experienced people. If they can't get it going we might as well all pack up and go home.' Mr Woodhead plans to revive Fox's fortunes by focussing on the core contracts. He believes its activities fall into two areas - the traditional cocoa, coffee and sugar of the old London Commodities Exchange, and the small volume contracts of the former Baltic Futures Exchange, which merged with Fox last year. 'People have lost sight of the fact that some of the existing contracts are doing extremely well,' he said, pointing out that the London cocoa contract set the international benchmark prices for the industry. 'The Baltic contracts came over to Fox just before the changes that took place in senior management so very little attempt has been made to evaluate and analyse what potential they have,' he said. The contracts include freight futures, grains and potatoes. Both Mr Woodhead and Mr Jenkins pointed out that several reviews of the exchange by consultants basically gave it a clean bill of health. But they agreed that Fox had some big problems - most obviously in the raw sugar and agricultural contracts. 'In the medium term I think we feel there is room for agricultural futures to be traded in Europe and that Fox is the only exchange that has ambitions in this direction,' said Mr Jenkins. 'The Gatt discussions and the impact they have on the CAP (the European Community's common agricultural policy) won't of themselves produce a lot more free trade immediately,' said Mr Woodhead. 'But they do indicate that the trend is against intervention and that must be to the benefit of the futures markets.' Raw sugar could prove a bigger problem. London used to set the international benchmark price, but that role has been taken over by the relatively young New York market, which attracts a lot of speculative money. Critics have blamed London's decline in the raws trade on the failed experiment in screen trading, but Mr Jenkins believes the decline took place over a decade, mainly because of underlying changes in the physical market. 'I think Fox frankly took its eye off the ball,' he said. The London raw contract was designed with British Commonwealth producers in mind, said Mr Woodhead. But there had been a fundamental change in the way raws were traded, with much more sugar coming out of the Far East and South America. At the same time the number of big sugar traders in London had declined significantly. Nonetheless, both men felt sugar trading would continue at Fox. 'We are urgently looking at what we should do but we haven't come to a conclusion,' said Mr Jenkins. Other problems with which they will have to get to grips include a sharp decline in robusta coffee futures trading (although options volume is well up); the fall from 22 in 1990 to just five locals (traders who buy and sell for their own account); and the fact that the exchange lost its marketing department during the summer job cuts. Fox still has more than 60 members and has recently had inquiries from potential newcomers. Mr Woodhead is keen to re-establish contact with members and to discuss ways of increasing their business activity on the exchange. But he is also well aware of the changing nature of the commodities business. He pointed out that when a big member like Drexel Burnham Lambert or Woodhouse Drake &amp; Carey disappeared, the capital that was supporting them was also lost to the market. However, the development of over-the-counter business was bringing new capital into the market and big financial groups that had given commodities a wide berth in the past were now looking at ways of providing a complete derivative brokerage service, he said. Mr Woodhead also believes it is all too easy to write off futures exchanges. 'At various times in the last 10 years all of the London futures exchanges have been described as being about to close. Notwithstanding the problems over the property contracts, one must remember that the traditional London Fox commodities are trading at extensive cyclical lows,' he said. 'One has to see the potential for the exchange in the light of that trend. So don't write us off yet.'</p>

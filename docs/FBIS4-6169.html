			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with DPRK President Kim </F> Il-song by special correspondent Pedro Margolles Villanueva at  the Government Palace in Pyongyang on 18 April]    [Text] Pyongyang, 18 Apr (PL) -- We have no intentions, nor  are we capable of producing nuclear weapons. It would make no  sense. The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through  pressure and coercion it can bring us to our knees.    The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an  exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace.    In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim talked about the tense  situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations with  China and other countries, foreign investments, and the  perspectives for the reunification of the country. Kim also  spoke fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President  Fidel Castro.    In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern  buildings and the wide avenues welcome a sunny spring.    Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the  celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as  the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in  Pyongyang.    In the countryside, one does not sense a warlike atmosphere.  The peasants work the land, grow rice, and the industries  continue operating.    An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in  the  august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim  Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly.    "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing  nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we  did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria  ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to  ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said.    Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction  of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The  United States deployed a large number of these weapons to  maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to  confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy  in the Asia-Pacific region.    Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula began with the United States' hostile policy toward  his country, and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral  negotiations.    The president said there is no justification for Washington  to maintain its nuclear weapons on the peninsula because the  Cold War has ended worldwide, and because nonaggression  agreements and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of  the Peninsula have been signed by North and South Korea.    The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in  the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after  the monumental battles of 1945.    Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion  of  Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce  battles were waged and the country was left virtually destroyed.    The 38th parallel and Panmunjom were established in the name  of humanity, and the North Americans portrayed themselves as  defenders of noble ideals by way of their persistent  anticommunist propaganda.    Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the  leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including  Pyongyang which had been razed. Industry was constructed and  agriculture was reestablished.    Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has  eradicated poverty.    That same man explains that "in order not to lose the  control  they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the  North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading  groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the  situation."    According to him, the South Korean authorities have joined  this campaign and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war.    The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he  said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing  international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it  worsened the situation to the extreme, he added.    Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure can never be the  method to resolve problems.    "The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through  pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees,  because they value independence as they value their own lives,"  he said.    He added that if Washington becomes obstinate and persists  in  pressuring the DPKR, the nation will be forced to adopt  self-defense measures to safeguard its dignity and sovereignty.    In the interview with PRENSA LATINA, the paramount Korean  leader reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic  Korea is to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue.  Whether it can be resolved through peaceful means depends  entirely on the United States, which must cease its clumsy  international pressure against our Republic and adopt a  trustworthy position, he added.    International organizations should not support the unjust  demands of this world power, and they should endorse solutions  the problem, Kim Il-song stressed.</p>

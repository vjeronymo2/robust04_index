			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramon Melenciano] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez, who claims that electoral fraud was perpetrated in  Monday's elections, today asked his party activists to remain  calm. His party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD, social  democrat), demands President Joaquin Balaguer "relinquish power."    "We will not push the people to their death....we will fight  with all peaceful means" the alleged victory of his party, Pena  Gomez said. He also said that if the Central Electoral Board  (JCE) continues to tally the votes and proclaims Balaguer the  winner, the victory will not be valid.    The PRD leader today challenged the impartiality of two of  the judges who comprise the electoral tribunal as part of his  efforts to have the JCE recount the votes and recognize that his  party won the elections. Pena Gomez requested Leonardo Matos  Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar be disqualified for their  alleged acts of corruption, in which he also implicates the JCE  and the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which supports  President Balaguer.    The two electoral judges, proposed by the ruling PRSC, must  relinquish their posts to their substitutes until the other  members decide whether the request for disqualification is valid.    "The country has been robbed," Pena Gomez stated, justifying  his charges that there were more ballots than voters in some  towns. He explained that the JCE must again tally the null and  "disputed" votes (subject to an embargo due to suspicions) to  settle the situation. According to him, these votes include  valid ones that would benefit the PRD.    He said the tally of null and disputed votes must be  directly  supervised by OAS, International Electoral System Foundation  (IFES), and Electoral Advice and Promotion Center (CAPEL)  observers. Pena Gomez believes these same observers should  participate in a revision of the tally sheets, which correspond  to electoral tables whose annulment the PRD has requested  because of a modification of the voters' lists. He reported  that computer diskettes delivered to the JCE with the tally  sheet information do not coincide with the information announced  by the electoral organization.    According to Pena Gomez, the situation occurs because the  JCE's computer center is altering the tally sheet information to  the detriment of his party. He claimed that JCE personnel added  38,000 votes that did not belong to the PRSC, and he also  reported that the military seized four Municipal Electoral  Boards and no one knows what happened to their tally sheets.  Pena Gomez said the military still controls the boards in El  Seibo, Moca, Samana, and Elias Pina.    Police and military surveillance around PRD facilities  located in downtown Santo Domingo increased considerably while  Pena Gomez gave his statements. Although the presidential  candidate asked hundreds of followers to remain calm, they  demanded to go out and "fight for their victory."    Nevertheless, Pena Gomez said that he wants no deaths and  that he does not want "to disrupt the country's peace" with an  uprising by his activists. PRD activists gathered in front of  PRD facilities and shouted several slogans: "Get out, get out,  Balaguer"; "We will repeat the April war"; and "If they do not  relinquish (power) to us, there will be trouble."</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Poland rich in entrepreneurs THEY are usually aged between 36 and 45 years. Most have a background in science or engineering. And - perhaps inevitably - nine out of 10 are men. Three years after Poland embarked on its 'big bang' policy of economic liberalisation, the new entrepreneurs are not only thriving, but providing the backbone of the country's attempts to emerge from recession. Even more significantly - according to a recent study by the International Finance Corporation - the focus of their market skills is shifting. Instead of simply trading, as they did in the early days, in imported 'luxuries' such as alcohol or frilly undergarments, Polish entrepreneurs are moving into manufacturing, producing goods ranging from car parts and plastics to homoeopathic remedies. The IFC says the shift has left Poland's private sector arguably the best developed in East Europe, providing more than 50 per cent of Poland's GDP and employment. For those who wonder whether this can be repeated elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the IFC's case studies are illuminating. The key to the Polish would-be capitalists is, the study claims, their economic 'agility'. Poland is apparently peppered with academics who have turned their hand to producing hot dog kiosks, farmers who have switched their skills from hop growing into spice marketing, and engineers who have moved from metal work to meat processing to publishing and back again. With credit hard to raise, and interest rates high, most starting capital has come from family funds, often gained from speculative trading during the late 1980s. Nevertheless, a familiar litany of problems remain: loans are difficult to obtain, trading bureaucracy is Byzantine, market information is scarce, and almost all entrepreneurs report being plagued by that old problem - the crackly telephone.

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs hit MR-Data profits MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing group, reported lower interim pre-tax profits reflecting one-off reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in its Memex software division. In the six months to December 31 profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 2.66m (Pounds 4.02m) on turnover up 5 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 18.6m). Earnings per share declined to 3.21p (4.89p). However, the interim dividend is being raised by 20 per cent to 2.076p (1.73p) reflecting the group's strong balance sheet and cash position. Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'During the past months we have reorganised our business resulting in significant one-off costs which have been absorbed in the first half. Additionally profits have been affected by the on-going development costs at Memex.' Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m). The 1992 figure was boosted, following accounting rule changes, by the writing back of Pounds 651,000 of acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by reorganisation costs of Pounds 382,000.</p>

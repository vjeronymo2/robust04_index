			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Poor start to pollution permit sale The US Environmental Protection Agency revealed yesterday it had received 150 bids in its first auction of air pollution allowances, the agency's market-based scheme to reduce acid rain. However, most of the allowances offered by private companies failed to fetch their minimum prices and were not sold. The pollution emission permits are granted to 110 of the largest sulphur dioxide polluters, many of them coal-burning electric utilities. Companies are allowed to trade allowances in excess of their own needs to meet pollution standards. Bids came from power companies, coal producers, environmentalists and smokestack industries for the rights to emit 275,510 tonnes of sulphur dioxide (SO) into the air after 1995. The average price per tonne of SO emissions was Dollars 439 (Pounds 309) for permits up to 1999, the first phase of the two-phase programme, with the lowest successful bid Dollars 122 and the highest Dollars 450. Brokers bidding for industry took about 5 per cent of the total. A few public interest groups, including environmentalists, made token purchases of five or six of the allowances. The sealed-bid auction, finalised on Monday, was conducted by the Chicago Board of Trade. The prices reached at auction are substantially below the cost of technologies for reducing emissions under the Clean Air Act. This could force a rethink in marketing strategies by companies selling smokestack scrubbers, which reduce sulphur emissions, and those marketing high-priced low-sulphur coal. Scrubbing costs vary widely, although analysts say technology for meeting emission requirements after the year 2000 ranges in price from Dollars 700 to Dollars 1,200 per tonne. The next official auction is due in March, although private trades are allowed to continue until then. Some analysts suggested the Chicago auction was an inappropriate format for the sale and that demand was also dampened by the sale's timing. 'The nature of compliance planning is you need a long lead time,' said Mr Andrew Weissman, of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based investment banking firm. 'The auction came too late for phase one compliance plans, and was a little too early for companies planning for the second phase of emissions standards.' He fears artificially low auction prices will be misinterpreted. 'This is not a liquid market, and lends itself most readily to customised transactions,' he said. A number of regulatory, market or financing factors helped to depress the prices at auction, he added. 'Scrubbing costs and fuel switching (into less polluting energies) costs have come down substantially.' Illinois Power, a mid-west electricity utility that burns large amounts of high-sulphur coal, recently elected to buy SO allowances from other utilities and delay installing scrubbing technology. It plans to buy between 75,000 and 125,000 allowances per year through 1999 in a strategy expected to preserve hundreds of jobs. The utility is hoping the delay will allow it to buy more advanced technology when scrubbers are finally installed in its smokestacks in 1999.</p>

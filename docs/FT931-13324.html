			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Lambeth council report alleges corruption of Pounds 10m CORRUPTION and malpractice on an 'unprecedented' scale have cost the south London borough of Lambeth upwards of Pounds 10m, according to a confidential report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the council's chief executive. The report is a catalogue of work done without proper authority, unauthorised redundancy payments, overcharging by the council's direct-labour organisation and overcharging by former council employees brought in as sub-contractors by the organisation. Some cases uncovered involve double charging. The most serious cases involve the borough's housing department. The findings of Mr Ouseley's report may be investigated by the Serious Fraud Squad, whatever action the council itself takes. The report, debated by councillors at an emergency meeting last night, suggests that police be called in and recommends that an independent enquiry be established. It also raises the issue of disbanding the direct-labour organisation and putting its services out to tender. The allegations involve officials, council workers and contractors and go back more than 10 years. Throughout most of the period in question Lambeth was under the control of a leftwing Labour administration. Lambeth's finances have long been in a critical state. It has the highest poll tax in England - Pounds 425 after capping - and more than Pounds 157m outstanding in uncollected rents, poll tax, and rates. Mr Steven Whaley, the council's Labour leader, called for a 'no-holds-barred' inquiry by a leading barrister, but conceded that the council had not been as 'vigorous and vigilant' as it should have been. Mr Keith Fitchett, Liberal Democrat leader, said the report reflected 'a complete breakdown of managerial control in Lambeth, arising from the . . . debilitating relationship between the Labour party and local government unions.' Mr Peter Evans, deputy leader of the council's Conservative group, called the report a 'whitewash' and said it was 'the tip of the ice-berg'. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said he wanted 'strong and effective action to deal with the quite appalling abuses revealed by this report'. 'We expect to see decisions taken quickly to ensure that these abuses are never allowed to happen again.'</p>

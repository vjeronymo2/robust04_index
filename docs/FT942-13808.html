			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy action in banks A Pounds 1.8bn agreed merger of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and Lloyds Bank was the catalyst for a chain of big moves throughout the financial sectors as analysts and institutions began to manoeuvre their recommendations and stances in the light of the deal. Lloyds Bank shares rocketed as the market reacted positively to the news, reaching a session high of 588p, before easing back to close a net 48 firmer at 585p. Turnover of 24m shares was the highest single-day's business for five and a half years. Lloyds shares reached an all-time high of 684p on December 29, but have since fallen sharply with the other banks as the City has become disenchanted with the sector. The market has been waiting for Lloyds to make a bold strategic move ever since its last expansion attempt in April 1992, when it unsuccessfully sought a merger with Midland Bank. The deal also impacted on Standard Chartered, where Lloyds retains a near 5 per cent shareholding following an unsuccessful takeover attempt in the 1980s. Standard shares, also reflecting further overall weakness in the Hong Kong market dropped 20 to 1015p on assumptions that the chances of Lloyds bidding again for Standard may have diminished and that the stake could be sold. Some observers said, however, that Lloyds may yet move to acquire Standard which has an enviable presence throughout the far east. Other bank shares fell sharply on fears that Lloyds/C &amp; G will introduce much fiercer competition in the UK mortgage market. Abbey National was the hardest hit, the shares sliding 17 1/2 to 446 1/2 p, while Barclays dipped 7 to 509p and NatWest 4 1/2 to 445 1/2 p. Shares in Lloyds' life assurance subsidiary, Lloyds Abbey Life, sprinted 21 to 405p, reflecting the increase customer base for its products. One banks specialist said Lloyds' merger with C &amp; G, 'solves at a stroke the former major worries about Lloyds, ie the acquisition and succession problems'. He warned that Abbey National 'now faces a fierce assault from what now looks certain to be a price war in the mortgage market.'</p>

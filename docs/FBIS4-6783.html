			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of  Korea (GFTUK) in a statement today denounced the South Korean  authorities's negative stand toward the DPRK's proposal for the  convocation of a national conference and urged them to look  straight at the nation's aspirations and respond to the proposal.    Noting that the South Korean authorities showed a negative  response to the proposal, saying "a conference oriented toward  political propaganda is undesirable", the spokesman says this  fully reveals their true color as flunkeyist traitors trying to  plunge the nation into the scourge of war in league with outside  forces, instead of sitting at a negotiating table with fellow  countrymen to solve the question of national reunification  independently.    He said, "Our working class and the whole nation can never  tolerate the criminal moves of the Kim Yong-sam group which is  taking the extremely dangerous road to a nuclear war in league  with outside forces, disregarding the proposal for the  convocation of a national conference which was prompted by our  warm love of the nation and the stand of national independence  to bridge over the present difficulties and open a broad avenue  for reunification through the great unity of the nation."    "The South Korean authorities must immediately remove the  checkbar which they dropped on the road ahead of the political  parties, organizations and personages of broad strata in South  Korea intending to participate in a national conference," the  spokesman said.    He called upon all the workers and other sections of people  of South Korea to actively turn out in a patriotic struggle for  the convocation of a national conference which would open up a  short cut to reunification in the '90s.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Drawing the Line of </F> Control"]    [Text] Once again Kashmir has become a centre of utmost  concern both at home and abroad. The latest focal point of the  Kashmir crisis is the border township of Kupwara where an army  operation against militants led to the killing of about 30  persons. This in turn led to the bandh called by the  civilian population which described the operation as a  "massacre" by the Indian Army. Government offices, business  establishments, banks, post offices and shops were closed  throughout the valley--one more proof of the alienation of the  people from the Indian government.    This has come as a severe blow for the Centre. Its isolation  in the trouble torn valley has been exposed just when the  Pakistan government is likely to raise the issue of human rights  violations by India's security forces in Kashmir at the session  of the United Nations human rights commission which began  yesterday.    Now more than at any other time, the record on human rights  is certainly negative for India. In the early Sixties, there was  a direct diplomatic offensive by the United Kingdom-United  States combine leading to the Duncan Sandys mission that bluntly  advocated the vivisection of Kashmir. But the crisis that time  was not triggered off by any armed secessionist movement within  Kashmir. It arose from India's disastrous confrontation with  China over the border dispute leading to armed aggression by the  Chinese army. Pakistan, in concert with its international  patrons at the time, sought to exploit India's isolation on the  international plane.    In contrast, this time the near total isolation of India  within the Kashmir valley itself is being exploited by Pakistan.  Unlike the situation in 1962-63, this time the key to any  solution of the Kashmir crisis lies with India to a large extent.    It is well worth noting the drift that has overtaken the  Indian government's Kashmir policy in the last one year. One can  question with good reason if the present government has a  Kashmir policy at all. Three months ago, New Delhi's stand was  that there had to be an Indo-Pakistani dialogue for a real  solution of the Kashmir crisis. It was argued that unless the  training and arming of the militant secessionists was stopped  there could be no solution. Normalcy in the Kashmir depended on  an Indo-Pakistani understanding.    Against this background, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao's message  of  greetings to Ms. Benazir Bhutto on the occasion of her becoming  prime minister in October 1993 and the latter's friendly  response were thought to be positive signs the Kashmir problem  could begin to be tackled.    Then came the protracted siege of the Hazratbal shrine by  the  Indian Army. It showed up an amazing lack of coordination and  common understanding among the various arms of the government  right at the ground level. This could hardly be papered over by  official denials. In fact, the full story of the Hazratbal  episode has not yet come to light, particularly the manner of  its settlement.    Nevertheless the resolution of the Hazratbal issue opened up  new possibilities for some initiatives both at home and abroad.  In Kashmir itself, the emergence of the Hurriyat outfit aiming  to bring about a rapprochement between the government and the  militant groups offered a golden opportunity. For the government  could find a new approach to solve the problem within Kashmir  itself.    But the opportunity was not used. Instead, the army was  given  the go-ahead to launch a military strike against the militants.  The Sopore operation destroyed the chances for any dialogue with  the militants. The government itself did not seem unified in its  assessment of the way to handle the Kashmir crisis.    On one side is the hardline lobby that frankly takes the  stand of no-truck whatsoever with the militants. This school  thinks that the militants can be wiped out and thereafter the  people in the valley brought over to the side of the  authorities. There is another school within the government, or  rather the political establishment, which realises there can be  no solution to the Kashmir crisis through mere armed action. It  stresses the need for political initiatives.    Undoubtedly nowhere in history has an insurgency been  quelled  by sheer force. The military can only contain militancy, not  eliminate it. However, New Delhi seems to be caught in a dilemma  of its own making. It is trying to handle the most explosive of  all its problems without having worked out a clear policy. It  has been trying to respond to events rather than initiate any  policy decision.    A careful analysis of New Delhi's reactions to events in  Kashmir in the last one year makes it clear that the government  has largely depended on the US administration to pull up  Pakistan and force it to curb its aggressive designs on India.  This dependence is based on the premise that since the Cold War  is over, New Delhi cannot be accused of relying on Moscow. Since  the government has also been making a thorough effort to  dismantle the Nehruvian legacy of economic self reliance and  openly inviting US corporate giants to invest in this country  and capture even the home market, it expected an era of bonhomie  between the two countries.    The finance minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, has assiduously  pursued a policy of total subservience to the World Bank  prescription of free market economics. He naturally expected  this to fetch political dividends. This anticipation has  dominated the government's entire thinking on international  affairs. But the assumption Washington would recognise India's  worth as its largest loyal camp follower in south Asia was naive.    An illusion was also fostered that the US administration  would listen more to New Delhi than to Islamabad on any issue of  contention between India and Pakistan. That was why greater  labour was spent by Indian diplomats and the government to  canvass for India's case on Kashmir in Washington than make any  serious attempt to open a worthwhile dialogue with its neighbour.    Even when US state department underlings like Mr. John  Mallot  and Ms. Raphel made offensive remarks about India's position in  Kashmir, the Indian government held on to the illusion it would  be able to persuade Washington to brand Pakistan as a "terrorist  state". Instead came the two missives from the US president, Mr.  Bill Clinton, to two non-descripts. This clearly showed his bias  for the militants not only in Kashmir but in Punjab as well.    What seems to be totally missed by policy making pundits in  New Delhi is that the US administration has never claimed to be  a Santa Claus distributing goodies to third world destitutes. It  has always maintained its realpolitik for mastery  over international affairs and economics, more so after the  collapse of its rival superpower, the former Soviet Union. It  has never made the mistake of announcing the abandonment of its  aspirations to world hegemony. In that design, the emergence of  a stable, powerful India can only be a nightmare rather than a  benign force.    An unstable India in constant friction with its neighbours  provides the ideal setting for Washington's policy on south  Asia. At the tactical level, Indian diplomats should have  realised the present prime minister of Pakistan has long  maintained the closest relations with the Democrats in the US.  This relationship enabled her to work out a businesslike  relationship with the powerful military junta in Pakistan which  has never snapped its close links with the Pentagon.    Given this alignment of forces, any government in New Delhi  has to try its hardest to open a dialogue with the militants in  Kashmir. They should be offered autonomy short of secession from  the Indian Union. To discuss and negotiate there has to be a  ceasefire. Dialogues with all groups of Kashmiris have to  include representatives of the refugee intelligentsia as well.    And once the Indian government plucks up the courage to make  such an offer to Kashmiris who are citizens of India whether  they are militants or not, it can be in a position to call upon  its Pakistani counterpart to make a similar offer to Kashmiris  on the Pakistani side of the line of control. This would  represent a healthy competition between the two countries to win  over the hearts of the inhabitants of paradise on earth.    *</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Papering over the cracks 'Why this white paper?' asks European Commission president Jacques Delors and his co-authors on its very first page. 'Why indeed?' might well be the murmured reply of certain European finance ministers. But Mr Delors' paper - long, wordy and lacking in detailed prescription though it may be - is a worthwhile contribution, at least to the unemployment debate. It does not quite succeed in providing the European 'vision thing' that Mr Delors was looking for. But that is the politicians' job, not the Commission's. The white paper's opening question is, in fact, satisfactorily answered on the first page. It is primarily a document about labour markets and, in particular, the failure of a myriad national solutions either to cut long-term unemployment or (not the same thing) revive employment growth. Not that the Commission claims to offer a worked-out solution. But, in its definition of the problem, its dismissal of easy solutions and its aspirational model for the future, the white paper makes a lot of sense. First the diagnosis. Employment growth in Europe, the Commission confirms, has been slower than in other regions of the world because of government-erected barriers to hiring labour. Meanwhile unemployment has stayed high through the economic cycle because investment has been insufficient, while regulations have prevented the cost of unskilled labour falling in the face of technological change and external competition. Politically untenable The paper is encouragingly quick to dismiss miracle cures. Protectionism, a dash for inflationary growth, a generalised cut in working hours, a drastic cut in wages and social protection to east Asian levels - all these non-solutions are thankfully dismissed. Nor is US-style deregulation alone enough. Sluggish productivity growth, accompanied by falling real wages and rising unskilled male joblessness, seems both politically untenable and economically short-sighted. The better approach, the white paper argues, is to remove obstacles to job creation, thereby raising the employment intensity of growth, while boosting the sustainable growth rate by raising investment in physical and human capital. Yet the white paper, while providing an impressive framework for analysis of Europe's labour market problems, ducks the difficult issues. The Commission is right to argue that high non-wage labour costs, especially at the lower end of the wage distribution, are important obstacles to employment creation. But there is little mention of the employment effects of Spanish-style levels of incumbent worker protection. Is there a workable balance between deregulation and employee protection? A dilemma ducked. Dilemma dodged The paper also rightly points out that wages must grow more slowly than productivity if profits and investment are to rise. Britain's failure to control its wage inflation in the 1980s demonstrates that decentralisation is not a guaranteed solution. But centralised tripartite bargaining has clearly undermined employment flexibility in many countries. How can this tension between micro-flexibility and macro-co-ordination be resolved? Another dilemma dodged. On the need for funds for private investment, the paper seems to bite the bullet. Only the public sector can be relied on to free up savings for investment, it says, so fiscal deficits must be cut now in order to generate surpluses when growth accelerates. But it also says that governments must pursue expensive expansions of education and training, and maybe provide more non-wage income support for the unskilled. But do offsetting cuts in public spending imply a rethinking of welfare priorities? Again, the paper is silent. The commission, however, can hardly be criticised for failing to find solutions which have eluded European policymakers for over a decade. In so far as progress can be made in dealing with unemployment, it will involve further, specific actions at the national level - Europe may have a single market in goods, but it does not have a single labour market. The role of Brussels is to identify best practice and to encourage individual governments to make the right choices. This white paper is a start.</p>

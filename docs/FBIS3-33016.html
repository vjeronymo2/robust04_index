			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F> and Guests Osvaldo Rodriguez of the weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE and  Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Roque] Today we would like to discuss the  invitation for a conference between Cubans and the exile  community. Where do we begin?    [Sexto] Well, Rodriguez just pointed out to me, so I will  begin, that an invitation has been extended for a dialogue. I  take this invitation as an effort by our country to build a  bridge for the Cuban community abroad. This is not the first  time that our country has tried to build a bridge. We recall  that Cuba also tried to establish a bridge for Cuban exiles in  1978. Cuba tried to maturely understand their situation. It  tried to give to that community its value and role within our  history, within our set of problems, and within our then current  situation.    [Roque] And that strengthens the idea of a family reunion.    [Sexto] Indeed. Cuba has also tried to reunite the Cuban  family. It has sought a reunion, which is one of the essential  causes for maintenance of the migration level in our country.  That is, since the first years of the Revolution, there has been  a migratory chain of relatives. This has been one of the causes  of a continuous emigration over the past years. The Revolution  has tried to resolve this problem of distance and separation of  family members. Everyone must remember that this was attempted  in 1978, and if not premature, I believe there were neither  objective or subjective conditions to make this dream come true.    [Roque] What we are certain about is that the Cuban  Government has always favored reunion of the Cuban family. It  has always been said that there were not the conditions here for  receiving many of those people who wished to be reunited with  their relatives. But the willingness, the idea that this  existed, has always been on the negotiating table. At least I  think willingness existed in 1978.    [Rodriguez] I also think that in a way, the Cuban family has  always been a hostage of the Cuban-U.S. conflict and policy.    [Roque] Well, that is another subject we are going to  discuss  later.    [Rodriguez] Well, yes, it is another problem, but this idea  of being hostage to a policy, namely the U.S. hostile policy  toward Cuba, represents a wall, a curtain, a barrier against  family reunion, because the United States has used the migration  issue as a spearhead against the Revolution. Undoubtedly, when a  relative of yours is on the opposite side of the idea you  defend, or the cause you defend, a disruption takes place within  the family. But today I think we are reuniting many families  divided for political reasons, families that have adopted  different political stances after being separated. But this is  not happening for the first time now, during this revolutionary  period. It also happened during the Spanish period. There were  families, well, Creoles of Spanish descent, who broke from one  another because they defended different positions.    Later, during the era of the Republic -- or during the  pseudo- republic as we call that period of successive  governments of representative democracy -- many families were  also broken up for political reasons. I think the time has come  to end this political disruption in family relations because  with greater respect within families, with greater respect for  the ideas each might hold, without humiliation or offense, the  families with varying points of view can be reunited.    [Sexto] I believe, Osvaldo, that except for the people who  could have left the country for true political reasons, the rest  of our exiled people have misinterpreted that policy or have had  a mistaken idea about it. That is, Cuban exile is eminently  economic. The Cuban exile who goes to the United States, the  principal immigration center of America and the world, obviously  seeks to improve his well-being. But to migrate to that country,  he is forced to adopt a different stance, because as you have  just said, the emigrants have been hostages of the U.S. policy  against the Cuban Revolution. The United States has politicized  immigration because right now the best means of going to the  United States is by assuming a political stance against the  Cuban Revolution. For instance, today it is very difficult to  obtain a legal visa to enter the United States from Cuba. It is  very difficult for you to be granted a visa to legally settle  down in the United States. However, if you get there on a  bicycle, on a raft, or a barge, you are immediately and  automatically admitted into the United States because you are  considered a political refugee.    [Rodriguez] I would like to give you a little example of  this. Not long ago I heard a casette tape, sent by a boy who had  to migrate from one country to another until he reached the  United States. But in the United States he had to make remarks  against Cuba to be admitted. He sent this casette to his  relatives, expressing regret that he made those remarks. He  said: If my friends who know my way of thinking had heard my  remarks, they would definitely think that I am a dishonest man.    [Roque] Friends, we are discussing the invitation for a  dialogue with the exile community from 22 to 24 April in Havana.  I think we can discuss the ideas currently prevalent among  Cubans and the exile community on this conference.    [Rodriguez] I believe there are some who think this step is  being taken because of a crisis situation in the country. I have  heard some clear statements in this regard: that this decision  was made because the country is in crisis. I do not believe the  crisis has anything to do with the reunion, with the  normalization of relations. In fact, the possibility of  normalization had been much discussed before the crisis.    Moreover, as Sexto just said, talks with the community in  the  United States, and with the entire community abroad, began in  1978. These talks were aborted because of the enemy's  activities. My opinion is that we should not expect this  community to help us economically, although it could happen. But  the objective is not for it to help us economically. I think the  normalization of relations with Cuban exiles is a human right, a  right of the family. If I am a Cuban who decided for any reason  to migrate to another country, I must be respected as a Cuban,  just as I must respect my country's government and the decision  of the majority of the people. It is that respect that is being  sought. But I think the invitation read by the foreign minister  is very clear. There will be no talks about this or another  political system. The discussion will deal with the civilian and  legal situation of the exiles. This must be made very clear  because the invitation itself is clear in this respect. I think  it will be broadly discussed soon.    [Sexto] I do not think Cuba will be talking with the  political exile community. Cuba will speak to the economic exile  community. The economic exile community is a world phenomenon.  This is what we are talking about. We must clearly note the  difference between a political and an economic exile. Of course  the political exiles will not be present at that conference  because the political community is an organization which leaves  the country with the intention of returning to impose the  reestablishment of its party and its class, to restore the  government or the power it had lost. That is what characterizes  the political exiles. This can be clearly seen within the Miami  community. There is a political community, which fights day  after day -- fights, talks, kicks, and moans. It cries in the  hope of returning to reimpose its idea, to reassume the  government. They do not care about the interests of Cuba or of  the Cuban people. They only care for their political interests.    Those who will come in April are economic exiles who left  the  country to improve their well-being, to find ways to fulfill  their aspirations and talents, but who wish to maintain a link  with their people. The Cuban by tradition is patriotic. It is  appropriate that this community maintains its language, its  traditions, its culture. They must be respected for this, and  given consideration. A link must be built between them and us.  No political matters will be discussed. These people will not  demand power. They will not come to ask the working class for  power. They are not coming to ask the Communist Party for power.  They are not coming to ask Cuba to sacrifice its national  interests. They are coming to ask for what we can give them:  understanding, ties with their relatives, ties with their  country, and ties with their culture.    [Roque] We are getting to the end of the program, and we  must  reach a conclusion on this invitation to the conference. But are  the Cubans, the Cubans who are here, aware of the times that are  coming, of this exchange of ideas, of this rapprochement with  the community that lives not only in the United States but  throughout the world?    [Rodriguez] I think our people have been politicized. They  have a fine understanding of what could happen. They are aware  of the possible outcome. When you speak with a worker who has a  lower cultural level -- the lowest level for us is the ninth  grade -- speaking with workers, we realize that they are aware  of what is happening. They are also aware of the fact that the  policy on migration has changed because we know one another  better. The idea we have on migration has also changed.    [Roque] Do you not think that changing the idea of those who  are on the other side might also change the U.S. policy imposed  all along concerning the Cuban economic and political situation?    [Sexto] It is possible. It is possible, but this is not the  time to prophesy anything. It could be a pressure element  forcing the United States to reconsider its policy. I think we  Cubans who are on this side must be aware that many Cubans who  are on the other side are also changing their ideas on the  situation. They are becoming aware of the false idea they had  that forced their migration. We must also admit and recognize  that we cannot continue ignoring the U.S. policy toward Cuba,  which has taken the migration issue as a pressure and propaganda  element against our country and its interests. We must admit  that, except for that political sector of the exile community  that is fighting to return to this country as a conqueror, the  rest are true Cubans who by right deserve to have an affective  link with their people.    [Rodiguez] Well, answering Roque's question on the nation  and  migration, and what could be said about it, I think we Cubans  comprise a single nation. We will always be a single nation  regardless of where our citizens live. This has been  demonstrated by that community in Miami that has not allowed  itself to be affected by another society.    [Roque] I wish to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto for  their participation in this discussion on the invitation for  dialogue with the exile community that will be held in Cuba in  April, 1994.</p>

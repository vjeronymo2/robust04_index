Interest rates took a jump  in absolute and relative terms, and international and Brazilian  institutions had enormous losses.    After the initial panic, the market has stabilized in the  past few days, but the loss was inevitable. It now remains to be  seen whether it was only a regular adjustment of a market that  has experienced an extraordinary rise for more than one year, or  whether some basic conditions underwent lasting changes.    The manager of one of New York's most important  international  investment funds told GAZETA MERCANTIL that the market will  recover "slowly and partially." He expects a "substantial drop"  in Eurobonds and other securities offered by developing  countries, including Brazil, for this year. He believes costs  will rise and the financial flow reduction might affect stock  market investment. [passage omitted]    Profits on debt certificates (the "Brady's") and Eurobonds  from developing countries already have jumped significantly. The  crisis was triggered by the increase in U.S. interest rates.  Treasury 30-year securities, the market's most sensitive  indicator, which were paying 6.3 percent at the end of January,  jumped to 6.9 percent (on 9 March they were paying 6.85 percent).    Since T-bonds are the gauge, the basis of comparison for the  market, it was only natural that the yield on all securities  should have edged up. What happened, however, is that the  increase was much higher than proportionate. Or in other words,  the "spread" [preceding word in English] on securities from  Latin American countries vis-a-vis T-bonds shifted gears.    This is obvious comparing quotations published by the U.S.  investment bank Bear Stearns on 21 January, before the crisis,  with the current ones.    In Brazil's case, the spread of bonds on interest in arrears  (IDU [expansion unknown]) increased from 477 points to 600, the  "exit bonds" [preceding two words in English] from 383 to 488,  and the "new money bonds" [preceding three words in English]  from 434 to 565. For Argentina the damages was even greater  because the FRN's [expansion unknown] spread jumped from 302 to  478. Even the spread on Mexican "discount bonds" went from 160  to 232 points.    This increase also affected the quotation of Latin American  Eurobonds in the secondary market. The "spread" on several  Brazilian papers increased from 10 to 30 points. Bonds with  longer maturity dates, in general, suffered even more. The  spread on the bonds issued by the Argentine Republic worth $1  billion, whose maturity day is now a little less than 10 years  away, increased from 238 to 307 points.    In Brazil's case, a sector of the market believes the  announcement of an agreement with the IMF might push prices up.  The fact, however, is that during the past the arrival of some  good news such as the approval of the Social Emergency Fund and  the URV [Real Value Unit] helped cushion the increase compared  to other countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, but did not  avoid it. Combined rates on "Brady"-type papers show an average  drop from 20 percent (Bloomberg) to 15 percent (West Merchant  Bank) due to the crisis.    This is not the first crisis that has shaken the emerging  markets. During the last quarter of 1992, Brady papers lost  approximately 10 percent of their value due to the combination  of the Brazilian political and economic crisis and the excess  offer of Mexican papers. What is more worrisome today is the  nature of the crisis.    International investors' renewed interest in the emerging  Latin American markets was prompted by the combination of  various factors, among which is the recovery of their economies.  Anyhow, everybody agrees that a crucial factor was the major  drop in U.S. interest rates, thus making them unattractive.  Investing institutions such as the pension funds that must pay  their clients a minimum 7 percent interest a year were forced to  seek more risky alternatives that are, consequently, more  profitable.    What made the bonds market drop (increasing the  profitability  of their papers) was not only the increase in U.S. short-term  interest rates. The drop was caused by the signs that the very  long cycle of low and dropping rates probably has ended. U.S.  rates have increased because the rhythm of activities has been  much greater than expected and this starts to push inflation up.  As a banker stated: "Nobody says whether U.S. interest rates  are going to increase; people only talk about how much and when  they will increase." [passage omitted]</p>

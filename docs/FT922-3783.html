			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: McGowan, MCI chairman and telecom visionary, dies MR WILLIAM McGowan, chairman of MCI Communications and one of the most important figures behind the revolutionary changes in the structure of the US telecommunications industry over the past two decades, died yesterday in Washington of a heart attack. He was 64. Mr McGowan, a restless challenger of convention, came to the rescue of a tiny, financially-ailing start-up company - then known as Microwave Communications Incorporated - in 1968 and turned it into the second-largest long-distance telephone company in the US. Central to his success was the legal challenge he mounted to mighty American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which led in 1978 to a landmark court ruling breaking AT&amp;T's monopoly of the long-distance telephone market. Mr McGowan, who for most of his career was a chain-smoking workaholic, suffered a serious heart attack in 1986. He underwent heart transplant surgery the next year but returned to his desk after only a few months, declaring 'it would be punishment not to work'. However, in recent years he had steadily withdrawn from day-to-day responsibilities at MCI and late last year he ceded his role as chief executive to Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's president and his long-time heir apparent. Mr Roberts is expected to be named chairman. Wall Street analysts said Mr McGowan's death was likely to have little impact on MCI's operations, in view of the careful devolution of power to Mr Roberts. However, they said the US telecommunications industry as a whole would suffer from the loss of one of its most articulate and visionary spokesmen. MCI's shares closed at Dollars 32 7/8 , up Dollars  5/8 on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. Mr McGowan, a florid-faced man with a broad grin, was born into an Irish immigrant family in Pennsylvania. His father was a railroad engineer and his mother a teacher. After attending the Harvard Business School, he set up in New York as a consultant rescuing troubled companies. In 1968 he was invited to help rescue MCI, then based in Chicago, which wanted to offer a radio telephone services to trucks travelling between that city and St Louis. The company needed approval for this service from the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the US telecommunications industry, but its application was opposed by AT&amp;T, which had a virtual monopoly in the long-distance market. MCI eventually won FCC approval and Mr McGowan, having taken control of the company after paying off its debts, got a taste for challenging AT&amp;T. It was his particular genius to realise that a tightly run rival could undercut the giant's prices and that AT&amp;T's heavy-handed approach to potential competition made it vulnerable on anti-trust grounds. Over the subsequent decade and a half, MCI constantly harried AT&amp;T before regulatory agencies and in the courts, to the extent that the company jokingly became known as ' a law firm with an antenna on the roof'. Mr McGowan, aware that good relations with the FCC would be vital to his crusade, quickly moved the company's headquarters to Washington, just around the corner from the commission's offices. Parallel with MCI's attacks on AT&amp;T, the Justice Department pursued the giant on anti-trust grounds, and Mr McGowan's ultimate vindication came in 1984 when this suit led to the break-up of AT&amp;T and the spinning-off of its local telephone services into seven separate 'Baby Bell' regional companies. This created a much more level playing field for MCI and other independents, such as Sprint, to compete against AT&amp;T in the long-distance market. A bitter price war ensued, which helped the US consumer but in 1986 contributed to huge losses at MCI and heavy staff cuts. MCI recovered, helped by innovative product introductions, and it is now estimated to hold some 17 per cent of the long-distance market - although an aggressive AT&amp;T has made it much harder for MCI to win further domestic market share.</p>

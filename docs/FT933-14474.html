			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Mr Byatt's water torture Yesterday's missive from Ofwat on the cost of water quality sheds little light on the direction of next year's regulatory review. True, the 7 per cent real return on capital for water companies assumed in Ofwat's sums would be encouraging if carried through to the review. But Mr Ian Byatt, the regulator, may not be as generous in practice. By recommending that the government postpones the implementation of some water standards, he is trying to pass the problem of rapidly rising water charges back to the politicians. As he also believes that standards are too tight, the assumption in his report of a generous rate of return - and hence larger price rises - suits his purpose well. Whether Mr Byatt can squeeze a decision from government on standards, and thus capital expenditure for water companies, before the review is also open to doubt. Without a political decision, Ofwat might feel obliged to assume tough standards and high capital expenditure in setting price limits for the second half of the decade. That could result in a cautious settlement, broadly favourable for shareholders. The more likely outcome, though, is that price limits will be altered as spending obligations become clear. A stable framework of medium-term regulation looks a distant prospect. Even if the government comes down in favour of less onerous standards and lower capital expenditure, there is no guarantee water companies will be less geared or less likely to make rights issues. That turns on the return on capital which Mr Byatt finally settles on in his review.</p>

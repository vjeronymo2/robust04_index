Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira said he  has reached an agreement with rapporteur Nelson Jobim to extend  the deadline for 15 days. Oliveira wants Congress to vote on 17  February on a resolution to extend the constitutional amendment  works -- which are currently scheduled to conclude on 15 March  -- including amendments to the social emergency fund and a  reduction of the presidential mandate from five to four years.    On 22 February Oliveira will ask the party leaders to  guarantee the presence of at least 20 percent of their  congressmen in the plenary hall to guarantee a quorum for all  constitutional amendment sessions. With the help of political  parties and the definition of a minimum work agenda, Oliveira  believes the constitutional amendment works may conclude on 1  May, leaving 15 days of extra time. He is sure the elections  will not harm the constitutional amendment process. On the  contrary, he said, the parties will wait to conclude the  constitutional reform before defining their campaign strategy.    Senate President Humberto Lucena said he will suggest that  the constitutional revision process be extended until 30 May  because he said this is the preference of most parties.</p>

During the accumulation period, amounts allocated to the Separate Account may be transferred among the portfolios and/or the Fixed Account. After the annuity date, transfers may be made from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account but not from the Fixed Account to the Separate Account. The first fifteen transactions effecting such transfers in any contract year are permitted without the imposition of a transfer fee. A transfer fee of $25 ($10 in Pennsylvania and Texas) is assessed on the sixteenth and each subsequent transfer within the contract year. This fee will be deducted from contract values which remain in the portfolio (or, where applicable, the Fixed Account) from which the transfer was made. If such remaining contract value is insufficient to pay the transfer fee, then the fee will be deducted from transferred contract values. The transfer fee is at cost with no anticipation of profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A contingent deferred sales charge (``withdrawal charge'') may be imposed upon certain withdrawals. Withdrawal charges will vary in amount depending upon the contribution year of the purchase payment at the time of withdrawal. The withdrawal charge begins at 7% and declines 1% per year to 0% after seven years. The withdrawal charge is deducted from remaining contract value so that the actual reduction in contract value as a result of the withdrawal will be greater than the withdrawal amount requested and paid. For purposes of determining the withdrawal charge, withdrawals will be allocated first to investment income, if any (which may generally be withdrawn free of withdrawal charge), and then to purchase payments on a first-in, first-out basis so that all withdrawals are allocated to purchase payments to which the lowest (if any) withdrawal charge applies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Purchase payments no longer subject to the withdrawal charge and earnings under a Contract may be withdrawn at any time free of the withdrawal charge. In addition, there may be a free withdrawal amount for the first withdrawal during a contract year after the first contract year. The additional free withdrawal amount is equal to 10% of purchase payments made more than one year prior to the date of withdrawal that remain subject to the withdrawal charge and that have not previously been withdrawn, less earnings under the Contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Anchor National deducts a distribution expense charge from each portfolio of the Separate Account during each valuation period which is equal, on an annual basis, to 0.15% of the net asset value of each portfolio. This charge is designed to compensate Anchor National for assuming the risk that the cost of distributing the Contracts will exceed the revenuers from the withdrawal charge. In no event will this charge be increased. The distribution expense charge is assessed during both the accumulation period and the annuity period, however, it is not applied to contract values allocated to the Fixed Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Annuity payments will not be affected by the mortality experience of persons receiving such payments or the general population The annuity rates may not be changed under the Contract. For assuming the risks (1) that the life expectancy of an annuitant will be greater than that assumed in the guaranteed annuity purchase rates, (2) for waiving the withdrawal charge in the event of the death of the Contract owners, and (3) for providing the death benefit prior to the annuity date, Anchor National deducts a mortality risk charge from the Separate Account. The charge is deducted from each portfolio of the Separate Account during each valuation period at an annual rate of 0.90% of the net asset value of each portfolio. If the mortality risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs of assuming the mortality risks, Anchor National will bear the loss; however, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a gain to Anchor National. To the extent Anchor National realizes any gain, those amounts may be used at its discretion, including offsetting losses experienced when the mortality risk charge is insufficient. The mortality risk charge may not be increased under the Contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Anchor National bears the risk that the contract administration charge will be insufficient to cover the cost of administering the Contracts. For assuming this expense risk, Anchor National deducts an expense risk charge from the Separate Account. The charge is deducted from each portfolio of the Separate Account during each valuation period at an annual rate of 0.35% of the net asset value of each portfolio. If the expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of administering the Contracts, Anchor National will bear the loss; however, if the charge is more than sufficient, the excess will be a gain to Anchor National. To the extent Anchor National realizes any gain, those amounts may be used at its discretion, including offsetting losses when the expense risk charge is insufficient. The expense risk charge may not be increased under the Contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

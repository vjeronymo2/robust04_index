			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Hidden dangers in a family loan - Take care before you lend cash to loved ones IN DIFFICULT economic times, it is tempting to offer financial help to less fortunate family members. Parents in particular do not want to see their sons, daughters, or in-laws get into financial difficulties when a loan might stave off bankruptcy, repossession, or more positively, start or prop up a business. Take care however, if you are in this situation and about to make a loan to your nearest and dearest. Lending has more hidden perils than giving. When you make a gift by throwing your bread upon the waters, you may neither hope nor expect to see it return, although sometimes this action can have the happy consequence of reducing inheritance tax on your estate. The first danger the lender faces is that the money may never be repaid. Whatever arrangements have been made to repay the debt may be cancelled. Even borrowers with the best intentions may find it impossible to raise the money. Against this most obvious hazard of lending, assume the worst. Never lend so much that you put your own security in jeopardy. Take another precaution too: no matter how well disposed to each other debtor and creditor may be, put any lending arrangement in writing, and give receipts when money is received. The receipt can be quite simple, the name of lender and borrower, the amount and purpose of the loan, (to pay off other debts; buy a house, car, stock, equipment etc) the instalment paid, and the amount now outstanding at the date of the receipt. Use a small duplicate book with numbered pages. Keep the book and hand out the duplicate receipt. This action will save you from other dangers which sometimes beset the lender. In certain circumstances it can also prove tax efficient, giving you tax relief on any capital gains that you may make. The second hazard which a written arrangement overcomes is the possibility of family quarrels. These may arise in the course of time about who had what and who did or did not repay what. The written arrangement will show what was lent, for what purpose, how much was repaid, and will also ease the job of an executor, even if you have (or have not) made a will. A third hazard of lending is that the money lent may not be used as you intended. Rich philanthropists control trusts to ensure that their donations go where they want them to. There are sound reasons for this. Take a leaf from their book. If for example, your debtor uses your loan to buy not the equipment for which you lent the money, but, say, a share, and receives a 10 per cent dividend, that is technically your income and you are liable for income tax on it. The fourth point to notice when making a private loan, is more uplifting. When you lend or act as guarantor for a loan to somebody who is broke, and there is no hope of ever getting repaid, your unlikely saviour could be the Inland Revenue. Section D36 of its booklet Extra Statutory Concessions states that in certain circumstances a loss may be claimed where money lent to a person carrying on a trade, profession or vocation has become irrecoverable. Though the claim usually arises from the date of the loss, it can be made up to two years afterwards. Lending to family or friends is, generally speaking, a private arrangement of no interest or concern to anybody else. But if any eventual difficulty arises, a written agreement does show evidence of intention, even if nothing else, and may help the lender get tax relief on any capital gains elsewhere that he or she may make.</p>

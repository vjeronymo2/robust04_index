			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKING FOR JUSTICE  </P> <P> The irony of "Working Girl" strikes a nerve ("Griffith Fits Glass Slipper as a  'Working Girl' Cinderella," Dec. 2).  </P> <P> Here's a fantasy film about a woman who's scrambling to find justice in the  corporate world. In the end, she receives justice.  </P> <P> But catch the credits that appear on the screen: Melanie Griffith gets third  billing, behind Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver. Third billing for a film  that Griffith clearly carried, a film that relied on her role to push the box  office.  </P> <P> C'mon, Hollywood. C'mon, 20th Century Fox. That's corporate injustice!  </P> <P> NEIL EGLASH  </P> <P> and F. DAVID RENNIE  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

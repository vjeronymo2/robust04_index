			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Guyana suspends state sell-off THE government of Guyana has suspended the privatisation of state-owned enterprises saying the programme was not 'credible'. It will say in March whether it will continue to sell state property. Mr Asgar Ally, finance minister, said the government 'will have to review what happened with earlier agreements, what went wrong and how things should not be done'. The government's review will delay the privatisation of 10 companies which the previous government had said it wanted to divest. These include the national airline, and the sugar and bauxite industries, two main pillars of the economy. While in opposition, Mr Cheddi Jagan, the new president, had frequently criticised the privatisation programme, attacking the manner in which the government was concluding deals with foreign investors.</p>

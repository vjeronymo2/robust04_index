Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,  said China believes bilateral relations are extremely important,  especially trade ties.    She made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing with  visiting EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.    They presided over the 13th session of the EC-China Joint  Committee and the eighth bilateral ministerial-level talks over  trade issues.    Brittan, who is in charge of the EC's external relations and  trade policies, reaffirmed the community's support for China's  re-entry into GATT but urged the mainland to further liberalize  trade.    "We admire China's remarkable progress towards the creation  of a market economy," Brittan said yesterday. "The EC will  support and welcome China's continued economic reforms."    He continued: "China's re-entry into GATT (the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) would be of great interest  worldwide."    During the talks, the two sides have agreed to discuss the  liberalization of non-tariff measures in China.    The first meeting will take effect in March in Geneva within  the framework of the GATT Working Party on China.    Brittan's remarks came a week after Dorothy Dwoskin, the  U.S.  assistant trade representative, announced her country's support  of China's reentry into the world trade body.    Their remarks will be in China's favour when the GATT  Working  Party on China convenes its 16th session in Geneva in March,  local analysts said, for the two represent major GATT  contracting parties.    Wu said her talks with Brittan were conducted in a "frank,  friendly and down-to-the-earth fashion."    "We've reached consensus on a wide range of issues and  agreed  to tackle the remaining ones in the future in a positive  manner," she said.    She described her talks with Brittan as paving the way for  future bilateral cooperation.    She pointed out that the EC has become China's second  largest  import source after Japan. The two sides have engaged in  bilateral economic cooperation in agriculture, environmental  protection and other areas.    Also yesterday, the EC announced it will finance the  establishment of the China-Europe International Business School  in Shanghai this year.    The two sides did not discuss the EC's quota restrictions on  Chinese exports, which has been a major problem in bilateral  trade.    In another development, Wu Yi said Britain's inability to  cooperate over the Hong Kong issue would likely hurt  Sino-British trade, which had surged 86 percent over 1992 last  year.    But Brittan said China must extend non-discriminative  measures to all EC members.</p>

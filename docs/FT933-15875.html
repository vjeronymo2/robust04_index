			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Elections 1993: Business backing slips away from ruling party / Examining growing divisions of interest among the LDP's corporate donors THE divisions that have split Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party are working their way through the party's bedrock, its business support. Traditional LDP supporters in industries such as construction and machinery regard the recent split in the party's ranks as a disaster. Mr Takeshi Kaname, managing director of Yamazaki Mazak, the leading machine tool manufacturer, remarked: 'The divisions are terrible, nothing but bad news.' Yet he is far from being in a majority. Business executives from newer industries such as electronics and cars, which are more dependent on international trade, say they support political reforms which could strengthen new parties. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Federation of Employers' Associations, believes the new parties created by breakaways from the LDP could bring benefits to business, partly by displacing the Socialist opposition. Commenting on the Japan Renewal party led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, Mr Nagano said: 'I would like to see the new party become one wing of a two-party conservative political set up.' These divisions came to a head last week when the heads of Japan's four largest employer federations held a hastily convened summit. They decided to review their relationship with the LDP after the election. Business may fund the new conservative parties if they emerge from the poll strong enough to offer a durable alternative to the LDP. At first sight Japanese industry's interests in fostering a challenge to the LDP seem perverse. Business has done extremely well from LDP policies over the past three decades which have been designed to favour it often at the expense of consumers. For instance, Japan still lacks a basic product liability laws common in other countries. Mr Hata's new party is conservative but it claims to champion the rights of consumers and plans to come to power in coalition with the Socialist opposition. Many business leaders believe the LDP's political dominance is an anachronism inherited from the cold war era when Japanese industry was developing with the help of the government's protection. Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Cannon, the camera company, explained: 'The old relationships are breaking up. In the old days when Japan set out to catch up with the west it made sense for business to build close relationships with political parties. But now Japan is an economic superpower and the cold war threat it gone. We no longer have to contribute to the LDP to protect the economy.' Executives from international companies believe Japan's political institutions are ill-equipped to guide Japan to a larger world role. They also complained the centralisation of bureaucratic power in Tokyo handicaps them with unnecessary regulations at home. A senior official of the Keidanren, the largest employers' federation, explained: 'Japan needs stronger, more enlivened politics to open debate on how Japan should fulfil a large international role. We just do not debate these issues at the moment. We need more political openness.' He went on: 'We want decentralisation at home so that bureaucrats in Tokyo have less power to set detailed regulations in local areas. If a business wants to do something - extend a road or build a factory extension - they often have to apply to Tokyo first. This creates huge bottlenecks.' The official concluded: 'The development of two competing parties, a conservative party and a more liberal, consumer-oriented, internationalist party, is a part of Japan becoming more mature.' This developing division in politics reflects a similar trend within industry. The LDP has held together a very wide coalition of business support stretching from domestic farmers and small businesses, to large high-technology manufacturing companies exporting 80 per cent of their output. It is becoming increasingly hard for the party to satisfy both wings of its business coalition. Manufacturing exporters' interest in free trade is increasingly at odds with the protection of rice farmers, for which Japan is regularly criticised by its trading partners. Heavy industries such as steel and chemicals, which benefit from traditional government public building programmes designed to boost the flagging economy, are at odds with retailers and consumer goods makers who want a tax cut to revive consumer spending in urban areas. An imbalance in how industries wield political influence also favours domestically oriented sectors. Construction companies can target their financial support at politicians who will influence how public sector contracts are awarded. However, consumer industries cannot target their political support in this way. As a senior executive with a consumer electronics manufacturer explained: 'We need to change general policies such as the retail laws and tax policies to help our business. That means changing the way politicians in general think, not just a few key people. That is why we favour more political debate because that is the only way to get different policies discussed.' But perhaps the most pressing reason for business reconsidering links with the LDP is the way the political corruption tarnishes the image of business. This is already having an impact on the LDP's finances. The party had hoped to borrow Y25bn (Pounds 155m) from a syndicate of large banks to finance its election campaign. The banks trimmed that to Y10bn because they did not want to be seen bankrolling the LDP. Even the construction industry federation last week adopted tougher guidelines to limit political donations by member companies.</p>

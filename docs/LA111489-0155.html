			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KOHL PAYS TRIBUTE AT AUSCHWITZ, DECRIES BARBARISM  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl bowed his head in silent tribute today at  the former death camp at Auschwitz, where the Nazis killed 4 million people  during World War II, and later vowed that such barbarism must never be  repeated.  </P> <P> Kohl laid a wreath at the camp's death wall, where 30,000 victims were shot. He  then bowed his head and stood in silence as Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas  Menahem Yoskovitch, recalled the Holocaust and prayed for the dead, most of  whom were Jews.  </P> <P> "The warning (given by) this place must never be forgotten. Unspeakable harm  was inflicted on different peoples here, above all European Jews, in the name  of Germany," Kohl wrote in the camp visitors' book.  </P></p>

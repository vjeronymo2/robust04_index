			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Minister welcomes building review The government yesterday welcomed proposals to reduce construction costs by stemming contract abuses and improving services - but would not commit itself to promoting new legislation. Viscount Ullswater, appointed construction minister in last week's reshuffle, said: 'The government is willing in principle to consider legislation if the need for it is adequately demonstrated.' It was the government's first opportunity to respond to an independent review of the construction industry which called for a construction contracts bill to improve payment and dispute procedures. The review, sponsored by the industry and the government, said that it should be mandatory to appoint independent adjudicators to resolve conflicts, reducing the need for costly legislation. A bill would permit trust funds to be established to hold contract cash to protect companies should customers or contractors fail. Sub-contractors would be able to charge punitive interest for late payments. Viscount Ullswater said yesterday that the government welcomed the overall thrust of the review. As a first step the Department of the Environment would support the creation of an implementation forum, representing the industry and its leading customers, 'to oversee the follow-up work necessary to take forward the report'. Sir Michael Latham, the former Conservative MP and ex-director of the Housebuilders Federation who led the investigation into the industry, would become chairman of the implementation forum. Viscount Ullswater said this would advise whether a more permanent administrative machinery was required to pursue the proposals and cut construction costs by up to 30 per cent.</p>

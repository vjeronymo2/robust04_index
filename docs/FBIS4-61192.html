			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Shapiro report in the "Russian Lieutenant Colonel </F> Arrested in Chechnya" column: "The Chechen Side Considers the  Detainee a Saboteur"]    [Text] Yesterday INTERFAX, citing Sultan Geliskhanov,  chief of the Chechnya State Security Department, reported that  on 29 April department officers detained a Russian lieutenant  colonel on the territory of the Chechen Republic. The detainee  allegedly admitted his involvement in operations by Russian  special services on the territory of the Chechen Republic. No  details of the detention are disclosed.    The CHECHEN PRESS AGENCY told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's  correspondent that no information about the detention of a  Russian lieutenant colonel was filed through their channels, but  an agency official noted that "there are plenty of spies in  Chechnya." The fact that a former KGB lieutenant colonel was  detained on the territory of Chechnya was confirmed by Chechen  Republic Press Minister Movladi Udugov, who said that  documentary evidence was obtained about the detainee's  involvement in organizing terrorist acts in Chechnya. Mr.  Udugov, however, refused to provide further details of the case.  Russian special services officials also declined to confirm the  detention of a Russian lieutenant colonel on the territory of  the Chechen Republic.</p>

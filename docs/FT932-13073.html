			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Private View: A talk on the night train - Natalia Makarova, the ballerina, trembles for the future of Russia SHE ALIGHTED like a gorgeous butterfly on the shining parquet of Prince Naryshkin's palace in St Petersburg and took a swig of champagne. Her head was wrapped in a trailing turban, her slender body in a jacket of rainbow colours and her legs - the famous legs - in saucy black-patterned stockings. When Natalia Makarova emerges fragile and shimmering from the secret struggles of the wardrobe she seems to create an auditorium of the space around her. It is not deliberate vanity, I think, but her uninhibited theatricality  - the same impulse that keeps the former prima ballerina assoluta of the Kirov still twirling under the lights as an actress and media celebrity. A few evenings later, aboard a luxury train trundling down to Volgograd and central Asia, the Russian butterfly consented to perch for an hour in the ornate library car and talk about the sensation of revisiting her wasted homeland. It was early in April and the snow was melting to expose a dour landscape of birch woods, brown pasture and muddy, derelict townships. President Boris Yeltsin had just returned from his meeting with Bill Clinton and was campaigning for votes in the national referendum to be held tomorrow. First of all I asked Makarova (the stress is on the second syllable) whether anything of the Leningrad child in her had survived. 'Well, I don't feel particularly Russian,' she said in a heavy Russian accent. 'Everybody says I'm totally Russian. But I don't feel this national belonging. I belong to the world.' She laughed as if to apologise for the conceit. 'I always am comfortable and feel free when I have lots of possibility for creative things. And that's my home.' Makarova's material home is San Francisco where she lives with her third husband, Edward Karkar, a tall, courteous Lebanese-American who sold his electronics company in 1986 and plays Stradivarius and Guarneri violins. There are apartments in New York and London. The couple have a 15-year-old son, Andrei ('Andrusha') who was travelling with them for his first look at Russia. Do you suffer as other exiles have? I asked. Solzhenitsyn became quite bitter about the West . . . 'I know, I know. But you see writers are different. Writers belong to the roots because they reflect their nation and they have probably more responsibility to the nation. Ballet is a much more abstract art . . . Because I am abstract. I am Sylphide (the wood sprite in Bournonville's romantic ballet). I can be Sylphide everywhere. Nothing to do with politics. It's my spirit, that's what it is . . . whether in America, Africa. Everywhere it's a spirituality.' This little sprite - she is no more than 5ft 3in tall - was rescued by her mother from the German siege of Leningrad and grew up pardonably unashamed of her material cravings - for chocolate, clothes and shoes, for icons and works of art. She is not all Material Girl. In the garden of their country house in the Napa Valley, California, Makarova and her husband are completing an Orthodox chapel of Canadian cedarwood with seven onion domes, computer-designed, of copper-covered fibreglass. It is more than just a souvenir of the country she fled 23 years ago, as became clear later in the conversation. The couple have also set up a foundation to help her childhood ballet school in St Petersburg, the Vaganova, which produced many of the great names of Russian ballet including Makarova's two fellow refugees, Nureyev and Baryshnikov. Makarova defected ('I don't like the word. I choose to live in another country]') during a Kirov tour to London. Dining with English friends, she debated with them for seven hours before ringing Scotland Yard. 'They predict me in Soviet Russia I will never survive,' she said, 'because I am too Russian and I will be lost in that rotten capitalist world. But that is old story.' Four years ago, one of the first beneficiaries of glasnost, she returned to her home city to dance at the Kirov. She decided to make it her swan-song as a classical ballerina. Emotional as the occasion was, it seemed to her unreal. 'I totally cancelled that other world when I live this different life. In my mind I knew I will never go back. I just totally cut it from my life.' Would you live here again? 'No, I will not. Why? Why?' I could not think why. To give people encouragement? To show your faith in their future? 'I don't think it will be enough for them,' she laughed thinly. 'It will not help, really. It's very romantic.' (I think she meant naive). Do you feel no nostalgia? 'You can't say it's nostalgia. I just feel very sad and very dramatic towards my generation, my people. I share with them and I suffer. It's not just to say that. I really truly do. I really feel terrible because they don't deserve that. They have a dignity and it looks like they're on the edge to lose their dignity. I don't know what best I can do. 'They are down, much down. They hardly hope for the future. It's so sad. Everyone complain. They took my shoulder and put their head on my shoulder and say: 'Natashinka, but you heard about our situation?' I said: 'Of course I heard'. It's getting worse and worse. At least after the war it was difficult time but everyone was optimistic, rebuilding, you know, a rejuvenation mood. But now they find hard just to survive to get enough food, not to die.' As Makarova's passion rises, her accent and syntax becomes ever more exotic. She begged me, for the sake of her career as an actress, to tidy up her English. What can one do? It is part of her personality, and the critics are forgiving because of her mesmerising stage presence. The Financial Times called her the most flawed but the most sublime element of the piece when she starred opposite Robert Powell in Tovarich in Chichester and London. Her performance in On Your Toes won her rave reviews and an Olivier award as best acress in a musical. When I observed it was difficult not to feel ashamed travelling in luxury through such manifest poverty, she agreed hastily. 'Yes. I feel guilty. Me too. Absolutely. I go to the streets with these people. They cover themselves and they look away from the camera. It is because they have dignity that they cover. And I am living well, I'm alright. I am really like a Scarlett O'Hara.' She described her compatriots as spiritually energetic but reduced to apathy by 'the tragedy of uncertainty where the old thing collapses and the new didn't arrive.' If they got through the mental and moral stress of the present, she added, they would survive. She talked about Africa and Yugoslavia in the same breath as Russia. 'I wish everyone would not just say 'Oh, Oh, how bad]' but do something realistic about it. I just wish people will be not passive. Of course you can sympathise with people who are hungry but do something. My God] 'Just put this. How is principles, when people are dying? How possible that?' The extravagance of her language does not mean Makarova's concern is insincere. Indeed, as we talked a softer, more thoughtful and less theatrical character began to emerge and her discomfort with my questions subsided. I wondered how maturity had changed her. We get older, I said, and want to make sense of our lives. Like Tolstoy, I prompted. 'Certainly. And sometimes they are wrong.' What about you? 'You perform some role and you are very fussy at the beginning,' she replied. 'With more experience you cut the extra and come to the essence. So probably with age you come to be more simple, more direct.' What about the celebrity status you have achieved as a dancer and exile, and now as a media performer. Do you enjoy that side of life? 'I don't think about that. It's part of my life. I cannot answer. It's just what I am.' Some people in the public eye complain . . . 'No, I don't dislike anything. I don't particularly like socialising when I am out of work. I prefer to stay in my country house and read and listen to music. That's the most enjoyable time I have. I had very little opportunity before.' I asked her what she read. She surprised me by replying promptly: 'Philosophy, religion.' Did you have any religious teaching? 'Not as a child, no. Only my babushka, my grandmother, christened me when I was five years old and since that I never was in church in Russia.' A little later she said: 'Myself, I have a belief. But it is in me, inside of me. It's not come from on top. I am afraid now in Russia there is a new fashion of religion which comes too much from above. It is somehow strange to me after all this education in the party ideology. They have gone from one extreme to another.' Because they feel so vulnerable? 'Probably escapism too. I read a lot of philosophers, atheist and religious, like Berdyaev, like Heidegger, Camus and Sartre. I compare and choose for myself. I am looking for the right thing for me. 'I don't think ever in the history of Russia they ever had a choice. It's always been dictated - how to think, how to feel. Thus for people to take liberty and democracy is very difficult, mentally. There has to be a transition time. It will be much longer than you think.' She looked at me accusingly. You mean 50 years, 100 years? 'I can't predict. I am not politician. I am not gypsy,' she laughed gaily and continued. 'I'm not very political, as you say. Not very intellectual.' She laughed again. 'So. I'm not supposed to be. I'm ballerina.' And she flitted off to bed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, 18 March -- Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao will visit the United States in May to resolve the  complexities in Indo-U.S. ties centering on the Kashmir issue  and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty by holding summit-level  talks. The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr.  Sidharata Shankar Ray, will arrive in New Delhi on 2 April to  finalize the date for Rao's visit. Earlier, Indian officials  held that it would not be proper for Rao to visit Washington as  the Clinton administration was exerting too much pressure on the  Kashmir and Punjab issues. These officials gained confidence  after the defeat of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution on Kashmir  in Geneva and advised Rao to go ahead with his proposed trip to  the U.S.    Apart from exerting pressure on India on the human rights  situation in Kashmir, the Clinton administration is also raising  the Punjab issue which New Delhi no longer acknowledges is a  problem. President Clinton is doing things that have not been  done by the former U.S. presidents. He is responding to letters  written by any Sikh militant and has already replied to the  letters from two of them. Washington is also pressuring New  Delhi to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and all these  have become a cause of headache for India.    New Delhi's ties with the Democratic Bush administration was  very cordial but it is not the same with the Clinton  administration. India did not expect Clinton to become the  President. India cannot match even somewhat the intense  Pakistani propaganda in Washington; and the favorite issue is  human rights for the Democratic senators, who regularly raise a  hue and cry over the human rights situation in Kashmir, China,  Iran, and other countries. This issue is the main obstacle that  has prevented the United States from granting the most favored  nations status to China. Hence, there is no reason to believe  they will easily stop raising the human rights question in  Kashmir.    There has been a diplomatic victory in Geneva, but the  United  States did not support any side. Indian officials believe that  had America exerted pressure, it would not have been necessary  for China or Iran to appear in the field. In that case,  Pakistan would not have gone so far. The U.S. silence over this  issue is a cause of worry for India. Solarz is not willing to  become the U.S. ambassador to India due to pressure from the  Clinton administration, causing a great setback for India. It  is well-known that Solarz has a soft spot for India. Under  these circumstances, the Indian officials feel that Rao should  go to Washington to express India's feelings. They are  confident that the talks between President Clinton and Rao would  be successful like the latter's earlier talks with the British  prime minister, John Major, and the German chancellor, Helmut  Kohl. It is for this reason that the Indian ambassador to  Washington, Sidharta Shankar Ray, has been summoned to New Delhi.    Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has again commented on  the human rights situation in India. This time the concern has  been voiced not by Robin Raphel but the Secretary of State  Warren Christopher before the subcommittee of the U.S. House of  Representatives over the situation in Punjab and Kashmir.  According to reports from Washington, in reply to Democratic  Congressman James P. Moran, Christopher said a clear difference  of opinion exists between New Delhi and Washington on the two  issues of human rights and nuclear nonproliferation. He said,  "In fact, concern over the human rights situation in Kashmir and  Punjab has not yet been allayed." Christopher also did not  hesitate to praise India. In his words "the United States has  traditional and friendly ties with India. We want that this  relationship to strengthen further. We have very high opinion of  India. Unlike other friendly countries, U.S.-India ties are not  totally free of problems. The two spheres where difference of  opinion exists is human rights and nuclear nonproliferation."    The U.S. Secretary of State is confused over India's nuclear  programs. Referring to India's first underground nuclear test  in 1974, Christopher said India might have acquired nuclear  capability in the meantime. This is also applicable in the case  of Pakistan. The U.S. wants nuclear research programs conducted  by these two countries for military purposes to be kept within a  certain limit. Christopher evaded the question on why the ban  that has been imposed against Pakistan under the Pressler  Amendment has not been imposed on India also. However, he said  he would reply to this question later.    The complexities regarding the appointment of the U.S.  ambassador to India has increased. Solarz who had been  identified as the next U.S. ambassador to India has stepped  aside realizing the attitude of Clinton administration  officials. Solarz became aware of this attitude after he held  talks with the U.S. vice president, Albert Gore, last Thursday  [10 March] and earlier with the national security adviser,  Anthony Lake, and his assistant, Sandy Berger. These three  people hinted to Solarz that his chances of being nominated as  ambassador were thin. Solarz later withdraw his candidacy.    Experts believe that despite the great publicity that Solarz  did not get the ambassador's job because he is very sympathetic  to India. Recently, Warren Christopher, announced that Solarz  would be made ambassador to India. He added that the  announcement of his appointment had been delayed due to  procedural formalities. Earlier, Solarz had been accused for his  alleged involvement in providing visa to a Hong Kong  businessman. Later, he was acquitted of the charge after an FBI  inquiry.    The middle-level officials of the U.S. State Department are  against the appointment of Solarz as ambassador as he is close  to President Clinton.</p>

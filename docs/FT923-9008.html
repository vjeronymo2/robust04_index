			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Off the road IF JACK KEROUAC had been British, he would probably have gone by bicycle. The folk hero of America's road culture would have drawn little poetic inspiration from a coast to coast drive on Britain's motorway network. Even today, more than 30 years after Kerouac's fabled journey, a 'road-trip' along America's highways is exciting and up-lifting: in marked contrast to the congestion, pollution and poor services which scar the M1 from London to Leeds. The great British public has always shown a dogged willingness to tolerate squalor. Some even claim to take a strange pleasure from a stop at a motorway service station. Maybe it is the lingering legacy of the war-time spirit that has caused decades of motorists to tolerate greasy food served by unwilling staff at inflated prices. The quality of Britain's motorway services is a clear example of the abuse of monopoly power. Five companies currently control all 55 motorway service areas on sites owned by the government and operated under 50-year franchises. Almost never spaced less than 30 miles apart, they have had little incentive to respond to consumer needs. Road travellers have detected some recent improvement in food quality. But last year's Which? report found dirty or shabby toilets, drab surroundings and 20-minute restaurant queues. In three cases, the report recommended motorists to drive on by. Yet budding beatniks be ready. Mr John Major's famous intimacy with roadside Happy Eater restaurants has equipped his administration for radical measures. Yesterday's announcement that the government plans to deregulate motorways service areas suggests Britain's motorways are to enter the consumer age. The franchise system is to be dismantled and private developers will now be able to identify new sites where they see profit-making opportunities and apply for planning permission. This change does not herald a new age of motorway fun: service stations will still be tightly controlled. A minimum 15-mile interval between services will still be maintained; and stations will not be allowed to provide activities 'which are unconnected with motorists' use of the road and which would therefore lead to the site becoming a destination in its own right'. The intention of these restrictions is understandable. It is in no one's interest to develop motorway leisure complexes on the edge of large cities which undermine urban facilities, increase traffic flow and disadvantage city-dwellers without cars. And, surprising as it may seem, Britain's motorway verges are an important natural habitat for wildlife. Still, the government should interpret its guidelines liberally. Safety demands that long distance motorists need plenty of breaks; and there is no reason why the only available pastimes should be eating, drinking and arcade games. Why not allow drivers to break the trip from London to Glasgow with a refreshing swim at Newport Pagnell, or from Birmingham to Carlisle with a spot of 10 pin bowling outside Warrington? As for the leisure-centre seeking tripper, there is a long overdue way to discourage short journeys: motorway tolls.</p>

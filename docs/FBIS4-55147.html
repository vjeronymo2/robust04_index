			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 10 (CTK) -- Net monthly income per  member of households with a common budget averaged 2,809  korunas, nominally 51 percent more than in 1988, but 19 percent  less in real terms, according to a Czech Statistical Office  report. The report, based on a "microcensus" of selected  households carried out in March 1993, was made public yesterday  at a press conference. Having collected data from 0.5 percent  of Czech households, the office compared the results with a  similar study undertaken in March of 1989. Cost of living  indexes, which increased 88 percent between 1988 and 1992, were  taken into account when determining real income.    Households headed by a businessman had an average monthly  income per member in 1992 of 3,730 korunas; by a farmer, 3,419;  by a wage-owner, 2,849; by a pensioner (with economically active  household members), 2,773; by cooperative farmers, 2,500; and by  a pensioner (with no economically active household members),  2,445. The lowest income was reported by "other" households,  usually headed by an unemployed individual, and by broken  families living on child benefits -- 1,698 korunas. Real income  decreased most for households headed by cooperative farmers --  31 percent -- and least for those headed by pensioners without  economically active members -- 13 percent.    According to the data, differentiation increased both among  the categories and within them. Just under three percent of  households had incomes putting them under the poverty line at  March 1993. Almost half of these were from the other households  category.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / British Gas break-up opposed THE GAS Consumers Council has warned the government against breaking up British Gas into separate companies as proposed by Ofgas, the industry regulator. Mr James Cooper, council chairman, said: 'No case has yet been made for radical and irreversible restructuring.' In the council's annual report published today, Mr Cooper says any restructuring should show benefits for the consumer: 'Competition just for the sake of competition is no reason for change.' Proposals to break up British Gas are being considered by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due to report in July. The council said complaints from consumers about British Gas fell by 14 per cent last year to 19,281 - the biggest drop since 1989. The council said British Gas's reorganisation into district centres had led to improved customer service. But Ofgas registered an 89 per cent increase in complaints to 1,624 in its annual report in February. The disparity appears to result from Ofgas's higher public profile, which has meant more complaints being directed towards it, rather than a rise in consumer dissatisfaction.

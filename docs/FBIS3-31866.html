			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pristina, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova,  president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK], said today  that "if the international community recognizes the division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina then the same principles of division along  ethnic lines will be also valid for Kosovo."    At a news conference Rugova said that "what is valid for  Muslims and Croats must be valid for Albanians as well,"  explaining that the option chosen by the DSK and other Albanian  political parties was "an independent and neutral Kosovo." This  option is also the minimum [of Albanian demands] -- nothing less  than that could be acceptable in the talks with the Serbian  leadership, he said. This would be a compromise both for the  Serbs and for the Albanians [as received], he believes.    Rugova today denied the existence of "the Defense Ministry  and other ministries of the Kosovo republic" and called [the  Serb claims of their existence] "a stage-managed political  process." He also denied the role of his close aide Anton  Koljaj in the group, which had been discovered recently, saying  that these "arrests were organized with the aim of discrediting  certain personalities and efforts for a peaceful resolution of  the Kosovo question."    Speaking about Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for a  summit  of leading European and U.S. statesmen [on Bosnia], Rugova said  that this was unnecessary and that "there can be no alternative  to a global approach to the resolution of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia."    "We do not want another Yalta and a reorganization of the  Balkans into spheres of interest; instead we advocate  integration processes," Rugova said, and added "Russia's role in  the Balkans cannot be one-sided, but it must be adapted to the  international community's principles."    Rugova welcomed the signing of the "Partnership" agreement  between Albanian President Sali Berisha and the NATO alliance,  describing it as "important for Albanian, all [ethnic]  Albanians, and for the whole of the Balkans."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- Visiting Niger President  Mahamane Ousmane said he is interested in agricultural  cooperation with Taiwan during a visit to the Council of  Agriculture (COA) Friday [3 Jun] morning.    Ousmane said he hoped Taiwan can assist Niger in developing  agricultural technology to promote the economic development and  improve people's living standard in his country.    Accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, Ousmane  was  received by COA Vice Chairman Wu Tong-chuan and heard a briefing  from Wu.    Ousmane is especially interested in Taiwan's cultivation of  sugar cane and fruits, preservation of water and soil resources,  and agricultural budget as well as the small-farm system which  Taiwan is developing.    Taiwan began to offer agricultural and medical assistance to  Niger two years ago to teach people there how to improve  planting of agricultural products. Ousmane also said he hoped  Taiwan can assist Niger in developing technology and education  in the future.    Earlier in the morning, Ousmane visited the Government  Information Office (GIO) and viewed the multimedia introduction  to the Republic of China [ROC]. He said he is impressed with  the vitality and spirit seen in Taiwan.    Ousmane said that the ROC should be allowed participation in  the United Nations and other international organizations. He  added that his visit aims to reaffirm Niger's support of the  ROC's UN bid.    Niger resumed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1992. Ousmane  is the first Niger president to visit Taipei. He was elected to  lead the West inland African country in 1993.    Ousmane arrived here Thursday for a six-day visit. He is  accompanied by Niger's Foreign and Cooperation Minister  Abdourahamane Hama, Trade, Transportation and Tourism Minister  Souley Abdoulaye, and other ranking officials.</p>

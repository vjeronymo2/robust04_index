The two presidents signed the Transfer of Convicted  Individuals Treaty, the Illegal Immigrants Agreement, and the  Complementary Protocol on the Legal Assistant and Mutual  Cooperation Agreement in Medellin. They also created the  Permanent Commission for the Demarcation of the  Colombian-Panamanian Border at the meeting. This commission will  hold its first technical meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota on 17 and  18 March.    In one of the paragraphs of the joint declaration, President  Gaviria reiterated his satisfaction with Panama's efforts for  the orderly transfer of the Panama Canal, which will occur on 31  December 1999, and the canal's administration. According to a  press note released by the Panamanian Presidency, the two  presidents expressed their firm conviction that a full and  participative democracy is the appropriate framework to meet the  people's needs. They also agreed that social development  programs strengthen democracy and that fighting poverty is a  priority.    An ANSA dispatch, datelined Medellin, reports that yesterday  Gaviria stressed the need for Colombia and Panama to consolidate  their integration and cooperation to fight drug trafficking  jointly. He maintained that "the big effort" the two countries  are making to confront drug trafficking would be greatly  rewarded "if we were able to strengthen coordination and  cooperation between our nations' authorities on a permanent  basis. Colombia and Panama have a great opportunity to fight  this scourge; we can do more to make this threat disappear  forever," Gaviria said at the opening of the fourth meeting of  the Colombian-Panamanian neighbors' commission.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of a Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Distributor and the Adviser will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Distributor and the Adviser at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Any Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of rule 12b&hyph;1 as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders of the Non-12b&hyph;1 class will not receive the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The directors of a Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning Plan Payments (including, in the case of 12b&hyph;1 Plans, expenditures relating to distribution) complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale (in the case of 12b&hyph;1 shares) or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution (in the case of 12b&hyph;1 shares) or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Dividends or other distributions paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be paid at the same dividend rate, except that any Plan Payments and other Class Expenses relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by the applicable class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset values, dividends, and distribution of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between those classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to applicants that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by a Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff, upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers, by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards that may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset values, dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in Condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in Condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The prospectus for each portfolio with more than one class will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares may receive different compensation for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another class in the same portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

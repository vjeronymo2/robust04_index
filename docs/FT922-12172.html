			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Midland investors may not keep HSBC bonds MANY OF the bonds which Hongkong and Shanghai Bank plans to issue as part of the consideration for the purchase of Midland Bank are likely to be dumped in the market soon after the takeover, Midland shareholders and bond market professionals said. If a substantial proportion of the bonds were to be sold by Midland shareholders, it would depress the price and could clog up the market in sterling subordinated bank debt, driving down the price of other bank paper. The bonds' estimated value will factor into institutions' calculations of the value of the bid for Midland by HSBC Holdings, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's parent. Taking the bonds at par value, the all-paper share and bond offer was worth 396p on Thursday, the most recent trading day in Hong Kong. Midland's share price languished on Thursday at 362p, indicating shareholder dissatisfaction with the offer's terms. M&amp;G, the unit trust group which owns around 6 per cent of Midland's shares, said last week it would be likely to sell the bonds quickly. 'There is not really a natural home for that (paper), particularly not with us,' M&amp;G said. Other UK institutions also said they did not normally hold subordinated debt issued by banks, and were unlikely to keep the bonds. HSBC has said it will issue between Pounds 352m-Pounds 704m of bonds, depending on the proportion of shares and bonds Midland shareholders elect to receive. Even the lower figure would amount to the largest-ever sterling bond issue by a bank. HSBC's advisers expect domestic UK investors to sell the bonds and foreign investors to buy. No decision has yet been taken on whether there will be advanced marketing of the bonds to potential overseas investors. The margin on the bonds, at 1.6 percentage point rounded up or down to the nearest  1/8 per cent, compares favourably with a margin of around 0.6 on similar paper issued by Barclays and National Westminster Bank. However, HSBC is considered a poorer credit, making it less attractive to investors. IBCA, the UK rating agency, said the bank's AA- grade was now under review and could fall if the Midland takeover is completed. Lex, Page 34</p>

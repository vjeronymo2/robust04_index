			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Books: Nostalgic for Keynes KEYNES IN THE 1990s: A RETURN TO ECONOMIC SANITY by Michael Stewart Penguin Pounds 5.99 It is hard to deny that 14 years of Conservative economic stewardship have produced disappointing results. The severity of the recession of the early 1980s can perhaps be explained by the inexperience of an incoming government and the numerous problems inherited from Labour. But Conservatives have few excuses for the dismal record of recent years: record trade deficits and double-digit inflation followed by deep recession, mass unemployment, an exploding public sector deficit and a humiliating exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. There are two ways of reacting to this record. Michael Stewart's conclusion is that the economic failures were inevitable. Twist and turn as they might, Conservative governments were doomed to fail because their approach was based on fundamental misconceptions about the way modern economies function. The cardinal error was to revert to an atavistic 19th century faith in the efficiency of market forces. This was the sheerest folly, argues Stewart, because in the 1930s John Maynard Keynes had shown beyond reasonable doubt that market economies are not self-stabilising. Governments must actively manage economic demand and the most reliable tool is fiscal policy. It is vain, moreover, to expect deregulation and privatisation to do much for the economy's supply-side. If productivity is to be improved, Britain must increase public investment substantially and expand the provision of government-funded vocational training. Stewart's timing is certainly excellent. Public disenchantment with market-oriented policies is growing. The Financial Times recently ran an editorial entitled 'Monetarism in retreat.' Many readers will find Stewart's arguments persuasive. Having read his rehash of Keynes's critique of classical economics, many will feel they at last understand what went wrong in the 1980s. But there is a second interpretation of recent events that Stewart does not consider: this is that the economic philosophy behind Conservative policies was broadly correct but that the implementation of the strategy left much to be desired. The most serious policy failure in the 1980s was macroeconomic: ministers allowed demand badly to outstrip supply in the late 1980s, leading to a resurgence of inflation and an unnecessarily deep recession. But this error owed much to policy disagreements within the government. Had either Lawson or Thatcher been able to follow their convictions the outcome would have been better. If Lawson had been able to put sterling into the ERM in 1985, Britain would have had an inflation anchor in place before encountering the storms of the late 1980s. But, ifAlan Walters had been Chancellor, domestic monetary policy would have been tightened sooner, achieving a similar result by different means. Stewart's curious belief that greater fiscal activism would have helped seems based on his view that Keynesian economics accounted for the 'golden era' of rapid growth between the 1940s and early 1970s. But this is a simplistic conclusion. In the first place, Britain did poorly during these years relative to countries such as Germany and Japan, where Keynesian doctrines were treated with greater scepticism. And many factors lay behind the global expansion, including extensive rebuilding after the second world war, the growth of world trade after autarchy in the 1930s and a secular rise in public spending as welfare states were extended. All this provided a tremendous boost, but it could not have persisted indefinitely, and the price in terms of steadily rising inflation was evident by the early 1970s. Would Keynesians have run fiscal policy sensibly in the past decade? It seems unlikely: with hindsight fiscal policy was too lax in the late 1980s but few, if any, Keynesians called for public spending cuts or sharp increases in taxation. On the other hand Keynesians were clamouring for a fiscal boost in the early 1980s, when it was not needed. Given the ever-present pressure for higher public spending, such a boost might have led to a decade of Italian-scale deficits and even greater structural fiscal problems. Stewart's nostalgia for the pre-Thatcher years is equally misplaced. Does he really think Britain would perform better today with a 1970s policy framework? That included a top personal tax rate of 98 per cent; bureaucratic controls on prices, wages, dividends and foreign exchange transactions; nationalisation of broad swathes of industry; and an array of special legal privileges for trade unions. The move toward greater reliance on market forces was a global phenomenon. In the past decade most industrial countries have pursued policies broadly similar to Britain's. The drive to reduce the growth of public spending was global as was the focus on improving incentives by cutting tax rates and deregulating industries. If Labour had retained power, it too would have pursued these policies; indeed much of Thatcherism was merely an embellishment of policies initiated by Denis Healey in the late 1970s. Stewart's philosophical arguments are sadly misguided. Keynes's theories were undoubtedly ingenious. But it is by no means clear that they amounted to a convincing refutation of classical economics. Fiscal policy can be important on occasion, but over the long haul individuals' propensity to work and save, and their willingness to embrace necessary economic change, are far more important determinants of growth. Few recent books have poked fun more effectively at Conservative chancellors but, coming from an economics don at London University, it is irresponsibly one-sided.</p>

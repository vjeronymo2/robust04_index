			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Banks seek early move on settlement BANKS SAID yesterday they would press for a rapid switch to the rolling settlement of share accounts within 10 days of trades after the collapse of the Stock Exchange's Taurus project for automated settlement. The British Bankers' Association said a decision to move to rolling settlement should be made before the Bank of England's task force on a Taurus replacement produces its full report at the end of June. Mr Brian Pitman, the association's vice-president, said a move to settlement within 10 days would benefit institutional investors and reduce the level of risk in the banking system created by the settling of accounts on set days. Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said banks were 'not comfortable with the bunching of risk and paper-shuffling that goes with account days'. He said banks and institutional investors would like a rapid move to rolling settlement. Although the Bank of England's task force is not due to report until June, Lord Inchyra said banks wanted an earlier decision to move to rolling settlement even if it was implemented only after a reasonable period of notice. The Stock Exchange said a decision on rolling settlement would have to be made by the Bank of England task force. It said it could not predict whether there would be any technical difficulties. The banks also said that a final decision on whether to alter the custom of banks answering inquiries about customers' accounts from other banks without seeking express consent would be made within 'a few months'. The association's officials have proposed a move to a new system under which banks would respond only to 'status inquiries' directly to third parties with the written consent of the customers involved.

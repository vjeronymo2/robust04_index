			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec advances 10% to Pounds 9.06m - Environmental fashion in US gives a leg-up to sports shoe group THE ENVIRONMENTAL look helped propel Hi-Tec Sports, the designer and distributor of sports shoes and leisure wear, to pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.06m, a rise of 10 per cent, for the year to February 2. Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, said the trend in US sports shoes was benefiting the group, which supplies a leading range of street hiking boots. 'They are walking around looking very green, as if they had just come off the nature trail,' he said. 'That has served us very well in the US.' Trading in the UK remained difficult, he said, citing the performance of Sears, one of the group's main customers. However, the group was optimistic and had 'budgeted for a healthy second half'. Mr van Wezel said the programme of widening the geographical spread had borne fruit, with turnover 7 per cent higher at Pounds 127.8m. 'The bad news from the UK was very much compensated by good news from North America,' he said. Operating profits in North America rose 53 per cent to Pounds 1.9m, while sales advanced 42 per cent to Pounds 22.6m. Trading in the UK suffered as Reebok and Nike dumped excess stock at lower prices. 'But we weathered the storm,' he said, 'and they cannot go on like that forever.' Sales in the UK fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 60.6m, while profits dropped almost 12 per cent to Pounds 6.9m. Mr Derek Watson, finance director, said that operational margins had been held at about 11 per cent. Bad Boys, the group's leisurewear division in continental Europe, and the newly acquired Labels business performed satisfactorily. Bad Boys increased profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.9m on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds 19.1m. The Pounds 10.3m rights issue in January brought debt down to Pounds 9.9m, reducing gearing from 79 per cent to 28 per cent. The final dividend is raised to 3.85p, for a total of 5.5p (5p). Earnings per share rose from 14.75p to 16.07p. COMMENT Hi-Tec carved itself a neat little niche in the middle-price sports shoe market, just in time to perform rather well through recession. Although it is tough in the UK at the moment, the effects of dumping by the big boys are expected to have been overcome by the second half. Assuming that sportswear remains fashionable, and that one believes research showing a global sports shoe market worth Pounds 9bn by 1995, then Hi-Tec looks well placed. The rights issue has left the group poised to expand in the fragmented continental market, and its brand name is about to get a pan-European boost from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. An acquisition is possible in the medium-term as it aims to get the clothing side up to about 35 per cent of turnover. Forecasts are for Pounds 11.2m pre-tax. The prospective p/e of about 11 leaves the shares looking good value.</p>

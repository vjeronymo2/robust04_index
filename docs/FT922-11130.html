			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Technology: Seven phone calls for the price of one How do you cut your phone bills in half - or by even more? One solution is voice compression technology, where several calls are squeezed down the equivalent of a single line. Johnson Matthey, the precious metals company, uses voice compression on two international links out of London. The calls are squeezed to occupy the equivalent of 16 kilobits of data - 64 Kbits are usually allocated to voice calls. As a result, says Dave Murphy, analyst in the telecoms group at Johnson Matthey, the company needs to use each of its eight leased transatlantic voice circuits for only five hours a week in order for them to cost the equivalent of the ordinary public telephone network. Johnson Matthey had tried to compress these calls down even further - to 8Kbits/s. However, reports Murphy, because the link has several connection points where the calls are converted between digital and analogue formats, the quality of the final call was too poor. On direct links, however, companies such as Newbridge Networks, of Newport, Gwent, and Craycom, of Frimley, Surrey, report a growing interest from companies for this 8 Kbit/s technology. 'You can get seven conversations for the price of one,' points out Barrie Desmond, marketing services manager at Newbridge in Wales. This customer demand has been fuelled by a loosening of the telecommunications regulations, enabling companies to use the technology on private networks. 'Typically 80 per cent of a company's traffic starts and ends within the company and with different sites,' points out Trevor Hall, senior marketing director at Craycom. Equipment from both Newbridge, at the high capacity end of the market, and Craycom, which sells equipment for smaller companies, uses technology which goes under the unusual name of codebook excited linear predictive - Celp. Celp works by predicting the next sounds. Then it takes the difference between the predicted and actual sounds and compares it with the common errors in its code book. It selects the one which most resembles the actual error and transmits an abbreviated code for this pattern - rather than the error itself.</p>

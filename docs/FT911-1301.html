			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (6): Gold loses its glitter - Mining is no longer the bulwark it was THE declining fortune of the gold mining industry, suffering the worst crisis in its history, dominates the local mining scene. The recent decision by Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor mining house, to close the Stilfontein mine was both a symbol of hard times and a gloomy portent of the considerable hardship that lies ahead. Closing a mine is, ultimately, inevitable. But as Mr Gary Maude, Gengold's managing director, pointed out, the difference with Stilfontein was that it was not 'mined out' when closure was announced. It had a large, coherent body of reef which could profitably have been mined at the real gold price of five years ago. Mr Maude predicts, and industry opinion agrees, that Stilfontein is only the first of a number of such mines which will have to close. The broad figures bear him out. At a gold price of R933 per ounce*, an estimated 40 per cent of the country's gold is produced at a loss and 45 per cent of the industry's labour force, or about 190,000 men, works on mines unable to make a profit. The industry is no longer the bulwark of the domestic economy. Tax receipts from gold fell from 10.7 per cent of state revenue in 1981/2 to 0.9 per cent in 1990/91 and its contribution to GDP was down to 8.8 per cent in 1990. Where its influence remains pronounced is on the export front - last year it accounted for 25 per cent of the country's exports. however, the industry's troubles have wide ramifications, particularly in the labour market. Approximately 40,000 workers lost their jobs last year and that figure is expected to be repeated in 1991. Some see this as a pretext for state intervention. The root cause of the industry's difficulties is a relentless cost-price squeeze. The last three years have seen revenues flat at about R990/oz. Costs, however, have been rising inexorably at an inflation rate of about 14 per cent per annum. Result? A decline of at least 36 per cent in the real rate of return over three years. Producers' attention is obviously focused on what steps can be taken to remain profitable. The main response has been a much greater focus on mining where grades are higher, and returns better. Labour has been shed on a vast scale. In truth, no strategy which might prolong the life of a marginal (low return) mine has gone unexamined. A worrying, if inevitable, feature of the present time is the declining exploration effort. The industry mines about 100m tonnes a year, but new mines are not being opened to provide the replacement tonnage. Most of South Africa's better prospects are very deep mines which would cost about R3bn to start. Analysts reckon the gold price will have to double before such projects would be viable. Gold's shrinking importance is shown by the fact that 1989 was the first year in which profits from mining activities in South Africa, other than gold, exceeded profits from gold. Also revealing is that in the year to March 1990, 9.7 per cent of equity accounted earnings at Anglo American, the country's largest mining house, came from platinum, with gold only slightly higher at 11.9 per cent. Although the platinum sector is having to deal with a fairly depressed price, down from a high in February last year of Dollars 525/oz to around Dollars 400 now, the price of rhodium - an important by-product of platinum mining - has quadrupled in two years to current levels of about Dollars 5,300/oz. This is a function of the increasing demand for the metal in car exhaust catalysts as emissions standards are tightened. The buoyant price has boosted the profits of South Africa's mines, which produce about 75 per cent of the world's platinum, although the price of producing more rhodium is more platinum, a fact that contributes to a perception of oversupply which puts a cap on the platinum price. Bolstering this perception is the expansion plans South African producers have announced which, if implemented, would add a million ounces a year to the approximately 2.8m ounces the country produced in 1990. The biggest talking point in the industry at the moment is the future of the ailing Crocodile River mine, managed by Barmines, the platinum arm of the Rand Mines group. The mine is estimated to need R350-400m to develop its underground operations, money which could not be raised easily or cheaply through a rights issue. Barmines recently held unsuccessful discussions on the matter with Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, and has now moved on to talking to Genmin, the mining arm of Gencor. The outlook for coal, South Africa's second largest export earner after gold with revenues of R3.52bn last year, is modest. Demand on the domestic market is weak as a result of the recession. The export market offers hope, at least for better prices if not volumes. With sanctions crumbling, the Dollars 3-5/tonne political discount on South African coal has started to erode. Contracts with European customers for 1991 included price increases, considered very satisfactory, of 3-8 per cent. The country had lost about 25 per cent of its export markets in 1986 when major markets like the US, France and Denmark were closed to it. South Africa will not find returning to these markets easy, as producers like Colombia and Venezuela have become a force since it left. There are also infrastructural constraints. More than 90 per cent of the country's exports go through the Richard's Bay terminal on the east coast, which has a nominal capacity of 44m tonnes, currently being extended to 53m. Even if South Africa had more capacity, it is by no means clear world markets could absorb this and sustain the price. South Africa is also one of the world's big diamond producers and De Beers, continues to dominate the world diamond market. Attributable profits dropped 16 per cent down to Dollars 911m in 1990 because of recessionary conditions. *The real gold price is subject to exchange rate fluctuations as well as international price swings: R933 would be Dollars 345-360.</p>

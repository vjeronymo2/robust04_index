			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GEORGIA GULF TO FIGHT TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Georgia Gulf Corp., moving ahead with a plan to avoid a hostile takeover bid by  Texas investor Harold Simmons, filed today for permission to offer $200 million  in notes to investors to back its recapitalization proposal.  </P> <P> The Atlanta-based chemicals producer previously said its board of directors  would make a decision on the $1.1-billion, or $45-a-share, unsolicited offer by  Feb. 16.  </P> <P> Until then, it advised shareholders not to tender their shares in the hope of  gaining support for its previously announced recapitalization plan.  </P> <P> Simmons' NL Industries Inc., a Houston-based specialty chemicals company, has a  9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf and recently announced the $45-a-share offer.  </P> <P> Georgia Gulf is hoping that a recapitalization will discourage Simmons'  overtures. The company has valued the recapitalization plan at $55 a share, but  Wall Street analysts value the plan at $45 to $50 a share.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Georgia Gulf set April 19 as the date for a shareholders  meeting at which a vote will be taken on its plan.  </P></p>

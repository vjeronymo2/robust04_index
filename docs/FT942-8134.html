			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Do not write off Bordeaux '93s - Edmund Penning-Rowsell finds that strict selection has produced some better-than-expected wines Much of last year's summer was disappointing in Bordeaux, but a hot, dry August and early September brought hopes of a fine 1993 vintage. These were washed out by the rain that began as the picking started, around September 20, and continued irregularly to the end. So, 1993 was dismissed initially as the third disappointing claret vintage in a row. But late hot weather improved a fair proportion of the grapes, particularly the earlier-ripening Merlots, and thickened the skins. This, plus cool weather throughout the harvest, prevented rot developing. Nevertheless, only where strict selection was employed from the vineyard to the fermentation vats - often 'bled' (seignee) to reduce the proportion of juice to skin - was success achieved, producing deep-coloured, well-balanced and medium-weight wines for early drinking. There is more to them than the not-to-be despised '92s. Special care was also required in the assemblage - the choice of vats for inclusion in each chateau's grand vin, and the proportion of each grape variety to be used. At Ch Margaux, only 47 per cent of a below-average yield went into the grand vin. This blending begins in November and usually finishes by February. This enables the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux to organise tastings for its 115 members at the end of March for the Bordeaux trade, and in the first week of April for groups of international wine writers. The first growths and three leading seconds - Cos d'Estournel, Ducru-Beaucaillou and Leoville-Las-Cases - are not union members, partly because they expect their wines to be tasted in their own cellars. Thanks to Bruno Prats of Cos d'Estournel, who arranged most of my visits, and Peter Sichel, a former union president who provided accommodation at Angludet, I was able to preface these in advance of the three days of union tastings in the Medoc, Graves and Pomerol. Of the first growths, my favourite was Margaux, followed closely by Haut-Brion - the former dense-coloured with a fine, elegant nose and fruity, well-balanced, long flavour; the latter with very big colour and an austere but distinguished nose. Although not big, it was well-balanced, with some tannin evident. Latour, meanwhile, was typical Pauillac, a big wine with fine colour but a rather closed nose and plenty of body. I found Mouton-Rothschild and Lafite difficult to taste as both, particularly the Mouton, were very closed. The former seemed lighter than I expected but had a long flavour, while the Lafite was encouragingly concentrated. At the end of the union tastings, the '93 was sampled at Cheval-Blanc. Purple, with a rich nose, it had a typical richness but, perhaps, lighter flavour than in the greater vintages. The union's tastings were divided into four groups of approximately nine members and they were held in four different chateaux in each district. In our group, unfortunately, the wines in the first of two Medoc tastings - from Listrac to Margaux and St Julien to St Estephe - were shown in a very cold chai, and again in the St Emilion-Pomerol one. This flattened the aromas and led to a good deal of hand-warming of wine in glasses. But elsewhere it was easier. Overall, the greater maturity of the Merlots is likely to have favoured St Emilion and Pomerol. Below is a list of those wines that appealed to me, with the particularly attractive starred. Listrac: Clarke. Moulis: Chasse-Spleen*, Poujeaux. Haut-Medoc: Cantemerle*, Citran, Dauzac. Margaux, Cantenac: Angludet*, Palmer, Le Prieure, Siran St Julien: Beychevelle, Ducru-Beaucaillou, Gruaud-Larose, Langoa-Barton*, Leoville-Barton, Leoville-Las-Cases, Leoville-Poyferre, Clos du Marquis. Pauillac: Clerc-Milon, Haut-Batailley, Pichon-Lalande*, Pontet-Canet. St Estephe: Cos d'Estournel, Montrose, Ormes de Pez, Phelan-Segur. Graves (red): La Chapelle de La Mission-Haut-Brion (2nd wine), Dom de Chevalier, Fieuzal, Haut-Bailly*, Larrivat-Haut-Brion, de France, Olivier. Graves (white): Carbonnieux, Dom. de Chevalier, de France, Olivier, Pape Clement*. (Generally a good year for dry whites, picked before the rain, but disastrous for the sweet wines.) St Emilion: Angelus*, Figeac, Grand Mayne, Larmande, Pavie-Decesse, Troplong-Mondot. Pomerol: La Conseillante, La Fleur-Petrus, Gazin* Petit-Village, La Pointe, Latour-a-Pomerol, Trotanoy*, Vieuz Ch. Certan*. The Bordeaux trade in its fine wines is now notably better than last year, but cash deficiency will lead to more en primeur offers than at any time since 1990. Should one buy? For those able to decorate their cellars or reserves, the first growths and top seconds are probably good gastronomic (if not financial) speculations. The firsts that came out at FFr155 a bottle are still a long way below the 1989s originally at FFr230; Haut-Brion and Margaux sold all the '93 they offered and could have sold much more. The leading seconds and their peers opened at FFr70. In this irregular vintage, though, it might be better to wait until the lesser classed-growths are in bottle - especially those picked out by the traditional merchants who specialise in them and can, if necessary, keep them. Yet, there is a case for buying minor growths selected as 'opening offers'; they should make attractive early drinking. When sold out initially, they will not re-appear on lists. Unquestionably, the heavens owe us a fine vintage this year. Meanwhile, the heads of Bordeaux University's institute of oenology, professors Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau, say in their annual report that, providing overall selection was maintained, 'one can be thoroughly optimistic over the quality of the 1993 red vintage'.</p>

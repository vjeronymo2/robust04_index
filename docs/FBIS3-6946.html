The country's Muslims and Croats have signed a pact creating a  new federation within the former Yugoslav Republic. The Bosnian  Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia, refused to be in on the  deal. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says  peace cannot be fully restored without the active participation  of the Serbs. Senator Evans said Australia hoped the Serbs  would join the Croats and Muslims in concluding a comprehensive  agreement to settle the conflict in Bosnia.</p>

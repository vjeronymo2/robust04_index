			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V. Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] Inhabitants of the southern Kuril Islands have sent  telegrams to the Russian president, the Federal Assembly, and  the oblast governor outlining their disastrous economic  situation. A particularly tense situation has developed at the  Yuzhno-Kurilsk fish processing combine -- Kunashir Island's  basic enterprise. High prices and astronomic transport costs  have made Kuril goods completely uncompetitive. The fish  processing workers expressed a negative attitude towards the  Federal Kuril Islands Development Program. The Yuzhno-Kurilsk  fish processing combine strike committee, in signing the  telegrams, warns that there is a developing opinion among the  people driven to despair about the expediency of the Kurils'  secession from Sakhalin Oblast.    True, the strike committee did not elaborate further as to  what the independent islands are going to do and whether this  will help to improve the lives of the Kuril people. However,  this is just another indication that neglect of the outlying  regions' interests by the federal authorities could lead to an  upset of stability in Russia's Far East. The meeting of the  Russian Federation Government Commission for Operational Issues,  on 25 May, noted the danger of the Maritime Kray's economic  separation from Russia. This is further exacerbated by the  critical social and economic processes in the Maritime Kray and  the demographic pressures from neighboring China. As a  countermeasure, it was proposed to form a commission to prepare  proposals on the stabilization of the situation in the region  and prospects for its development in the context of Russia's  geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific region -- this is a  quote. This is how they express alarm in Moscow over the fate  of far eastern Russia -- mostly through lip service.</p>

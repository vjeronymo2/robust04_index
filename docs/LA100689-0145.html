			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> KENNEDY TOPS BOLSA GRANDE BY CAPITALIZING ON TURNOVERS  </P> <P> Kennedy High School, taking advantage of several turnovers, defeated Bolsa  Grande, 23-10, in Garden Grove League play before 200 Thursday night at Bolsa  Grande.  </P> <P> After a less-than-stellar performance against Rancho Alamitos last week,  Kennedy (2-3, 1-1) made amends by holding Bolsa Grande (2-3, 1-1) to seven  yards rushing and 64 total yards in the first half, intercepting Bolsa  quarterback Sonny Nguyen twice and recovering four of five Bolsa Grande  fumbles.  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish amassed 197 yards in the first half, 124 on the ground.  </P> <P> "That was the whole difference in the ball game," Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson  said. "They gave us the ball a lot and we played a pretty good game. The kids  were fired up. They played tough and were able to capitalize."  </P> <P> Kennedy scored in two plays after Jason Mehr recovered Bolsa Grande's first  fumble at the Matador 15. Vince Church got all 15 yards. He scored on an  eight-yard run to put Kennedy ahead, 7-0, late in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Kennedy went ahead, 14-3, after quarterback Russ Clark, who completed 10 of 17  passes for 104 yards and an interception, broke away for a 65-yard touchdown  run off a busted play. On third down, Clark dropped back to pass from his 35  but his receivers were covered. He was chased out of the pocket, and scrambled  to the sideline before outrunning the Bolsa Grande defense to the end zone.  Clark ended up with 80 yards in six carries. Church carried 16 times for 45  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Kennedy scored once more in the half, again with help from Bolsa Grande.  Matador quarterback Nguyen fumbled the ball out of his end zone for a safety  and Kennedy took a 16-3 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Bolsa's smaller line had trouble running against Kennedy's size. Fighting Irish  linebacker Keith Sewell, who last week set a school record with 30 tackles, was  one of the main reasons for the Matadors' troubles.  </P> <P> Nguyen mounted a drive early in the second quarter moving the Matadors from  their 34 to the Kennedy 5. Key plays included a 19-yard completion to Jim  Hanson and a 19-yard run by Carlos Torres. A pitch to Torres appeared to be a  touchdown but the play was called back on a 15-yard illegal blocking penalty by  Bolsa Grande. The Matadors settled for a 27-yard field goal by Nguyen.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Nguyen and Torres missed the connection on a handoff,  setting up the third Kennedy score off a fumble. The Fighting Irish recovered  at Bolsa Grande's 44 and eventually scored on Church's one-yard run for a 23-3  lead.  </P> <P> Bolsa had an opportunity to score late in the fourth after Nguyen's 43-yard  completion to Trent Wood (seven catches, 108 yards) moved the Matadors to the  Fighting Irish 17, but Marvin Dayao picked off Nguyen's next pass.  </P> <P> With about a minute remaining, Bolsa finally made it into the end zone when  Raul DeHesa returned a kickoff 68 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Nguyen completed 12 of 27 passes for 149 yards and two interceptions.  </P></p>

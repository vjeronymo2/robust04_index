			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Monopolies body clears ice cream makers Britain's leading ice cream manufacturers were yesterday cleared of anti-competitive distribution practices by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission said the practice of supplying freezers free to shops on condition they were not used to stock ice cream from other suppliers did not operate against the public interest. Nor was it convinced that consumer choice 'would be significantly improved were exclusivity to be ended'. A nine-month inquiry into the supply of 'impulse ice creams' - bought for immediate consumption - concluded there was no evidence of excessive prices or excessive profits being made as a result of freezer exclusivity. The decision could bring the UK competition authorities into conflict with Brussels where the European Commission is also examining the issue. It indicated recently that it regards freezer exclusivity as a serious barrier to market entry. The MMC report was welcomed by Birds Eye Walls, the UK ice cream subsidiary of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. The company has over half the total UK impulse market valued at Pounds 275m in 1992. It said the report was a 'clear vindication' of its policy of pursuing freezer exclusivity. The report's conclusions were condemned by Mars, the US food products group, which wants the practice outlawed. Mars, which has achieved 16 per cent of the UK impulse market since entering the ice cream business in 1989, said the report 'protects Wall's existing and profitable exclusive distribution arrangements'. The MMC was also criticised by the Consumers' Association for a 'muddle-headed and misguided report'. Clash with EU looms, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

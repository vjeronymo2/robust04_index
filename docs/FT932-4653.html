			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tully to be new head of Merrill Lynch MERRILL Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, confirmed yesterday that Mr Daniel Tully, president and chief executive, will replace Mr William Schreyer as chairman at the end of this month, when Mr Schreyer retires. The rise of Mr Tully was expected - when he was appointed chief executive in May 1992, the firm indicated that Mr Tully would eventually take over from Mr Schreyer as chairman. Yesterday's announcement, however, leaves open who is to succeed Mr Tully. Among possible candidates for the top post are Mr John Steffens, head of the firm's individual investor business, Mr Herbert Allison, head of the investment banking operations, and Mr David Komansky, who is in charge of Merrill's debt and equity markets business. Alliance Communications has filed a preliminary prospectus with Canadian securities regulators for a public offering of common shares, Reuter reports from Toronto. The issue is being underwritten by Midland Walwyn Capital, Wood Gundy, Gordon Capital Corp and Marleau Lemire Securities.</p>

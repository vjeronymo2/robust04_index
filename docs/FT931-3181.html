			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Stamp duty and tax relief  -Housing THE chancellor announced two measures which would affect the housing market. Stamp duty threshold on new house purchases will be raised to Pounds 60,000 from Pounds 30,000 with immediate effect, in an effort to stimulate the bottom end of the housing market. The cost of buying homes priced at between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000 will be reduced by up to Pounds 600. Mr Lamont announced that the rate at which mortgage interest tax relief at source will be given will be restricted to 20 per cent. That change would not be introduced until April 1994. At 7.99 per cent interest rates, the change will cost Pounds 2.50 a month on a Pounds 10,000 loan and Pounds 9.98 on Pounds 40,000. Elderly people with life annuity home income plan schemes which allow them to draw down some of the savings invested in their houses will continue to attract relief at 25 per cent. Mr Ian Darby at John Charcol, mortgage brokers, said his reaction to the proposals for the housing market was mixed. 'Raising the threshold on stamp duty should be beneficial for the first time buyers market but the erosion of Miras, even though at today's interest rates it means no more than a loss of Pounds 10 a month, will take it a step back.' He was disappointed too that there was no mention of a base rate cut to help the market.</p>

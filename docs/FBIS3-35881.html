			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Everybody Can Understand </F> Kozyrev's Speech as They Please"]    [Text] Riga, 20 Jan -- Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs  told DIENA today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  received a copy of the speech by Russian Foreign Affairs  Minister Andrey Kozyrev [advocating the retention of Russian  troops on the territory of the former USSR]. G. Andrejevs  pointed out that this is "a speech that was thought over with  great care so as to please everyone." Still, it has no direct  link with the Baltic states and everybody can interpret it as  they please.    DIENA also interviewed leaders of several parliament  factions, with the aim of discerning prevailing opinions in the  Latvian parliament.    Edvins Kide (Unity for Latvia) told DIENA that Kozyrev's  statement was dictated by the existing state of affairs, because  "Kozyrev has to show sternness to keep his post." As E. Kide  saw things, the speech could also be explained by pressure from  the Russian Liberal Democratic Party on foreign policy.    Aleksandrs Kirsteins (LNNK) [Movement for Latvia's National  Independence] told DIENA he would not pay much attention to what  Kozyrev is saying because "at the moment, Russia has no  government." In his opinion, A. Kozyrev is keen to keep his post  in the Russian Government. A. Kirsteins was more impressed by  DIENA's interview with Russian Ambassador to the United States  Vladimir Lukin, a deputy to the State Council from the  Javlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc. The leader of the LNNK faction  believes that the standpoints of Latvia and Russia could come  closer together if Lukin became chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Commission in the Russian parliament.    Filips Strogonovs (Equal Rights) told DIENA that Kozyrev's  speech could be regarded from two points of view. He recalled  that about 700,000 inhabitants of Latvia lack citizenship. "This  gives Russia cause to speak in the name of these 700,000," said  F. Strogonovs. Therefore, he thinks, it is important to resolve  the problem of citizenship. On the other hand, the Russian  geopolitical interests mentioned by Kozyrev are ungrounded  because they reflect only Russian political ambition. "Our  standpoint in this matter is the following: Latvia is an  independent sovereign state, but we should not give cause, by  way our policies, for other countries to interfere in our  internal affairs," said F. Strogonovs.    Aivars Kreituss (faction of the Democratic Party) confessed  to DIENA that on the one hand, Kozyrev's utterances should not  be treated seriously. He also saw the willingness of the  Russian foreign affairs minister to obtain an important post.  On the other hand, emphasized A. Kreituss, it is necessary to  put in order and ensure Latvia's defense. "We should find twice  as much money for its needs, at least to provide it with  ammunition," said Kreituss.    Maris Grinblats (Fatherland and Freedom) expressed his view  to DIENA that A. Kozyrev's speech is somehow linked with the  considerable influence of communists and liberal democrats in  the Russian parliament. M. Grinblats concluded that Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, as well as A. Kozyrev, are more  inclined in the direction of these forces, to amortize the  position of the more aggressive part of society. M. Grinblats  said the policy of Russia during the last years indicates  nonetheless, that the administration of B. Yeltsin prefers  economic methods to keep the Baltic states in Russia's sphere of  influence, rather than strictly military pressure.    The leader of the Latvia's Way faction, Andrejs Pantelejevs,  expressed his opinion to DIENA very laconically: "At the  moment, we do not have sufficient information; it would be  tragic if this statement was connected with the Clinton and  Yeltsin summit; but it is not tragic if it is just a  misunderstanding."    Aida Predele (Union of Christian Democrats), in speaking to  DIENA, deemed the statement by the Russian foreign minister as a  high-level provocation.</p>

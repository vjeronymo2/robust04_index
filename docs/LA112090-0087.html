			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> New Rumors on the Block: Is Tiffany going to turn out to be the Yoko Ono of the  '90s? The Boston Herald reports that the teen singing queen is involved with  Jonathan Knight, 21, of New Kids on the Block, and the other New Kids want him  to break it off with her because their fans want them romantically unattached.  "His fellow band members have told him bluntly that if he continues with the  romance, his career could be over -- as well as Tiffany's and the rest of the  New Kids," the Herald quoted an insider as saying.  </P> <P> Knight is quoted as saying: "I love Tiffany a hell of a lot more than I love  the New Kids on the Block. I don't want to break up the group but if they don't  leave me and Tiffany alone, I will." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

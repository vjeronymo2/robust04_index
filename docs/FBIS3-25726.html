			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Mohamed Abshir, leader of  the Democratic Front for the Salvation of Somalia, has said that  Egypt under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak plays an  active role in helping Somalia to achieve national  reconciliation, restore peace, and establish a provisional  government. He expressed his hope that Egypt will continue its  support for the Somali nation because it will pass through a  critical stage in the future after the U.S. and European forces  have withdrawn on 21 March. [passage omitted]    He addressed a message to General Aidid in which he said  that  the various factions welcome his participation in the Cairo  meeting and his participation in the dialogue under the auspices  of President Mubarak. Abshir also expressed the factions'  willingness to forget the past and cooperate with him for the  sake of the Somali people interest to restore stability,  establish a central authority, help Somalia restore its  credibility, and renounce violence to find a peaceful and  Islamic solution.    He stressed the need for Aidid to take this historic  opportunity, face the challenge, and prove to the world that the  Somalis can rearrange the house from within. He noted that the  main obstacle to the implementation of the Addis Ababa Accord  lies in the stance of General Aidid himself. Aidid, he said,  claims that he controls most of the Somali local and regional  councils and administrations, although he does not enjoy a  popular consensus and does not form a majority at all.    He said the Somali problem now centers on personal interests  and a power struggle. He added that Aidid's group, which  consists of only three of the 15 factions, have killed  approximately 400,000 Somalis either by fire or by preventing  food aid from reaching the needy over the last three years.    On charges that the United Nations caused the war in  Somalia,  Abshir said the international organization has exerted effective  efforts to find a solution to the Somali problem and provided  humanitarian and food aid. He noted that it is General Aidid  who is responsible for disseminating these accusations in which  Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan support him. Sudan, he said, fears  that the U.S. forces may move into south Sudan from the Somali  territories. Sudan has invited General Aidid and granted him  about a half million dollars to support the tribal war in  Somalia.    Abshir noted the need for the presence of Arab forces to  rebuild Somalia and set up a police force to confront these  problems and control the arms of the warring factions.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WIC to cut interests in regional brewers THE WHITBREAD Investment Company, an investment trust 49.9 per cent-owned by Whitbread, yesterday said it was reducing its shareholdings in other brewers to below 15 per cent. However, Mr Robin Farrington, WIC's chairman, told shareholders at the annual general meeting that it would, where possible, try not to sell stakes to potential hostile bidders. Its decision to reduce its holdings in regional brewers - to comply with the government's beer orders - triggered the Pounds 101.3m hostile bid from Greene King, the south of England's largest regional brewer, for Morland, its Oxfordshire-based rival. WIC was Morland's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 per cent holding. It is selling a 28.5 per cent stake to Greene King for Pounds 27.23m cash and has agreed to accept the offer for its remaining 14.9 per cent if there is no higher bidder. Greene King's bid received a boost from Barclays de Zoete Wedd research yesterday which recommended acceptance of the offer, describing it as 'generous'. Speculation has surrounded the future of Marston, in which WIC holds 31.5 per cent. Mr Farrington said WIC wanted to divest part of its shareholding in a manner which was 'preferably recommended by the board concerned'. WIC also holds 20.7 per cent of the Boddington group and 14.9 per cent of Devenish. In addition, Whitbread plc holds 5.9 per cent of Marston and 5.6 per cent of Boddington, which holds 20 per cent of Devenish. If the shareholdings had remained unchanged, Whitbread would have had to free another 1,000 pubs. The government is forcing all brewers owning more than 2,000 pubs to release the tie on half of those outlets in excess of that number by December. If a brewer has a 15 per cent holding in a rival then those pubs are also included in the total.</p>

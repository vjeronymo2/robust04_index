			<p>BFN     [Text] As we have already reported in our previous  bulletins, the National Council of the Slovak Republic today  rejected the so-called road sign bill initiated by the  government. According to Deputy Speaker Peter Weiss, it was  shown that extremists on both sides were incapable of reaching a  compromise agreement. He went on to remark that the bill had  taken into account all of the most important amendments,  including those made by the opposition.    Tibor Cabaj, deputy for the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia, said that sound reason had prevailed. According to  him, the bill had not been well prepared, and, when amendments  that had been submitted to improve it had failed to be  incorporated, the way the opposition would vote had been quite  clear. On the other hand, Vladimir Miskovsky, deputy for the  National Democratic Party, was of the opinion that the  amendments submitted had improved the bill to such an extent  that it ought to have accommodated all tolerant people, both the  Hungarian minority and the Slovaks living in the south of the  country. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Movement, saw the reason for the rejection of the bill in the  fact that towns named after important Slovak figures had been  excluded from the requirement to display bilingual signs. Pal  Csaky, deputy for the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement-Coexistence, commented on the rejection of the bill by  saying that the matter was serious and that the party would draw  conclusions from the breaking of the coalition agreement. Arpad  Duka Zolyomi, representing the same party, had envisaged that  the coalition partners would ensure the implementation of the  agreement reached in the coalition council. He said that it  would obviously be necessary to hold discussions about further  cooperation.</p>

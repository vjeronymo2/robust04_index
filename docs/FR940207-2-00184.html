			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief is necessary to permit the deduction from the Separate Account of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act, as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than the sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants submit that the Company is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks, and represent that the charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity contracts. Applicants state that these representations are based upon an analysis of the mortality risks, taking into consideration such factors as: the guaranteed annuity purchase rates; the expense risks, taking into account the existence of charges against Separate Account assets for other than mortality and expense risks; the estimated costs, now and in the future, for certain product features; and industry practice with respect to comparable variable annuity contracts. The Company will maintain at its principal office, and make available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed and the methodology and results of this analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants acknowledge that the CDSC may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts, and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. In such circumstances a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by the Company at its principal office and will be available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in underlying mutual funds that undertake, in the event they adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by a board of directors or board of trustees, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such funds within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard, Applicants assert that the exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the policies and purposes of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Sales fears depress Ratners shares: Jewellery retailer may have to renegotiate its banking covenants Executives at Ratners Group accept they will almost certainly have to renegotiate the jewellery retailer's banking covenants this week following weak Christmas trading. However, analysts increasingly took the view yesterday that fears of a financial meltdown at the group had been wildly exaggerated. After initially falling to 18p yesterday, the Ratners shares recovered to close at 21 1/2 p, a net  1/2 p down on the day. 'We do not believe at this stage that there is a fundamental risk of the company going under but the shares will continue to look vulnerable until we know what, if any, restructuring is going to take place,' said Mr Quintin Price, retail analyst at James Capel, the stockbrokers. The Ratners board met all day yesterday to review the Christmas trading performance and the company will issue a statement on its prospects on Friday. The company declined to comment before the announcement other than to dispel suggestions that its 1,000 store managers were holding a crisis meeting. Ratners has suffered from poor levels of demand this Christmas in the UK and the US, where it runs the second-biggest jewellery chain. The company's extensive discounting campaigns - in addition to its normal rash of promotions - suggests it was trying to liquidate stocks and was running the business for cash to prevent its borrowings running out of control. Although this may have helped prevent a drastic fall in volume sales it will have eroded margins. James Capel estimated a total pre-tax loss for the year of Pounds 35m - although this includes Pounds 12m in exceptional costs relating to an anticipated rationalisation programme. Trade in the US was also badly hit by low consumer confidence and difficulties at Zale, the biggest jewellery chain in the US. Officials at Sterling, the Ratners US business, would not comment on Christmas sales but the performance of other US retailers in December gives little cause for hope. Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery retailer, saw its US retail sales slide 3 per cent from a weak Christmas a year earlier. The whole North American jewellery industry is in disarray as it waits for Zale to implement a reorganisation or file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 'When the largest company in any industry is in Zale's position, it adversely impacts the whole industry,' said Mr Dick Miller, chief financial officer at Sterling. 'We don't relish that Zale is in trouble, but in the longer term we should benefit from this.' In spite of these worries, the principal bankers for Ratners, Barclays and Midland, seem to be taking a fairly relaxed view of the situation and are making no move ahead of the trading statement. One banker said: 'Ratners may break a banking covenant. But that in itself is no reason to panic. What we have to assess is how much cash the business is generating and is capable of generating. Only then will we need to discuss whether its debt has to be restructured. There has to be a serious possibility that Gerald Ratner will give up either his role of chairman or chief executive.' Analysts estimated the Ratners bank debts were about Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m although much of this was spread among several US institutions. Mr John Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest, brokers for Ratners, said: 'The bankers will want to talk to the company but there is no immediate financial crisis or a need for a restructuring. Ratners does not have to go to its banks and say 'we need some more money'.' The company will come under pressure, however, to provide further details of its future strategy including any attempts to sell assets or close outlets. The company may also be forced to tidy up its debt structure; it has five different types of preference shares in issue. 'I think that there may well be some kind of boring financial restructuring: maybe paying off the preference shareholders and converting their holdings into ordinary shares,' said one analyst. Jewellery manufacturers will also keenly await developments at Ratners, which controls more than 30 per cent of jewellery sales in the UK. Shares in Abbeycrest, one of its biggest suppliers, fell 14p to 78p. According to Mr Patrick Fuller, chairman of the British Jewellers' Association, the trade group, Mr Ratner is respected for what he has achieved in the jewellery business, but not particularly liked. The association's main criticism is that Ratners has been very aggressive in its buying, using its dominant position to dictate onerous terms to suppliers, many of which are relatively small companies. Mr Fuller said Ratners did not place firm orders, but gave manufacturers 'estimated requirements' - allowing Ratners to return the goods if they did not sell. Ratners refused to confirm it took goods on such a 'sale-or-return' basis, saying it did not discuss its commercial relationship with suppliers. In 1990, Ratners antagonised many suppliers by returning large amounts of stock during October and November. Mr Fuller said manufacturers kept their factories going all the year round, but made most of their profits in the last quarter of the year, so it was infuriating for them to have goods returned which they had supplied a few months earlier. Mr Fuller said: 'He got away with it once, but a lot of the bigger companies got together and said they were not prepared to deal with him again on that basis, so he had to change.' Excalibur, a quoted jewellery manufacturer, said it had been given a written assurance before Christmas that Ratners would not return any stock. If such assurances were widespread it helps explain the group's frantic price-cutting over Christmas.</p>

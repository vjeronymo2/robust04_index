"I do not expect the legislation to be voted down," Ichiro  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  said at a news conference, referring to the voting on the reform  bills at a House of Councillors plenary session expected later  this week.    Ozawa said most people must long for the enactment of  political reforms in the current extraordinary Diet session,  which ends January 29.    On possible talks between the ruling coalition and the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to seek a compromise  on the final shape of the reform legislation, he said the LDP  should prepare its own compromise plan before seeking  negotiations with the coalition.    "Discussion for modifications should be premised on the  LDP's  pledge to achieve reform during the current Diet sitting and its  presentation of specific areas for possible fine-tuning," he  said.    The government package, featuring a rearrangement of the  electoral system for the House of Representatives and stricter  curbs on campaign funding, cleared the lower house in  mid-November.    Hosokawa has vowed to achieve political reform by the close  of the current Diet session.    Obstacles to passage of the bills remain, however, with some  upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan]  the largest force in the ruling coalition, opposed to certain  aspects of the package.    Ozawa, a former LDP secretary general, is said to have  masterminded the formation of the seven-party coalition last  August after he and his followers quit the LDP and inaugurated  Shinseito in June.    He said he believes additional pump-priming measures and  administrative reform will be two major tasks for the Hosokawa  government in the event of passage of the political reform  package.    Monday's news conference was Ozawa's first in about two  months. He had refused to speak to the media on the grounds that  two national dailies carried inaccurate reports of his press  conferences.</p>

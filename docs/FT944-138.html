			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Engineer of the electronic era: Bill Gates, chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, is the FT's Man of the Year. He talks to Louise Kehoe about his vision When Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Microsoft in 1975, their slogan was: 'A personal computer on every desk and in every home.' At the time, it was an outrageously ambitious proposition, since the personal computer was little more than a toy for computer hobbyists. Today, however, that vision is rapidly approaching reality, with more than 45m PCs sold worldwide this year alone. The vast majority of those PCs run Microsoft software programs such as the Windows operating system and applications like Word and Excel, the spreadsheet. This has made the company - based at Redmond, near Seattle in the north-west Pacific state of Washington - by far the largest software publisher in the world, with revenues of Dollars 4.65bn in fiscal 1994. Microsoft's success has also made Gates the richest person in the US, with an estimated net worth of more than Dollars 9bn (much of it tied up in Microsoft shares). These achievements alone make Gates a man whose every pronouncement is scrutinised by the computer industry and analysed by investors. But in 1994, he has added further to his stature, with plans for products that will bring the information superhighway into every sphere of life. Microsoft's planned acquisition of Intuit, announced in October, adds Quicken, the leading PC personal finance program, to the company's software portfolio. Gates recently unveiled plans to create the Microsoft Network, a global online service supplying information, bulletin boards, electronic mail and entertainment to PC users through cable and telephone lines. The company has also fended off challenges to its business practices - alleged to have been anti-competitive - from the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department's antitrust division. A cloud that has hung over the company's future for four years has been lifted. But it is as an architect of the next industrial revolution - the convergence of computer, communications and entertainment technologies - that we choose Gates as our Man of the Year for 1994. In an end-of-the-year interview with the Financial Times, he predicts that such technologies will soon have an impact on every sphere of life - commerce, education, communication, medicine and entertainment. Within the next decade, Gates says, information highways will link most businesses to their customers and suppliers. Wallet or wristwatch PCs will be able electronically to transfer funds directly to shop cash registers, as well as store personal identification documents and even family photos. Doctors will have direct video links to emergency response teams. Teachers will have access to resources that enable them to bring multimedia lessons to the classroom. Interactive television services will provide news and entertainment in the home tailored to the user's personal interests. 'We are investing way, way, way in advance to create the software platforms and tools for such services,' Gates says. Microsoft has 600 programmers dedicated to this effort and many more working indirectly on his long-term goals. 'It is a huge investment and it is based on our belief that these kind of electronic applications will catch on in a very big way before the end of the century. Our investment level is predicated on having millions of people hooked up to broadband (high speed, multimedia) networks within the next three or four years.' The pace of computer technology change is accelerating, Gates warns. 'Every company is going to have to avoid business as usual. The only big companies that succeed will be those that obsolete their own products before somebody else does.' While others in the computer industry may consider Microsoft unassailable, Gates says he is driven by a 'latent fear' that the company could become complacent and allow itself to be overtaken by nimbler competitors. It happened to other large computer companies such as IBM, he points out. In pursuit of his 'information highway' strategy, Gates is reaching beyond the computer industry to form partnerships with telephone companies such as BT and France Telecom, with cable television networks such as Tele-Communications of the US, and with publishers and Hollywood producers. A partnership with Visa, the credit card company, could allow secure online purchasing of goods and services. Making computers more user-friendly is essential to the proliferation of information highway services, Gates believes. Microsoft plans to create easy-to-use, fun 'social interfaces' for the intelligent electronic devices of the future. The first product of these efforts will be launched next month. Code-named 'Utopia', it is a first attempt at anthropomorphism in the PC industry, a program that endows the desktop computer with a 'personality'. Users will choose one of 10 cartoon-like characters as a friend and helper, guiding them through tasks, reminding them of things that need to be done and finding information on other computers via telecom networks. Gates views the new-found success of the CD-Rom - discs that can store large amounts of information in the form of text, pictures, music or video - as the most important development in the PC industry this year. For years, Microsoft's attempts to interest the PC industry, software publishers and others in the CD-Rom fell flat. As the publishing medium for computer games, reference books, shopping catalogues and other PC programs, it is now the key in creating a new generation of 'multimedia PCs'. 'Really to see that electronic publishing form take off is pretty fundamental and it carries us into the next phase of computing,' he says. That next phase is the development of online services. 'People are really starting to see the PC as a communications tool,' says Gates. 'Look at the explosion of electronic mail, the Internet and growth in online services.' He acknowledges that Microsoft Network will face significant competition, particularly in the US, from existing services such as Compuserve and America Online. But he seems to relish the battle: the company will create superior software technology, he claims. 'We have about 50 things that even in the first version will be far better than the online services have. We will make it very easy for people to do electronic mail, use bulletin boards, make purchases online . . . 'Even eight or nine months before we get into the business we have had an impact. Established companies are starting to think: 'Oh, we had better get more content, do better marketing.' Already we are making the market more competitive.' Such boasts give substance to the charge of his critics - and there are many in the computer industry - that Microsoft effectively dampens competition with its grandiose 'pre-announcing' of its planned products. Because of the company's dominance and resources, few software groups can risk a head-to-head market battle. This was one of many complaints about Microsoft investigated in the past four years by the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department's antitrust division. The investigation ended this year with an agreement, due to be approved in court next month, involving minor changes to Microsoft's software licensing practices. Gates is surprisingly sanguine about the investigation: 'It is to be expected, when somebody is as successful as we are in an important part of the economy, that regulators would review the situation to see if it is a competitive market.' He complains, nonetheless, that Microsoft is unique in having been investigated by two government agencies. 'There are not many people who have had every electronic mail message and everything that they have done subjected to the kind of scrutiny that we had here.' The end of the antitrust investigation has not, however, ended the barrage of criticism and 'Bill bashing' from industry rivals. One frequent accusation is that Microsoft is not an innovative company. Rather than inventing new products, it copies the ideas of others, critics maintain. Windows, Microsoft's PC operating system program, for example, is still seen by many as an imitation of Apple Computer's Macintosh software. Most of the criticism is sour grapes, says Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic, an industry consulting group. 'Like the Japanese computer companies, Microsoft may not be an inventor, but it perfects products. It is more important to get the product right, than to be first.' Getting the product right, however, is proving to be a drawn-out effort for Windows 95, Microsoft's newest version of Windows. Recently the company announced that the product will not be available until next August, three months after its last 'due date' and almost two years after the product was originally expected. Gates says the delay is not significant. It is more important, he maintains, that the product should be compatible with the broad range of PCs and applications that are currently in use. Fear of Microsoft's unbounded ambitions and envy of its success are undoubtedly at the root of much of the criticism that the company receives. But Gates's personal style does not help. While he can be charming and friendly on a good day, he can be testy and abrasive, even in front of TV cameras. At industry gatherings, he often seems condescending, dismissing any challenge to his ideas. In company meetings, he is prone to outbursts. 'That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard' is a typical Gates line. 'Part of Bill's style of presenting, clarifying and challenging ideas is to be very blunt and a little bit dramatic and some would say a little rude,' says Steve Balmer, Microsoft executive vice-president, one of Gates's closest friends for 20 years. 'But he is a lot less rude than he was 10 years ago]' Apart from a Porsche sports car and a Dollars 35m mansion under construction on the outskirts of Seattle, Gates is not conspicuous in spending his wealth. One exception was his purchase in November of an illustrated manuscript by Leonardo Da Vinci for Dollars 30.8m. He likes to keep his private life private. Newly wed to Melinda French, a Microsoft product manager, Gates bristles at any mention of his personal life, which he does not consider a matter of public interest. Said by some to be the computer industry's answer to Henry Ford, and by others to be the most powerful US businessman since Rockefeller, Bill Gates, at 39, still has plenty of time to outdo both.</p>

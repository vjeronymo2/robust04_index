			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman </F> of the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, by Bisharah  Shirbil in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] London -- Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman of  the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform [LMCR], has denied  that his movement is holding any dialogue with the Libyan  regime. He also denied that the question of dialogue was one of  the causes of the movement's split from the National Front for  the Salvation of Libya [NFSL] at the beginning of the month of  Ramadan. He stressed that the movement wanted "a peaceful  solution to the Libayn question" but that did not mean  "forfeiting our right to use all legitimate means, including  force, for the salvation of our country."    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Suwaysi said that the  movement's constitutent assembly would be held within months to  approve the organizational, ideological, and political structure  and to elect a leadership. [passage omitted]    Asked about the movement's willingness for dialogue, Suwaysi  said: "I say again that when the prerequisites are fulfilled and  the principles are clear, especially al-Qadhdhafi's recognition  of the patriotic opposition and his expression of willingness to  respond to the legitimate national demands of the Libyan people  and true recourse to the people.... If all that happens, then  it would be another matter.    "We want a peaceful solution to the Libyan question, a  solution that would spare our country more conflict and  bloodshed and spare our people more difficulty, but that  certainly does not mean forfeiting our right to struggle and use  all legitimate means, including force, for the salvation of our  country." [passage omitted]    On the question of the Libyan National Army joining the  movement and its announcement that it would remain open to all  Libyans, and the conflict that that would create with sound  organized work, Suwaysi said: "Not at all. There is no  conflict. The Libyan National Army is an integral part of the  movement and it is open to all Libyans interested in military  struggle and not necessarily in joining the ideological and  political organization."    Asked about the leadership of the new organization, Suwaysi  said that "the present leadership is a provisional leadership;  we have called it the Constituent Committee and thought it best  not to divulge the names of its members, but it consists of the  brothers who took the initial practical steps of crystallizing  the idea of forming the organization." [passage omitted]    On the question of unification of the opposition factions,  Suwaysi emphasized that the movement "seeks cooperation and  coordination with all patriotic forces and opposition factions  to fulfill our people's demands because the current challenge in  Libya requires the pooling of the efforts of all patriotic  parties, factions, and individuals." [passage omitted]    On the question of who finances the new movement, Suwaysi  said: "We will rely on the Libyan national capabilities and  resources inside and outside the homeland. All the  organization's programs and activities will be kept within the  limits of the national intrinsic capabilities out of faith in  the principle of an independent national will free from foreign  and external pressures." [passage omitted]    On relations with the United States, Suwaysi believes that  "they will be the same as relations with any other state, the  sole aim being to serve the national cause without undermining  the Libyan people's interests and the independence of national  decisionmaking."

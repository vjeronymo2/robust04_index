			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 31 March (TANJUG) -- Several thousand people  gathered at Stojan Jankovic square in Knin today to greet a  delegation of the Russian State Duma at a meeting of  Serb-Russian friendship. The meeting was opened by the leader of  the Serb National Renewal [Srpska Narodna Obnova], Mirko Jovic,  and was attended by the president of the republic of Serb  Krajina [RSK], Milan Martic, and the RSK minister of foreign  affairs, Slobodan Jarcevic. On its visit to Krajina the  delegation of the Russian parliamentarians is headed by  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, the vice chairman of the Duma and of the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia. It also includes Vitaliy  Sevastyanov, a hero of the USSR, and astronaut Yegeniy Fyodorov,  an independent Duma deputy.    Addressing the people of Knin, Vengerovskiy -- often  interrupted by tumultuous applause -- said that "Russia is  rising again and is preparing to come to your help." He said  that 170 million Russians were behind Krajina and that major  changes were underway in Russia which would help to bring 1,000  Russian officers to Krajina if necessary. "We have come here to  extend our hands and to ensure that we are never separated  again." It was with enthusiastic applause that Fyodorov's  following words were greeted: "I express the Russian Army's  enormous gratitude to you for having found enough strength over  the last three years, while Russia was on its knees, to defend  your and our freedom. The Russian Army is now with you." In  conclusion Fyodorov said: "We are here, you are here, Turks out,  Americans out." The Russian delegation has had talks with Milan  Martic, the president of the RSK.</p>

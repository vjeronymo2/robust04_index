			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (3): A dominating personality - Politics FOR MORE than 40 years, the politics of Belize has been dominated by one man and one party. Mr George Price helped to form the People's United Party in 1949. This move - a response to the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar which hit the pockets of Belizeans - established an anti-colonialist party which the British originally viewed with suspicion. This suspicion lifted over the next 15 years, and Belize would undoubtedly have claimed full independence in the 1960s were it not for the Guatemalan claim over Belize. In 1964, the country became self-governing, except for foreign policy, defence and internal security. Full independence was gained on September 21, 1981. The PUP won the six general elections held from 1954 to 1979, losing to the opposition United Democratic Party in 1984. Against the odds, it narrowly won the 1989 general election - with a narrow 15-13 majority in the House of Representatives. Its majority was strengthened after one opposition deputy switched to the government benches. Unmarried, austere and a devout Catholic, Mr Price, 73, is seen as likely to fight the next election, which must be held by 1994. The prime minister, the last of the generation of post-independence commonwealth leaders, has no obvious successor within the party. Those seen as most likely to succeed him are Mr Said Musa, foreign minister, and Mr Florencio Marin. Although the party rhetoric would suggest otherwise, the policies of the two main parties have proved hard to distinguish. Although ostensibly more populist than the pro-market UDP, the PUP in government has followed similar policies in favour of privatisation and continued investment. This has calmed the disquiet among investors following the 1989 election which the PUP won by appealing to nationalist sentiment with the slogan 'Belizeans first' and charges that the UDP had allowed foreign speculators to dominate the economy. The US embassy's assessment of the investment climate in the country remains 'excellent'. Mr Manuel Esquivel, the UDP leader and former prime minister, agrees the 'PUP were more effective in fighting the election than we were'. Since the election the opposition has split over the aimed-for settlement with Guatemala, which Mr Esquivel's party has supported. A faction, led by Mr Philip Goldson, a respected senior politician, has ceded from the UDP and formed a new party, the National Alliance for Belizean Rights. Mr Esquivel says his party sacrificed 'party integrity in favour of national integrity' in supporting the government over the Guatemalan settlement. 'We felt this was an opportunity to end this problem once and for all by making a minor concession to solve a major problem.' This may add to his problems in fighting the municipal elections in March. But he says that in the the long run the UDP will not be hurt, since the NABR is a one-issue party.</p>

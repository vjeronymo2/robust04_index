The airport was not affected.  </P> <P> A portable transformer will be used until it is determined what caused the  failure and the transformer is repaired, Vaughn said.  </P> <P> Company officials said such malfunctions usually happen once or twice a year,  and usually during lightning storms.  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Exporters shift production to counter high yen JAPANESE exporters are stepping up efforts to fight the impact of the yen's sharp rise on profitability by moving more of their production outside the country and increasing procurement of foreign-made components, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. A growing number of exporters are shifting manufacturing to lower-cost areas in south-east Asia and China, or localising production for regional markets. Seiko, the watch and precision instruments maker, said it might move low-end watch production to Hong Kong, where it already has an assembly plant. Komatsu, the construction machinery maker, is shifting the development and manufacture of large construction trucks for exports to the US within the year. Within three to four years Komatsu is also moving production to Germany of medium-sized wheel-loaders. The Japanese plant where the company now manufacturers the wheel-loaders will gradually shift production to small cranes. Meanwhile, Japanese companies are increasing procurement of foreign parts to help lower their cost base. Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, will attempt to double procurement of foreign-made parts by 1995 by securing more items from areas such as south-east Asia and buying more local parts for products manufactured overseas. The decision would increase the average ratio of foreign parts in Fujitsu's machines from about 12 per cent to about 24 per cent, the company said. Fujitsu has set up an international procurement division and is increasing the number of people with responsibility for procuring parts at ICL, its UK subsidiary.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Volvo back in the black despite fall in sales VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle manufacturer, yesterday confounded market expectations by announcing a return to profit in the first half despite a further fall in its sales of cars and trucks. A rebound to an operating profit of SKr166m (Dollars 20.5m) from a loss of SKr835m last year pushed Volvo to a profit after financial items of SKr380m, compared to a deficit in the first half of 1992 of SKr103m. The surprise result, which contrasted with expectations of losses up to SKr550m, sparked a sharp rise in its shares on an otherwise weak Stockholm stock market. The most-traded A shares closed up SKr11 at SKr454. Volvo said a change in the accounting of some tool costs had bolstered operating income by about SKr400m. The dramatic fall in the value of the Swedish krona compared to the first half of 1992 had also increased operating profits by about SKr200m. But it said that the turnaround was mainly driven by rationalisation measures, cost-cutting and lower research and development costs. Two out of three Swedish car assembly plants are being shut and the number of employees in the group has fallen to 56,400 - a drop of 13,000 since 1990. Sales rose to SKr48.8bn from SKr41.4bn, but Volvo said there was a decline of 2 per cent when exchange rate changes were excluded. The number of cars sold fell to 156,400 in the first half from 160,100 a year earlier, including a tumble of more than 20 per cent in Europe. Sales of medium-heavy and heavy trucks were bolstered by sharply higher demand in North America, but still fell by 3 per cent to 23,600. However, although details were not given, Volvo said both the truck and car groups reported operating profits, as did the Volvo Penta marine engine group and the aero engine group. Volvo's share of Renault's income stemming from its cross-shareholdings in the French group fell sharply to SKr220m from SKr852m. But income from Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group, more than doubled to SKr1.04bn. Net interest expenses rose to SKr565m from SKr315m, but net debt was down slightly from the end of 1992 at SKr12.9bn and interest charges fell off in the second quarter.</p>

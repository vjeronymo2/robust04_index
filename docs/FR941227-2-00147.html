			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' may not be exercised before the expiration of 90 days from the date the Contract is issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. A new 60 day confinement period must be satisfied each time the Contract owner becomes newly confined (whether for the same unrelated causes), if services by an eligible nursing home and/or hospital have not been provided for a period of at least six months. A new 60 day confinement need not be satisfied, however, if services for related causes were provided within six months of current receipt of services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Anchor National and SunAmerica Inc. have determined that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is a desirable feature, and beneficial to variable annuity contract owners. Accordingly, they wish to have the flexibility to incorporate such a feature in both existing and new Contracts, in jurisdictions where permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. In jurisdictions where permitted, Affiliated Insurers will make the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' available to all new owners of affected Contracts. The Affiliated Insurers reserve the right not to make the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' available to certain of their existing Contracts. Alternatively, an Affiliated Insurer may make the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' available to existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements uniformly applied to owners of such Contracts_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the making of an additional purchase payment under the Contract within a specified period of time, and in a prescribed amount (which may vary depending on whether the Contract is held in connection with a tax-qualified plan). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the 1940 Act or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 6(c), the Applicants request that the Commission issue an order to provide the exemptive relief set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants submit that granting the requested relief not only to variable annuity contracts issued by Anchor National and funded in the Separate Account, but also to variable annuity contracts funded in other separate accounts that Anchor National has or may establish, will eliminate the necessity for filing multiple applications for relief under circumstances where no new issues would be presented by the subsequent applications. Similar reasoning applies to extending the relief to apply to Contracts issued by other Affiliated Insurers as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 22(d) of the 1940 Act provides that no registered investment company shall sell any redeemable security issued by it to any person except either to or through a principal underwriter for distribution, or at a current public offering price described in the prospectus. Applicants recognize that the proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' described above could be viewed as causing the Contracts to be sold at other than a uniform offering price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Under certain prescribed conditions, Rule 22d&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act provides an exemption from Section 22(d) to the extent necessary to permit the sale of redeemable securities issued by a registered investment company at prices that reflect scheduled variations in, or elimination of, the sales load to particular classes of investors or transactions. However, to the extent that it has been interpreted by the Commission as granting relief only for scheduled variations in front-end sales loads_not deferred sales loads such as the CDSC_Rule 22d&hyph;1 is not directly applicable to Applicants' proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit.'' Applicants nevertheless submit that by adopting Rule 22d&hyph;1, the Commission has decided that variations in front-end sales loads should be permitted universally, subject to the standards embodied in that Rule, and that similar considerations should apply with at least the same force for the requested variation in deferred sales charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Rule 22d&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act exempts registered variable annuity accounts, their principal underwriters, dealers and sponsoring insurance companies from Section 22(d) to the extent necessary to permit variations in the sales load or in any administrative charge or other deductions from the purchase payments, provided that any such variations reflect differences in costs or services, are not unfairly discriminatory, and are adequately described in the prospectus. Applicants do not represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' reflects differences in sales costs or services, however, and for that reason do not rely on Rule 22d&hyph;2 for the requested relief, even assuming that Rule 22d&hyph;2 does apply to deferred sales loads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants note that while Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act permits variable annuity separate accounts to impose a deferred sales charge, it neither imposes any conditions on the ability of an investment company to provide for variations in the deferred sales charges nor provides an exemption from Section 22(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants submit that the proposed waiver is consistent with the policies of Section 22(d) and the rules promulgated thereunder. One of the purposes of Section 22(d) is to prevent an investment company from discriminating among investors by charging different prices to different investors. Applicants represent that because the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' will be available prospectively to any new Contract owner who becomes confined to a hospital or nursing home for 60 days or more (as is described more fully above), the benefit will not unfairly discriminate among Contract owners in jurisdictions where it is permitted by state law. Applicants further represent that the benefit advantages Contract owners by permitting them to surrender their Contracts without imposition of the withdrawal charge, upon the occurrence of the contingency described above, and that the benefit will not result in dilution of the interests of any other Contract owner. Applicants also represent that waiving the withdrawal charge under such circumstances will not result in the occurrence of any of the abuses that Section 22(d) of the Act is designed to prevent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit,'' if offered in connection with a particular Contract, would comply with the substantive provisions set forth in Rule 22d&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. More specifically represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' will be: uniformly available to all Contract owners who are eligible therefor; and adequately described in the applicable prospectus for the Contracts (or supplements thereto) before being made available to Contract owners. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to existing Contracts, the Affiliated Insurers will inform owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit by transmitting a copy of the endorsement or rider for attachment to their Contracts (as well as by supplementing the prospectus for such Contracts), as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements, the Affiliated Insurers will inform the owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit and the relevant requirements by transmitting a current prospectus or supplement thereto that adequately describes the benefit and the requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated above, Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested above is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

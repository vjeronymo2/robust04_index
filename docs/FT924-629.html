			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Those who have been pacing the economic garden in search of green shoots may derive modest encouragement from yesterday's trade figures. Excluding erratic items, the volume of non-oil exports grew 4 per cent in the three months to November, while imports were flat. That is doubly gratifying, as it is too early to expect September's devaluation to have had much effect on export volume. Perhaps rising British productivity will make for a spot of export-led recovery. At least, net exports should make a positive contribution to fourth quarter GDP. How far the advantage can be sustained is another matter. Devaluation benefits may be offset by declining demand elsewhere in Europe, leaving the UK to rely on increasing its share of a dwindling market. The depreciation of sterling against the dollar may help win new business in the growing markets of Asia and Latin America, but even this is unlikely to compensate for a likely rise in both the value and volume of imports. That the devaluation is already having its effect on imports is clear from the 4 per cent rise in their unit value in the latest quarter. Volumes may rise, too, at the first sign of real domestic recovery. Indeed, the 12 per cent fall in car imports over the quarter to November looks something of a blip, given the revival in registrations. It may be 1994 or even later before the trade deficit reaches unmanageable proportions. Just the same, worry about the trend will probably overhang the recovery from mid-1993.</p>

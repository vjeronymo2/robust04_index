Nogueira da Silva reports from Maringue, Renamo's  general headquarters.    Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has admitted that the  pacification process in the country will soon enter a difficult  phase since most people in rural areas are illiterate. Afonso  Dhlakama said it was necessary to educate the people about the  meaning of democracy, [words indistinct] and how to vote, among  other issues, connected with the electoral process. He said it  is necessary to explain to the people that not voting for the  Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] would not mean their  death. Likewise, if people did not vote for Renamo it would not  mean that they would be killed, the Renamo president stressed.  He said the people are still afraid of Frelimo.    At a news conference he gave in Maringue yesterday to mark  the New Year, the Renamo leader once again accused the news  media organs in the country of being biased.    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] There is still no press freedom  in the country. This is what I can say. I have always spoken  about this issue and I continue to speak. For example, I am  speaking here. If you return today and to do not report what I  am saying, if you cut or just try to report bits and pieces of  what I am saying, it means that you have no freedom. I shall  therefore continue to speak about lack of press freedom.    We want to see the freedom of the press in Mozambique and  you, as journalists, should correctly inform the people. The  people do not want propaganda. They want to hear the truth. In  my case, I want the people to hear what I am saying. You should  not, therefore, be the ones to cut my words or choose what you  think should be reported. You cannot say: Dhlakama's words were  too strong. We cannot report them because Frelimo will not like  it. Let us report what is not strong.    Although I continue to speak about lack of press freedom, I  must also say that things are improving. We have to recognize  that things are improving. All the same, I would like to see  the press have greater freedom in Mozambique than is presently  the case.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you believe there  has been reconciliation in the country since the signing of the  general peace accord?    [Dhlakama] Well, I can say that there has been. The  situation is a little bit difficult. Let us recognize that  Freelimo has ruled and continues to rule the country alone. It  has not been easy for Frelimo to heed the message of  reconciliation. We have been receiving complaints from our  members who are maltreated. Some of them are expelled from  work. Some of our members who are civil servants are expelled  just because they visited Maringue. That is the case with you.  You were dismissed from work because you came to Maringue.  Today, you work for Renamo full time. There are other cases  where our members were expelled, including teachers, (?typists).  Others were expelled from companies, hospitals, and so on. We  have already talked to the government about it and we think that  we shall be able to defend the interests and rights of our  members. [end recording]</p>

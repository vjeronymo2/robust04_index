			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cookson declines 65% to Pounds 34m - Rationalisation and restructuring point way to future growth COOKSON, the materials group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 65 per cent from Pounds 97m to Pounds 34m for the year to December 31. The figures included an Pounds 11m provision for rationalisation. The severe recession and the restructuring undertaken to restore profitability showed through in the results, said Mr Robert Malpas, chairman. However, the group had clearly turned the corner, he said. The balance sheet had been strengthened, profitability had been restored in the second half and the company was poised for growth. Mr Malpas pointed out that operating profits on continuing activities had increased during the second half to Pounds 28m, about Pounds 2m higher than in the corresponding period of 1990. The successful restructuring meant Cookson would increase its profits this year even without an economic recovery. However, the US was beginning to pick up and he hoped this trend would continue. Businesses in the Asia/Pacific area continued to perform well. Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 1.3bn following a series of disposals. Sales of continuing businesses fell from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.19bn. The results benefited from a reduction in the tax charge from Pounds 40m in 1990 to Pounds 18m. Mr Fergus Munro, finance director, said this had been achieved by moving cash back to the UK. As long as profits improved, he expected tax paid by the company to fall still further this year. A reduction in net interest from Pounds 73m to Pounds 25m had also been achieved, said Mr Malpas. Gearing, counting convertible preference shares as equity, had fallen from 143 per cent in June 1990 to 51 per cent by the end of last year. Mr Malpas said he was aiming for about 40 per cent. About 2,000 jobs had been shed since the beginning of 1990 and annualised savings of Pounds 25m had been realised. There would be further job losses this year, he said, though not as many as last year. Extraordinary items, incurred through closing a number of businesses, resulted in a charge of Pounds 19m (Pounds 31m). Earnings per share were 1.8p (12.5p). The final dividend is maintained at 3p, making a total of 6p. COMMENT Those looking for a cyclical recovery stock need look no further than Cookson. A strengthened management team has whittled down the business to core activities. Profits should increase without a recovery, but if the world economy improves the company would also be able to increase volumes without much additional cost. About 50 per cent of sales are in the Americas and the first glimmers of a potential recovery are becoming apparent. Heavily dependent upon the US automotive and building industry, which seem to have bottomed out, Cookson has little downside. Analysts are forecasting profits of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m, giving a multiple of between 10 and 15 on yesterday's close of 125p, up 9p. The stock appears good value.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Auto electronics market to double: Tougher laws trigger increase The market for automotive electronics is forecast to double from Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.3bn) to Dollars 80bn a year between 1993 and 2000, according to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. The study suggests that the biggest increases will come in the value of navigation equipment, while the installation of airbags will continue to rise rapidly. Electronic systems are forecast to account for 30 per cent of the production cost of a car by 2000. The value of the electronics content of the average car has already quadrupled from Dollars 300 in 1980 to Dollars 1,200 in 1990. According to the report, this is set to increase to Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,800 per car in 1995 and to rise further to Dollars 2,200-Dollars 2,500 in 2000. The EIU study claims that the rise in the use of electronics in cars is being driven by the introduction of tougher legislation on safety, emission controls and vehicle security, as well as by technological developments in the electronics industry and the need by car makers to gain a competitive advantage. The value of the car electronics market worldwide is forecast to rise to Dollars 69bn-Dollars 93bn in 2000 from Dollars 43bn-Dollars 58bn in 1995 and Dollars 29.7bn in 1990. Electronic systems for engines, transmissions and chassis will remain the single most important market sector, with sales forecast to rise from Dollars 13bn in 1990 to Dollars 23bn in 2000. The biggest increase will come in driver information systems, however, where the value of the market is expected to jump from only Dollars 2bn in 1990 to Dollars 18bn by 2000. Navigation systems will be able to give routes and update them to take account of changes in traffic. The Electronics Revolution in the Motor Industry. Pounds 495.

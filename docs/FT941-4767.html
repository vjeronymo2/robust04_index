			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Voting row goes to heart of EU's fault lines: How a dispute among the 12 has put the prospects for the 16 in jeopardy Britain and Spain will come under intense pressure from their European partners to settle the EU power-sharing dispute which threatens to prevent four new members - Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway - entering the Union. Britain in particular, has been identified as the villain in sabotaging prospects for the wider Europe it says it wants. Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, mainly blamed the UK when the enlargement negotiations broke up in rancour late Tuesday night, to resume in Brussels next Tuesday. London and Madrid, with lukewarm support from the Italians, insist on keeping the weighted voting rules of the 12 - where two large and one small countries combining 23 out of 76 votes can block measures - for a Union of 16. Their nine partners want to move the threshold to 27 out of 90 votes, keeping the same, roughly 30 per cent proportion for the 'blocking minority', after the four newcomers arrive. 'The Nine won't blink on the 27 votes,' Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister for Europe warned early yesterday. British officials maintain that only the Benelux countries and possibly France firmly oppose the UK and Spain, with a large pool in between for both sides to fish in before next Tuesday. The known evidence from what has nevertheless been a row behind closed doors suggests they are wrong. First, the power-sharing issue goes to the heart of the divisions in the Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between North and South, between big and small member states, between the sovereignty-conscious who prefer inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists who want to tighten European integration and make decisions at EU level easier. But more immediately, countries like Germany and Holland - both with greater right to complain about under-representation in the Council than the UK or Spain - feel certain that the European Parliament will not ratify the accession treaty if EU law-making is made more difficult by a shrinking minority. Parliament formally has to decide whether to go ahead today. This might be stretched to next week. Much beyond that, however, and the January 1995 enlargement target could be lost, along with momentum in the applicant countries which still have to convince their voters to endorse entry. Although nobody disputes that the UK and Spain can block the decision, there is a growing feeling in Brussels that Britain has misread the situation - unless it is putting down markers now for the 1996 constitutional review to which the 12 heads of government (including Mr Major and Mr Felipe Gonzalez) in June 1992 remitted the votes issue. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has suggested moving to 27 votes for the moment, and for the 12 leaders to set up a committee to study vote distribution ahead of 1996, specifically taking into account British, Spanish, Italian, and also German concerns. This looks like the only sort of framework which can resolve the dispute and deliver a Europe of 16 next year - and the British and Spanish governments can expect to be told so in no uncertain terms in the few days left.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Noyan Tapan: "Our Neighbors Are Opposed to the </F> AES"]    [Text] According to the Baku correspondent of the "Svoboda"  radio station, physicist Eldar Salayev, president of the  Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, stated in response to numerous  questions from local and foreign journalists that the Armenian  AES [atomic power station] is one of the first three Soviet  AES's and there were numerous miscalculations in its design  which increase the likelihood that emergency situations may  arise. There are no conditions in Armenian territory for the  burial of radioactive waste. Previously almost everything was  taken to Russia. But what will happen today, when Armenian armed  forces have occupied a substantial part of Azerbaijan? There is  a danger that the waste will be buried in Azerbaijan's  territory. Free access to reservoirs and rivers with the absence  of control will lead later on to contamination of the Caspian,  which is fraught with catastrophe for all countries in the  Caspian basin. We are opposed to starting the AES, the political  destabilization, and the endless chaos in the Transcaucasian  region. For this reason, Salayev said, "when Armenia raised the  question of allocating funds for renovation of the AES at the  IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] session last year,  Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey spoke out against it."    According to the Baku correspondent, the Azerbaijan MO  [Ministry of Defense] is also concerned about this, assuming  that radioactive raw material may be used not only for peaceful  purposes under the conditions of a conflict.</p>

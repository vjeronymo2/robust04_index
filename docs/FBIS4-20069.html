			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Larserik Haggman, chief editor of Nordic Council </F> periodical NORDISK KONTAKT: "Iceland's Road"]    [Text] In the intense debate on European integration the  Nordic aspects have been pretty well to the fore on both the pro  and con sides and the Finnish media have been writing more about  Norway than they have done for a long time. However, the Nordic  area's smallest country has been almost completely forgotten in  this context. And yet Iceland is being greatly affected by the  end of the Cold War and by European integration.    For many years the Icelanders were deeply divided over their  NATO membership and particularly over their U.S. base at  Keflavik. However, throughout the Cold War the majority were  clearly behind Iceland's West-oriented foreign policy, and  despite considerable opposition to the Keflavik base, those  advocating neutrality were few in number.    The fact that Iceland did not participate more actively in  EC  integration than did Finland, for example, had nothing to do  with security policy. It was instead because of fishing and  fish exports that are of crucial importance to the island  state's national economy. The so-called Cod War with Britain is  still fresh in people's memories as are Iceland's difficulties  on the European market.    Iceland's strategic position during the Cold War was due  both  to the transatlantic links between North America and Europe and  to Soviet naval and air force movements in the north. At the  same time the Keflavik base was not to be sniffed at as a direct  and indirect employer. It is interesting therefore that it was  the Icelandic side that applied the brake when in the many years  of negotiations with Iceland the United States was in favor of  reducing activities at the base.    In 1994 an agreement was reached that clearly reduces the  military force at the base, even though this reduction is not as  drastic as first planned. New negotiations will begin in two  years' time.    But not only the situation in the field of military policy  has meant changes. The trend toward integration in Europe has  also left its mark on Icelandic political life. Despite an  unmistakable skepticism, Iceland took part in the European  Economic Area [EEA] negotiations and a majority in the Althing  approved the results of these negotiations. When the question  of the European Union [EU] then raised its head, Iceland put  itself out in the cold after it had "threatened," as early as  the EEA negotiations, closer trading links with North America,  and chiefly with the United States, if the results of the  negotiations in the European direction were unsatisfactory.    Until very recently the only openings toward the EU were  Prime Minister David Oddsson's mildly positive general  statements made in the context of international meetings of the  leaders of conservative parties. At home in Iceland the  consensus that the EU is not on the agenda has up to now been  the prevailing view.    Instead the Icelanders have been kept busy thinking about  what will happen to the EEA and European Free Trade Association  [EFTA] if Iceland is left alone in the former and only has the  company of Switzerland in the latter organization. The solution  that has been settled on is a proposal for a bilateral agreement  with the EU, and to this end, Oddsson has given advance warning  of a visit to Brussels.    When, around a week ago, Norway concluded its fisheries  agreement with the EU, this gave rise to turbulence in Icelandic  politics. A part of the picture here is that Norway did not  succeed in keeping its own fisheries under national control but  was given a promise that once the EU has taken over, fisheries  policy will follow Norwegian principles. In the Norwegian  debate at present views are deeply divided on whether this is to  be seen as a major success or a relinquishment of  self-determination in the fisheries field.    Iceland's social democratic foreign minister, Jon Baldvin  Hannibalsson, recently raised the question from the Icelandic  perpsective and joined the group of those who view the results  of the Norwegian negotiations as a great success. He even went  so far as to say that the Norwegian result gives grounds for  looking again at the the foundation for the Icelandic stance and  to warn that Iceland could otherwise find itself marginalized.  The foreign minister did not go as far as to directly propose  Icelandic membership negotiations with the EU, but his message  was crystal clear and provoked some violent reactions.    Fisheries Minister Thorsteinn Palsson, who represents the  conservative Independence Party, protested and claimed that  Norway had abandoned its control over its marine resources. He  received the immediate support of the center and left-wing  opposition and of the fishing industry, while employers, the  industry confederation, and a number of trade organizations  voiced their sympathy with the foreign minister's view and  called for an investigation into the necessary preconditions for  negotiations with the EU.    The prime minister tried to bring the discussion to an end  when he backed his colleague, the fisheries minister, but it is  already clear that such a stance is an impossibility.    It is possible that a new trade initiative backed by both  the  government and opposition could direct attention elsewhere for a  while. There are proposals, for example, of negotiations with  NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement, but this does of  course throw the eternal Icelandic west-or-east dilemma into  sharp relief.</p>

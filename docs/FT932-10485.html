			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Man in the News: A cuckoo big enough to fly the nest - Peter Wood From a distance, Mr Peter Wood appears as unexceptional as his name. Soberly dressed, quietly spoken, even a little shy. He could be any middle manager in a large manufacturing company, putting in long hours for Pounds 35,000 a year. But close up, he starts to display a disconcerting intensity. And there is nothing boring about what he gets paid. Mr Wood runs Direct Line, the UK insurance company which sells policies by telephone, and which this week disclosed a trebling of profits in the first half of its financial year. This means that 46-year-old Mr Wood, who last year earned Pounds 6m, is likely to be paid at least Pounds 10m. The issue of his pay re-emerged this week amid several reports about the escalating salaries of some British company directors. Mr Wood remains the nation's highest-paid, but he is starting to face stiff competition. A share option scheme at London Weekend Television seems likely to give shares worth Pounds 55m to a group of its senior managers. Yet there is an argument that Mr Wood is under-paid. It runs as follows. Like Mr Bill Gates of the US software company Microsoft - who is worth an estimated Dollars 8bn - he was the first to spot how technology might change an industry. Mr Gates held on to his stake in Microsoft, whereas Mr Wood sold his 25 per cent of Direct Line - potentially worth Pounds 250m - to Royal Bank of Scotland. When he sold in 1988, he received an unusual contract in return. The bank agreed to inject capital into the company to fund its growth. It offered Mr Wood a yearly bonus linked to the rate at which Direct Line increased its assets - the insurance policies it sells. Direct Line is now one of Britain's fastest-growing companies. The man who has made it so excites a mix of astonishment, admiration, and in some cases fear, from his colleagues and competitors. He occasionally gives the impression that he is physically at war with others. Nor does he have much time for niceties, such as pretending to respect the achievements of others in the industry he is shaking at the roots. 'He is one of those incredibly ruthless characters who says I'm going to take you all on,' says one former colleague. Even Lord Younger, Royal Bank's chairman, describes his best-known director as 'volatile'. He adds: 'There are not too many Peter Woods around. He is so unusual because he has such tremendous drive, and an individual view about everything.' Mr Wood has another explanation. 'To be average makes you good in the insurance industry,' he says. With barely concealed contempt he recalls a meeting with an executive from another insurance company. 'He could tell me all about the worldwide airline table, but when I asked about seven specific areas of his business he didn't have a clue,' he says. By contrast, he knows every detail of Direct Line, spitting out figures for 'loss ratios' and 'expense ratios' in machine-gun fashion. His vision also differentiates him in a generally conservative and slow-moving industry. While some companies are still considering whether they should set up direct operations, Mr Wood is hatching broader plans. He is distinctly uncharitable about companies such as Churchill, The Insurance Service and GA Direct, which have now copied Direct Line's methods, even though these companies are starting to experience some success. He says that it will take some time for them to achieve Direct Line's levels of efficiency in processing policies. Its advantage comes from technology, of which Mr Wood is a master. Direct Line's information and management systems have helped it cut costs over its rivals. Computer software helps ordinary telephone sales workers to make decisions, thereby saving on more senior underwriters and middle-managers. Mr Wood developed his technical skills at Levi Strauss, where he became head of European data processing operations at 25 - and at Alexander Howden, the insurance broker. Mr Wood's acerbic view of the industry spreads to critics of his salary. 'They are only moaning minnies who do not know what they are talking about,' he says. One enigma to outsiders is what he does with his money. He lives well but relatively modestly with his wife and five daughters in Surrey, drives an 8 Series BMW and devotes much of his spare time to tennis, which he is said to play well, and intensely. His regular partners include Cliff Richard, the pop singer and entertainer, and Sue Barker, the former Davis Cup star. Yet insurance industry insiders do not regard his lack of flashy spending as a mystery. For Mr Wood could eventually have a good use for his money. This stems from his unusual relationship with Royal Bank of Scotland, at which he can appear out of place. Mr Wood is hardly the grey, stolid manager whom banks have traditionally groomed for senior jobs. Royal Bank initially gave Direct Line backing of Pounds 20m, and has since built its capital to a total of Pounds 90m. The bank has hopes of Direct Line providing a steady stream of at least 20 per cent of earnings when it approaches Mr Wood's target of being the largest UK insurer. But Mr Wood sometimes talks as if he does not envisage being part of the bank indefinitely. A flotation of Direct Line might value it at up to Pounds 1bn, so Mr Wood could have no further need of the bank's capital at some point. Both sides insist that the relationship is harmonious, but further questions were raised this week by the disclosure that Direct Line is to apply for its own banking licence to allow it to sell competing products such as loans and savings accounts. The more Direct Line starts to look like a bank in its own right, the more investors will question when the cuckoo in the nest will fly away. Some of the bank's managers point out that the decision on whether Direct Line will go solo is not Mr Wood's, and that if he left, the bank would retain the company's name and its assets. But this may be to overestimate the value of the Direct Line brand without Mr Wood's direction. Lord Younger makes soothing noises about such speculation, and about whether Mr Wood is out of place in a bank. 'He might not have fitted 10 years ago, but he fits very well with what we are trying to achieve now,' he says. He is adamant that the bank deserves to reap the rewards of Direct Line through continued earnings since it found the original capital. Mr Wood says he is happy to be part of the bank, but the idea of a split does not seem to worry him. 'It would cost them an awful lot of money to get rid of me,' he says. He could have saved a lot more by the time it came, enough perhaps to start another business with his own capital. There are other industries which he could yet shake up.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): Reform poses a dilemma - Debate over electoral options BRITAIN will be called upon to decided whether, in 1995, Hong Kong is allowed to elect 20 representatives to the Legislative Council with western-style fairness, or whether other interests, representing China and the business community, will be given an advantage. Which way Britain jumps turns on the question of how much democracy Hong Kong wants on the eve of its hand-over to China The answer to that question will dictate an important area of the political landscape post-1995 and beyond. Liberals, who point to the United Democrats' success at last September's elections, can fairly claim that the people have spoken. The social and political policies the Democrats enunciated won the day; the more democracy the better to safeguard the interests of Hong Kong's people, they say. Those to the right, representing business and pro-China groups, argue that what is needed is a return to the status quo. They emphasise economic growth, stability and dialogue, not confrontation with China. Government officials question whether the Hong Kong Chinese want full-blown democracy and the difficulties from China that would bring in its wake. Foreign diplomats concur: 'There is a recognition of a need to reach an accommodation with China to protect their well-being; I am not convinced of a broad desire for democracy here,' observes one. The nine constituencies returned 18 of LegCo's 60 members; in each constituency voters were able to cast two votes. Martin Lee's United Democrats won 12 of the 18. The number of directly, or democratically, elected members will rise to 20 in the 1995 plebiscite. The government has made it known that it sees only three alternatives: 20 single-seat constituencies; 10 two-seat, two-vote constituencies; or, multi-seat one-vote constituencies. The first two options are favoured by Hong Kong's liberal politicians, the last named by China and local conservative interests. On the LegCo committee of 12 studying reform, only four were democratically elected; the remainder were either appointed by the government or elected by 'functional' constituencies, many on an uncontested basis. Those groups who were unsuccessful in last year's direct elections - the Beijing-backed candidates and those representing business - see electoral 'reform' as a way of improving their chances in 1995. They opt for multi-member constituencies with voters given only one vote. The electoral reform process will be one of the most difficult for the government to manage. It is likely to come under pressure from all sides and not all can be pleased at the same time.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead the stock market to a strong close - Market Report The London stock market yesterday turned in its first convincingly positive session this week as good performances from US and European bonds set the scene for the US gross domestic product data due from Washington this afternoon. The FT-SE 100 Share Index comfortably regained the 3,000 mark, trading volume remained poor and there were hints that a leading UK investment bank will cut staff today. A strong lead from the stock index futures market and from British government bonds drove the stock market to the day's peak at the close. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,029.6, with a net gain of 29.7. The rebound was something of a surprise. Indeed, the market was 6 points off on the Footsie scale in early deals as traders shied away from any continuation of the weakness at the close of the previous session. The mood turned as German bunds turned higher after the deputy president of the Bundesbank suggested that the German central bank might soon return to variable rate repos. Although warned not to do so, markets took this as a bullish sign, and were not put off by the expected decision at the Bundesbank's policy meeting to leave key rates unchanged, nor by the announcement that this week's repo would be at a fixed rate. The stock market climbed steadily during the first half of the session, with individual companies providing a number of features. Good results from ICI had been well discounted in the marketplace and profit-takers cut into the share price following the boardroom announcement. But the impending flotation of BSkyB continued to help shares in the stakeholders and the flow of higher corporate profits from US companies continued, with Shell Transport and Trading very firm following the trading statement from Shell Oil. The final boost came when the US Federal bond market opened higher, taking the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by 12 points in UK trading hours. The gain in the Footsie was quickly extended from 16 points at mid-afternoon to its closing gain of nearly 30 points. The final hour of trading saw share prices rising rapidly as marketmakers faced an unexpected demand for stock and hurried round the market, searching topping up their own trading books which have been kept on very tight reins for the past few weeks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index more than recovered its fall of the previous session, closing 12.9 higher at 3,480.1. While pleasantly surprised by the market's resilience in recapturing the Footsie 3,000 mark so convincingly, analysts remained cautious ahead of today's US GDP number. US third-quarter growth is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, according to UK based strategists; a higher figure will inevitably revive concerns about inflation, the dollar and the attitude of the Federal Reserve, and revive speculation in London regarding the timing of the next base rate hike. The wider concern of the UK stock market is the lack of equity business and yesterday's volume figures emphasised the dearth of business. Seaq volume of 507.2m shares showed a further fall of around 3 per cent. The day's total of bargains booked in shares, at just over 21,000, remained barely two thirds of the average for the past two years. Low turnover is taking its toll not only of confidence at stockbroking firms, where commission income is at risk, but also in the daily marketplace. Volatility in share prices has reflected unwillingness of marketmakers to run positions in such a thinly-traded market. This has increased the influence of the stock index futures arena, which is often accused of driving the underlying stock market.</p>

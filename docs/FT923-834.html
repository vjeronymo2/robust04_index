			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The bargain masquerading as a cut-down: Computing - The latest spreadsheet program offers WITH 18m users in 65 countries, Lotus 1-2-3 is the best-known spreadsheet in the world. It comes in two versions. 1-2-3 release 3.1 is a multi-page version for specialised applications; the basic version, which will satisfy most of us, is 1-2-3 release 2.3. Release 3.1 is priced at Pounds 475; release 2.3 at Pounds 395. In June, Lotus announced 1-2-3 GO, priced at Pounds 149 and available through Dixon, Ryman and Wilding as well as specialist dealers. Lotus modestly describe 1-2-3 GO as an 'easy to learn introduction to 1-2-3' designed for 'home and small business users'. But this is marketing flim-flam to persuade corporate users to keep buying the full-price versions. If (if]) you are content to accept inferior packaging and the demeaning 'cut-down' tag, in return for paying a half or a third of the price you receive the full-strength package minus a few bells and whistles. So it proved with 1-2-3 GO. In fact, after going through the menus in detail I found it indistinguishable from 1-2-3 release 2.3, which I use myself. The only regrettable omission seems to be that of the 'Viewer' facility. This is based on Lotus' wonderful 'Magellan' file manager, and allows you to find your way around a disk full of files with ease. For documentation Lotus has rebadged a self-teach book called The 10 Minute Guide to Lotus 1-2-3. Unlike the standard reference manual it is clear and readable, but at 138 pages is a mere introduction to a massive and highly sophisticated package. Be prepared to go out and buy yourself a more detailed guide from Sybex or Que. Alternatively, a reader has strongly recommended to me Spreadsheets for Business Readers by C West of the Bristol Business School. Installation was mostly a matter of pressing the Enter key to accept the suggestions ('defaults') offered by Lotus. However, part of the procedure is very confusing. 1-2-3 GO only appears to work with Diablo, IBM and 'unlisted' text printers. After talking to Lotus support staff I chose 'unlisted' and also the 'Extended' font set for my dot matrix printer. Everything worked OK, but Lotus needs to clarify this. In accordance with current GUI fashion, 1-2-3 GO automatically starts itself in graphical 'WYSIWYG' (What You See Is What You Get) mode. I wonder how many people use Windows software without realising that they do not have to put up with the slow response time and the faint and scrawny characters you often get under WYSIWYG. I run 1-2-3 on a portable and the display under WYSIWYG is so poor that I have removed it and do all my work in character mode, which is clear and chunky. Instructions on how to turn off WYSIWYG are on page 85 of the manual. 1-2-3 GO is a top-of-the range product which, amazingly, turns in a respectable performance even on a basic XT machine like the Amstrad 1640. But competition in cheap spreadsheets is strong, with Quattro Pro SE selling at Pounds 69 and Supercalc at Pounds 79. Why pay the extra for 1-2-3 GO? One very good reason is Budget Express, a 1-2-3 'add-in' package from Symantec. Budget Express brings to 1-2-3 an 'outlining' facility; that is, it enables you to present data in summary totals at the top level, then to explode these totals down in increasing levels of detail. This facility (also called 'drill-down') is essential in any financial reporting system. Suppose, for example, you are budgeting next year's profit and loss account for your 15-person company. Best practice is to budget wages separately for each employee, necessitating 15 lines in your budget, plus a 'Total Wages' line. But this level of detail makes for a very long spreadsheet. Even for a company turning over only Pounds 1m or so, the budget profit and loss account can easily grow into three or four pages. Your bank manager or investors are not interested in this level of detail - they just wants the total wages figure in a one-page summary 'profit and loss'. With outlining you can instantly 'collapse' a lengthy detailed budget into a one-page summary, and back again. Once you have used Budget Express you wonder how on earth you managed without it. Not only that, but the manual is intelligently written by someone with wide experience both in using 1-2-3 and in budgetting. If only all software manuals were like this] This then is the reason for choosing 1-2-3 GO - that it lets you get your hands on Budget Express. 1-2-3 GO is available at Pounds 149 plus VAT. Budget Express is available at Pounds 99 plus VAT from 4-5-6 World, telephone: 0206-44456.</p>

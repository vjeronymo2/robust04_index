			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: Confronting the old age crisis - Economic Eye Do you expect future generations to pay you a good pension over decades of secure retirement? Do you also believe in Father Christmas? In no area of public policy is there a greater need for clear-sighted policy-making, since decisions taken today will have effects half a century or more in the future. But be warned. Nowhere is there a greater temptation for governments (and employers) to make deceitful promises for short-term advantage. In the UK, the government has just announced a bill to make occupational pensions safer, but has failed to address the conflicts of interest inherent in defined-benefit occupational pension schemes. In the US, a bi-partisan commission has failed to agree on how to contain the burgeoning cost of entitlement programmes. In Italy, the fiscal programme of Mr Silvio Berlusconi has been undermined by the constitutional court's insistence that it pay arrears on certain pensions, going back to 1983. As a superb, but under-reported World Bank study, published earlier this autumn, shows, all these are but different aspects of the world's rapid ageing.* Nor is this mainly a problem for industrial countries. The number of people over 60 is forecast to rise from half a billion in 1990 to 1.4bn by 2030. Some 29 per cent of that increase is to be in China alone; another 29 per cent in the rest of Asia; and 28 per cent in other developing and transitional countries. Only 14 per cent will be in industrial countries. The burden of public pensions is set to rise sharply (as is shown in the chart, on the assumption that the current relationship between demography and spending on pensions continues). Today the Italian state is tottering under the burden of paying just over 14 per cent of gross domestic product in pensions, but the average burden of industrial countries is set to be higher than this by 2030. The increased costs will be still more difficult to bear in poor developing countries, such as China. Health spending is also correlated with ageing: in Australia, for example, public health spending per head on people over 65 is six times that on children under 15. Ageing is, in fact, the world's most important economic challenge. Pension and health spending on the old either is already - or will become - the largest item of public spending virtually everywhere: in Austria and Sweden, it is already close to 20 per cent of GDP. In OECD countries, implicit pension debt exceeds reported public debt by large amounts: in the UK, for example, the ratio of public debt to GDP in 1990 was 35 per cent, while the implicit pension debt was over 150 per cent of GDP. Italian implicit pension debt was almost 250 per cent of GDP, dwarfing the explicit debt ratio of over 100 per cent. Ageing is important for equality between the sexes, since women are much more likely to be old and poor than men. Meanwhile, heavy payroll taxes, largely to cover pensions, represent an important cause of high levels of unemployment, notably in Europe. In the UK, for example, the payroll tax rate was close to 20 per cent in 1990. In Poland, it was 30 per cent. Pension systems also have implications for savings, while private pension funds have become massive players in capital markets. In 1991, pension fund assets were two thirds of GDP in the US, 70 per cent in Switzerland, 73 per cent in the UK and 76 per cent in the Netherlands. If any area of public policy requires long-term planning, it is pensions. Unfortunately, governments have set up public pension schemes that generated hugely positive real returns to the first cohorts of beneficiaries, but negative real returns as they mature. In the case of the US, for example, the real return to those retiring 25 years after the establishment of social security was 9 per cent, but this fell to below 4 per cent for those retiring 45 years after. Things will get still worse in the future. One indication of this is the increases in taxes as a share of GDP that will be needed to meet pay-as-you-go pension obligations. In Italy, the worst example, the required tax increase will be 11.9 per cent of GDP. Governments are absolutely certain to default on their pension obligations, probably by a mixture of higher pension ages, reduced indexation and means testing. The notion that the state can be trusted is just one of several myths punctured by the Bank. It also notes that the anti-poverty case for focusing aid on the old is weak, because families with small children are usually poorest of all; that social security for the old rarely redistributes income to the poor, partly because the rich live longer; and that governments focus quite as much on the short term as individuals, one example being the use of early retirement programmes as a false cure for unemployment, another being how pay-as-you-go programmes concentrated benefits on voters who were mature at the time they were established. The Bank study argues that there should be three distinct policy objectives: redistribution to the poor; smoothing of consumption; and provision of insurance. It also recommends a multi-pillar system, with the public pillar providing a basic minimum income, to alleviate poverty in old age and insure citizens against a multitude of risks. But relying on the public sector alone is risky. Thus, it also recommends a privately-managed, funded and mandatory system, alongside purely voluntary savings. It is impossible to do justice to this rich study in one article. But it has a clear lesson: stop believing in Father Christmas and start saving now. *Averting the Old Age Crisis (New York: Oxford University Press for the World Bank, 1994).</p>

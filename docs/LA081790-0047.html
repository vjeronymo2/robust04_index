			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Dead Ahead: The Grateful Dead has canceled three scheduled Labor Day weekend  shows at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., in the wake of  the drug-related death of keyboard player Brent Mydland last month.  </P> <P> The band will go ahead with East Coast shows in September, including a  six-night stand at New York's Madison Square Garden, followed by a swing  through Europe. The band's pal Bruce Hornsby will sit in with the Dead for the  last five of the New York shows. Band publicist Dennis McNally said auditions  are proceeding for a new full-time keyboardist who is expected to be on board  before the East Coast tour starts. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

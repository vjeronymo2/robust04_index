			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Illinois Offers $33 Million to Sears: Illinois has offered $33 million to  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. to keep its retail headquarters in the state it has  called home for more than 100 years. Sears has said it will announce by the end  of the month whether its 6,000-employee Merchandise Group will remain in  Illinois. Speculation for a new site has focused on an area west of Chicago,  Dallas, and Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C. The Merchandise Group, which has a $411  million annual payroll and produces about $19.4 million a year in state and  local taxes, is being moved from Sears Tower to cut costs; the company is also  selling the skyscraper. Gov. James R. Thompson signed legislation earmarking  $33 million to Sears' incentive package. The money could be used for land, site  improvements or infrastructure at any Illinois site. Chicago already has  offered unspecified incentives to Sears.  </P></p>

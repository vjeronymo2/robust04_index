			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The president of U.S.  fertilizer giant Cargill said here today that the United States  should extend the most-favored-nation trade status (MFN) toward  China this June.    Speaking at a seminar on international trade of agricultural  commodities, Cargill president Fritz Corrigan said China and the  United States have close economic and trade relations. He  expressed hope that Sino-U.S. economic relations would be  maintained and strengthened.    He told XINHUA that during his meeting with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington last February, he  strongly advocated the renewal of China's MFN status.    Kantor was generally in favor of the extension of MFN  status,  Corrigan said.    He said that withdrawing China's MFN status would be  unhelpful to Sino-U.S. cooperation and would definitely harm the  economic and trade relations between the two countries.    According to John Crawshaw, president of Cargill  Fertilizer's  Southeast Asian branch, the U.S. fertilizer giant shipped the  first batch of American wheat to China in 1972 when the then  U.S. President Richard Nixon made his first China visit.    Cargill Fertilizer's business volume in China has topped 25  million tons over the last two decades, including the purchasing  and selling of over 20 varieties of agro-products.    Crawshaw said that Cargill has determined to invest more in  China and would seek more partners. He anticipated that his  company could complete the necessary procedures to be registered  in China by the end of this year.    Cargill Fertilizer, with more than 70,000 employees  worldwide, specializes in agro-business. The company's  fertilizer sales volume worldwide exceeded seven million tons in  1993.    Today's seminar was sponsored by China's Ministry of  Agriculture, Cargill Fertilizer and the Potash and Phosphate  Institute of Canada.</p>

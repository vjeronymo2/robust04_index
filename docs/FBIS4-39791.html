			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [No date as received] -- A meeting of Ukrainian  and Vietnamese business representatives was held yesterday at  Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, during an  official visit by a delegation of the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam led by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet.    Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign  economic  relations, said the Ukrainian-Vietnamese trade turnover in 1993  was $39 million, including $23 million in exports and $7 million  in imports. Ukraine's exports to Vietnam include hydroturbines,  bulldozers, transport lifting equipment, and others. Import  priorities are rice and rubber. According to Anatoliy Kolos, 29  joint Ukrainian-Vietnamese ventures have been set up in the  years of independence, eight of which are manufacturers.    Mai Van Zakh [name as received], Vietnam's deputy minister  of  commerce, said that thanks to reforms introduced in Vietnam in  1986, the country's exports have been boosted by 20 percent each  year. One of Vietnam's priorities in foreign relations, the  deputy minister said, is renewal of ties with CIS states,  particularly, with Ukraine. Mai Van Zakh told UNIAN that the  slow development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations was caused by  Ukraine's lack of legislative regulations on payments.    Deputy Minister Anatoliy Kolos said in an interview that  Ukraine is mainly interested in Vietnamese rubber imports for  which Ukraine could supply relevant processing equipment. In  order to resolve the other bilateral issues, Ukraine and Vietnam  set up an intergovernmental commission led by Vietnam's deputy  minister of commerce and Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign  economic relations, Anatoliy Kolos. The commission will look at  the possibility of setting up a Ukrainian-Vietnamese bank.    Summing up the meeting, Anatoliy Kolos pointed out favorable  trends in the development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations,  saying that despite all economic obstacles, Ukraine's exports to  Vietnam have grown 10-fold in the first quarter of this year,  while imports have increased two-fold, compared with the  respective period last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Elmakov] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk April 7 TASS--The chemical plant in  Novosibirsk is facing a tough financial situation which can  affect the implementation of the Ukrainian nuclear disarmament  programme.    The plant is the only enterprise in Russia which produces  fuel for water-moderated water-cooled reactors which is to be  shipped to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear warheads.    The first batch of fuel assemblies was shipped to Ukraine in  the end of March, deputy director general of the plant Vladimir  Rozhkov told TASS on Thursday.    The Finance Ministry had to pay for the fuel nearly 30  billion roubles, but the enterprise had received no money so far  and cannot buy a number of accessories necessary for the  production of nuclear fuel assemblies.    Experts of the enterprise warned that reserves will last  only  for one month. If production stops many Russian nuclear power  plants will remain without fuel as well.    "A disruption of nuclear fuel shipments to Ukraine is not  ruled out because the state, which is acting as a contractor,  does not fulfil its commitments in time", Rozhkov said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Any mass return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia  during the peacekeeping operation in the region will be  unacceptable, the Abkhazian foreign ministry said in a statement  on Wednesday. It said the measure would be enforced on a  case-by-case basis in keeping with the program adopted by the  four- party commission.    The commission, now into a second day of work at the Black  Sea city of Sochi, involves representatives of Russia, Georgia,  Abkhazia and the United Nations. The timing and procedure of  repatriating the refugees and displaced persons dominates its  agenda.    The ministry has spoken against any attempt to try to link  the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in the region with the  repatriation issue.</p>

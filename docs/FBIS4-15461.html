			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] It appears that the visit by the Latvian President  to Moscow will take place after all. Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman Grigoriy Karasin has said that the preparations for  this visit to Moscow have now entered the plane of practical  actions. The plane of practical actions evidently means that the  somewhat confused situation connected with the mistake in  President Yeltsin's instructions about setting up military bases  outside Russia, including in Latvia, is being resolved.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH APPEALS CONVICTION IN CONTRA AFFAIR  </P> <P> Former White House aide Oliver L. North formally notified the federal court  Tuesday that he is appealing his conviction and suspended sentence in the  Iran-Contra case but did not immediately spell out the legal grounds for the  appeal.  </P> <P> At the same time, North said in legal papers that he wants to begin promptly  the 1,200-hour "community service" part of his sentence, which will involve  working with inner-city District of Columbia youths who are regularly exposed  to drugs.  </P> <P> In view of the leniency of the sentence imposed last week by U.S. District  Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, North's appeal apparently is aimed at clearing his  name, removing a ban on his holding federal office and avoiding the $150,000  fine Gesell imposed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Payment Required Now  </P> <P> The U.S. Court of Appeals generally takes one to two years to act. North may  delay payment of the fine until the appellate process is exhausted, Gesell said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, in declaring that North had acted "to carry out the initiatives  of a few cynical superiors," Gesell handed North a suspended three-year  sentence and placed him on probation for two of those three years.  </P> <P> North's attorneys said in their court filing that he wants to begin his  community service before his appeal is acted upon because "we understand that  the next 6 to 12 months is a critical start-up period during which the program  could best use the assistance" of the retired Marine lieutenant colonel.  </P> <P> Gesell, in telling North last week that prison time "would only harden your  misconceptions" about his past illegal conduct, said that he wants the  community "to get the benefit of your organizational and administrative skills,  which are very high."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Destruction of Documents  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a leading supporter of North, has told  reporters that "the harshest penalty" for North is a prohibition against  holding federal office because of his conviction in May on charges that he  altered and destroyed top-secret government documents -- one of three felony  counts on which a jury found him guilty.  </P> <P> Dornan and other congressmen have urged a presidential pardon for North, partly  to remove this prohibition. A successful appeal would accomplish the same  result. North has been urged by some supporters to run for Congress.  </P> <P> North's lawyers are expected to claim that Gesell infringed on North's right to  defend himself by limiting the evidence he could introduce at trial. Gesell  established guidelines for classified material that could be used at trial  under the 1980 Classified Information Procedures Act, a law that North's  attorneys have argued is unconstitutional.  </P></p>

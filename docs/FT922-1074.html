			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Germany It is beginning to look as though the German money supply will never shift in the right direction. The one glimmer of hope in May's annualised increase of 9 per cent was a small slowdown in the growth rate of bank credit to the private sector. Even so, it now looks inconceivable that money growth can slip back sufficiently over the next few months to justify easier rates. The latest money supply data thus tend to confirm earlier impressions that there will be no room for an official German rate cut this year. One consequence may be that the recovery in the dollar which many foreign exchange dealers expected for 1992 may simply not occur. A weak US recovery and the presidential election will prevent short-term interest rates rising on that side of the Atlantic. So the interest differential between the two countries will remain wide. As for Germany, there may be some lag in the impact of high interest rates, but for the time being the economy appears able to stand the strain. It is thus unlikely the Bundesbank will cut rates aggressively when it does start to relax.</p>

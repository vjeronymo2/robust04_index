			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, China's  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said here  today that the country's foreign trade companies should be more  aware of competition, so as to push forward the development of  China's foreign trade.    She was speaking at a meeting of the China National  Technical  Import and Export Corporation.    She noted that China's foreign trade companies face  increasingly severe competition with the establishment of the  market system and China's foreign trade reforms.    China already has over 7,000 enterprises enjoying foreign  trade rights, including nearly 2,000 industrial enterprises,  over 280 barter trade corporations, and over 120 scientific  institutions.    She said that this year's foreign trade target is set to  reach 200 billion U.S. dollars, which will be a painstaking  task. But, she noted, reforms of China's foreign exchange and  foreign trade systems will provide new opportunities.    She hoped that all foreign trade companies will strive for a  new breakthrough by keeping their eyes both on the domestic and  overseas market, paying due attention to quality control and  diversifying foreign trade markets.    She said that China will expand its technical imports and  exports this year, with the focus on technical imports for key  national and long-term projects such as power stations and  telephone systems.    At the same time, China will enhance its export of  equipment,  high-tech products and high value-added products of machinery  and electronics.    She also said that foreign trade companies should try to  strengthen their overseas business management, which is a key  point for this year's foreign trade.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Health win for unions in Argentina ARGENTINE union chiefs have won a victory over the government by wresting back control of the equivalent of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn in funds for union-managed health schemes. In exchange, the Peronist-controlled CGT union confederation pledged to shelve plans for a general strike this month. Both sides signed an accord committing them to greater social justice and higher benefits for the country's 3.5m pensioners. Officials denied concessions were made to the unions that would threaten economic stability. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said wage talks were constrained by a marketplace thrown open to international competition, preventing companies granting inflationary wage increases. He had wanted to allow employees to opt out of union health services and buy private health insurance.</p>

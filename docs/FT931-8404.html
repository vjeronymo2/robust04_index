			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: Nagano's triumphant Mahler - Concert Even 25 years ago, Mahler's Symphony no. 3 was heard only slightly more often than his Seventh - which is to say, hardly at all. Together they counted as his symphonies maudites, too 'problematic' to earn regular performances. Then the Third began to enjoy the attention of a few mature Mahler conductors, with some memorable results - and therewith too of ambitious but less practised maestros, in whose hands the gigantic first movement could seem arbitrary and brutal, and the final Adagio sentimentally, intolerably drawn out. Kent Nagano, who took the London Symphony through the work at the Barbican on Wednesday, cannot be all that practised. Many another youngish conductor with a reputation in contemporary music has reached back to Mahler by way of expanding his range, and thus his career, and has come a cropper. When Nagano offered a Mahler Ninth with the LSO a few years ago, however, it was a precocious triumph of musicianship, and plainly of respectful, assiduous attention to what the likes of Horenstein and Bruno Walter made of the score. This time he did no less with the Third. And even more: for there is really no 'definitive' reading of the Third, what with its patchy public history (and its exacting budget - large orchestra, women's and boys' choirs for just one movement and a strong alto soloist for two, unskimpably costly rehearsal-time). At the end of the day, a conductor of this work must sink or swim on the precision of his own musical instincts. Nagano's were faultless. Later, no doubt, he will define a larger-scale impulse in the opening 'Kraftig', and develop a finer chiaroscuro for the wry grandfathers'-dance 'Tempo di menuetto'. For now, he gave us far more than enough to be going on with. That cataclysmic initial movement had a barely leashed, tooth-and-claw power and an ironical feel for municipal-band sound, where many an international name (I forbear to name them) engineers a mere sequence of noisy assaults. Nagano wound up the Knaben Wunderhorn scherzo to a wry height, and gave impeccably sensitive support to his alto - Birgit Remmert, a towering 27-year-old who may well be the leading Erda in Wagner's Ring for the next generation - in her Nietzsche soliloquy. The 'Angels' movement found the LSO women's chorus brisk and clear, and the Southend Boys' Choir as boyishly apt as they always are in this work (a bit eerie, that, since in the nature of things their personnel must always be short-term members). The Adagio reached a glorious apotheosis. Nagano paced it unerringly, from the first bated-breath melodies to their grand final dress. Each subito pianissimo in the flowing line clutched at one's heart; every new plateau was attained by cogent steps. For the first time in my concert experience, the grandiose, repetitive last pages were a mighty culmination instead of an over-insistent redundancy. Ingeniously, Ute Lemper had been recruited to preface the lengthy symphony with a half-dozen Weill songs. She is a class act, supremely schlank and importunately appealing in her little black dress, very high heels and husky mezzo. Some of my colleagues object to the voice; I thought it served her material very well, and well in tune. What Lemper lacks, simply, is music-theatre experience without the aid of a microphone - vocally character-building to an irreplaceable degree; and yet, so far as one could judge in the Barbican (where she may have had an unfamiliar mike), less sophistication in her address to it than many a straight pop-vocalist can boast. Her lively intelligence struck through nevertheless, and her performances struck home. It was a pity that her German texts in the programme-book were so badly proof-read and garbled.</p>

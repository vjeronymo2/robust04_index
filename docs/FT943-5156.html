			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Swedish opinion polls jolt election campaign - A walk-over that is now a race Sweden's general election, for weeks apparently little more than a triumphant victory march for the opposition Social Democratic party, has suddenly acquired an air of uncertainty which has revitalised the campaign with less than two weeks to go. Opinion polls published since Sunday showing a slide in Social Democrat support and a marked swing to the Left and Environment parties not only jolted politicians. They alarmed financial markets which for the past two months have pushed up interest rates and driven down the krona because of concern about the yawning budget deficit. The prospect of a minority Social Democratic government reliant on a resurgent red-green camp for a parliamentary majority yesterday helped knock more than 2 per cent off the Stockholm stock exchange general index and send five-year government bond yields up more than 40 basis points to more than 11 per cent. Such levels of interest rates already threaten to choke off Sweden's faltering recovery. What upset the markets and the Social Democratic leadership was not so much the fall in support for the party to below 50 per cent - in one poll the reverse was enough to deny it the parliamentary majority most polls have predicted throughout the summer. Even the mighty Social Democrats, who have ruled Sweden for most of the past 50 years, have rarely achieved such a position in recent times and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, party leader, has long been braced for a slip. What he did not anticipate was such a powerful shift to the left, including the projected return to parliament of a resurgent Environment party, which failed to overcome the 4 per cent entry barrier to parliament in 1991. The leftward shift was apparently prompted by the Social Democrats' recent espousal, albeit reluctantly, of a programme of public spending cuts to trim the deficit and curb Europe's fastest rising state debt. Meanwhile, the four parties in the governing right-centre coalition - Prime Minister Carl Bildt's conservative Moderates, the Liberal and Centre parties and the Christian Democrats - fell back in the polls to less than 40 per cent together. This undermined Mr Carlsson's (and the markets') preferred option should he fail to win a majority: to forge either a formal or informal alliance with the Liberals, or possibly the Centre party, aimed at gathering broad parliamentary support behind a rigorous, long-term fiscal policy. The shock of the poll results was enough to shake Mr Carlsson out of what had seemed a severe case of election complacency. Last week, he retired to a mountain holiday house for three days to rest and plan for government. He repeatedly refused to meet an increasingly desperate Mr Bildt in a face-to-face television debate. Then, on Sunday, he agreed, and within hours the two men were on air in a strikingly hostile confrontation which clearly illustrated the ideological split between them. Mr Carlsson insisted that three years of 'new liberalism' under Mr Bildt had failed and promised investment to tackle unemployment (now running at 14 per cent). Mr Bildt attacked the Social Democratic plan to raise income, capital and wealth taxes and said a return to traditional Social Democrat welfare policies would be a disaster for Sweden. He warned voters not to 'buy a pig in a poke' from a 'red-green mess that will undermine Sweden's credibility'. The dispiriting reality for Mr Bildt, however, is that so far the polls show no sign of enthusiasm among voters for continuing his campaign to reform Sweden's overweight public sector and put the emphasis of job creation on the private sector through favourable income, corporate and capital tax regimes. Instead, the latest leftward swing has put pressure on the Social Democrats to stiffen their commitment to the welfare state. This at a time when recession has pushed up public spending to a record level equivalent to almost 70 per cent of gross domestic product. Many in the Social Democratic leadership acknowledge that this imbalance has to be tackled. Hence their preference to work with the Liberals, whose leader Mr Bengt Westerberg supports the welfare state and has a friendly attitude towards the Social Democrats. However, the polls have shown Liberal support slipping as low as 6 per cent, compared with their 9.1 per cent showing in the 1991 general election.</p>

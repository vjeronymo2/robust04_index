			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--QUDS PRESS--The Islamic Resistance Movement,  Hamas, has criticized the current alliance formula among the  Palestinian opposition factions.    Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official Hamas spokesman, told QUDS  PRESS: We (in the Movement) consider the Palestinian alliance  formula as not being sufficiently ambitious to the degree Hamas  was seeking. It is rather a reconciliatory formula which does  not achieve the desired aspirations, he added.    Ghawshah, who recently participated in the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces [APF] meetings held in Damascus on 19 and 20  February, urged upgrading the current alliance formula. He said  this is a temporary formula which should be upgraded. He  pointed out that the Palestinian factions should work for a  formula to establish an elected Palestinian parliament, similar  to all democratic states. Such a parliament would truly express  the Palestinian people's position on all issues related to their  destiny and future, as he put it.    Ghawshah stressed his movement's refusal to consider the  popular conferences as a political reference from which a  representative council can emanate. He said: This formula  partially expresses the people's opinion, but we believe in  total expression. This is a point of difference with the  democratic (leftist) factions in particular.    The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and  the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] had  called for holding conferences in the places where the  Palestinians are present in order to create a leadership  representing the Palestinians.    Regarding the meetings of the APF Central Command recently  held in Damascus, Ghawshah said they discussed three issues:  first, the internal arrangements (the alliance); second, the  regulations pertaining to these arrangements; and third, the  activity in the territories and among the Palestinians in  Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.    Ghawshah pointed out that the meetings touched on ways to  enhance coordination in the territories in light of the APF's  failure in (the elections of) the Doctors Association in Gaza.  He stressed that this failure resulted from lack of  coordination among the opposition factions.    Ghawshah added that the Damascus meetings worked out  preliminary programs to activate the APF on the political and  popular levels. The conferees also agreed to organize visits by  APF representatives to hold contacts in the world in general and  in the Islamic world in particular on the official and popular  levels. He pointed out that these visits aim to stress to the  world that the Palestinian people adhere to their land, future,  and homeland. Ghawshah revealed a draft for internal  regulations for the APF. A dialogue will be held in order to  endorse these regulations during a meeting of APF officials  whose date will be set soon.</p>

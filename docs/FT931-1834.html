			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): From lender to investor - Banks appear increasingly willing to take equity stakes in small companies Looking for equity? Forget the venture capitalists - they are too demanding. Leave aside private investors or 'business angels' - they are difficult to track down. Why not try your high street bank? It is very early days, but there are signs of a growing willingness on the part of banks to consider providing equity. In many cases this has been forced upon them. Sometimes the best way to save a business from failure is to convert loans into equity. Last month, shareholders in Trencherwood, a quoted housebuilder, approved a refinancing package which gave the company's banks a 37 per cent stake, rising to a maximum of 67 per cent if they converted their preference shares. 'The bank takes the view that a 'gone concern' is not attractive to anyone,' says Jim Tracey, a manager in the corporate recovery department at Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the three banks involved. 'If we can keep them alive, we do so and we look to take an equity holding. We swap lost money for a potential upside in the years ahead.' Putting equity into a business in trouble, rather than calling in the receiver, represents a shift in bank attitudes. But Tracey's department is part of a unit at RBS, called Specialised Lending Services, which aims to help companies by taking an equity stake. Since the end of last year it has been headed by a venture capitalist, Derek Sach, former managing director for UK investments at 3i. Midland Bank has also launched an ambitious programme to provide equity to unquoted companies through its branches and a network of small regional venture funds. Midland is ready to refinance well-managed businesses where interest charges threaten to overwhelm the company, says David McMeekin, a corporate banking director. 'If we convert a loan to equity, it may give us something to set against the provision we have to make. But this is not the way I want to see the banks ending up with equity stakes in their customers.' The model envisaged by Midland is for the bank to take a modest equity option, starting as small as 2 or 3 per cent, to help a customer complete a fund-raising. 'If all went well, we would sell the stake back to the company,' says McMeekin. Midland has completed a dozen equity deals since launching its new policy. An important reason for the banks' move into providing equity is a desire to share in the high returns which successful equity investments can provide. The narrow margins on much conventional lending can soon be eaten up by failures. 'It has always frustrated me that if a company did well, the bank was repaid and the shareholders went off with big amounts of money,' comments Hans Blankvoort, UK general manager of Bank Mees &amp; Hope, part of the Dutch ABN Amro banking group. Mees's corporate finance department has begun providing equity alongside debt finance to a small number of customers. The frustration felt by bankers was highlighted in a recent study* of investment returns carried out for National Westminster Bank. A survey of the fortunes of more than 100 small business customers between 1986 and 1990 showed the bank increased funding at a faster rate than the owners boosted their investment. Firms that borrowed performed better than those that did not. Yet while the average return on the owner's invested capital was 48 per cent, interest payments on the bank loans provided a return of only 10 per cent. Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small business services, says: 'When small business owners invest their own funds they assess the risk for a potentially unlimited return, whereas the return on a bank loan is limited to the interest rate charged. But both stand to lose equally, if a small business should fail.' Business owners may have little sympathy for this argument. The banks have not endeared themselves to their small business customers, with increased charges and reductions in loan facilities. But a more serious issue is whether bankers are capable of assessing equity risks. The flip response, though one with an element of truth, is that much of their lending in the late 1980s involved an equity-style risk anyway. Crucial to success will be the sort of company they back. Mees &amp; Hope says it will target the more established business with turnover of Pounds 10m or more and a good business plan. Of the four companies backed so far, one was a management buy-out of Bolton Brady, the industrial door-making subsidiary of Tarmac, and another was Foster Church, a start-up company. Mees has taken a 20 per cent stake in Foster Church, which provides working capital finance to young companies and, with a Dutch investment company, a stake of just over 50 per cent in Bolton Brady. 'Combining loans and equity is the way forward for banking,' says Darryl Keys, corporate banking manager. Mees plans to provide equity backing of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m to about a dozen companies. Clearly, a Dutch merchant bank has a different culture and approach than the UK clearing banks. For the UK clearing bank, equity investments involve a leap of the imagination. NatWest found how difficult it was to get equity investments right when it was forced, in January 1991, to acknowledge the failure of its Growth Options venture, launched five years earlier. Growth Options started out taking equity options alongside loans, but then moved to taking straightforward equity stakes. But a higher-than-expected failure rate forced NatWest to merge it with NatWest Ventures, its venture capital arm, after it had made 65 investments involving Pounds 10m of equity. 'We just couldn't make money out of these small investments,' said Mark Wordsworth of NatWest Ventures. 'The costs are the same as for bigger companies. You still need to spend Pounds 50,000-Pounds 70,000 on accountancy and legal fees before you start.' If anything goes wrong with a small company, there is little leeway for a rescue. 'We can refinance bigger companies with a balance sheet and a management structure, but with very small companies with Pounds 100,000 of turnover there is nothing you can take out,' says Wordsworth. NatWest's experience appears to indicate that if banks are to provide equity it will be, as Mees has also decided, to larger companies. Barclays Bank has targeted the slightly larger business through a link with Baronsmead, a venture capital company. Barclays says it has backed about 40 companies, investing an average Pounds 400,000 in each since 1989. Barclays uses Baronsmead's venture capital expertise to pick companies, but bank staff are seconded to the venture firm. Barclays says it has had only one failure among companies backed, and it expects to continue the joint venture when the initial Pounds 20m of funds are exhausted. The banks are attempting to succeed in a field of investment in which their venture capital subsidiaries have found it difficult to make money. It will be several years before the results of the present renewal of interest in equity come through. Meanwhile, the banks will need to be selective in the companies they back and business owners must be choosy in who they tie up with. *Investment and Financing Decisions and the Performance of Small Firms. 48 pages.

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 50% profit decline at Baggeridge Brick Baggeridge Brick suffered from reducing production in the winter, turning in a pre-tax profit some 50 per cent lower in the six months ended March 31 1993. Mr Peter Ward, chairman, explained that production was cut in order to help contain the national over-capacity that was evident at the time. In the event there was 'some satisfaction' with the results. In the period turnover rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 13.1m. Operating profit came to Pounds 905,000 (Pounds 1.41m) with building materials accounting for Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 864,000) and landsource Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 546,000). Pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 383,000 (Pounds 761,000). Sales prices continued under pressure but the group's sales volumes and market share increased. Stocks were reduced considerably at March 31. Mr Ward said demand was stronger for social and private housing, and brick and paving schemes were also on the increase. However, it would be some time before the commercial and industrial sectors of construction showed much improvement. Earnings per share fell to 0.65p (1.29p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.75p.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNSELORS HELP MENTAL PATIENTS COPE WITH DAILY LIFE ON THE EDGE  </P> <P> It was only 8 a.m. and Bill Peck was already sweating. He had just dialed the  home phone number of a woman he had hoped to check into a psychiatric ward by  nightfall.  </P> <P> "No one is answering. That's not a good sign," said the Los Angeles County  social worker.  </P> <P> In a previous visit, Peck had noticed that the young woman had begun chattering  about the devil again. She was incontinent. Both were ominous signs for a woman  with a history of trying to hurt herself with hot water, cigarette lighters and  stove burners.  </P> <P> By nightfall, Peck had located and counseled her. But in between there were  several other mentally ill clients that day needing his attention: there was  the delusional man in love with singer Joni Mitchell, a volatile young mother  whose baby had been taken away and a frightened middle-aged man locked in a  mental ward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Ways of Helping  </P> <P> They are among the San Fernando Valley's most severely mentally ill -- those  who will never completely escape their difficulties. But the county is  providing a new way of helping them lead their lives as independently as  possible.  </P> <P> A year ago, the county's Department of Mental Health kicked off a pilot project  in the Valley to identify and give extra attention to the heaviest users of its  services. Four veteran mental health workers crisscross the Valley most days to  visit with 80 or so clients in the program. They serve as confidants and  go-betweens with landlords, doctors, bill collectors and others in the outside  world.  </P> <P> The program's average 20-person caseload for its social workers is far lighter  than that of their colleagues, who must keep track of as many as 60 to 80  clients.  </P> <P> "We're their mother, their father, their friend," explained Peck, who makes his  rounds in an aging orange Volkswagen bug with a leaky roof.  </P> <P> The intensive case management program, as it is called, is the first of its  kind in Southern California. For county officials, it serves a dual purpose.  Officials hope that the added investment in this select group of the neediest  mentally ill not only will improve their lives but will save money and hospital  bed space.  </P> <P> Mental health administrators had grown concerned that a small percentage of  troubled individuals had been costing the county millions of dollars, primarily  for hospital stays. For many of these people, the return rate to state and  county hospitals -- their second homes -- was dizzying. Before entering the  pilot program, one former short-order cook in his 30s had been hospitalized 39  times.  </P> <P> The experiment so far has lived up to expectations, county administrators said  in recent interviews.  </P> <P> "The whole idea of the program is to see if there isn't a better way to serve  this population. It seems it is certainly working," said Ken Miya, the  program's project director. He attributed the success to the clients knowing  that people who care about them are willing to help however they can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hospitalization Figures  </P> <P> His yardstick is the latest set of figures on the number of days the program's  enrollees are spending in hospitals. Before the program's start, 71 future  participants had stayed a total of 4,383 days in county or state mental wards  during the 1986-87 fiscal year. During the experiment's first 10 months,  however, the same group spent just 687 days in a hospital.  </P> <P> That decrease meant the county paid $120,000 for hospital stays during the  program's first 10 months, compared to $635,000 paid for hospitalization during  the 1986-87 fiscal year, Miya said.  </P> <P> Several of the clients said during recent interviews that they are deeply  appreciative of the extra attention the program's social workers provide.  </P> <P> One of those was John, whose deep depression is such a constant in his life  that his social worker cannot even classify it as recurrent.  </P> <P> "I feel it is the best thing the county has done," said the middle-aged man, on  the verge of tears. "I don't feel lonely. I feel the county is protecting me. I  need that. I need that very badly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Prototype  </P> <P> The experiment has served as a prototype for the countywide mental health  system. But with funds for the county's mental health network evaporating, the  program's future remains clouded.  </P> <P> The fate of every program is "up in the air," said Roberto Quiroz, the director  of the county's mental health department. But he said, "When the dust clears, I  think case management with the focus on the severely chronically mentally ill  is the way we've got to go."  </P> <P> The experiment began when a county computer was enlisted to identify the  Valley's most dependent mentally ill clients. The criterion: those who had  generated the biggest mental-health care bills in 1986-87.  </P> <P> The computer extracted a pool of 1,530 from the Valley, Glendale and Eagle Rock  who had used county mental health services the most. From that list,  caseworkers started contacting the top 100 or so individuals to see if they  would be interested in participating.  </P> <P> Compiling the list turned out to be simple. Finding those on the printout and  then persuading them to participate was trickier. Some didn't have permanent  addresses -- a few lived in cars, parks or on the streets. The social workers  located some when police dropped them off at emergency rooms after they had  caused public disturbances during psychotic episodes.  </P> <P> The responses of some who were approached, recalled Linda Graul, the project's  supervisor, was: "Who the hell are you? Get out of my face."  </P> <P> The typical participant is white, between ages 26 and 45, and living with  family or in a residence. About half are males, half females.  </P> <P> A small, idealistic staff started what they call their "missionary work" last  April. Since then, the county's  </P> <P> financial woes cut the program's staff in half to four caseworkers. Later, the  full-time psychiatrist was reassigned elsewhere three days a week. After that  happened late last year, the clients' rate of hospitalizations in state  institutions jumped almost 400% during a period of four months.  </P> <P> But despite the setbacks, the staff members said they remain committed to their  clients, who oftentimes are estranged from family and friends whose patience  dried up years ago.  </P> <P> "I go home at night and I'm exhausted. It's like having 20 children," said  Lenore Lewis, a county social worker. "The rewards are small, but you get very  excited when someone makes even some little progress."  </P> <P> Just the week before, one of Lewis' clients, who thought she was Joan of Arc,  took one of those small steps forward. Lewis kept a close eye on the woman  until she could arrange for the staff psychiatrist to see her. The woman called  Lewis two hours after she saw the psychiatrist and received new medicine.  </P> <P> "She was so excited; the voices had lessened," Lewis said. "She could deal with  her own thoughts."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Psychiatrist in Charge  </P> <P> The psychiatrist who takes care of the group's medical needs is Dr. Paul  Joseph, 35, who looks more like a Hollywood screenwriter than a doctor. The  bearded physician, who wears a blue-jean jacket, a Swatch watch and fabric  bracelets, quit his private practice to work with the homeless on the Santa  Monica beaches a few years ago. He is apparently the only county psychiatrist  who makes house calls, Graul said.  </P> <P> The caseworkers have relied heavily upon Joseph to prescribe drugs because  almost all their clients require medication. Most are taking six to eight  drugs, and the wrong mix can be disastrous.  </P> <P> Suzy, for instance, entered the program with a set of prescriptions she had  received at a hospital, but her behavior remained bizarre. Twenty times a day  she was calling her caseworker, Sue Melton, telling her she was fired and then  rehired.  </P> <P> Joseph was summoned, and he prescribed a better combination of medications.  Suzy's calls stopped, and he gradually weaned her off all medication. Today,  Suzy is working at a yogurt shop and doing volunteer work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Salvaged Furnishings  </P> <P> The small staff meets frequently in their North Hollywood office, which is  furnished with salvaged furniture and just two filing cabinets. Together, they  provide moral support and brainstorm. Creative solutions are sought for the  endless string of "what now?" dilemmas that come with the job.  </P> <P> Some of caseworkers' approaches seem surprisingly simple. What for instance,  can be done to prevent the deeply depressed person from trying to overdose with  the medication in his bathroom cabinet? One tactic that has been tried is  asking the client to sign a suicide contract promising not to kill himself  before the next counseling appointment. So far it has worked.  </P> <P> Vangie Montalvo, a bilingual caseworker, once resorted to an Old World "cure"  to help one of her deeply troubled clients. The client, a 19-year-old woman who  hears voices, would frighten her family by uncontrollably twisting her body in  grotesque ways, Montalvo said. Complicating matters, the teen-ager had  developed an adverse reaction to drugs that might have helped -- something that  normally doesn't develop for 30 or 40 years.  </P> <P> The Latino family believed that the teen-ager was the victim of a curse placed  by one of her mother's co-workers. Montalvo didn't try to argue with the  parents, and her suggestions for the daughter's care were largely spurned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Counseled  </P> <P> So Montalvo turned to a social worker at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk  who works with the superstitions of recent immigrants. He counseled the family  using mainstream therapy methods, but also performed an exorcism, which seemed  to improve the girl's condition, if only slightly.  </P> <P> His advice to the family, Montalvo said, was "the same things I was telling  them for months and other therapists have told them for years." "They were able  to hear it from him and accept it from him much more readily."  </P> <P> Bill Peck had his own challenges awaiting him the day that began with his  telephone call to the potentially suicidal woman who had delusions about  talking to the devil.  </P> <P> One of those challenges was curled up in a chair and chain-smoking when he  reached the door of her townhouse in Van Nuys. Like most of the clients,  Claire, a bright young woman, cannot work because of her disability. Her infant  child was taken away seven months earlier after social workers feared that the  baby might be harmed.  </P> <P> Claire had been in a fury the night before, after her first day of classes at  Pierce College. She thought the strangers in her class didn't like her and were  trying to humiliate her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions About Child  </P> <P> She became subdued when Peck asked about her baby.  </P> <P> "Do you know what you want to do with Joey?"  </P> <P> "I don't know."  </P> <P> "How do you feel about him not being here?"  </P> <P> "I don't know. I don't want to give him up because I don't know."  </P> <P> In one of her more candid moments, Claire, who had been struggling with whether  to give up the baby to adoption, said: "I have no mothering skills. I feel  awkward around him."  </P> <P> When Peck started to go, Claire bummed a dollar from him for gas for her car,  showing him a coin purse that held only 78 cents. With no money, she said, she  had been "ripping Ralphs off on a regular basis" with bad checks.  </P> <P> She did say, however, that she hoped things would improve when her husband got  his next paycheck more than a week later.  </P> <P> Peck's next stop, the mental health staffers agree, was one of the program's  shining successes. Before Peter joined the program, he would wander away from  the various board-and-care homes where he lived, only to return hours later,  sunburned with feet that were bloodied, apparently from walking miles barefoot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Hospitalizations  </P> <P> Peter's greatest wish was to get his own apartment. But his 39 hospitalizations  and compulsive spending had made that unlikely, Peck said.  </P> <P> Peck eventually arranged for the move to an apartment, however, and visited  Peter every day for months to make sure things went smoothly. Peter has  remained out of the hospital and in his immaculately kept studio apartment in  Van Nuys for almost a year.  </P> <P> "When Bill comes by we have a little thing going," said Peter, who had become  more paranoid in recent days. "When Bill's in my house, it turns into a  psychiatric unit."  </P> <P> It was harder for Peck to be optimistic about the next client he visited at  Glendale Adventist Medical Center. John, a newcomer to the program, had no  friends or family and often talked about starting his life over again -- his  code words for suicide. He was scared that he would be trapped in the hospital  forever.  </P> <P> "My worst worry at this point, I have to be honest with you . . . is they  aren't planning to let me go," John, clad in pajamas and slippers, told Peck.  </P> <P> Peck assures John that he is wrong. And in a soft voice he tries to cheer him  up. He tells him that he looks better since he lost some weight and that his  hospital room is much nicer than those at the state mental hospital in  Camarillo. Peck leaves, reassuring John that he will let his landlord know  where he is.  </P> <P> When he walks out of the hospital, Peck resumes thinking about the suicidal  woman he needs to find tonight. And he remarks, "Well, you've seen a typical  day."  </P></p>

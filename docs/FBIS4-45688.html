			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Equipment for  monitoring and exchange of data on radiation between Slovakia  and Austria will start operating in September, according to an  agreement signed today.    The signatories were Slovak Environment Minister Juraj  Hrasko  and Austrian Health Minister Christa Krammer.    "Slovakia is the first country with which we will connect  systems warning against radiation," Krammer said at a press  conference today.    She added that talks are under way also with the Czech  Republic and Slovenia, and Hungary and Germany are also under  consideration. The Austrian Government paid 3.5 million  schillings for the system.    The move is an important step on Slovakia's path towards  joining international cooperation in the area. The Austrian  monitoring system is composed of 336 automated measuring  stations, while Slovakia has only 26.    The need to connect both systems resulted from a visit of a  Slovak Government delegation to Austria in May last year.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bids sought in 'one-stop' plan MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday invited competitive bids for a chain of one-stop shops which he said would revolutionise support for British business. The shops will bring together the services of chambers of commerce, local authorities and local enterprise agencies. They will also incorporate Department of Trade and Industry services to business. A prospectus seeking bids for 15 pilot one-stop shops is to be sent to Training and Enterprise Councils, which have been asked to co-ordinate the bids. Mr Heseltine has allocated Pounds 3.5m for the shops - which has been clawed back from Tecs' existing budgets. It is intended that a network of about 200 shops will be established, to be the main local point of providing and promoting DTI services to business. Information and advice will include exporting, VAT, standards, single-market information, and training. The government hopes a policy will be developed to charge for services, many of which are now free. Mr Heseltine said he was ready to consider imaginative ideas about how that might be achieved, including proposals for co-location and, subject to any legal constraints, subcontracting of services. There are about 800 DTI staff in the regions and bids may result in them being seconded to the shops.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Malaysia contact admitted A government minister triggered renewed speculation about the lengths to which the UK went to secure trade with Malaysia in the 1980s by admitting that Britain was formally approached by Kuala Lumpur over a sensitive legal case. Mr Alastair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, said that Britain received representations from Malaysia over the trial of Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian banker who was accused of taking part in a fraud in Hong Kong. Mr Goodlad did not reveal details of the exchanges between British and Malaysian officials between 1983 and 1993. But his statement added to newspaper speculation that the government withheld important telexes from Mr Osman's trial in exchange for Malaysia's decision to buy Pounds 1.3bn of British military equipment. Mr Goodlad's response came in a parliamentary written answer to Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery. He is pressing ministers to release the telexes suppressed in the Osman case under the system of public interest immunity certificates. Dr Kua Kia Soong, an opposition leader in Kuala Lumpur, is reported to have claimed in the Malaysian parliament that his country had agreed to buy arms from Britain to avoid the release in court of 'sensitive documents' which could have implicated Malaysian politicians in a banking scandal. The Commons public accounts committee will next week produce a highly critical report on the government's support for Malaysia's Pergau dam project.</p>

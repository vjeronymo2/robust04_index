			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Kazakhstan - no shortage of refineries Sir, Chrystia Freeland's interview with President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan gave an interesting and generally enlightening overview of that country's present situation (FT Interview: 'Prospects in the pipeline', March 25). However, it did contain a serious error when it stated that Kazakhstan has no oil refineries. Kazakhstan has in fact three refineries in operation at Chimkent, Aktyrau (formerly Guryev) and Pavlodar, with a total crude capacity of 21m tons a year. This capacity compares favourably with Kazakhstan's current domestic crude production of about 27m tons a year. Kazakhstan's problems with refined product supplies lie not so much with a lack of refining capacity but, first, with the location of its refineries with respect both to crude sources and to the internal market and, second, with the reduction of pipeline deliveries of crude from Russian fields in western Siberia to the two largest Kazakh refineries. Curtailment of Russian crude supplies is due to payment problems and the overall drop in west Siberian crude production.

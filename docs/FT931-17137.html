			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Hijacker puts US in quandary US officials are pondering what to do with the Cuban pilot who this week hijacked his aircraft and flew to Miami, taking with him 48 willing defectors and also some passengers and crew members who were diverted against their will. The case again places the US government in a quandary as a result of its enduring feud with Mr Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. While Washington welcomes any refugee from the Castro government, it is reluctant to appear to condone hijacking, and some US airlines are agitated about the possible precedent. The Cuban American National Foundation, a right-wing grouping of Cuban exiles headed by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman, has hired a lawyer to represent the pilot, Mr Carlos Cancio, and is acting as Mr Cancio's interpreter in interviews. But the episode has also highlighted the contradiction between the open arms the US extends to any Cuban defector, and the cold shoulder it has turned to thousands of Haitian refugees from the military regime that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. The US policy of forcing Haitian refugees to return home is justified by the argument that they are, for the most part, fleeing economic misery rather than the political persecution that faces their Cuban counterparts. Human rights observers, however, say the US position is at best rooted in the distinction that Cuban oppression is communist, rather than merely totalitarian, and at worst in the fact that most Cuban defectors are white and relatively well educated, while most Haitians are black.</p>

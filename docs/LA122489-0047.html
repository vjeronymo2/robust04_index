			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: 'TIS THE SEASON FOR GIFT BOOK GIVING TO THE MOVERS, SHAKERS  </P> <P> Combining the spirit of this holiday season with the spirit of this column, it  is time once again to suggest gift books for a select few involved with the  drift of architecture, planning and design in Southern California.  </P> <P> Most of the books are new, although a few have been recycled from holidays  past. Each in their way has a message, if only in the title.  </P> <P> To Mayor Tom Bradley: "The Living City" by Roberta Brandes Gratz (Simon &amp;  Schuster), a well-documented plea for thinking small and being sensitive to the  potential of historic preservation and community concerns, with a view toward  injecting new life into tired cities (and perhaps also into tired mayors).  </P> <P> To John Tuite, head of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency: "City:  Rediscovering the Center" by William H. Whyte (Doubleday), an insightful  exploration of why some downtowns work as people places, chock-full of ideas  that don't need a city council's approval.  </P> <P> To Kenneth Topping, Los Angeles planning director: "How to Save Your Own  Street" by Raquel Ramati (Doubleday). Although nearly 10 years old, and  fashioned for New York City, the book's focus and its detailing of street-wise  planning tools are very applicable to Los Angeles now, and a not-so-subtle plea  for some "get down" microplanning.  </P> <P> To Topping's patient staff, and persevering planners everywhere: "Right Before  Your Eyes: Penetrating the Urban Environment" by Grady Clay (APA Planners  Press), a collection of relaxed essays that engagingly relates planning and  design to everyday places and events.  </P> <P> To Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman: "Los Angeles in the Thirties:  1931-1941" by David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton (Hennessey &amp; Ingalls),  a revised and enlarged new edition of an informed and evocative view of the  city's embrace of the Moderne-styled decade.  </P> <P> On the cover is a photograph of the Pan Pacific Auditorium, one of the period's  architectural gems. For nearly 10 years, the landmark deteriorated while the  supervisor procrastinated over its fate, until fate stepped in and it was  destroyed by fire.  </P> <P> To Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, who no doubt will have to arbitrate  various controversial proposals to redevelop sections of the Fairfax District:  "Every Goy's Guide to Common Jewish Expressions," by Arthur Naiman  (Ballantine).  </P> <P> And as the paperback blurb says: "Also recommended for Jews who don't know  their punim from their pupik."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, of the adjoining district, no doubt knows the  difference, so to him, along with colleagues Marvin Braude, Gloria Molina and  Hal Bernson, goes: "Density By Design," edited by James Wentling and Lloyd  Bookout (Urban Land Institute). Included is a selection of case studies of the  trend toward more dense residential projects, with a knowing nod to community,  political, financial and market considerations.  </P> <P> At $48, "Density by Design" is a little pricey, but I'm sure the former head of  the city's Planning Commission, Dan Garcia, would be happy to put it on his  gift list. To Garcia, who now counsels developers, goes: "Icons and Aliens:  Law, Aesthetics, and Environmental Change" by John Costonis (University of  Illinois Press).  </P> <P> A copy also goes to Councilman Mike Woo, along with: "Holly wood: Legend and  Reality," (New York Graphic Society).  </P> <P> To Richard Weinstein, Bob Harris and Michael Rotundi, the trio of local  architecture school deans who form the core of the Mayor's Design Advisory  Committee: "Architecture: Meaning and Place," by Christian Norberg-Schulz,  (Rizzoli). This is a heady compilation of essays and lectures that attempts to  put architecture into a proper perspective.  </P> <P> To Gary Squier, Arnold Stalk, the L.A. Family Housing Corp. and the L.A.  Community Design Cen ter, to aid them in their continuing noble struggle for  decent housing: 'Reweaving the Urban Fabric," (Princeton Architectural Press).  The book explores the siting, design and development of quality, affordable  housing within existing neighborhoods.  </P> <P> To Scott Johnson, Richard Keating, Herb Nadel and Tom Landau, among other local  architects whose bent it is to scrape the skies with their buildings: "Towers:  A Historical Survey" by Erwin Heinle and Fritz Leonhardt (Rizzoli), a  well-illustrated survey of the construction of every conceivable high-rise  through the ages and around the world.  </P> <P> To Frank Gehry, Eric Owen Moss, Janek Bielski, Frank Israel, Michele Saee and  other local designers who are arbitrarily, and at times capriciously, labeled  avant-garde: "Social Design: Creating Buildings with People in Mind" by Robert  Sommer (Prentice Hall). The text points the way to more user-oriented and  environmentally sound designs; designs that are humanistic as well as  sculptural.  </P> <P> As for clients thinking of hiring a brand-name designer, or for that matter any  designer, to have a house built, expanded or renovated: "The Well-Built House"  by Jim Locke (Houghton-Mifflin), is a down-to-earth, easy-to-follow guide that  asks the right questions of the client, the architect and the contractor.  </P> <P> To Jay Rounds, Claire Bogaard and other indefatigable preservationists:  "Picture Palaces," "Ducks &amp; Diners" and "Mostly Moderne," (Preservation  Press), collections of postcards featuring views of assorted landmarks, ready  to be mailed to whatever public official or agency happens at the moment to be  thwarting preservation through their actions or inactions.  </P> <P> To Mitzi Mogul of Heritage Square, and the stalwarts of Carroll Avenue and  environs: "The Victo  </P> <P> rian House Book," by Robin Guild (Rizzoli), a sumptuous guide to the varied  styles and designs of the period, plus some sage, if pricey, renovating and  decorating ideas.  </P> <P> To Kurt Meyer, who because of the time he donates to various urban design  concerns here deserves a diversion elsewhere: "Andrea Palladio: The Complete  Works," by Lionello Puppi, (Rizzoli), a detailed review of the works of the  Italian master architect.  </P> <P> Also, because of their public service on behalf of the design profession, to  Barton Myers, Bill Fain, Fernando Juarez, Ray Gaio, Chet Widom and Edward  Friedrichs go copies of "Architectural Practice: A Critical View," by Robert  Gutman, (Princeton).  </P> <P> And to all my readers, on this the day before Christmas and the second day of  Hanukkah, happy holidays.  </P></p>

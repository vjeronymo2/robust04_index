			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIMPSON IN EARLY LEAD AT U.S. OPEN WITH 66  </P> <P> Tim Simpson found no trouble where trouble lives at Medinah's No. 3 monster  course, shooting a 6-under-par 66 today in the first round of the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> On the longest course ever used in the Open, 7,195 yards, Simpson took  advantage of overnight rain that softened Medinah's Teflon-like greens for two  nine-hole scores of 3-under 33 that included not a single bogey.  </P> <P> John Huston, who won the Honda Classic earlier this year after the PGA made him  change an illegal pair of shoes, was two shots back at 68. He shot a 35-33  while many of the field's top golfers still waited to tee off in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "You won't see a U.S. Open like this very often," Huston said. "It's a great  deal easier because of the rain."  </P> <P> Rain and thundershowers let up early this morning after forcing a half-hour  delay in the start of the opening round. Golfers then took advantage of the  softening greens to make good scores, and Simpson had the best of it.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service forecast called for periodic rain and  thundershowers through Saturday but predicted no prolonged storms.  </P> <P> Simpson got to 4-under with a birdie on No. 10, then birdied No. 14 and No. 17,  a 168-yard par-3 over water, to get to 6-under for the day.  </P> <P> Huston, tied for third in the Masters this year, turned in a 1-under 35, then  birdied Nos. 11, 14 and 15 to go 4-under.  </P> <P> "Not only were the greens softer, but they were slower," Huston said. "Some of  them are pretty severe, but even if you were above the hole today, you could  take a pretty good run at it."  </P> <P> Still on the course was Mike Donald, who got to 5-under on the backside, one  shot behind Simpson. He had a front nine of 1-under 35, then birdied Nos. 12,  13, 14 and 16.  </P> <P> Scott Hoch was in the clubhouse with a 2-under 70.  </P> <P> Brad Faxon and Ian Woosnam of Wales also had 70s. Each had 35s on both nines.  Bill Glasson and Jaime Gomez each were in the clubhouse with 71s. Glasson shot  34-37 after a bogey on No. 18, and Gomez was 36-35.  </P> <P> Curtis Strange, who won the last two Opens, got off to a slow start with bogeys  on the first and fourth holes, then got a stroke back with a birdie on the  526-yard, par-5 fifth. He bogeyed the ninth and made the turn in 2-over 38, but  got a stroke back with a birdie on the 11th. He stood at 1-over through 15  holes.  </P></p>

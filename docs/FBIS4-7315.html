			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Domestic production of  cars, trucks and buses fell in fiscal 1993 for the third year in  a row, slipping 12.0 percent to 10,849,827 vehicles for the  biggest fall in nearly 50 years, the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association said Monday [25 April].    It is the first time in the postwar period for the nation's  four- wheel vehicle production to fall for three straight years,  association officials said.    The latest annual fall was the largest since fiscal 1947,  when domestic auto output took an 18.9 percent tumble, they said.    The three-year string of declines was produced by a  prolonged  auto market slump at home against the backdrop of the worst  recession in decades.    For the fiscal year that ended March 31, production of  passenger cars fell 11.8 percent to 8,199.790 as weak output of  small cars offset a gain in larger cars.    Production of "compact" cars, or those with engine  displacement below 2000 cc, shrank 20.0 percent to 4,826,387.    Output of cars with engines of more than 2000 cc rose 4.3  percent to 2,587,133, underlining the shift to such models away  from compact cars.    Production of trucks declined 12.7 percent to 2,603,190,  while output of buses went down 11.8 percent to 46,847.    For March alone, domestic automobile production fell 9.4  percent from a year earlier to 1,054,608 vehicles for the 18th  straight month of decline, the association said.</p>

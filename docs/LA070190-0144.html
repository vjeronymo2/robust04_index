			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> HOMELESS BANNED FROM CENTER PLAZA  </P> <P> San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has announced that because a homeless shelter  will open soon, the homeless will no longer be allowed to camp at Civic Center  Plaza across from City Hall. Scores of indigents, mentally ill people and  runaways have lived under the park's olive trees for more than two years. The  mayor, who has come under criticism for not enforcing laws against spending the  night in public parks, promised last year to begin moving the homeless off the  streets.  </P></p>

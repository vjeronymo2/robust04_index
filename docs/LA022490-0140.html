			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND READY TO LET MARDI GRAS ROLL  </P> <P> Somehow, the motto of Mardi Gras seems to say it all: Laissez les bons temps  rouler! (Let the good times roll!) And Southlanders will be able to do just  that at festive celebrations today and Tuesday in Hermosa Beach, Santa Monica  and San Luis Obispo and on Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In French, Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday. The annual celebration falls on the  Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, a Christian period of  penitence and fasting that concludes on Easter Sunday. The idea is to have a  rip-roaring good time before Lent starts.  </P> <P> But it's not just for Christians. The good-humored fun is there for anyone to  enjoy. In fact, the origins of Mardi Gras are hazy, but it probably began in  the Middle Ages and may have been a way of giving religious significance to  ancient festivals celebrating the rites of spring. Today, it is celebrated in  much of Europe and the Americas.  </P> <P> The French brought the seeds of Mardi Gras with them when they colonized  Louisiana in 1699, but it took a while for the idea to catch on. The traditions  of Mardi Gras as it's now celebrated in New Orleans began in the 1880s and have  come to encompass a month of parades and parties culminating on Fat Tuesday,  which this year is Feb. 27.  </P> <P> In Latin America, this celebration is known as Carnival, which is believed to  come from the Latin phrase carne vale, "farewell to flesh."  </P> <P> In some countries, Carnival is celebrated on the three days before Ash  Wednesday, while other countries indulge in a monthlong revelry. The Rio de  Janeiro Carnival is perhaps best known, but Panama, Venezuela, Colombia,  Bolivia and Mexico also celebrate. In Mexico, part of the celebration includes  bidding farewell to Senor del Mal Humor, an effigy symbolizing bad feelings and  evil spirits.  </P> <P> Mardi Gras celebrations this year include:  </P> <P> * Hermosa Beach -- Queen Ida and the Bon Temps Zydeco Band bring their special  brand of music -- a mix of Cajun, Creole, reggae, calypso, country and blue  grass -- to the Hermosa Beach Civic Theatre, 710 Pier Ave., tonight at 8. Queen  Ida won a Grammy in 1983 for her album "On Tour."  </P> <P> Concert-goers are asked to come in costume to this Mardi Gras-themed event,  sponsored by the Hermosa Beach Community Center Foundation. A post-concert  reception featuring Cajun food from Jeanette's Classic American Cuisine is  included in the price of the concert tickets, which are $40 each. Tickets are  expected to be available at the door. For information, call (213) 318-3452.  </P> <P> * San Luis Obispo -- "It's Magic" is the theme of the annual Mardi Gras  celebration in San Luis Obispo today in the downtown area. Daytime events  include a gumbo cook-off and other New Orleans-style food, when Garden Street  becomes Bourbon Street West. A parade with bands, elaborate floats and costumed  characters starts at 7:15 p.m.  </P> <P> "It's not like a parade you've seen anywhere else," says Don Koberg, a  professor of architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He launched Mardi Gras  there about 12 years ago because he missed the celebrations of his native New  Orleans. "It's like a neighborhood Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans."  </P> <P> Koberg suggests parade-goers plan to come early and stay late and enjoy the  many parties being held in downtown eating establishments.  </P> <P> For those truly into the spirit of the event, there's the Mardi Gras Ball,  which will be held at San Luis Veterans Memorial, Monterey and Grand streets,  after the parade. Tickets for the ball are $20. Some tickets will be available  at the door, but only to those in appropriate costumes. The ball, Koberg says,  helps pay for the parade each year. For information, call (805) 543-0223.  </P> <P> * Olvera Street, Los Angeles -- The burning of Mal Humor is part of the  festivities planned on Olvera Street Tuesday starting at 6 p.m. There will be  dancing to the Latin rhythms of Los Marischal and a parade. Special  performances are also scheduled by Embrasamba, a Brazilian band, at 7 p.m. and  9 p.m. and Soul of Brazil, a dance company, at 7:30 p.m. Olvera Street shops  and restaurants will be open until about 10 p.m. For information, call (213)  687-4344.  </P> <P> * Santa Monica -- Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, is  presenting a parade, carnival and dance on Tuesday starting at 5 p.m., when the  members of the procession will gather on the grass meridian at Olympic  Boulevard and 11th Street. The parade, which will proceed to Highways, will  include performers from "Sex, God &amp; Politics," an intercultural festival  that plays there through April 14; 85 children from Edison Elementary School  for whom Hugo Sanchez, a Mexican artist in residence at Highways, helped create  costumes and masks, and walking murals and large movable puppets, also created  by Sanchez.  </P> <P> Linda Burnham, co-director of Highways, says the parade will be "small, but  colorful and interesting." The carnival, which will be held in a warehouse next  door to Highways, includes African food booths, mask-making booths, mural  painting and a display of murals by Sanchez. There is no admission charge for  the carnival. A dance at 8:30 p.m. is $5 per person and features the music of  San Andreas Fault, a band from Tijuana. For information, call (213) 453-1755.  </P> <P> You may well have also heard of the UCLA Mardi Gras, planned for May 18, 19 and  20, or the premiere of the Long Beach Mardi Gras due Oct. 13 and 14.  </P> <P> Actually, the UCLA festival has little to do with Mardi Gras other than the  name. The event, a fund-raiser for UniCamp, a UCLA charity for underprivileged  children, is actually a carnival with rides, food booths, games and crafts,  mimes, clowns and magicians. Admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children.  </P> <P> Then how did it get the name Mardi Gras? Karla Johnson, public relations and  promotion director for the event, says it began as a masquerade ball in 1941  when a Mardi Gras theme was chosen. The event evolved into a carnival, but the  name was maintained because of the recognition it had acquired. UCLA Mardi Gras  is held at the UCLA athletic field at the corner of Sunset and Westwood  boulevards. For information call (213) 825-8001.  </P> <P> The Long Beach event will try to recreate the atmosphere of Mardi Gras, but it  was scheduled in October for two reasons. First, holding it in late February  would place it too close to the Long Beach Grand Prix, according to Linda S.  Wall, president of Mardi Gras International, the firm presenting the festival.  </P> <P> Also, she says, it wasn't desirable to be in direct competition with the annual  Mardi Gras in New Orleans, because her firm hopes to build the Long Beach event  to one of national stature.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Mardi Gras will include a golf tournament, a cruise; Mardi Gras  ShoreFest with entertainment, Cajun food and international music; the "Wanna-Be  Parade" (participants are encouraged to be whoever or whatever they "wanna be")  and the Mardi Gras U.S. Western Regional Kinetic Sculpture Race, where  people-powered vehicles that are also works of art traverse terrain obstacles  such as mud and sand. For information, call (213) 433-2400.  </P></p>

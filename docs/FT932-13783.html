			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: Kvaerner wins its biggest single order THE Norwegian group Kvaerner Engineering has won a Nkr1bn (Pounds 96m) contract - its biggest single order - for engineering and construction work on a new gas platform in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The contract was placed by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for its Sleipner 'T' gas treatment platform. The contract extends over four years as part of the Sleipner West development. Kvaerner said the contract meant it taking on part of the project management traditionally performed by the oil companies. Allocating part of the project risk to contractors - known as partnering - is becoming popular as a way for the oil industry to cut costs.</p>

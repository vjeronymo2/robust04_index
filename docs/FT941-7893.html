			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Digital is that bit better Digital television is to analogue TV as a superstore is to the corner shop. Once information is coded in a common digital form, the possibilities become almost infinite. Digital signals are the traffic on an information superhighway. In practice, any form of information - text, graphics, sound, video images - can be represented in computer language as a code of a series of binary digits (bits). Bits are transmitted along a communications channel - cable, telephone line, or through the ether - to the television set. Powerful computers and clever software sort the bits out, one from another, and recombine them into information which can be displayed on the screen and output through the loud speakers. There are two principal advantages. First, the reproduction of information coded in bits is more accurate than analogue transmission. So quality of sound and image is significantly better. Colours are better presented. Patterns appear natural instead of the mess of ghosts and halos seen on conventional television sets. Second, bits representing various kinds of information travel together in the same channel, making possible interactive multi-media. Still and moving pictures can be combined on one screen; high fidelity sound, graphics and text can be added. Most important, the viewer will be able to interact with the programme displayed, sending messages and instructions back along the transmission path in digital form.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US Report into BCCI: Morgenthau's office wins lavish praise OF ALL the myriad US institutions involved in the investigation and regulation of BCCI, only one is the subject of consistent praise in the Kerry report - the office of Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney. But for Mr Morgenthau's work, the Bank of England 'might well have proceeded with BCCI's restructuring regardless of the new revelations about fraud, and simply hoped for the best', the report said. Mr Morgenthau, who brought the first wide-ranging fraud charges against BCCI in July last year, is singled out as having been far ahead of US or British authorities in uncovering criminality at BCCI and credited with having essentially forced both the Bush administration and the Bank of England into taking action against BCCI in the period leading up to the bank's shutdown in July last year. In the end, the report remarks, it was not the regulatory process itself that brought about the exposure and removal of BCCI from either the US or the UK. The ultimate regulatory action was prompted by the criminal investigation brought by Mr Morgenthau. On August 21 1989, the Federal Reserve was told by an aide to Mr Morgenthau that an informant had reported that BCCI had secret control of First American Bankshares, the Washington bank then chaired by Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary. The Fed took no action in response, according to the Kerry report. It did learn more in late 1989 about ties between BCCI and First American from the Bank of England. But for Mr Morgenthau's work, the Kerry report concludes, the Fed might never have learned from the Bank of England, Price Waterhouse and Abu Dhabi that auditors to BCCI had found damaging evidence on the bank. If Mr Morgenthau is singled out for praise, the US Department of Justice, the US Treasury and the Central Intelligence Agency are sharply censured in the Kerry report. The Fed is described as having been negligent during much of the 1980s, but is praised for its work since January 1991. In investigating BCCI, the Fed's efforts were, according to the report, hampered by a lack of co-operation by foreign governments and agencies, including the Serious Fraud Office in the UK and, since the BCCI closure, the government of Abu Dhabi. The SFO is accused of having prevented the Fed from interviewing certain witnesses and reviewing certain documents in the UK. Although Abu Dhabi has claimed that it is co-operating with the US, the Kerry report says the government's refusal to make available 18 witnesses and many important documents has gravely hindered the Fed's ability to complete its BCCI investigations. The Justice Department, the report says, 'essentially stopped investigating BCCI in connection with First American after the spring of 1990, until press accounts, Fed action and the New York district attorney's investigation pushed them into action in the spring of 1991'. The report even cites evidence of one federal prosecutor who acknowledged making misrepresentations to Fed officials and to Mr Morgenthau's office concerning the existence of documents critical to their work.</p>

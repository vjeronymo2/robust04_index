			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would implement a new system of post mortem inspection, require re-inspection of all reprocessed birds on the main processing line, revised the existing finished product standards program, and require the use of an antimicrobial treatment before the chilling operation. The proposed new inspection system is intended to assure that only uncontaminated poultry would enter the chiller and the required antimicrobial treatment is applied to every carcass. A benefit of these is to reduce the chance of cross-contamination in the chilling operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Inspection Sequence Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would replace all existing systems of poultry post-mortem inspection with a single system in which two FSIS inspectors would staff each poultry processing line. The first inspector would examine eviscerated poultry at an ``on-line post-mortem inspection station,'' located at or near the present post-mortem inspection position. This inspector would assure that carcasses sorted by the establishment are free of condemnable pathology or are properly designated for off-line trim, salvage, or reprocessing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second inspection station, the ``on-line/off-line carcass inspection station,'' would be positioned just before the chiller. The inspector at this station would perform on-line inspection for fecal contamination thus ensuring that no visible fecal contamination is present on carcasses entering the chiller. This inspector would also be responsible for observing plant operations between the viscera harvest and the final wash and for reinspecting all reprocessed birds on the line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests that comments on the proposal include information and data on this proposed inspector sequence, or information and data relative to any alternatives to this proposed inspector sequence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Establishment Responsibilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Establishment personnel, known as sorters, would be positioned before the first FSIS inspector. This position will be a reassignment of duties for the current plant presenters and inspector helpers. The establishment sorters differ in responsibility from the inspectors' helpers under the current regulations because the sorters would be more active in detecting disease and abnormality and sorting birds affected by such conditions from normal birds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required establishment sorter or sorters would be responsible for assuring that no diseased poultry requiring condemnation are presented for FSIS inspection. They would designate poultry for off-line salvage, trimming, or reprocessing, or condemn the birds prior to presentation for inspection, and they would be required to record all condemnations on a disposition reporting form required for the purpose. Only those birds without condemnable conditions would be permitted to reach the post-mortem inspection station, except for those designated and marked for reprocessing, knife-salvage, or other off-line procedures. These would be removed from the evisceration line only after the bird passed the FSIS post-mortem inspector at the on-line post-mortem inspection station but before the viscera harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal, as is currently required, the establishment would have to position an employee after the post-mortem inspector and before the viscera harvest. This employee would be required to perform duties such as removing carcasses marked for salvage or reprocessing, or placing birds on hangback racks for veterinary disposition or correlation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment also would continue to be required to position one or more trimmers after the giblet harvest and before the final wash. These trimmers would continue to perform the duties required by the current regulations, but they would have the additional responsibility of removing for reprocessing birds that are contaminated with feces on the inner surfaces and assuring that only birds that are properly trimmed are presented to the FSIS inspector at the on-line/off-line carcass inspection station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reprocessing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, reinspection of reprocessed birds by FSIS is done by random sampling of lots. The proposed system would require all reprocessed birds to be returned to the main processing line at a point before the second FSIS inspector to assure that they are reinspected. If any reprocessed bird were found with fecal contamination, all birds remaining in the reprocessed lot would be returned to the establishment's reprocessing station for rework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian companies get head start in race for Chinese gold A company owned by American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, and Power Corporation, the Canadian investment holding company, is close to finalising two gold exploration and development ventures with the China National Gold Corporation. The letters of intent signed yesterday are part of an ambitious drive by the two Canadian companies, operating as Barrick Power Gold Corporation of China, to lead the modernisation and expansion of China's fragmented gold-mining industry. Barrick Power, which is 75 per cent owned by Barrick and 25 per cent by Power, is confident that it has a head start on other western mining companies in China. It has a staff of more than a dozen in its Beijing office. CNGC agreed earlier this year to submit prospective gold-mining properties to Barrick Power for evaluation. Under one of the proposed joint ventures, Barrick Power will acquire a 75 per cent stake and provide management, technology and financing for the Paishanlou project in Liaoning province. The venture will have an initial capital of USDollars 40m. A pre-feasibility study, started earlier this year, envisages an open-pit mine producing 30,000 tonnes of ore a day, plus a 4,000 tonnes-per-day mill. Barrick Power said that further drilling was due to take place next year near the existing deposit and that a mining plan would be completed by the end of 1995. The second joint venture centres on the Changkeng deposit in Guangdong province. Samples from this refractory deposit have already been tested at Barrick's Goldstrike mine in Nevada, with 'high recovery rates'. Barrick Power said that it planned a 'major' exploration programme at Changkeng in 1995 once the joint venture company had been set up. The announcements coincided with a 400-strong trade mission to China led by Canada's prime minister Mr Jean Chretien.</p>

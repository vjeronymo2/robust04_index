			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by mu: "The President Does Not Sue Anybody"] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana, 28 January -- Yesterday afternoon,  Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, was a guest for an hour on  the live call-in show hosted by Glas Ljubljane Radio Chief  Editor Ales Kardelj. Kucan talked with the editor and answered  listeners' questions.    With regard to Mrs. Albright's invitation for Slovenia to  join the Partnership for Peace program within the NATO  framework, which was also the topic of yesterday's talks between  President Kucan and U.S. Ambassador Wendt, Kucan emphasized that  the NATO Council will make the final decision. It will not only  debate the military aspect of the partnership but will also  evaluate the openness of the Slovene economy and the human  rights situation in our country. The president hopes that we  will pass these "entrance" exams. He noted only one possible  deterrent: We still do not have civilian control over the  military sector.    With regard to Slovene relations with the Balkans, he thinks  it is necessary for Slovenia to formulate a clear strategy  towards this area now and not to wait until the end of the war  when it would be ineffective.    Referring to the Geneva agreement between Milosevic and  Tudjman, Kucan did not see any reason for optimism if this is  only an agreement between two partners at the expense of the  third one, that is, at the expense of Bosnia and the Muslims.    Referring to new party alliances in Slovenia, he said that  it  is a natural tendency for the parties to unite and form  alliances. He expects a merger of the parties on the right and  in the center of the political spectrum in the near future while  nobody wants to be on the left yet. He is concerned by the  trend to polarize the political arena, to divide the people  between "ours" and "yours," "red" and "black."    Evaluating the effort to create an independent Slovene  state,  he said that, accordingto the European standards, we succeeded.  However, now that we have to organize life in a state that is  law-abiding and socially responsible, a will to define a common  interest and common vision seems to be lacking. In his  assessment, people in power are not sufficiently aware that, in  the final analysis, all the government's decisions must serve  the people.    Responding to the question as to whether he, as a president,  is suing somebody at a time when this seems to be the "fashion,"  he stated that he is not suing anybody, although he would have  reasons to seek moral satisfaction; however, he does not want to  solve political disputes in court since the courts have a  backlog already.</p>

"We in Azapo will intensify the struggle in all forms and  all  the components of the black consciousness movement, including  the Azanian Liberation Army [Azanla], are urged to fight to the  bitter end," Azapo Natal Chairman Patrick Mkhize told a press  conference.    Blacks had been sold out by deals struck at the Kempton Park  negotiating forum and Azapo was distributing more than 10  million pamphlets advising blacks not to participate in the  "sham elections", he said.    Azapo would also prevent the National Party and the  Democratic Party from recruiting black support in townships, he  added. Mr Mkhize said the black consciousness army, the Azanian  Liberation Army, would intensify its military campaign although  there was no specific programme of action against the April poll.    "Azanla will continue to fight until people are free," he  said. Only when land "stolen from black people by settlers" had  been returned would there be true liberation. Voting in the  April elections would be tantamount to blacks "rubber stamping  the selling of their land for life", he maintained.    Mr Mkhize said he could not elaborate on Azanla's military  agenda as "it has its own programme of action". He stressed,  however, that Azanla would never become part of the national  peace keeping force but would become "the army of the people  when South Africa is free".    Asked whether Azanla would continue armed action after the  elections, he replied: "As long as the aspirations of black  people have not been met the struggle continues."    He said the questions of homelessness, landlessness, poverty  and hunger had not been addressed by Kempton Park negotiators.    Mr Mkhize claimed Azapo was daily gaining support and had  more than 20,000 members in Natal.</p>

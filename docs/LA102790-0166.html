			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FOG DELAYS FLIGHTS AT WAYNE AIRPORT  </P> <P> More than a dozen early morning flights out of John Wayne Airport were delayed  by heavy fog Friday, and meteorologists predicted that conditions will remain  virtually unchanged throughout the weekend.  </P> <P> Airport officials reported delays of 15 to 35 minutes on 16 flights, but some  passengers said they waited about an hour for the fog to burn away. Still, most  travelers seemed unfazed by the delays and passed the time either admiring the  new terminal design or grumbling about airport parking costs.  </P> <P> "The delays I expect, but the parking . . . it's outrageous!" said Frank Cier  of Diamond Bar, referring to new terminal parking charges that run as high as  $14 a day.  </P> <P> The higher parking charges went into effect last month when the $310-million  terminal opened to the public. Long-term parking lots north of the terminal are  expected to continue operating at least through early December at $7 a day.  </P> <P> Cier and his wife, Pam Eversole, who were bound for Miami on vacation, were  told their flight would be 20 to 25 minutes late.  </P> <P> "I'll be mad if we miss our flight in Dallas," Eversole said.  </P> <P> Slumped in her seat at an American Airlines gate, Sera Oxner of Mountainside,  N.J., seemed more impressed with the design of the new terminal than upset by  the wait.  </P> <P> "It's very comfortable," she said. "Everything is very clean -- a very  nice-looking airport."  </P> <P> While early-morning air travelers can expect delays as long as the fog lasts,  meteorologists agree the pattern should be short-lived.  </P> <P> Forecasts through Sunday call for the system of stable high pressure to  continue its dominance over much of Southern California, bringing with it  late-night and early-morning fog.  </P> <P> "This pattern is just right to hold the pollution in there too," said Steve  Burback, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The  Times. "But the morning heating should break it up very quickly."  </P> <P> Burback said a break in the pattern and cooler temperatures could arrive by  Sunday night.  </P> <P> Joseph Davies, area supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration, said  the fog presented "minimal impact" Friday, adding that much of it had burned  off by about 7:20 a.m. KEVIN JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, May 18 (ATA) -- A considerable number of  Serb soldiers are deployed recently in the border area between  Albania and Kosova so banning the Albanian farmers from using  the pasture land. They have declared it "forbidden area,"  because it is near the border zone. The army has blocked the  roads that lead to the pasture land and conducts a severe  search, prohibiting so the free pass of people.    Against such measures, have reacted the Albanian political  subjects of Decan commune and has appealed to the farmers to be  cautious not to fall into the trap of the Serb militaries.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> PLANNERS ENDORSE SUBDIVISION PLAN  </P> <P> The Camarillo Planning Commission recommended Tuesday that the City Council  approve the subdivision of a 31.51-acre tract at Upland Road and Terra Bella  Lane.  </P> <P> Michael Guyer is seeking to create 36 parcels for the development of  single-family residences on the property.  </P> <P> The council, which has final say on whether the property is subdivided, will  consider the issue June 13. Guyer would still be required to apply for building  permits to develop the housing tract.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the commission approved a plan allowing Oxnard-based TOLD  Corp. to remodel a 310,000-square-foot building near Mission Oaks Boulevard and  Dawson Drive. The decision allows at least three more tenants to use the  building for offices, manufacturing and warehouse space.  </P> <P> The building on the 38-acre site will include upgrading of the exterior to  bring the appearance more in line with the city's Heritage Zone. Set up by the  city, the zone requires an early California architectural style, including  mission tile roofs and stucco walls.  </P> <P> The commission also voted to allow Ventura Pacific Capital Corp. to build a  two-story office building on the east side of Camarillo Springs Road, south of  the Ventura Freeway. The commission agreed to allow the height of the building  to be 48 feet -- 13 feet higher than the usual 35-foot limit -- to allow for  additional architectural features, such as two Mediterranean-style towers.

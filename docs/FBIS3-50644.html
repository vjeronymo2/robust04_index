			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Barragan; from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Mexican Bishops Conference issued an official  communique today on the events that have occurred in Chiapas.  The communique is signed by Monsignor Ramon Godinez Flores,  auxiliary bishop of Guadalajara and secretary general of  Mexico's Bishop conference and, therefore, official spokesman of  the Mexican Catholic Church. In the communique, Flores stated  that the Bishops Conference called for respectful and truthful  dialogue between both parties; in addition, he stated that  dialogue is necessary, adding that those who assumed arms must  be heard, because they have been unheard for a long time.    The most important part of this one-and-a-half page  communique reads: What must we do? First of all, we must hear  the clamor of these brothers and many more Mexicans, some of  whom have assumed arms, others who are taking refuge in not  participating in the elections, as well as others who are  desperate over not finding solutions to the crises we are  facing. This is like a voice of God; we must all hear and know  how to interpret it.    Flores also added in his communique: Those who have  authority must be attentive to discover the sense of these  voices and not try to repress them violently. These are voices  of anguish and desperation. The very peasants who assumed arms  have said this is not a war to destroy, rather, to build a  better fatherland.    Commenting on this situation, Flores, as official spokesman  of the Mexican Bishops Conference, said:    [Begin recording] [Flores] These are incidents that must be  dealt with carefully. They cannot simply be interpreted as a  confrontation between one army against another or for a  political change. They are requesting that their just demands  be met, and they themselves must be a part of this to overcome  these difficulties. They cannot just wait until their  difficulties are solved; they must act to overcome their crises.  [end recording]    The church representative explained later that Christians  must pray so that God will give us a peaceful heart and we may  act with prudence and wisdom in these difficult times. He said:  This will permit us to build peace based on justice, making the  plan of God--who gave us the resources of nature to benefit all  and not a few--a reality.    This is the most important part of the official communique  by  the Mexican Bishops Conference on the events in Chiapas, issued  on 4 January 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with European Commissioner Karel Van </F> Miert by Wim Brummelman; place and date not given: "Van Miert  Fears for Europe"]    [Text] Brussels, 26 February -- European Commissioner Karel  Van Miert (aged 52), is not exactly optimistic about cooperation  in Europe. Recently, as the man responsible for competition  policy, he has noticed how the recession has fanned the flames  of nationalistic tendencies in Europe once again. "Regardless  of the political color of the government, we are seeing that the  longer the pressure goes on, the less easy it is to withstand  the temptation to simply give government support in one way or  another when a particular company is threatened with bankruptcy  or a specific sector is threatened with difficulties."    Van Miert merely sees the problems facing European  cooperation mounting up further over the next few years. He  fears the European Union (EU) risks being ripped apart in the  discussion on "enlargement" or "consolidation." Now already, it  often is so difficult to maintain even slight coherence in the  EU's approach. So what will the situation be like in the near  future when the four new member states -- Norway, Sweden,  Finland, and Austria -- have joined, each with their own  specific demands and sensitivities, or when subsequently, over  the following few years, further enlargements appear on the  agenda, e.g., involving Malta?    Van Miert entertains serious misgivings about this. He  predicts that if the EU soldiers on like it is doing at present  -- clinging frantically to the present hybrid structure of the  EU in which some decisions are made at Community level with a  majority, while others are the result of negotiations between  the member states which require unanimity -- then definitely it  will sink further into the morass of indecisiveness and  impotence.    If the EU does not strengthen drastically its decisionmaking  mechanism, it will preprogram its "own disintegration,"  reiterated the European commissioner several times during the  interview. He believes already there have been various  indications pointing toward disintegration, rather than  integration. "Finally the time has come to stare the problem in  the face," he said.    Van Miert believes it is of fundamental importance to the  functioning of the EU that a breakthrough be made in the current  situation, where even a single member state can block  decisionmaking in Brussels. That would mean departing from the  principle of unanimity. Moreover, this immediately would throw  up the question as to whether each member state, large or small,  in the future should still continue to have to designate its own  candidate for the European Commission. At present there are 17  members of the Commission, but this number will rise to 21 when  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria accede.    Van Miert agrees with those critics who maintain that such  "mechanical" enlargement will go ahead at the cost of  efficiency. He believes an executive body of around 15 members  is sufficient. "If we progress toward having 20 or more, then  that will complicate matters here even further. As a result,  the various areas of responsibility would have to be divided up  even further, and you know what people say: The more members a  government comprises, the more bickering goes on, and the longer  business takes. So I do not consider it to be a positive  development. However, you then run up against the problem that  lies at the heart of the matter: As long as the rule dictates  that every member state must have at least one member of the  Commission, you will automatically see the Commission's  enlargement. I find the desirability of such a trend highly  questionable, but changing things would inevitably mean moving  away from a principle that is regarded as virtually sacred by  all the member states."    Agreement has been reached within the EU that such  institutional questions will be avoided for the time being.  Indeed, they will only feature on the agenda in 1996, when the  Maastricht Treaty will be taken a step further. By then, a  formula must be found for settling relations between the small  and large member states within the various European bodies.    The question is whether the EU really can afford such a  repetition of the debate on Maastricht, given the competing  interests and views of the member states. "If another debate is  going to be allowed to proceed in the classical manner, then I  fear it will go on forever." For that reason, Van Miert  proposes a radical solution: The member states must go ahead  with negotiations on the desired mode of organization of the EU  which also involves the European Parliament (EP). The result  then should be put to a referendum, but not in the same way as  happened with the Maastricht Treaty, where a Danish "No"  succeeded in bringing the whole procedure to a standstill.    Van Miert says: "Put the result to the entire population of  the EU, rather than holding one referendum in each member state  where the smallest country is entitled to block the whole  development, because otherwise we would be preprogramming our  own disintegration in the long term. No, we should organize a  referendum for the total population of the EU. However, that  will present us with an almost fundamental problem. That, we  will say, is the result of the negotiations, including the  contribution made by the EP. Go ahead and say what is on your  mind. That would be a logical way to proceed. However, I am  probably daydreaming, saying something like that."    Van Miert, who was born in Oud-Turnhout, and for 10 years  served as chairman of the Flemish Socialist Party, as well as  being a former member of the Belgian and European Parliaments,  was appointed commissioner responsible for transport in 1989.  Last year he inherited the portfolio on competition from Sir  Leon Brittan. Diplomats in Brussels describe him as a capable  pragmatist, as someone who does not allow others to walk all  over him, but who is always prepared to seek solutions and is  readily approachable.  <H5>  Reorganization of Steel Sector Within EU Virtually Comatose </H5>   In recent months, Van Miert was kept busy primarily by the  crisis in the European steel industry, where tens of thousands  of jobs are on the line. For 18 months now there has been talk  within the EU of a voluntary restructuring of the destitute  steel sector. The industry and the European Commission have  agreed that money will be made available by Brussels for social  accompanying measures on condition that the steel companies  themselves table credible plans for reducing production  capacity. Moreover, the Commission is helpful in other ways,  among others by giving the companies price indications and  "guarding" external European borders against already superficial  imports.    Last December, agreement was reached on reducing the  production capacity of a number of Spanish, Italian, German, and  Portuguese companies, which recently received state subsidies.  The conclusion of that agreement marked the end of the first  phase of the restructuring operation. Now it is the turn of  privately owned companies that do not receive state subsidies to  present their plans for reducing their production capacity.  However, so far only an insufficient number of companies has  tabled their plans. In actual fact, the "private sector"  companies consider that the state-subsidized companies like  Ilva, CSI, and Eko Stahl, are being made to concede too little.    As a result, the entire restructuring operation is being  threatened with failure. In any case, Van Miert is seriously  reckoning with such an outcome, and he is not that surprised by  these developments. In the steel dossier, says Van Miert, the  power of the individual member states and the impotence of the  European Commission comes particularly to the fore. He feels  like a referee who first has to ask for the views of the players  who have committed an offense before deciding whether to give  them a warning or send them off: "That does not generate  results, it is just an endless mess."    "How does that work in practice? As a European commissioner,  you approach, say, the Spanish Government, telling it that it  must close such-and-such a company, because it is not  profitable, or that it must reduce its capacity by a certain  percentage, if it wants us to give our approval in Brussels for  government support. What does the appropriate minister then  say? Mr. Van Miert, we cannot agree to this. And we shall meet  again in the Council of Ministers, because I have the right of  veto there. So, if you do not go along with what I want, the  dossier will simply be blocked. In this way, the Spanish  dossier has been blocked for nearly one year now. In Italy,  they are simply saying: No government subsidies whatsoever were  granted here. And why can they get away with that? Because  they have a damned right of veto."    Van Miert has no problem at all doing the rounds in Europe  doggedly. However, he certainly wants the whole story to be  told, and to avoid the criticisms going no further than the  reproach that the Commission extracted too few concessions from  the Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese Governments in the  negotiations. "I understand this reaction, but then I say:  Please aim your remarks at those who are responsible for the  situation, and not at those who have done their very best to  make as much progress as possible. I have never concealed the  fact that I would have liked to have made the negotiations (with  the governments in Italy, Spain, Germany, and Portugal  respectively -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) bear much more  fruit than they did, if only I had been given the opportunities  to do so. However, unlike the German Government, I simply  cannot say one day that things are completely insufficient, and  then block things the next day because of Eko Stahl. Such a  situation would mean we are just going round in circles."    Last week, Van Miert and his colleague Martin Bangemann (the  commissioner responsible for industry -- NRC HANDELSBLAD  editor's note) invited representatives of the European  association of steel companies, Eurofer, to participate in  informal talks. At these talks, the European commissioners  issued a clear warning that Brussels will take its hands off the  restructuring plan if the steel groups fail to come up with  sufficient reductions in capacity in the near future. "I gained  the impression that the message was received loud and clear,"  said Bangemann last week.    Van Miert also shares that impression. However, that does  not yet mean any actual headway has been made. "Nothing has  emerged so far. We will let things run on for another few  weeks, and then reassess the situation," he said stoically.  "Naturally, Eurofer also is split into various factions. When  I talk to Eurofer, I am sitting at the table with Ilva, CSI, and  Klckner, as well as with Hoogovens and British Steel. So it is  a really thorny problem. I always say it with a smile on my  face, but in fact it is dramatically accurate: There are only  two things on which the steel companies mutually agree: To form  a cartel under these circumstances, and to take potshots at the  Commission."    The wait-and-see attitude on the part of the steel companies  is being strengthened further by the relative lack of concern on  the part of the steel market. "Yes that also plays a role.  People hope the sun will be shining again during the second  half of this year or in 1995. Consequently, people are arguing  in favor of simply riding out the recession. Should it turn out  reductions in capacity are inescapable, as everyone wants, then  only reductions by the neighbors should be done. So my analysis  leads me to believe we will not make much headway."    Van Miert foresees two developments. An increasing number of  companies that have so far managed on their own will now go  banging on the door of their regional authorities for support.  The first indications of this are already visible, also in  other sectors, claims the commissioner. Admittedly, governments  simply may not provide such support. However, nobody can  prohibit a government from banging on the door in Brussels in  order to ask for approval, whereupon the whole procedure starts  from the beginning again.    The other development is that steel companies in Europe  increasingly will have to work together or merge. Van Miert  even prefers it this way: "I think it is good if you analyze  the situation as moving in that direction. After all, the  current number of steel companies is surely rather excessive."  However, he imposes clear conditions on this development. "Of  course, mergers may not be allowed to result in dominant  positions in certain segments of the market. A line has to be  drawn to prevent circumstances from arising whereby the market  no longer plays a role for certain products."</p>

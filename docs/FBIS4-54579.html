			<p>BFN     [Text] ROMPRES agency received a fax with a message to the  country by former sovereign Mihai of Romania regarding the visit  he was going to pay to Romania to, quote, jointly pray for the  country, unquote. According to the message, the presence of the  former sovereign would have guaranteed civic and moral peace as  well as the spiritual peace that the country needs in order to  come out of self-doubt, discouragement, and fear. Considering  that the unjust decision on his exclusion -- a decision taken  more than 40 years ago by the leaders of the communist coup  d'etat -- is also upheld at the highest state levels today,  Mihai of Romania announces that he does not want to lose hope  and, along with the Christian formula of Christ Is Reborn, adds:  It is high time that your patience should bear fruit. The  message continues, quote: My fate is in your hands. It is up  to each one of you whether I can return home. The time has come  that, after sacrifices and suffering, we should be again  together, for our fatherland's revival.    In connection with the message sent by Romania's former king  on the Holy Easter holidays, a message which contains several  references to his cancellation of his visit to Romania, the  Romanian spokesperson was authorized to state the following: As  announced, the Romanian Government has expressed its regret that  the invitation it has sent to the former king -- for the first  time since the abolition of the monarchy -- to pay a private  visit to Romania on the occasion of the Holy Easter holidays  this year was not met with an appropriate response, despite the  fact that the government has shown itself ready to ensure the  proper organization and development of the visit.  Unfortunately, the former king's message clearly reveals the  true reasons for his refusal to accept the government's  proposals, which were made in the context of strict observation  of the country's constitutional provisions.    The real aim of the visit, as it resulted from the text of  the message, was to create conditions for his comeback on  Romania's political scene, something which directly contradicts  his previous statements, whereby the former king said that he  wants to pay a private visit and does not challenge the  constitutional order. Moreover, the message contains inciting  calls, capable of disturbing the public quiet and law and order  in the country, the communique points out. The government  intends to exert its prerogatives, by strictly observing the  principles and norms of the rule-of-law state, as sanctioned by  Romania's Constitution, in order to ensure a climate of quiet  and public order, which are so necessary for the further  democratization of our political and social life.    Therefore, the government cannot accept -- in any form or  under any pretext -- such actions, which may jeopardize the  constitutional order in the country. The government is firmly  determined to treat any future intent of the former king to  visit Romania in the same way, only on the basis of a clear  commitment by the latter to observe the constitutional order in  Romania.</p>

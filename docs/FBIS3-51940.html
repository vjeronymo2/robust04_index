			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos Presidential </F> Residence in Mexico City; from the "Vector 21" newscast]    [Excerpts] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari traveled  this morning to Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas State,  to give his full attention and time to efforts for promoting  peace, justice, and democracy, as well as to efforts to support  the human rights of the people of Chiapas State. At the  Government Palace, the president met with 42 representatives of  280 peasant and Indian organizations. For one and one-half  hours, he listened to the demands of the various  representatives, all of whom spoke with great sincerity, and he  had answers for each one of them. He told them that, first, the  emergency would be addressed, but he added that measures also  would be taken to combat and resolve long-term problems.    President Salinas listed the specific plans to assist those  people who have been affected by the violence that has been  unleashed since 1 January. He said:    1. In terms of supplies, Conasupo [National Company for  Basic  Commodities] Director Javier Bonilla Garcia will remain in  Chiapas to ensure regular food supplies to the conflict zone  without overlooking other areas.    2. In terms of medical services, the Health Secretariat and  the Mexican Social Security Institute will establish aid  centers, especially for families within the conflict zone.    3. Widows and orphans will receive aid through a trust that  must begin operating before the end of the week. It will give  government assistance to widows, as well as scholarships to  orphans of the conflict.    4. The authorities will offer facilities that will enable  families to return.    5. Facilities will be offered to the State Council of  Indigenous and Peasant Organizations of Chiapas.    6. The president said that human rights will be respected,  and he gave assurances that the commission headed by Dr. Jorge  Madrazo will not conceal anything and will review with  impartiality and resolve all reports from and charges made by  the people.    7. Regarding Agrarian topics, Agrarian Reform Secretary  Victor Cervera will open an office in Chiapas to help in  whatever way it can and to offer alternatives to land demands  that cannot be met.    8. To benefit conflict participants under the Amnesty Law,  Dr. Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary for the Amnesty Law  Commission, is also in Chiapas State. The president explained  that in terms of crimes committed prior to the enforcement of  the Amnesty Law, the state government, together with the  National Indian Institute, will study how to implement a  comprehensive system of justice, which will include reforms to  the Penal Code.    9. The president also dealt with the issue of peace -- the  great goal being sought at this moment in Chiapas State. Let us  listen to what the president said:    [Begin Salinas recording] We want peace, and not merely to  return to the old situation. We want peace, but we want to  begin on a new footing. I quote [words indistinct] said: A new  stage in Chiapas State of solidarity, respect, support, and  construction. This is the promise all of us are making in favor  of Chiapas, and I want to tell you [words indistinct]. I am  convinced that this will allow us to move ahead in the projects,  as was explained here, not only has prevented the solution of  urgent problems, but also in- depth problems. [sentence as  heard] This is what it is all about, and this will prevent a  return to the previous situation. We will confront this  situation with the agenda that several of you have outlined, and  this will enable us to jointly enter this new stage. [end  recording]    President Carlos de Gortari's trip was doubtless unexpected,  but it was carried out after peasant and Indian organizations  last night invited him to travel as soon as possible to Ocosingo  or to San Cristobal de las Casas to listen first-hand to those  affected by the violence there.    On Tuesday, 25 days after the conflict began, the president  began his trip at approximately 0800. He arrived at Military  Base No. 6 in Tuxtla Gutierrez accompanied by his private  secretary (Justo Ceja) and General Arturo Cardona, chief of the  presidential general staff. The meeting with the Indians and  peasants was held at the Government Palace. After listening to  all of the participants -- 20 in all -- the president stressed  that the government will comply with all that was promised,  adding that it will continue to nurture the project he called  Life Through Dialogue, Reason, and Respect for Human Life [para  la vida, por la via del dialogo, la razon el respeto a la vida  humana].    The president left a message for the people of Chiapas. This  message was broadcast over the local radio and television  stations. The message justifies the Army's work in Chiapas  State. [passage omitted]    At about 1500, the president returned to the official Los  Pinos residence. Before entering, he was interviewed by  reporters. He was asked about the work of Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. The  president responded by saying Manuel Camacho has fulfilled the  responsibilities he assumed, adding that Camacho Solis has  exhibited loyalty to the institutions, the president of the  Republic, and the entire Mexican nation.    In addition, when asked whether the national solidarity  program would remain in effect, the president said solidarity  has proven it can produce specific results for the benefit of  the poor, and this is why the program will continue to be  strengthened, because this has been requested by those who have  been helped by the program.</p>

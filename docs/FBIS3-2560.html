			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jim Cheung] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Council yesterday passed a motion  calling on the government to lobby for unconditional renewal of  China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status by the United  States. "The renewal of China's MFN status should not be linked  to human rights or any other nontrade related conditions," said  Liberal Party legislator James Tien who moved the motion.    U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an executive order last  year specifying that China's MFN status would only be renewed if  it improved its human rights record.    Mr Tien urged the government to call on Washington not to  "politicise economic and trade issues" and to avoid trade wars  that might jeopardise the economies of China, the U.S., and Hong  Kong.    It is estimated that Hong Kong will lose almost $200 billion  in trade and 75,000 jobs if MFN is withdrawn.    Liberal Party legislator Henry Tang called on the government  to lobby for permanent MFN status for China instead of yearly  renewal.    But the United Democrats (UDHK), the second largest voting  block in the legislature rejected the Liberal Party's proposal  to decouple human rights and the MFN. UDHK legislator Huang  Chen-ya moved an amendment urging the government to mount  pressure on China to improve human rights to secure permanent  MFN status. But that brought torrents of criticism from the  Liberal Party and other pro-democracy factions, with Liberal  Party legislator Selina Chow accusing the UDHK of double  standards. "On the one hand, the UDHK urged the Chinese  Government to separate economic issues and political ones. But  on the other hand, they support the U.S. (in linking) human  rights with trade issues." She condemned the UDHK for standing  by the U.S. government over its use of human rights as a tool to  interfere in the political affairs of other countries.    Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL)  legislator Frederick Fung also opposed the UDHK move. "If MFN  is not renewed this year, human rights conditions (in China) may  even worsen because of the adverse impact on China's economy,"  he said.    Meeting Point legislator Fred Li shared the ADPL view  calling  for unconditional MFN renewal. But UDHK legislator Cheung  Man-kwong fended off the criticisms, accusing the Liberal Party  of "turning a blind eye" to human rights in China.    "If we keep silent... the Chinese Government will further  abuse human rights," he said.    Mr Cheung's ally, James To, said the U.S. Government had  already spelt out that "the link between human rights and MFN  was an undeniable fact. "We want MFN renewed. But we also want  human rights to be improved," he said.    The UDHK amendment was defeated by 29 votes to 13.    Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak-hay travels to  Washington this month to relay Hong Kong's concerns. He said  the government would lobby for unconditional MFN renewal for  this year and rejected calls to mount pressure over human  rights. "It would be tempting to think that such an appeal to  China would be entirely logical." He added that it was wrong to  mix politics with trade.</p>

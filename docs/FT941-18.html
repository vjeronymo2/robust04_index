			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines on US-Japan trade tensions Fears of mounting US-Japan tensions over trade spurred a further rise in the yen, and equities closed moderately lower after an early fall of more than 2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average lost a net 149.83 at 19,559.91 after opening at the day's high of 19,640.53. The index dropped to a low for the session of 19,288.86 in the morning as the yen peaked at Y102.52 to the dollar on speculation that the US government will attempt to talk up the Japanese currency, due to dissatisfaction with Japan's trade package, announced on Tuesday. Criticism of the measures was voiced by Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative in Washington, and Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador to Japan, in a morning meeting in Tokyo. However, the yen lost some of its steam and finished a net Y0.50 up at Y103.30. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 8.29 to 1,588.22 and the Nikkei 300 slipped 1.48 to 290.99. Declines led advances by 792 to 241, with 144 issues unchanged. In London the ISE Nikkei 50 index shed 4.97 to 1,303.42. Volatility on the currency markets kept many investors on the sidelines and trading volume totalled 330m shares against 254m. Small-lot buying by public funds and financial institutions in the afternoon helped to remove some of the uncertainty. Export oriented high-technology shares lost ground on the higher yen. NEC, the day's most active issue, retreated Y20 to Y1,100 and Ricoh, which rose on firm earnings prospects earlier in the week, met profit-taking and dipped Y8 to Y830. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y10 to Y1,730 and Sony Y80 to Y6,050. The high yen also hurt steels, NKK losing Y10 at Y250. Some trading houses were higher on the multimedia theme. Many of the companies are investing in cable television, and forming alliances with satellite-related companies. Itochu rose Y17 to Y698 and Mitsubishi Y30 to Y1,150. Drug stocks, unaffected by currency movements, were popular. Takeda Chemical moved forward Y10 to Y1,230 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Y20 to Y1,520. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 270.53 to 21,750.08 in volume of 86.8m shares. The index fell through 22,000 for the first time in three weeks. Roundup The region produced varied reactions, or a lack of them, to the overnight slide on Wall Street. HONG KONG dropped on the US sell-off, and on measures to curb domestic property prices, the Hang Seng index tumbling 247.93, or 2.6 per cent, to 9,232.21. Turnover was flat, and low at HKDollars 4.5bn. During late trade the government announced the setting up of a task force in the next few months to make proposals for the improvement of residential land supply. It also plans to speed up the release of sites in the remote Tin Shui Wai area. Major property stocks all fell. Cheung Kong relinquished HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 40.25, New World HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 28.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 54.50. NEW ZEALAND ended 1.9 per cent lower in line with overseas trends, and as investors reassessed fixed-interest alternatives following the sharp rise in interest rates over the past few weeks. The NZSE-40 index fell 39.32 to 2,076.23. Higher rates, in particular, were largely responsible for weakness in stocks with high dividend yields such as Telecom. The company also ran into strike news as it ended 10 cents down at NZDollars 5.10 but off its low of NZDollars 4.95. AUSTRALIA clawed back early sharp losses sustained in response to Wall Street, the All Ordinaries index closing a net 8.4 off at 2,092.4. An improving bond market, comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, that a rise in official interest rates is some way off, and current account data in line with expectations, all contributed to the subsequent recovery. MANILA, normally sensitive to US influences, saw Philippine Long Distance Telephone slightly higher in New York overnight, and unchanged at home at 1,740 pesos. The composite index rose to 2,726 and then hit profit-taking to end 37 up at 2,711.50. SINGAPORE's brokers gave a polite nod in the Dow's direction but institutions were buying the market and bargain hunters also came in. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 34.67, or 1.7 per cent, ahead at 2,128.39 after sharp falls last week and on Monday. COLOMBO extended its correction, the all-share index falling a further 13.64 to 1,183.07.</p>

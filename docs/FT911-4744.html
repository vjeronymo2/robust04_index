			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Technology: Eat at home or take away / A look at whether you should buy in IT services or turn your computer department into a business Corporate computers are being subjected to a wave of intense scrutiny as the recession underlines the importance of getting value for money. Harsh conditions have forced IT departments in both private and public sectors to renew their efforts to cut costs and to reassess their potential for making their parent organisations more profitable. Since January, British Rail and Barclays Bank have turned their IT arms into commercial businesses offering services to external clients as well as to their own companies; while at the Post Office, the computer department has laid itself bare to outside consultants who are studying whether computer users within the group's three main businesses would be better off going to an independent computer services supplier. Handing the day-to-day running of IT to another company in this way is known as facilities management (FM). Such deals are still the exception rather than the rule - though a recent surge in FM, from a Pounds 60m UK market in 1987 to a forecast Pounds 270m this year, according to market researchers Romtec, has increased the pressure on IT departments to prove their worth. Some IT managers see FM as a threat to their own internal empires - being asked about it by the company board may be a catalyst for internal rejuvenation. In the public sector, FM has grown particularly fast. The local government IT managers association (SOCITM) has set up a working party to evaluate FM. The Computing Services Association, a trade body with many FM suppliers among its members, has prepared guidelines which it plans to publish this month designed to weed out cowboy operations. Some clients feel FM gives them more control of their IT - by taking items off the balance sheet and pinning down costs with fixed-price contracts. For other groups, however, IT is seen as so central to the business that contracting it out like the canteen food is unthinkable. If a company is reluctant to bring in an outsider for reasons of control or security, but still wants to benefit from the commercial ethos of FM, it may consider turning its own IT operation into an FM supplier. Just over a month ago, Barclays Bank did just this. Barclays says the new unit, Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), is a 'quasi' company - a profit centre that will bid for work outside the Barclays group. The unit's main objective, however, is to improve the provision of computer operations to Barclays itself. The IT department provides computer power to the whole Barclays group with the exception of investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd and consumer finance division Mercantile &amp; Credit. 'One of the big problems I have had as a monopoly is that my (internal) clients don't perceive that they're getting value for money - they think they may be getting ripped off,' says Bruce Hotter, BCO's managing director. 'If you tell them: you've got to reduce your cost base but, by the way, you're locked in to the Barclays IT department, they'll just say - what do you expect me to do about it?' Some of Hotter's internal clients have already achieved savings through tackling user inertia - making sure new technology is actually used as it becomes available. There have also been concerted drives to iron out the inefficient peaks and troughs of computer use that tend to reflect monthly financial cycles. But, despite measures like these, there was a growing feeling that clients should be allowed to contract out, and Barclays took that as its cue for putting the whole computer operation on to a more commercial footing. BCO will try to make a profit only from its external clients. Internal users will continue to be charged on a pure cost basis, but they will face changes. In particular, pricing will become more differential so that users will be able to choose between cheaper and more expensive options. A company with a different perspective on the merits of FM is BOC, the UK industrial gases group. In the 1960s the company decided to sell spare capacity on its mainframe by acting as a bureau service to other companies. When BOC decided to withdraw from this market in the 1970s, it sold the operation, Datasolve, to Thorn EMI, and became the spun-off company's largest customer. However, when the contract came up for renewal in the early 1980s BOC decided the time was right to bring IT back in-house. Today, it believes that IT's place is under the fingertips of the board, though there are certain individual activities which it says it would still consider contracting out. Paul Bosonnet, BOC's deputy chairman, believes that the company made a considerable savings by bringing IT back in-house, but he says this was secondary to the gains in competitive advantage. 'In the 1980s the use of IT in our business became much more intensive. Originally it was fairly mundane  -paying creditors and running the payroll. But then when we started doing on-line order entry and planning our distribution, IT became much more critical. You can probably get by without paying a supplier for a day or two  -but if something goes wrong when you're working on-line with a customer then there's a feeling that you've lost business.' BOC's computer activities have become spread around the world on a number of different systems from different vendors - whereas 10 years ago it was all concentrated on the UK mainframe. 'If we went back to Datasolve, where they would have dominated our business 10 years ago, they would now have a much smaller part of the total.' The British Broadcasting Corporation is also determined to run its own IT. It considered and rejected FM two years ago but believes the process of putting IT out to tender was an invaluable exercise. The IT department's customers are computer users in various parts of the corporation who develop applications using the raw power which the IT centre provides. They have to pay to use the IT service, but are free to go elsewhere. 'We don't expect to make a profit for the BBC but we are expected to recover our costs,' says Bryan Parlett, IT operations manager. Several FM companies tended for the BBC contract and Parlett drew up a list of the most common financial benefits that they claimed to offer. He concluded that all of these savings could equally be obtained in-house. Most of the FM companies saw potential savings in moving the BBC to more modern, powerful hardware and through cutting staff by about a third. The BBC agreed - and followed this course independently. In the last two years it has replaced its ICL 2900 mainframes with newer Series 39 machines from the same manufacturer and has reduced its computer operations staff from 64 to about 50 people. BBC staff themselves, he concedes, might have benefited from an FM deal. Career opportunities are enhanced by moving to an organisation which runs a broad range of computer operations on many different kinds of hardware and software. Leading FM suppliers such as Hoskyns, EDS, Sema, ITNet, and Andersen Consulting offer a variety of deals. A traditional FM contract may involve buying the computer department and its staff lock, stock and barrel, and then running it more cheaply - first on the customer's premises and later moving it alongside other clients' processing at the FM company's own data centre. Pure FM, despite its recent growth, has a limited lifespan. Many clients in local government, for example, have sold their mainframes to FM companies as a cleverly disguised step towards winding them down completely. Their real intention is to move to smaller minicomputers which are constantly striding ahead in terms of power. 'FM is a bit of a sunset industry,' according to David Andrews, head of systems management at Andersen Consulting. 'We're moving beyond it. What's important now is not the operation but the systems that deliver the services surrounding business operations. The boundary between IT and the uses of IT has to be broken.' For EDS, FM is part of a wider concept for which it uses the American term 'outsourcing'. This umbrella covers systems development, systems integration and consultancy, as well as the traditional managing of a company's mainframe. The budget for IT operations will only come to about 2 or 3 per cent of a company's revenue points out Ranald Bain, director of financial and insurance sales at EDS. Small cost savings within the IT department are immaterial when put next to what IT can achieve for company-wide profits.</p>

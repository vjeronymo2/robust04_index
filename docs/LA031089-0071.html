			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MITCHELL, NUNN SCORE A SIGNAL SENATE VICTORY;  </P> <P> NEW DEMOCRATIC LEADER WINS HIS FIRST TEST; GEORGIAN DEMONSTRATES HIS INFLUENCE  IN PARTY  </P> <P> For a brief interlude at the beginning of this week, the White House actually  believed that it could push John Tower through the Senate.  </P> <P> It was on Monday that Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama became the first Democrat  to announce his support of the nomination of the former Texas senator to be  defense secretary. White House vote counters reckoned then that they had 49 of  the 50 votes they needed: all 45 Senate Republicans plus Democrats Heflin,  Christopher S. Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and J. Bennett  Johnston of Louisiana.  </P> <P> Looking for that last elusive vote, President Bush met in the Oval Office with  Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who had entered the Senate in the same year as  Tower (1961) and who was thought to be troubled by the rough treatment that his  former colleague was receiving from his Democratic opponents. To build  momentum, Republicans arranged for Dodd to announce his support for Tower on  Tuesday and planned for Bentsen to do the same Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Johnston's Decision  </P> <P> Then, Republican hopes evaporated as suddenly as they had materialized. In a  private telephone call, Johnston notified Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.) that he was voting against Tower.  </P> <P> So even as Dodd became the second Democrat to break ranks, Mitchell calmly  announced that Tower would be defeated. In the end, 52 Democrats voted against  Tower and, with the support of Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas,  they scored a 53-47 victory Thursday.  </P> <P> Tower's defeat represented a signal victory, not only for Mitchell in his first  test as the Senate's new Democratic leader, but especially for Armed Services  Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). Nunn, concentrating on Tower's drinking  habits and his consulting company's acceptance of $750,000 from defense  contractors since he left the Senate in 1984, led the opposition to Tower both  in his committee and on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> "It's a testimony to Sam Nunn's influence," a senior Bush adviser said. "I  don't think there's another committee chairman who could have pulled this off,  because there were a helluva lot of Democrats who weren't all that comfortable  with where they were."  </P> <P> </P> <P> White House Miscalculation  </P> <P> The outcome also reflected lack of sufficient White House concern over Tower's  confirmation, despite early warning signals from Nunn. Only after Nunn's  committee voted, 11 to 9, against Tower -- at a time when Bush was half-way  around the world at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Japan -- did the  President swing into action to save his nominee.  </P> <P> At that point, Tower wanted to back out and spare Bush further embarrassment.  He went to the President and offered to withdraw his name, Sen. Pete Wilson  (R-Calif.) disclosed after Thursday's vote.  </P> <P> "John Tower repeatedly offered the President the opportunity to abandon this  fight and George Bush refused to do so and it was the right thing to do,"  Wilson said. "It was important not only to vindicate John Tower but let the  American people know the truth."  </P> <P> Republican senators commonly laid responsibility on Nunn for making Tower the  ninth Cabinet nominee in history to be defeated in the Senate -- and the first  of a President's initial round of nominees.  </P> <P> "This was made a personal matter by Sen. Nunn," Wilson said. " . . . A number  of Democratic colleagues admitted privately (that) they yielded to arm-twisting  . . . and said that this has become a test of personal allegiance to the  chairman."  </P> <P> Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) added: "When Sen. Nunn came down the other way,  the others all wheeled into line behind him. Sam Nunn was the key -- he gave  the others cover."  </P> <P> Democrats likewise credited Nunn, who has built a reputation for a nonpartisan  approach to defense issues, with holding the fractious party together.  </P> <P> "A lot of individuals based their decision on the fact that Sam Nunn took the  position that he did," said Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.)  </P> <P> Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) said that Majority Leader Mitchell did not  strong-arm the Democrats into line. "He said: 'I want them to make up their  owns minds,' " Exon said. " 'I hope they tell me when they do.' "  </P> <P> But, after the Armed Service Committee's strictly party-line vote against  Tower, Mitchell worked with Nunn to persuade uncommitted Democrats to fall into  line.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said that it was only after senators began inspecting  the FBI report on Tower's history of drinking and womanizing -- a report that  was carefully guarded in a fourth-floor room in the Capitol accessible only to  senators -- that a pattern of Democratic opposition began to emerge. "That's  when things began to gel," Simon said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intensive Fight  </P> <P> At the White House, meanwhile, Bush returned from his Asian trip and plunged  into an intensive fight to win over a few undecided Democrats.  </P> <P> "You can lose a battle like this in the court of public opinion and grass-roots  lobbying, but you can't win it that way," a senior Bush adviser said. "The  President has to win it."  </P> <P> Among the senators on the early White House list of likely Democratic prospects  were Bob Graham of Florida and David L. Boren of Oklahoma. When the Senate  rejected former President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the  Supreme Court in 1987, Boren was one of two Democrats who voted for him.  </P> <P> But Boren quickly announced his opposition to Tower, and so did Graham.  </P> <P> By the beginning of this week, the White House was focusing on the handful of  still-uncommitted Democrats. Those included Pell and two freshmen, Joseph I.  Lieberman of Connecticut and Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who would be casting  their first major votes on Tower's nomination.  </P> <P> All three voted against him. The only three Democrats who supported Tower were  Heflin, who surprised the White House with his announcement Monday; Dodd, who  noted that Tower had supported his father, also a senator, when the Senate  censured him in 1967, and Bentsen, Tower's fellow Texan.  </P> <P> "I don't think the President turned a vote," a senior Bush adviser said.  "Bentsen and Dodd were going to go for Tower, and Heflin seems to have reached  an independent judgment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Test of Loyalty'  </P> <P> "It got down to a test of loyalty in the Senate -- George Mitchell and Sam Nunn  versus George Bush and John Tower, and George Mitchell and Sam Nunn started  with 55 (Democratic) votes."  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who had been Bush's chief rival for  last year's Republican presidential nomination, became the chief strategist of  the drive to confirm Tower. He met almost daily with White House Chief of Staff  John H. Sununu and conferred with him regularly by phone.  </P> <P> But in the end, the one Republican who defected was Kassebaum, Dole's fellow  Kansan. Her vote came as a pleasant surprise to the Democrats, but she had  given Bush the news two days earlier.  </P> <P> "We recognized that she's an independent person who doesn't respond well to  lobbying by anybody, not even Bob Dole," a White House adviser said.  </P></p>

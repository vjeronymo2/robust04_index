			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Danish Foreign Minister  Niels Helveg Petersen said Wednesday [9 February] the European  Community "still envisages introducing sanctions against  Croatia" because of its involvement in the Bosnian conflict.    Petersen told a press conference he had raised the question  of sanctions against the Croats at a meeting in Brussels Monday  of European Community foreign ministers, but added that the  matter had been sidelined by the massacre in Sarajevo and  discussions on airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs.    "The member states agree that the question of sanctions will  be discussed soon," he said. "What we are looking at is either  trade sanctions or, alternatively, the possibility of  withdrawing the preferential status Croatia enjoys in its trade  with the Community."</p>

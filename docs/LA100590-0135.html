			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW GAINS 27, BUT BROADER MARKET DROPS  </P> <P> Blue chip stock prices closed sharply higher Thursday in a wild session driven  by uncertainty over the federal budget, a surprise bond rally and whiplashing  computer-trading programs.  </P> <P> Some bad earnings reports caused big stock hits.  </P> <P>  The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 27.47 points, or 1.1%, to 2,516.83.  Earlier in the day it was down more than 20 points.  </P> <P> The broader market failed to keep pace with the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's  500 index inched up just 0.4%; the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite lost 0.4%.  </P> <P> On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues slightly outnumbered advances  in nationwide trading, with 731 stocks rising, 780 falling and 465 unchanged.  Big Board volume came to a moderate 145.41 million shares, against Wednesday's  135.49 million.  </P> <P> Analysts said some investors bought on the belief that a budget agreement would  be passed in Congress. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), after meeting with  President Bush in the afternoon, said congressional committees will be able to  change part of the $500-billion budget-cutting agreement, a statement that may  assuage opponents.  </P> <P> Passage of the budget is expected to nudge the Federal Reserve into lowering  interest rates.  </P> <P> "We know the Fed is under enormous pressure from the Administration" to cut  rates, said Bank of America Senior Vice President V. Shannon Clyne.  </P> <P> But whether budget optimism sparked Thursday's surprise bond rally was unclear,  traders said. Meanwhile, stock investors had to contend with a flurry of  computer buy and sell programs.  </P> <P> "We've been roiled by the program people and by what amounts to a great deal of  uncertainty," said analyst Andrew Riley of Yamaichi International.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * The broad market's weakness may have stemmed from new worries about corporate  profits. The news was grim. Ingersoll-Rand tumbled 5 7/8 to 33 1/4 after the  machinery firm said its third-quarter results will be below Wall Street  expectations. It cited a sudden decline in certain businesses.  </P> <P> Tenneco slumped 4 3/4 to 45 1/4 after a Prudential-Bache analyst cut 1991  earnings estimates 12% on expectations of softer orders for construction  equipment. And Hewlett-Packard lost 1 3/4 to 29 1/4 after the computer company  said domestic orders slowed in September from August.  </P> <P> * High-tech stocks overall continued to be weak. Sun Microsystems lost 1/2 to  19, Microsoft fell 1 5/8 to 64 1/8 and AST Research gave up 3/4 to 16 3/4.  Digital Communications plunged 4 3/8 to 10 5/8 after it reported quarterly  earnings off 63%.  </P> <P> * Elsewhere, Carnival Cruise Lines dropped 1 3/4 to 12 after Alex. Brown and  Montgomery Securities cut earnings estimates.  </P> <P> * Toro Co., which said it expects to post a loss for the quarter ending Oct.  26, fell 2 3/4 to 12 1/4.  </P> <P> * Among the market bright spots, Ralston Purina rose 2 1/8 to 105, Lilly gained  2 3/8 to 75 1/8, Humana rose 1 to 45 and Time Warner added 2 1/8 to 74 3/8.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks finished lower in thin, volatile trading amid rebounding oil  prices and widespread fears that war would finally break out in the Mideast  after a two-month standoff.  </P> <P> The key 225-share Nikkei index ended down 571.20 points, or 2.5%, to 22,278.19.  </P> <P> At mid-day today, the Nikkei was up 785.75 points.  </P> <P> London stock prices also weakened as the market struggled for direction in the  absence of fresh news.  </P> <P> The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 16.6 points at 2,070.4. In  Frankfurt, Germany, stock prices fell in thin, lackluster trading. The DAX  index dropped 22.54 points, or 1.6%, to 1,422.35.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Leap in Slow Trading  </P> <P> Bond prices rose sharply in quiet trading as the market awaited the release of  employment figures for September.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 27/32 point, or about $8.43 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.79% from 8.87% Wednesday.  </P> <P> Analysts were somewhat at a loss to explain Thursday's advance. Many were  doubtful that buyers were motivated by the outlook for the pending federal  budget-cutting pact.  </P> <P> Analysts did report some technical buying, as traders adjusted their positions  before the Labor Department's employment report comes out early today.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.19%, down from 9% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The drop was due to technical factors.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds rose 1/32 point to 88 25/32.  </P> <P> The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 7.76%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENERGY  </P> <P> Crude Oil Prices Slump Late in Day  </P> <P> U.S. crude oil prices, led by a late selloff of gasoline, skidded downward in  late trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after being up earlier in the  day.  </P> <P> Crude was supported earlier as markets anticipated that an Iraqi speech at the  United Nations would not match the conciliatory tone of President Bush's  address earlier this week.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for November  ended the day down 39 cents at $36.93 a barrel.  </P> <P> It traded as high as $38.25 and as low as $36.30 a barrel.  </P> <P> "A late selloff of gasoline pulled crude down 30 to 50 cents in the last 15  minutes of trading," said Kirk Kinnear of the Phibro division of Salomon Bros.  </P> <P> On the Merc, unleaded gasoline for November delivery fell 2.28 cents to 90.86  cents a gallon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Pork Belly Rally Loses Momentum  </P> <P> A powerful three-day surge in pork belly futures prices peaked on the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange as buying interest sparked by a surprising government  hogs-and-pigs report exhausted itself.  </P> <P> Frozen pork bellies for delivery in February closed above Wednesday's closing  price but below the day's high of 64.9 cents a pound, which represented a gain  of nearly 12% since last Friday.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, livestock futures were mixed, precious metals  retreated and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> Pork bellies settled 0.65 cent lower to 0.25 cent higher, with February up 0.25  cent to 64.45 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Pork bellies had risen the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound Monday,  Tuesday and Wednesday in reaction to last Friday's surprisingly low  hogs-and-pigs inventory news.  </P> <P> The Agriculture Department report included an estimate of the number of pigs  born during the summer that was 2% lower than in 1989.  </P> <P> Most market analysts had expected summer farrowings to be unchanged or even a  little higher than a year earlier.  </P> <P> Precious metal futures, which have shadowed crude oil's moves since the Persian  Gulf confrontation began, fell on New York's Commodity Exchange.  </P> <P> Gold finished $1.60 to $2 lower, with October at $392.30 an ounce; October  silver lost 2.2 $4.67.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D6  </P></p>

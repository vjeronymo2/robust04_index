At the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri thanked the nation for their  wise and active presence at the Ten Days of Dawn ceremonies that  culminated in massive and magnificent marches on February 11.    The massive participation of our sensible people at the  marches, Mr. Nateq-Nuri said, once again proved to the world  that the Iranian Muslim people have remained loyal to the  revolution's causes and principles and are diligent in  safeguarding its achievement and values. The Majlis speaker  then urged the officials to serve this brave and heroic nation  more than before.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri further described as a deceitful scheme  NATO's  ultimatum to Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around  Sarajevo, adding that inwardly NATO, Serbs, and Croats are  allies.    The head of the legislative branch later expressed hope that  Muslims would no longer be deceived by their enemies'  conspiracies and, with greater resolve than in the past,  continue to defend the oppressed Bosnian people.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri then appreciated the stance of the Nonaligned  Movement in backing the Bosnian Muslims.</p>

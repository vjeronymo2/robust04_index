			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The body of a person suspected  of collaboration with Israel, Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ata, 28, a  resident of the Rimal neighborhood, was found near a garbage  dump in Gaza. Local residents told our correspondent Moti Amir  that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  members murdered him since he participated in several IDF  actions against wanted Hamas people. According to them, more  than six months ago Hamas members murdered Abu-'Ata's brother  for similar reasons.</p>

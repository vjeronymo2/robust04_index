			<p>BFN     [Text] In April and May, the provincial party committee  held three study courses on Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping. These courses were attended by a series  of principal leaders at the city and departmental levels.  Attending were more than 330 people, including comrades in  charge of the provincial party committee, the standing committee  of the provincial people's congress, the provincial government,  the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, and the provincial discipline  inspection commission; secretaries of the party committees of  various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities;  chairmen of city people's congresses; mayors; chairmen of CPPCC  city committees; and principal leading comrades of the  departments and bureaus directly under the jurisdiction of the  provincial government.    In these courses, participants mainly studied Volume 3 of  the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, while studying the  decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and relevant major reform measures.    While delivering a summary speech at one of the study  courses, provincial party committee Secretary Xie Fei pointed  out: It is a good way of doing things for provincial and city  leaders to study theory, discuss major issues, exchange  experiences, deepen their understanding, acquire clear line of  thinking, and promote work. He stressed: Leading cadres at all  levels must attach importance to studying theory by relating  major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation;  earnestly master Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; and master basic knowledge about  the market economy, as well as about modern science and  technology, so as to apply this knowledge to the solution of  practical problems and to open up a new prospect in work.    In his summary speech at the completion of the study  courses,  Huang Huahua, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, pointed out: Leaders at all levels must genuinely  regard theory study as an important task, and must make  unremitting efforts to carry it out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brothers, it is no longer a secret that Israel's  intransigence has become manifest in blocking the peace process  in the Middle East. It will not come to the rescue of the  occupation and its leaders. This intransigence will inevitably  lead them to perdition. It seems the occupation and its leaders  do not yet understand that their foolhardy actions will kill the  peace process in the region and wipe out any future aspirations  for peace. This will open the doors to war and violence.    They are mistaken to believe that by wasting time and  avoiding commitment to the schedule for the implementation of  the Declaration of Principles -- which is the only historical  opportunity for establishing just and comprehensive peace in the  region -- they can succeed in finding a way to undermine the  Palestinian national struggle and obstruct the PLO's political  bodies. If we reach a dead end, our steadfast and lofty people,  with their nationalist and brave leadership, will submit new  options. Then, and only then will the occupation and its leaders  realize that they are the only party that is responsible for  wasting the historic opportunity for establishing just and  comprehensive peace in the region.    It is true that we are patient, and that we work for a just  and comprehensive peace. However, our patience has its limits.  The occupation and its leaders will be the losers. As for our  people, who continue to sacrifice their sons, they will  ultimately attain their just and legitimate objectives of  freedom, independence, and life. The occupation and its leaders  should always keep in mind the conspicuous fact that victory is  the lot of our people and that defeat and loss is for the  occupation and its leaders.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Face shift Guess whose face beams out from civil service recruiting brochures as one who rose to the mandarin heights despite lacking a degree? The answer is Sir Peter Kemp, whom Citizen's Charter minister William Waldegrave has ousted as his top official after publicly praising him only on Monday as an out-standing success. Kemp's successor, Richard Mottram, is at least a graduate although not from the customary Oxbridge finishing school. His degree is from that erstwhile hotbed of redbrick radicalism, Keele University. His main claim to fame is that he was the star prosecution witness in the trial of former civil servant Clive Ponting over the leakage of documents on the torpedoing of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war. As private secretary to the then defence minister Michael Heseltine, Mottram was grilled for four hours in camera over the so-called 'Crown Jewels', a top-secret document dealing with the events leading up to the sinking. Dealing with Waldegrave should be a breeze in comparison.</p>

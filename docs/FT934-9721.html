			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): NZ tumbles by 6 per cent following election THE Nikkei average rose marginally on bargain hunting, closing higher for the first time in five trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index gained 34.70 at 18,625.16 after a day's low of 18,380.84 in the first hour of trading and high of 18,671.67 later in the morning. Arbitrage selling of Nikkei 225 component stocks left out of the new 300-issue index continued to depress the 225 index, while individual investors liquidated margin positions. Some arbitrageurs shifted positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Topix index, lifting bank stocks. Volume was 240m shares, against 433.7m. Declines led rises by 484 to 471, with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 2.96 to 1,583.81 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.23 to 1,267.40. Individual investors, who had bought East Japan Railway at its initial offering price of Y380,000, took profits, depressing the stock by Y6,000 to Y479,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y11,000 to Y799,000, closing below the Y800,000 level for the first time since March 11. Banks were higher on Topix index-linked buying. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y20 to Y3,340 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank put on Y10 at Y2,330. Steels firmed on bargain hunting, with Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, appreciating Y11 to Y331. Profit-taking depressed some consumer electronics manufacturers: Sony weakened Y40 to Y4,910 and Pioneer Electronic declined Y70 to Y2,700. Keisei Electric Railway, which had lost ground in tandem with JR East, recovered Y21 to Y889 on bargain hunting, while Sumitomo Metal Mining, which had plunged last week on margin liquidation, rallied Y49 to Y857. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 36.48 to 20,764.81 in volume of 18m shares. Roundup THE REGION'S markets were generally in an uncertain mood yesterday. NEW ZEALAND tumbled by nearly 10 per cent at the opening in reaction to the inconclusive election result; a partial recovery later in the session saw the NZSE-40 capital index close a net 138.4, or 6.3 per cent, off at 2,046.8. Most of the selling was attributed to retail investors, said Ms Pauline McAtamney, an analyst at Ord Minnett in London, although, henceforward, there was expected to be some downweighting of the market by institutions. She added that the risk premium had returned to equities, following their recent period of outperformance, and that investors would be watching closely what happened in the bond market over the coming days. Telecom, one of the leading stocks, fell 42 cents to NZDollars 4.08. AUSTRALIA retreated on what analysts described more as profit-taking than reaction to events in New Zealand. The All Ordinaries index lost 25.7, or 1.24 per cent, at 2,054.2. Turnover came to ADollars 349.1m. Banks were among the biggest fallers ahead of next week's earnings announcements. National Australia Bank shed 10 cents to ADollars 12.50 and Westpac 17 cents to ADollars 4.21. HONG KONG rose on demand from overseas institutions, particularly in the property sector. The Hang Seng index gained 181.02 at 9,177.95 in turnover of HKDollars 5.4bn. Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 55.50, Cheung Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 36 and Henderson Land 75 cents to HKDollars 30.25. SEOUL strengthened slightly, registering a gain in the composite index of 6.10 at 775.47 in Won908.3bn turnover. Brokers said export-orientated stocks were given a boost by good October trade figures. Samsung Electronics and Samsung Electron Devices went the day's limit up, both rising by Won1,600 to Won48,600 and Won58,000 respectively. TAIWAN fell back for the fourth straight session as investors continued to take profits. The weighted index relinquished 25.78 to 4,195.82. Turnover amounted to TDollars 28.9bn. MANILA added to its recent losses as another heavy fall in PLDT shares made its impact felt. The composite index dropped 59.86 to 2,351.46. Brokers said the fortunes of PLDT would dictate events in the near term, with some forecasting that the stock was now due for a rise in US trading. It fell 65 pesos to 1,760 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR declined 2.5 per cent but was off the day's lows on bargain hunting. Some commentators attributed the market's loss to the fact that dealers had been forcing clients unable to meet payment deadlines to unload their positions. The composite index shed 23.42 to 921.52. BOMBAY firmed on strong buying by foreign investors which led the BSE index up 48.58 to 2,713.30.</p>

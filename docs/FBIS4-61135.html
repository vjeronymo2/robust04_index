			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian parliament resumed its work yesterday.  The session started with quorum problems. Parliamentary Speaker  Vakhtang Goguadze proposed to broaden the powers of the  speaker's office, enabling it to apply effective sanctions  [against deputies who fail to attend]. The head of state said  that parliament should consider this proposal if it wants its  legislative activity to be more productive.    After a quorum was reached, Deputy Shalva Natelashvili  submitted a proposal concerning amendments to the provisional  rules of procedure. He said that plenary sessions of parliament  should be held less frequently to allow deputies to work in  commissions.    The head of state supported this idea. In his opinion,  parliament's legislative activity cannot be replaced by decrees.  The bulk of work should be carried out in commissions.    The second proposal on the agenda addressed the old painful  problem of the coupon. Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia  said that the Cabinet of Ministers has set up a commission  responsible for reorganizing the financial system. The  commission has been entrusted with drafting specific steps aimed  at strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the economy. In  its work, the commission will take into account IMF and World  Bank recommendations.    The deputy prime minister said that an integrated program is  needed to revitalize the economy. The first step in this  direction would be to free prices, since the difference in  prices [between the public and private sectors] is mainly  responsible for the budget deficit. Rationing could serve as a  social protection mechanism. It is necessary to determine a  budget deficit limit, which is to be filled with revenues from  state property privatization. These revenues should be used to  repay bank credits and to establish a fund to stabilize the  financial system. The deputy prime minister stressed that the  National Bank is to play an important role in this process.    The draft program produced heated debate and a fair amount  of  skepticism.    In responding to deputies' remarks regarding the further  impoverishment of the population, the absence of social  protection mechanisms, and the impossibility of implementing  reforms, Deputy Prime Minister Basilia said that it had been  much easier for him to be a member of parliament and work on  this issue in commissions than to speak from his present vantage  point. However, he said, it is necessary to start this process,  since the current situation defies assessment.    The fact that both parliament and the government have  discussed ways of strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the  economy many times before gives ground for a certain degree of  skepticism. Is it possible to implement everything mentioned  above? Deputy Prime Minister Basilia gave us the following  answer:    [Begin Basilia recording] The most difficult part of it is  to  make a decision and to have the political will to implement  these measures. I am profoundly convinced that the measures  which I presented to parliament today are the only way of  overcoming the current economic crisis. I am not aware of any  other ways or measures of doing it. Therefore, I think that all  of us, both parliament and government, should work in  coordination to implement these measures. If our work is well  coordinated, I am sure that we will achieve some results. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (5): 'All you had to do was go and shoot the breeze' - Ben Allen, of the Association of British Factors and Discounters If Cilla Black, the pop singer and TV personality, had been in the dating game back in 1966 she might well have met Ben Allen, Britain's first man to wed the woman he met through a dating agency. The event was front page news throughout the UK for days. Ben Allen, now 53, has achieved prominence almost 28 years later for an entirely different reason. He is the enthusiastic voice of factoring: the industry spokesman and new chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters (ABFD). Allen is also a founder and managing director of the ABFD's fourth largest factoring firm, Kellock. Factoring has been in his blood for almost 25 years, ever since he applied for a job under the misconception that he would be working for tea merchants. 'I thought factors were people who bought and sold things,' he admits. 'My father called himself a leather factor and he bought and sold leather.' Instead, Allen found himself shortlisted for a job as financial controller with a small factoring firm, then owned by a tea company. In spite of being unmasked at the final interview, when he quizzed his interviewer on conditions of the tea trade in India, Allen got the job and discovered a new passion. 'Suddenly I was making a big contribution to a company, which is exactly what I had always wanted.' After a couple of years, the restless Allen was appointed commercial director to look after new business, at a time when factoring was not understood. 'I thought it was the most wonderful job. All you had to do was go and shoot the breeze with people and tell them about something about which they knew nothing. You could see the scales fall off their eyes, and it worked. I have been doing it ever since.' Allen also learned one of his most valuable lessons at the firm during the recession of the mid 1970s: too much business and too little funding spell disaster for many smaller companies. 'I had to get rid of some of the largest clients,' he says. 'It was a very sad time for a company, that was doing well, to cut back. And, of course, that is the very thing all of our clients find themselves doing when they cannot get the money to go forward.' In the end, the business which he had helped to build was sold to Lloyds Bank. Allen soon struck out on his own. With Nick Oppenheim, the entrepreneur, he set up Kellocks. Oppenheim provided the finance and Allen the 'people skills'. He is convinced that the reason for the success of Kellocks, which is now owned by the Bank of Scotland, has been in establishing personal relationships with those who have need of his services. In fact, he regards himself as the reincarnation of a now largely extinct breed. 'We are the old-fashioned bank manager - someone the client can go and talk to.' Such thoughts form the basis of his philosophy on factoring, which to his constant annoyance is still often referred to as the 'finance of last recourse'. 'It is disappointing to me that over the past 25 years in the business factoring has not been accepted more.' He lays some of the blame for this at the door of the factoring industry itself; it may have made mistakes in the early days. 'Maybe they took on the wrong clients, or the wrong types of businesses, for example. Factors were learning their own business at that time.' However, there has also been a machismo problem. Business executives in the UK 'just don't want to give up control of the ledger', he says. Finally, factoring has suffered simply because often it can help those whom everyone else has turned away - 'those with weak balance sheets, very weak balance sheets,' Allen says. 'The waifs and strays end up with factors.' This does not mean that factoring is an easy answer for a company up against the wall. On the contrary, Allen says: factoring is there to help small companies which may have outgrown the bank overdraft, but are unable to take advantage of other types of finance - companies which may have nothing but a spread of customers. Yet - like those old-fashioned bank managers on whom Allen is proud to model himself - the factoring industry has been hit by the 21st century. In the last few years invoice discounting (where creditors sell debts at a discount) has rapidly outpaced factoring as the preferred route for companies seeking sales related financing. Somewhat reluctantly, Allen admits that this is where the future lies. 'If anybody wants to be a player today, they must offer invoice discounting.' But this sort of financing is not a 'people' business, he says disparagingly. 'It is much closer to (modern) banking. There is very little service in it.' Allen is old-fashioned in other ways, such as enforcing strict standards of dress from his employees (women must wear frocks, for example). But he is not one to pine after the past. Instead he is anxiously looking forward to the future, counting on dizzying growth in the factoring industry before his retirement in 2001. He cites figures which show that last year ABFD members lent a total of Pounds 1.6bn to small and medium sized companies, while collective turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 19.6bn. 'Our year is now,' he says. 'As you come out of recession - when balance sheets are maybe a little bit weaker, when the banks have burnt their fingers because they have lost money - that is when factoring does well.'</p>

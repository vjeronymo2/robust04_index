			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Prices in British supermarkets 17% below European average STERLING'S devaluation over the past five months has turned Britain's supermarkets into a bargain basement for shoppers from other European countries, according to an international price survey. It finds that UK retail prices for a range of branded foods, drinks and consumer products are 17 per cent less than the average for 14 European countries and 43 per cent lower than in Sweden, the dearest country. The survey, carried out for the Financial Times last month by Nielsen, the market research company, also finds little evidence that leading consumer product manufacturers have raised their UK prices since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Of 31 market-leading branded products surveyed, 17 have fallen in price since August, by as much as 7 per cent. The biggest rise, for canned salmon, was 23 per cent, though the price had moved sharply up and down in the previous six months. In several cases, price cuts of brand leaders were not matched fully by retailers' own-label products, which are usually cheaper. The survey covered a basket of 45 'Euro-brands' - products sold in at least four of the larger European countries. Among the products assessed were processed foods, snacks, pet food, alcohol, soft drinks, household cleaners and personal care products. Britain was cheapest in every product category except alcoholic drinks, for which prices were 6 per cent above the European average. Prices in Austria were 56 per cent higher than the European average and in Ireland and Switzerland 47 per cent higher. Among the best bargains in Britain are Heinz tomato ketchup, Kellogg's cornflakes, Whiskas cat food and Palmolive washing liquid. All are half or less the average European price. However, some items still cost more in Britain than elsewhere. The UK price of Ajax household cleaner is 8 per cent higher than the European average and twice the level in Spain, while Nutella chocolate spread and Danone yoghurt are respectively 10 per cent and 18 per cent above the European average. The cheapest country after Britain is France, where the basket of 'Euro-brands' costs 96 per cent of the average, followed by Greece, Spain and Germany.

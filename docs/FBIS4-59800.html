Rachid reports:    [Rachid] Dealing with the security issue, Sifi stressed to  journalists of the paper L'OPINION the determination of the  state to fight terrorism, and he affirmed that the role of the  government lay in providing security and protection to citizens  and property. In this respect, the prime minister reiterated  his solidarity with the families of the victims of terrorism all  the more because we are on the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha.    The prime minister also underlined that the state will  endeavor to provide all means to increase and strengthen the  capabilities of the security forces in their confrontation with  terrorism. He stressed that the state will never make peace  with terrorism and never stop fighting it until security and  stability return and the people are able, in the future, to  choose their leaders and representatives without pressure or  coercion. Concerning negotiations with trade unions on wages,  jobs, and unemployment benefits, the prime minister said that  the government remains prepared to listen to all suggestions,  and he affirmed that wage increases will not be ruled out when  accompanied by increase in production.    Speaking on the information sector, Sifi stressed his desire  to break the wall between the public-owned and private press.  The prime minister also insisted on defending the right to life  before any other consideration, and he reminded that practicing  the trade of journalism at this time in the country calls for  caution in accepting news from unreliable sources. Concerning  access to information, about which journalists have long  complained, the prime minister said that there are arrangements  that should be made at the level of the premiership to resolve  this problem and create direct links between the sources of  information and the press.</p>

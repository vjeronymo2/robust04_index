			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Wilson at the cutting edge More corporate moves afoot in Ipswich. Ransomes, the somewhat troubled lawnmower company, has a new chief executive: Peter Wilson, a 48-year-old ex-BTR man now with the utility Northumbrian Water as head of environmental management. Bob Dodsworth, the present chief executive, was already due to leave at the end of this year. Wilson's background in engineering and pollution control is not obviously relevant to a business whose main activity is cutting the world's grass. But in such a specialised area, experience is doubtless hard to come by. According to Wilson, his BTR background sounds more immediately relevant. 'I guess they were looking for someone who was used to running a tight business,' he says. 'It's a question of tight financial controls and building on market positions. Ransomes has a leading position in some key markets, but they haven't always been as successful in getting their products into some markets, such as the US.' If he is new to the world of lawnmowers, he is not alone. The recently appointed chairman, John Clement, made his name as head of the dairy firm Unigate. His short-stay predecessor, John Kerridge, was previously chairman of the drugs group Fisons. The announcement of Wilson's appointment is accompanied by the reminder that Ransomes is still looking for a couple of non-executive directors. In the context of a company whose shareholders' funds have more than halved in the past four years, this is a reminder that the investing institutions will be watching Wilson's progress with a critical eye.</p>

During the reception, Jiang Chunyun first extended a warm  welcome to the guests on behalf of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government as well as Shandong  people. Then, he said: Last year, while leading the Shandong  delegation to visit New Zealand, I was warmly welcomed and  cordially treated by your government and your people on various  circles. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks.  During our stay in New Zealand, we were deeply impressed by your  country's beautiful scene and abundant natural resources as well  as your hospitable people. Through that visit to your country,  our understanding of New Zealand was deepened, the mutual  friendship was strengthened, and the mutual economic and trade  cooperation and exchanges were promoted. We believe that the  current visit by your mayor will further deepen the friendship  between the peoples of Shandong and New Zealand and press  forward the further cooperation between the two sides.    After briefing the guests on Shandong's natural resources  and  economic development situation, Jiang Chunyun said: China's  economy has now embarked on the stage of rapid development, and  the dynamics of reform and opening up has been increased.  Therefore, we are urgently required to conduct economic and  technological cooperation with developed countries and regions.  New Zealand and Shandong are much complemented in the economy,  and there are bright prospects for the mutual cooperation. We  hope that the current visit by your mayor and ambassador will  further expand the sphere of mutual cooperation and exchanges.    While talking about the on-going second session of the  eighth  National People's Congress and the second session of the Eighth  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, Jiang Chunyun said: These two sessions  have given prominence to the subjects of seizing the opportunity  to deepen reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting  development, and maintaining stability in line with the  guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. China's economy has  continued to maintain a relatively high growth rate. As a  developed coastal province, Shandong effected a 24.2 percent  increase in economic growth rate last year. This year, Shandong  plans to effect a 12 percent increase in the gross domestic  product. To effect such a high growth rate, we should, what is  very important, bring in funds and technology from abroad, in  addition to making good use of our own natural resources.  Therefore, we are very happy to see that New Zealand is willing  to continuously conduct economic and technological cooperation  and exchanges with us. Our cooperation favors both sides. We  hope that the friends of New Zealand will make investment in  Shandong and also encourage Shandong's enterprises to run plants  and do business in New Zealand. As the window of the mutual  cooperation between the two sides, the Shandong Luxin Economic  and Technological Consulting Corporation, that will soon be  established, will certainly play a positive role in promoting  the economic and technological cooperation between Shandong and  New Zealand.    In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun wished the mayor and ambassador  of New Zealand success in their visit to Shandong.    The mayor of Tauranga city and the New Zealand ambassador  expressed their belief in the new progress in the mutual  cooperation and exchanges in the future.    During the reception, Wang Jiangong, vice governor of  Shandong Province, and responsible comrades of departments  concerned were also on hand.</p>

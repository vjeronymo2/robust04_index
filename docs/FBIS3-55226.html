"The Crimea needs a body, wielding real power, that would  handle all military issues, a Security Council chaired by the  Crimean president elected by popular vote," Yermakov told  INTERFAX.    In his words, the stationing of new and movement of existing  military units in the Crimea must be cleared with the Security  Council.    Yermakov said that he wanted the Black Sea Fleet to be  controlled by Russia, but it was up to the presidents of Russia  and Ukraine to decide who "must show firmness, political will  and not take heed of the noise made by various nationalistic  groups."    He believes that the fleet must become a major element in  the  security system of the Crimea and CIS member states.    Yermakov said that Sevastopol, an integral part of the  Crimean Republic, has been and will remain the main base of the  Black Sea Fleet.    He called for a "civilized" solution of the Crimean problem  and emphasized that "changing the borders at this stage may  result in a war."    "Conditions, historic and political, must be right, but  everybody knows now that economically the Crimea is linked with  the Russian industry," the presidential candidate said.    He believes that Ukraine needs "to mature before it is  prepared to give the Crimean back to Russia." Furthermore,  Ukraine must become a full member of the CIS economic union.    "If Ukraine does not become a member of that union, I think  that the Crimea can enter it on its own," Yermakov said.    The presidential elections will be held in the Crimea on  January 16.</p>

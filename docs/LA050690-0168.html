			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS OK PLAN FOR GATED COMMUNITY;  </P> <P> BALDWIN HILLS: CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL IS NEEDED. COUNCILWOMAN RUTH GALANTER  OPPOSES THE PROPOSAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM.  </P> <P> A proposal to turn the Baldwin Hills Estates into a gated community was given  overwhelming support in a community election which attracted slightly more than  50% of the residents.  </P> <P> The Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn. proposed the gates as a means of  deterring vandals, burglars and the curious who have taken to wandering into  the isolated hillside community since a fire devastated much of the area five  years ago.  </P> <P> The plan was approved by a vote of 423 to 121 last week. The vote represented  slightly more than half the 957 households in the community.  </P> <P> "It means that the community is concerned about our security, our lifestyle and  the value of our homes," said Joseph Gardner, the association's president. "It  is a very positive vote."  </P> <P> City Council approval is needed for the plan, but Ruth Galanter, the council  member who represents the area, said that she does not support the proposal in  its present form.  </P> <P> Gardner said that the next step is for the association to start obtaining the  necessary city permits for the project and to begin collecting the money to pay  for the gates.  </P> <P> Under the plan, seven electronic gates will be used to cut off vehicle and  pedestrian access to the community. Residents will be able to operate the gates  with a device similar to a garage door opener and from their homes by phone to  let in visitors. Police, fire and other city services will be given secret  codes to open the gates.  </P> <P> It is expected to cost an estimated $225,000 to install the gates, about $225  per household, Gardner said. Annual maintenance costs have not yet been  determined.  </P> <P> "We are obviously going to need the participation of the residents for the  gates to be built, but the vote is a strong indication that we will get it,"  Gardner said.  </P> <P> The proposal to install the gates has been under discussion since the community  was hit by an arson-set fire on June 2, 1985, which destroyed 53 homes, damaged  13 others and killed three people.  </P> <P> Galanter, questioned the plan, saying that communities seeking to become gated  should be prepared to assume responsibility for maintaining other city  services.  </P> <P> "If it is owned by the public and maintained by the public then the public  should be able to use it," she said. "The question really is how much financial  burden can the city be expected to shoulder for an area that is not available  to all city residents."  </P> <P> Gardner said that the association plans to meet with Galanter to work out any  differences. If they cannot do that, he added, the association will go  elsewhere for support. "We certainly hope to have her support, but if we have  to we will go directly to the City Council for approval," he said.  </P> <P> Galanter said the council will not support the plan.  </P> <P> "If they are asking for the public to maintain private streets, no one on the  council will swallow that," she said.  </P> <P> The association's plans call for two gates at the intersection of Don Miguel  and Don Lorenzo drives. Other gates will be located at Don Lorenzo near Don  Porfirio Place; Don Quixote Drive near Don Tomaso Drive; Don Miguel Drive near  Don Tomaso Drives; Don Felipe Drive near Marlton Avenue; and Hillcrest Drive  near Don Ricardo Drive.  </P> <P> TENANTS WIN ROUND  </P> <P> Owners' request to pass on the full costs of safeguarding Park Labrea is  rejected.

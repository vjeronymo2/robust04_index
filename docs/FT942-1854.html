			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Japanese recovery stronger than expected in first quarter Japan's economy recovered more strongly than expected in the first three months of this year, with a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in gross domestic product. The rise of 1 per cent over the previous three months, the best for three years, shows that the 'worst period is over', said Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, vice-minister of the economic planning agency. However, the stagnation of the economy was reflected in the meagre 0.03 per cent growth in the fiscal year to March, the worst performance since zero growth in 1974, in the aftermath of the first oil price shock. Most private sector economists are slightly more cautious in their forecasts than the EPA, and believe the economy might contract slightly in the second quarter, as it did after first-quarter growth in the past two years. Market consensus is for 0.7 per cent growth in GDP in the current calender year, below the government's target of 2.4 per cent, which even officials privately admit is high. But Mr Kazuaki Harada, chief economist at Sanwa Bank Research Institute, said: 'The economy passed the bottom in the third quarter of 1993.' The first quarter's stronger than expected rise featured a 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in personal spending and 3.7 per cent rise in exports. Those are unsustainable, but that does not threaten an overall gentle upturn, analysts said. Private sector demand recovered by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter and public sector demand expanded by 0.6 per cent, indicating that the economy is still being propped up by the effect of previous governments' four pump-priming packages, worth Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn), over the past 18 months. Among the uncertainties is the value of the yen, which yesterday rose sharply against the dollar, to close in New York at Y100.335, up from Y101.9. It opened in Tokyo at Y100.35. An unexpected jump in the Japanese currency, to nearly Y100 to the dollar last August, helped to choke recovery last year. Long-term interest rates have also risen in the past few days. Another imponderable is the impact of a Y5,850bn income tax rebate due this month. That represents 1.2 per cent of this year's GDP, the EPA estimates, but Japanese consumers may save rather than spend the money. The EPA announced that its leading index of economic indicators rose from 76.9 in March to 80 in April, the fourth consecutive month above 50, the dividing line between growth and contraction. The index, while sometimes erratic, is designed as a barometer of economic conditions three to six months ahead. Recovery signs, Page 6</p>

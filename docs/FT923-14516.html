			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Sharp split in Spain: Government and industry disagree about the costs and benefits of the aircraft Germany's decision not to participate in the prod-uction phase of the European Fighter Aircraft project has exposed sharp divisions between the Spanish govern-ment and the country's aerospace industry. Immediately after a majority of the German government coalition decided last week not to include production funds in the budget for next year, Casa, the state-owned Spanish aerospace group and the lead EFA contractor in the country, announced it was determined to go ahead with the project even if it meant assuming new costs. For Casa and the Spanish aircraft industry, the EFA is vital; the project has already involved large transfers of technology to Spain, particularly in composite materials. A joint venture with Rolls-Royce to build EFA engines in the politically unstable and economically deprived Basque region is also dependent on the project going ahead intact. By the time the German decision had been made, however, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, was already entertaining serious doubts about whether Spain would stay in the project. Mindful of the strains being placed on the economy by a 55 per cent growth in the government deficit this year, the defence ministry warned the aerospace industry that budgetary considerations would be paramount when it came to deciding whether, or how, to proceed with production. Last week, the defence ministry said that Spain, which has a 13 per cent share of the project, wanted to cut the costs of the aircraft by changing EFA's technical specifications and cutting the cost of the overall project. The ministry added that it hoped it would be possible to build a pan-European aircraft to replace its ageing Mirage F/1 air defence aircraft. In addition to the costs of the EFA, Spain has also been uncomfortable about the absence from the project of France, its most important European economic and political partner. Last week, after meeting Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez said he had invited France to consider rejoining some form of project to build a European fighter. 'The project has changed since it was begun,' he said, 'and it would be advisable to adapt it to the new (international political) situation.' For the moment, however, Madrid is unlikely to make any precipitate unilateral decision over its future participation in the project. Spain will probably use the next round of discussions with its EFA partners to try to find some common ground between Germany's wish for a cheaper and lighter aircraft and Britain's desire to proceed with the original project. Should Spain be forced to choose between producing the original aircraft with just two remaining partners or to drop out of production, current budgetary restraints make it likely that it would be forced to take the the latter course of action.</p>

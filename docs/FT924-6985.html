			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps ICI Australia ICI AUSTRALIA, which is 63 per cent-owned by the UK chemicals group, announced a 33 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 91m (Pounds 41.5m) for the year to end-September. Revenue dipped 2.4 per cent to ADollars 2.7bn. The group said the improvement reflected cost cutting and efficiency improvements following completion of a series of plant level agreements with trade unions. The result also benefited from a 38 per cent reduction in interest costs to ADollars 26m. Directors said the result was achieved in spite of 'a difficult recession year'. Profit fell by 32 per cent to ADollars 85m after abnormal items, mainly because the 1990-91 result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 58m resulting from the disposal of ICI's interest in Catoleum, an Australian petroleum company. The board said the continuing impact of increased operating efficiency should lead to a further increase in profits in the current year. A final dividend of 13 cents makes an 18 (15) cents total.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE HIGH GUARD PROVES A TOP GUN ON VARSITY, TOO;  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL: CRITICS SAID RICK ROBISON WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME SCORING WHEN  HE GRADUATED TO THE VARSITY RANKS. WELL, AS A JUNIOR HE AVERAGED 28.6 POINTS A  GAME AND IS AVERAGING 34 AS A SENIOR.  </P> <P> When Rick Robison was on the freshman basketball team at Torrance High, he  averaged 24 points a game.  </P> <P> Big deal, observers said, he's just playing against freshmen.  </P> <P> As a sophomore on the junior varsity squad, Robison averaged 26 points, but  once again he heard the critics: The skinny guard would wilt against varsity  competition.  </P> <P> Robison didn't wilt, he blossomed. The sharpshooter averaged 28.6 points, 10th  highest in the state, and was named to the All-CIF Southern Section Division II  first team. Touted Ed O'Bannon of Artesia was the only other junior on that  team, which included the state's all-time leading scorer, Tracy Murray of  Glendora, now at UCLA, and Harold Miner of Inglewood, now at USC.  </P> <P> Despite his heroics as a junior, the 6-foot-2 Robison is hearing the criticism  again. He's too small, he's too slow, and he won't be able to score now that  everyone is prepared to stop him.  </P> <P> "Every year people say he won't score, but every year he keeps on doing it,"  Torrance point guard Mike Sebaugh said.  </P> <P> Robison is doing it again. The wiry 17-year-old averaged 34 points in the first  nine games, tops in the South Bay and ranking him among the leaders in the  Southern Section.  </P> <P> "I worked real hard during the summer," Robison said when asked to explain the  scoring increase.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind that his life revolves around basketball,"  Torrance Coach Bob Little said.  </P> <P> Little said Robison scores in an offense that is not designed for him, unlike  last season. "He gets everything off our regular offense," Little said "He has  the same opportunity to score as the other players do. We have no set plays for  him."  </P> <P> This is difficult to believe watching Torrance play. In the semifinals of the  Torrance Holiday Classic against Narbonne last week, Robison sparked a  third-quarter comeback by scoring 10 points in the period.  </P> <P> Every time he touched the ball, it seemed, it was fired toward the basket. And  it usually went in. He took a pass off a fast break from Frank Tamashiro,  pulled up four feet beyond the three-point line and buried a 23-footer. The  next time he touched the ball he broke away after a steal, drove the length of  the court and slam-dunked to the amazement of the crowd.  </P> <P> Granted, the dunk wasn't of the gravity-defying, backboard-breaking variety,  but it was a slam. "He's real competitive," Sebaugh said. "When he gets into  it, he fires everybody up."  </P> <P> Ironically, Robison's lowest point total of the year, 22, came in the same  Narbonne game when he was held scoreless in the fourth quarter. Torrance lost,  77-66.  </P> <P> Robison said the offense doesn't have to focus on him, but he's not shy about  shooting: "If I feel I can make it, I take the shot."  </P> <P> Most teams play Torrance man-to-man and frequently double-team Robison. "I like  when they play man-to-man because if they double team, there will always be a  man open."  </P> <P> That unselfish attitude makes Robison, who averages five assists a game, a  favorite among teammates. "There is a very good climate on the team with Ricky  and the other guys," Little said. "They enjoy watching him play."  </P> <P> Opposing coaches aren't so fond of Robison, but they admire his ability. North  Torrance Coach Jim Nielsen watched Robison riddle his team for 37 points in  Torrance's victory over the Saxons in the third-place game of the Torrance  Holiday Classic.  </P> <P> "He's a tremendous talent," Nielsen said. "He can shoot the ball. He is a pure  scorer and a great foul shooter."  </P> <P> Foul shooting is one of the keys to Robison's scoring. Anybody who takes a lot  of shots is fouled a great deal, and Robison has capitalized. He is shooting  90% from the line, averaging 12 points a game just in that category.  </P> <P> The next step in Robison's development would be an offense that is designed to  get him shots. "I've been thinking about it," Little said. "We'll probably have  something installed by the second round of the league season."  </P> <P> Who knows what Robison could score in an offense designed for him, considering  what he has done so far. He opened the season by scoring 23, 28, 39, 41 and 52  points. The 52-point game came against Huntington Beach in an Orange County  tournament. "After he kept going up like that, I thought, 'Geez, what will  happen next?' " Little said.  </P> <P> Robison has cooled off to his torrid 34-point average, but his thoughts at this  time are with the team: "I hope to go at least as far as we did last year."  </P> <P> As a junior, he led the Tartars to a third-place Bay League finish and a  quarterfinal appearance in the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs.  </P> <P> Robison hopes to earn an athletic scholarship to play college basketball. He  has a college-qualifying score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Oregon State  and UC Irvine have shown interest, but some believe that Robison's game is not  complete for college play.  </P> <P> "I think he's as good a scorer that has been around (the South Bay) in a long  time," said Nielsen, a standout at North High and Washington State. "But  college is tough. He's a little small. I don't know if he's physically strong  enough. But he's proven people wrong before. If I was a college recruiter, I'd  look at him. And if I needed a shooter, I'd recruit him."  </P> <P> Robison acknowledges that his defense needs to improve as well as his size. He  packs only 165 pounds on his 6-2 frame, but he's working on it. "I'm lifting  weights and working out," he said. "I also eat anything I can."  </P> <P> Presently, Robison is eating up defenses and ignoring the critics.  </P> <P> Teammate Sebaugh has known Robison since the eighth grade and knows not to  listen to the naysayers.  </P> <P> "I've heard what Rick can't do," Sebaugh said. "But I have learned not to put  any limits on him."  </P></p>

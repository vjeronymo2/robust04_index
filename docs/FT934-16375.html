			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Survey of Cable TV and Satellite Broadcasting (2): Competition in the air sometimes, as in Germany, also broadcasting on conventional land-based transmitters - is beginning to make life more difficult for public service broadcasters. Next month public service broadcasters from all over Europe will meet under the auspices of the European Broadcasting Union to assess the competitive threat and try to adopt a co-ordinated response. Earlier this year, for example, Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC, conceded that by the turn of the century the new media could account for about one-third of the revenues in British broadcasting and a similar proportion of the audience. A recent study by McKinsey, the consultants found private broadcasters taking an increasing share of the audience in a number of countries. In Germany, for instance in 1987 the total public service had an audience share of 83.1 per cent of viewing. By 1992 it had dropped to 46.5 per cent. McKinsey concluded that the licence fee was potentially the most attractive funding source to meet public service obligations in a difficult competitive world. 'Experience from France, Germany and other comparable countries does suggest that advertising dependence can drive a decline in programme mix that undermines public service broadcasting goals,' the consultants argue.</p>

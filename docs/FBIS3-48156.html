			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia is providing A$1 million for emergency  relief in Kenya. The aid is to help counter the effects of  conflict and drought which have left an estimated one and a half  million people in urgent need of assistance. Kenya also has  around 400,000 refugees forced to flee from conflict and  instability in Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia.    Australia's Development Cooperation Minister Gordon Bilney  says the aid will go towards a supplementary feeding program  aimed at reducing malnutrition in women and children. Funds  will also be spent on blood testing kits to screen for the AIDS  virus, HIV, while further assistance will go to drought  rehabilitation, specially, in Kenya's northwest.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Tokyo, time to compromise When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa became Japan's prime minister last summer, ending 38 years of unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic party, he rightly identified reform of the country's corrupt and antiquated political system as his coalition's principal task. By that yardstick, the defeat of his electoral reform proposals in the upper house of parliament on Friday represents a serious setback. It has undermined, perhaps fatally, the government's cohesion and credibility on the main issue that brought it to power. Worse, it leaves Japan floundering without effective leadership in the face of the most serious economic recession since the second world war and at a time of mounting US pressures over trade. Vital decisions on stimulating and deregulating the economy are being held hostage by the row over reform. Unless it is swiftly resolved, economic confidence will take a further battering and, as Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, made clear in Tokyo yesterday, Japan's international difficulties will multiply. That things have come to this pass is not Mr Hosokawa's fault. His reform bill had the potential to make Japanese politics cleaner and more transparent by replacing the current multi-seat constituency system with a mixture of single-seat districts and proportional representation, and had been endorsed by the lower house of parliament two months ago. Friday's failure reflects rather the fissiparous nature of his seven-party coalition, and in particular the implosion of its largest component, the Social Democratic party, 17 of whose members crossed the floor to vote with the opposition LDP. Mr Hosokawa is now in the ironic position of relying on the power brokers of the LDP itself - the only party which can assure him of a majority - to salvage at least part of his plan. Important change Painful as it may be for the prime minister, a compromise between the government and the LDP on political reform is both necessary and desirable before the current parliamentary session closes on Saturday. Such a compromise is not impossible, for the LDP has proposals of its own. Although they dilute Mr Hosokawa's plan in various ways calculated to benefit the LDP, they retain his most important change - that to single-seat constituencies, which would foster competition between parties on policy grounds rather than encouraging individual politicians from the same party to buy votes with cash and favours as at present. Stagnant economy It is not just on the electoral system, however, that the government and the LDP need to reach some accommodation. The stagnant state of the economy is, if anything, a more pressing case for concerted action. In spite of repeated promises of an economic stimulus package in recent months, Mr Hosokawa has failed to deliver, and his coalition now looks less likely than ever to be able to agree on such necessary measures as a cut in income tax. Neither the domestic economy nor Japan's trading partners can tolerate further delay. Here, too, the onus is on LDP leaders to show statesmanship and recognise their self-interest in lending Mr Hosokawa a helping hand. There will be those in the LDP who, for ideological or electoral reasons, oppose such co-operation. But the alternative - an early election under an unreformed electoral system - would hardly serve a useful purpose. Voters outraged by the politicians' failure to agree on political or economic reform would most likely deliver another weak coalition that would simply prolong the political and economic agony, preside over a further deterioration in Japan's relations with the US, its most important partner, and deepen popular mistrust of the political class. Mr Hosokawa may be a transitional figure in a situation of unprecedented political fluidity. But the fact that he is one of the few politicians to whom the general public disaffection does not apply shows that his declared goals of political reform and economic deregulation are in tune with the desires of the electorate, as well as with the demands of Japan's international partners. From them and from his political rivals, he deserves support in managing an orderly transition to the fresh elections that are all but inevitable in a few months.</p>

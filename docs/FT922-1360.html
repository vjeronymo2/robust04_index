			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls 3.6 per cent to 68-month low A LOWER futures market prompted arbitrage-related selling, depressing the Nikkei average by 3.6 per cent to its weakest level for 68 months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell 598.65 to end at 15,921.22, its lowest close since October 22, 1986. The index rose to the day's high of 16,649.64 after the opening on short-covering, but later dropped on a steady flow of arbitrage-related selling, reaching the day's low of 15,885.79 in the afternoon. Volume decreased to 230m shares from Friday's 236m. Worries about economic prospects kept investors from committing funds and, while small-lot buying by public pension funds was noted, traders said the amounts were not large enough to counter the arbitrage selling pressure. Declines overwhelmed advances by 732 to 204, with 151 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 27.09 to 1,240.18, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.69 to 968.99. Sentiment deteriorated as the market fell through the 16,000 psychological support level. Ms Kathy Matsui at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said that while there was no panic selling, share prices were spiralling down because of lack of buying interest. Mr Jason James at James Capel said institutional investors, looking for weaker market levels in the near future, were hedging their long positions by selling in the futures markets. 'The market has broken out of its bottom, and some chartists are saying it is 'open country' from here,' he added. Nippon Life, the leading life insurer, said its fund managers were buying in small lots. However, prospects of an orchestrated move among life insurers were unlikely, since most of unrealised gains had been already wiped out at some of the leading insurance groups. Mr Fumio Hiramoto, manager of Nomura Securities' stock market division, said the bottom should be around 15,500-15,600, due to a number of technical resistance lines. Dealers unloaded short-term speculative holdings. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y39 to Y991 and Morinaga Milk Industry plunged Y33 to Y858. Daikyo, the condominium maker, lost Y75 to an all-time low of Y670. The stock is now 84 per cent off its peak registered in the early 1980s. Other real estate-related companies also retreated, Mitsui Fudosan slipping Y10 to Y827 and Mitsubishi Estate Y45 to Y741. High-technology issues declined on institutional selling. Hitachi weakened Y23 to Y760, Fujitsu Y28 to Y602 and Sony Y150 to Y4,010. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 275.69 to 19,000.52 in volume of 13.5m shares. Roundup THE Japanese market woes had a limited effect on equities elsewhere in the Pacific Basin. TAIWAN saw its heaviest trade since February, turnover doubling from TDollars 24.7bn to TDollars 49.2bn as speculative buying pushed the weighted index up 79.64, or 1.7 per cent, to 4,697.66. China Development, a recent speculative favourite, led the heavily weighted financial sector to a gain of 3.6 per cent as it rose TDollars 7.50 to TDollars 121.50. Food companies were strong because of the appreciation in the Taiwan dollar, making their raw material imports cheaper. MANILA was lifted by Friday's Dollars 1 3/4 rise to Dollars 38 1/8 in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the composite index adding 25.62 points at 1,519.54. SEOUL reached a low for the year as the composite index lost 6.97 to 558.32. Falls in banks and securities houses spread to other sectors, and sentiment was also affected by worries about an oversupply of shares after a statement by South Korean finance vice-minister Lee Soo-yoo that he would consider allowing the state-run Industrial Bank of Korea to make an initial public offering. HONG KONG climbed, although afternoon profit-taking trimmed early gains. The Hang Seng index closed 32.34 higher at 5,819.94 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.04bn to HKDollars 2.73bn. Initial gains on the strength of last Friday's Tokyo and Wall Street performances were more than enough to offset the weakness in Japan yesterday. AUSTRALIA edged higher in quiet trade, the All Ordinaries index firming 2.4 to 1,636.3, with investors preoccupied by Tokyo's decline and the initial public offering of shares in GIO Australia. The offer will raise up to ADollars 1.2bn, and will employ a constrained open-pricing mechanism with an application price of ADollars 2.40, and a final sale price determined by demand.</p>

Robert Bykov, consultant for the CIS Joint Armed Forces  Headquarters business manager, told MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS'  correspondent that the Finance Ministry proposes abolishing free  medical services for reserve officers and retirees  (approximately 1.3 million people); compulsory insurance of  officers' property; interest-free loans to military school  graduates (at a level of 12 monthly salaries); and interest-free  loans to officers for housing construction (including for  military servicemen and participants in the Chernobyl cleanup  operation).    The Finance Ministry also proposes that retiring officers be  paid the equivalent of not 20 but only five salaries.    The Finance Ministry is planning to submit these proposals  to  today's government session devoted to approving the 1994 budget.</p>

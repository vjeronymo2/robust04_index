			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: JAL maps out a route to recovery  -Japan's flag carrier is fighting for survival SINCE last summer, two new Boeing 747-400 jets belonging to Japan Airlines (JAL), the Japanese flag carrier, have been parked in storage in the US. Pilot resistance delayed the purchase for nearly three years, but when the aircraft were delivered JAL had insufficient pilots trained to fly them. The lessons of this experience have cast a shadow over a restructuring programme the airline is planning for the next two years. A sharp fall in business travel due to Japan's economic downturn and an increasingly cut-throat international aviation market mean JAL's very survival depends on the restructuring programme. This, in turn, depends on winning the co-operation of JAL's often unruly labour unions. It means dismantling the long-established co-operation between labour and management, in which the unions have traditionally held the upper hand. JAL, which reported pre-tax losses of Y6bn (Dollars 51m) on revenues of Y1,114bn in the year to March 1992, is forecasting pre-tax losses of Y50bn for this year and will pass its dividend for the first time since it was privatised in 1987. The airline aims to break even in the year to March 1994 and return to profit the year after. It does not expect to be able to resume dividend payments until the following year. JAL's directors paint a bleak picture of the group's prospects. 'The next two years will be the most important for the survival of the company,' a company publication noted. With 70 per cent of JAL's business on international routes, it has been hurt more than All Nippon Airways, its domestic rival, by the downturn in business travel. Competition has been fierce on international routes, particularly from US airlines offering cheap fares as a quick way to enter and expand their share of the market. As a result, JAL is losing money on most international routes. Only those to China and other parts of Asia and Oceania are in profit. Mr Chikara Sugimoto, director of international affairs, says: 'Overall, the number of passengers flying hasn't fallen, but yields have fallen because everyone is flying economy.' In the 10 months to the end of January, first class travel fell by 18 per cent and business class by 16 per cent. Domestic business has also fallen. JAL's problems however result from a combination of: Failing to spot these changing market trends; A labour policy dictated largely by the unions; High costs resulting from being based in Japan; Over-dependence on international and business class travel; Several years of expansion that have left it a bloated, inefficient organisation. The restructuring is aimed not only at cutting costs but also refocusing its operations to reflect Japan's changed aviation market. To cut costs it is reducing the number of B747-400 aircraft it is buying by 25, cutting staff costs, increasing the use of leased aircraft and curbing other investment. Earlier this month, JAL announced that 375 flight attendants it planned to hire in April would not be taken on until September. The airline is also aiming gradually to replace up to 30 per cent of Japanese cabin crew with foreign staff, who cost about half in overheads. For an airline which boasts flight attendants who were graduates of Tokyo University, Japan's most prestigious academic institution, that may not be an easy task. From April 1, it plans to abolish an employee savings scheme offering an interest rate of 9.72 per cent. It is negotiating to withdraw employee benefits, such as limousine services for flight attendants, and studying an early retirement programme. At the same time, JAL is trying to reduce its dependence on international business and aims to raise the share of domestic revenue from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the total. For JAL, which has long shunned discount tickets but had been able to increase business without cultivating the budget-conscious holiday traveller, the need to restructure has been intense. For a growing number of Japanese travellers the comfort and security of travelling JAL is no longer worth the high price. Mr Geoffrey Tudor, director of public relations, says: 'We have got to get back into the market place.' However, the price war on international routes is escalating and competition for international traffic will increase with the opening of Kansai International Airport in 1994 and the expansion of Haneda and Narita airports. In the long run, JAL's survival will also depend on how far and how fast it can shed its glamorous high-flying past for a more down-to-earth approach to today's market realities.</p>

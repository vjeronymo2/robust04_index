			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tokyo office economic reporter Takafusa </F> Tachibana: "Japan Holds Tough, Reacts to Criticism of  Bureaucrats -- Does Not Want To Repeat `Semiconductor' Mistake";  from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 5 February Morning Edition]    [Text] Although not much time is left until the  Japanese-U.S. summit meeting, by which time the Japanese-U.S.  economic consultations are supposed to be concluded and to  arrive at an agreement, a Japanese official in charge of  negotiations kept on repeating firmly, "It is better to have no  agreement than to make the wrong kind of concessions and to sow  the seeds of misfortune in the future." Even the meetings  between U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who  arrived into Japan on 1 February, and Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and  industry, did not go beyond discussing basic things.    Even though Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of  commerce,  once said "we are not seeking numerical targets," the United  States has proposed making trends and indicators objective  criteria. Japanese officials in charge of the negotiations take  such proposals as de facto numerical targets, saying, "The  expressions may be different, but there is no difference in that  they want future targets after all."    The reason why the Japanese officials are so rigid is  because  of their bad experiences. One of them is the Japanese-U.S.  semiconductor agreement. Whereas it contained a figure of 20  percent for foreign semiconductors' market share in Japan as the  U.S. industry's hoped-for figure, before one knew what was  happening, the U.S. Government started to say that it was a  figure that the Japanese Government promised would be attained.  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said it  will not retreat from its position, insisting: "We will never  repeat the same kind of mistake. If we put numbers in an  agreement, that will be interpreted as public pledge by the  Japanese Government."    One of the reasons why the Japanese Government, which has  kept on making concessions in past negotiations with the United  States, now has taken so tough a stand is that the trade  environment is greatly different following the conclusion of the  GATT's Uruguay Round of talks at the end of last year. Its  position is now that multinational trade rules have been  established, "if a dispute arises between two countries, the  right thing to do is to bring it to the GATT for open  discussions." After deciding to partially open the rice market,  which was a symbol of the closed nature of the Japanese market,  Japan's guilty conscience has lessened as well.    "We won't tell them not to come. But they can't do anything  even if they do come." [source not identified] The arrivals of  cabinet-rank officials such as USTR Mickey Kantor -- on the  heels of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- are seen as an  overbearing act ignoring the framework of negotiations now under  way at the vice- ministerial level. The U.S. claim against  Japan concerning Japanese "bureaucrats' impeding the progress of  negotiations" has amplified Japanese bureaucrats' mistrust of  the United States, and "we are now mutually distrustful of each  other," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of  international trade and industry.    But Japanese officials are perplexed as well. The MITI,  working behind the scenes, is asking domestic automobile  manufacturers to prepare voluntary plans on the purchase of  foreign-made parts -- in hopes of finding a breakthrough in the  framework talks on automobiles and auto parts.    The government wants to adopt a policy of not being involved  directly in order to prevent any figures from turning into  numerical targets, but there is no change in the fact that this  is nontransparent administrative guidance. Such a practice  weakens Japan's position on "not resorting to the practice of  trade of a managed nature," and consequently it will be rather  counterproductive to the negotiations.</p>

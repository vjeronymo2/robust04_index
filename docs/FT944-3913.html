			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds to close nearly flat Wall Street Share prices bounced back from early-morning lows yesterday to finish nearly flat amid growing fears of another rise in interest rates, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.38 at 3,691.11. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.52 at 446.97, the American Stock Exchange composite down 2.15 at 420.66 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.07 at 719.05. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 338m shares. The Dow fell more than 30 points at one point yesterday before rebounding as investors bought cheap equities at the bottom of the market and traders covered their short positions. Late in the morning the market turned mixed with the Dow momentarily positive, but most of the indices proved unable to hold on to positive terri-tory. While the stock market worried that another interest rate increase could erode corporate earnings, the bond market was relishing the realisation that the Federal Reserve did intend to hold a firm line against inflation. The long bond price jumped in the morning before sliding back to gain 1/8 by midday, while the price of the two-year note showed modest declines. Stock and bond markets, which have moved in tandem for much of this year, continued their recent decoupling as stocks skidded sharply in the early morning, while the long bond shot upward before falling off slightly. The stock market continues to alternate between moving with the bond market, and acting as a mirror image of it. Financial troubles in Orange County continued to trouble the market. Stocks have been volatile all week amid uncertainty over the ramifications of huge losses made by the California county and its declaration of bankruptcy on Tuesday. Also causing worry were fears that individual investors might begin to pull money from mutual funds in the wake of several sharp selloffs, including a loss of nearly 50 points on Thursday. Technology stocks received a boost from figures showing rising demand for semiconductors. Texas Instruments gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 72, National Semiconductor rose Dollars 1 at Dollars 18 3/8 and Applied Materials increased Dollars 2 at Dollars 43 1/4 . Intel was unchanged at Dollars 62 3/4 . Cyclical stocks were mixed. United Technologies dropped Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 58 1/8 , Caterpillar fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 50 7/8 and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber lost Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 32 7/8 . Shares posting gains included Hewlett-Packard, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 95 1/8 , Dow Chemical Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 62 7/8 , Roadway Service, which is traded on the Nasdaq, Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 48 1/4 and Motorola Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 55 3/8 . Canada A late-session rally took back the bulk of early losses in Toronto as stocks closed modestly lower in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 12.24 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 4034.33, with losers over winners 450 to 253. Volume traded of 43.999,000 shares and value of CDollars 522.7m were down from Thursday's 53,634,000 shares and CDollars 655.4m. Overall, 11 of the 14 sub-indexes were down led by real estate, conglomerates, pipelines and communications stocks. Mexico Mexican stocks finished lower for a third straight session yesterday in light trade ahead of Monday's Virgin of Guadalupe holiday. The market's key IPC index settled off 32.11 points to 2,467.79 - a loss of 1.28 per cent. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Buying, especially foreign buying, was again stunted by fears of a renewed outbreak of violence in the troubled state of Chiapas. Volume totalled a light 468 million new pesos, on 35.7 million shares traded.</p>

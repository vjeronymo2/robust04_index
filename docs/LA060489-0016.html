			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVES: STRAUSS: "ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA"; "VIER LETZTE LIEDER."  </P> <P> New York Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta; Eva Marton, soprano; Toronto  Symphony conducted by Andrew Davis. CBS Masterworks MDK-44910 (compact disc).  It looks like a bargain, but this midprice reissue offers value only in the  extended Nietzsche-inspired tone poem. Mehta conducts a persuasively idiomatic  performance, wasting little time over the bombastic introduction, preferring to  indulge the more seductive rhetoric of the "Night Waltz," aided by Glenn  Dicterow's suave violin. The 1980 sonics are a bit crude by today's standards.  Marton unfortunately brings little but a generalized vehemence to the Four Last  Songs, battling a cantilena that must soar above all worldly (and vocal)  considerations. Davis provides lumpy accompaniment. Allan Ulrich  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> INVASION OF THE EUROPEAN LETTUCES;  </P> <P> PLANTING: SEEDS FOR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THE TASTY, TENDER LETTUCES CAN NOW BE  OBTAINED IN U.S..  </P> <P> European gardeners and cooks know and savor lettuce. Most would certainly not  be satisfied with the mundane offerings found in American supermarkets.  </P> <P> Their kitchen gardens abound with a marvelous array of lettuces that feature  colors, tastes, shapes and textures that differ from lettuce varieties found in  this country.  </P> <P> Thanks to a trio of mail order seed firms, these sweet, crisp, tender and  colorful European lettuces are now available to gardeners in this country.  </P> <P> Now through early spring is a great time to sample these new varieties in your  garden. And you don't actually need a garden. Lettuce is simple and quick to  grow in a container on a sunny patio.  </P> <P> European lettuces (as do American lettuces) come in four basic types. Here is a  rundown of the four types along with some of the exciting varieties found in  each.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Butterhead Lettuce  </P> <P> Many gardeners and gourmets feel that the butterhead varieties have the best  flavor of all the lettuce types. The butterhead lettuce varieties are soft and  fragile in texture, containing a buttery colored heart surrounded by vividly  colored outer leaves.  </P> <P> The spongy leaves have a delicate, sweet, buttery flavor. The heads of  butterhead lettuce are very loosely folded and never become solid. Unlike  American butterhead varieties which are usually green, the European butterheads  come in a range of colors that typically include crimson or bronze, tapering to  various shades of green and yellow at the heart.  </P> <P> Of the four lettuce types, Europeans tend to favor the butterheads and have  developed some outstanding varieties. Sangria comes from France and has outer  leaves tinted a rosy red color and pale yellow interior leaves.  </P> <P> Its thick wavy leaves are tender and succulent. From Switzerland comes Pirat, a  very mild butterhead whose pale green leaves are mottled with bronze. Capitane  is a gourmet Dutch butterhead that is sold by very fancy Common Market  greengrocers. It has rosettes of large, velvety green leaves and a buttery  flavor that requires only the simplest oil and vinegar dressing. Merveille des  Quatre Saisons is a beautiful, tender French lettuce with very large  ruby-tipped leaves that surround pretty green hearts. It has great ornamental  as well as eating qualities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Romaine Lettuce  </P> <P> Romaine lettuce derives its name from Roman lettuce, which was grown by  14th-Century popes in the palace gardens and its cultivation quickly spread  throughout Europe. It is also referred to as cos lettuce in some seed  catalogues. Romaine became famous as the lettuce used in Caesar Salad. And  indeed, if grown and harvested properly, it deserves its reputation for  excellence of flavor. In contrast to the delicate flavor of butterhead lettuce,  romaine has a bold, hearty flavor.  </P> <P> Rouge D'Hiver has beautiful, wine-red leaves and comes from France. It has  better heat tolerance than most romaines. Winter Density is a beautiful English  romaine. Its compact deep-green heads are more tender than most romaines.  </P> <P> Romance is a French romaine with upright crispy green leaves that have a  unique, sweet flavor. Little Gem is a miniature romaine that comes from  England. The heads are four or five inches tall with bright-green, wavy leaves  that are perfect for individual salads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Batavian Lettuce  </P> <P> European batavian lettuce somewhat resembles American crisphead or iceberg  lettuce, however, it has a wider range of colors and shapes, and the heads are  generally looser.  </P> <P> In addition, unlike our crisphead lettuce, batavian heads are sweeter and never  bland tasting. They are also easier to grow than American crisphead lettuce  varieties.  </P> <P> Rouge Grenobloise is a beautiful French batavian lettuce with shiny green  leaves tinted with burgundy red. The leaves are sweet and crunchy.  </P> <P> Kristia, also from France, has crispy, large medium green leaves that are juicy  and never bitter. It takes hot weather better than other batavians. Canasta is  a gorgeous French batavian with red tinged, bright green leaves. It is sweet,  crisp and juicy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looseleaf Lettuce  </P> <P> Looseleaf lettuce is the easiest of all lettuces to grow and the most rapid to  reach maturity. As its name implies, looseleaf lettuce does not form heads.  Looseleaf lettuce makes an attractive landscaping item as the many looseleaf  varieties offer a multitude of colors which include deep burgundy, lime green,  bronze, red-tipped and dark green. The foliage is crinkled, frilled, wavy or  curled depending on which variety you grow.  </P> <P> In outlining the virtues of European lettuces, I don't want to give the idea  that American varieties are vastly inferior; they're not. Our looseleaf  varieties such as Red Sails, Black Seeded Simpson, Oakleaf, Prize Head and  others are the equal of European varieties. However, for both flavor and beauty  the European lettuces are hard to beat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> FINDING SEEDS FOR EUROPEAN LETTUCES  </P> <P> You probably won't be able to locate seeds for the European lettuces in local  nurseries; most will have to be ordered by mail. The following mail order  companies stock seeds for varieties mentioned:  </P> <P> Shepherd's Garden Seeds, 6116 Highway 9, Felton, Ca. 95018. Catalog $1. Lists  Capitane, Merveille des Quatre Saisons, Romance, Little Gem, Rouge Grenobloise  and Kristia.  </P> <P> Johnny's Selected Seeds, Foss Hill Road, Albion, Me. 04910. Catalogue free.

Lists  Pirat, Rouge D'Hiver and Lollo Rossa.  </P> <P> In addition to varieties mentioned here, these three companies offer a huge  selection of other unique European and American lettuce varieties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P>  For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  </P> <P> * Thanksgiving is on its way. Brighten up the indoors with potted  chrysanthemums or decorate with autumn-hued leaves, brightly colored  persimmons, pomegranates and berried branches.  </P> <P> * If you don't have a deciduous tree that gives a glorious show of leaf color  in the fall, check at your local nursery and see what they suggest for your  area of the state. Don't prune existing deciduous trees until they are  completely dormant this winter.  </P> <P> * You can lift and divide phlox and primroses this month.  </P> <P> * Soggy soil from winter rain will rot the tubers of tuberous begonias, so be  sure to lift them out of the ground and store them in a cool, dry area.  </P></p>

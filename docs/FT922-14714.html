			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Shopping out in Paris and London - Food / Giles McDonogh compares shops in two of Europe's great cities ALTHOUGH I have been back in London for seven years, I still find it inconvenient. Food shops are open neither early nor late. If you have run out of bread or milk at breakfast time, you must do without. As early as 4.30 pm, fishmongers and butchers are wiping down their slabs and preparing to shut; by the time most people leave work they have closed, leaving the supermarket chains as the sole source of fresh food. In some ways, I am luckier than most. I live in Islington, a well-favoured part of town close to the West End. Steve Watt, London's best fishmonger, is only five minutes' walk away in Essex Road; there is no lack of decent butchers; and the Chapel Street market provides cheap fruit and vegetables (although nothing that might be called exotic). The chains include Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer in Liverpool Road and The Market (the best for wine but the worst for virtually everything else) round the corner in Upper Street. The problem is that I have never wholly got used to shopping in supermarkets. As a single man I am never sure before the evening whether I am staying in or going out. Consequently, I decide what I am going to eat at seven or so. By that time, the only solution is to rummage through the meat selection at the supermarket: never a thrilling prospect. Life would be easier if I admitted the existence of convenience foods, but I do not; I refuse to stockpile food and have the deepest horror of deep freezes. The result can be a sadly monotonous diet of steak or chops. Paris was altogether different. I lived in the French gastropolis for seven years before returning to London: pretty well everything was available when you needed it and, in spite of a number of changes for the worse, it remains a gourmand's paradise. At some time or other I have lived in almost every one of the city's 20 arrondissements, but the area I know best is Montparnasse. It is a Parisian village like any other; nothing particularly special by local standards. On Wednesday and Saturday mornings, a market covered a length of the boulevard Edgar Quinet in the shadow of the Montparnasse Tower. On Tuesdays and Fridays, another morning market could be found along a stretch of the boulevard Raspail. If you needed a market open in the afternoon, Thursdays and Sunday mornings, there was the rue de Buci on the other side of the Luxembourg Gardens, providing a useful objective for a Sunday morning walk. What made these three markets so different to Chapel Street was the variety of produce on sale. Stalls groaned under fresh poultry, neatly-trimmed legs of lamb or Mediterranean fish. A Norman farmer would arrange his own Camemberts and fromage frais on a trestle table. Piles of ceps and chanterelles appeared in season. Moreover, every stall-holder was on hand to volunteer information on how best to prepare what was being offered. Within a few hundred metres of my door there were a dozen bakers, all of whom were working long before I had even thought of breakfast. Some used ready-made dough, but it was not long before you realised who was good and who was not. On the other side of the boulevard de Montparnasse, in the rue Delambre, a fishmonger followed the nice old custom of popping a lemon and a bunch of parsley into your bag with the fish. A good cheesemonger was next door while, at the end of the street (now, sadly, gone), a real craftsman charcutier was open on the generally miserable Mondays to sell fresh pork and those juicy steaks the French call onglets. All the local shops were open to 7.30 pm, making last-minute shopping the rule for most busy working people. While Monday reduced some people to the horse butcher, Sunday mornings were like any other. Even at Christmas, you could still shop in the morning and drop into one of the local brasseries to buy a few dozen oysters to serve your friends before the festive lunch. The only time when Paris seemed as barren as London was during August, when the shopkeepers had an unfortunate habit of disappearing en masse on family holidays. During that month, the few of us who remained to face the tourists exchanged precious addresses: a launderette, a tobacconist, a butcher or a fishmonger which had decided to take its holidays a month earlier. But standards have slipped. Many bakers are supplied from industrial concerns, while charcutiers and patissiers often sell the same Russian salad or fruit tart. But Paris is a long way from descending to the level of London. Part of the reason is that the local shops and markets remain viable for working men and women in the late-20th century by opening early and closing late. In England, the supermarkets deserve their victory over the small shopkeepers: only they were wise enough to adapt to changing times.</p>

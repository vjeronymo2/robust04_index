			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Management: Keep it quiet and healthy at work - Deafness as a work-related disease / Health Check Those who think deafness is mainly a question of old age may be in for a surprise. Noise at work is the leading cause of hearing loss in the industrialised world, with 1.7m people in Britain estimated by the Health &amp; Safety Executive to be suffering from work-related deafness. Hearing loss has long been known to follow loud blasts on the battlefield, and industrial deafness goes back more than two centuries. So-called boilermaker's deafness was commonplace in the 1890s - with today's wider range of noisy machinery, hearing loss affects many more workers. Noise-induced problems may not be new, but there is now greater interest in occupational health as well as growing disquiet over leisure noise. Loud noise affects the inner ear; it damages the hair cells of the cochlea, which translates the vibration of sound waves into electrical impulses. The first symptom of damage is often tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Its severity is a guide to the risk of incipient deafness. When hearing loss sets in, it may be reversible at first - as after a rock concert - but later it becomes permanent. An early complaint is muffled hearing, or difficulty on the telephone or in the pub. High-pitched sounds can be especially hard to distinguish. The risk of deafness is related to noise levels which are measured in decibels (dB), usually on the A scale which compensates for the fact that human hearing is more acute for high-pitched sounds. The decibel scale is logarithmic, so the difference between 90dB and 100dB is a ten-fold increase in sound energy. Levels of 80dB are roughly those you would find in a busy street and pose no significant risk to hearing. But around 2.4m UK workers, according to the HSE, are exposed to levels above this. Occupational deafness is a prescribed industrial disease, and an employee may successfully claim compensation from his employer if hearing loss is work-related. Under the 1989 Noise at Work Regulations, employers have a general duty to reduce noise to the lowest levels practicable, and a specific duty to take action where levels are too high. Where the daily exposure of an employee is likely to be 85dB, information about the dangers must be given, along with instruction on minimising risks. Ear protectors (muffs or plugs) should be provided to all employees on request, and - very importantly - maintained in working condition. At 90dB, employers must ensure that ear protectors are worn, and that ear protection zones are marked if at all possible. Everyone entering the zone, however briefly, should protect their ears. Ear protectors don't entirely cut out noise and are not always worn. Some workers claim they hinder communication with colleagues or prevent them from hearing warning sirens (this seems unlikely). Dirty protectors can cause ear infections, but even when clean they are often considered uncomfortable, inconvenient, or wimpish. Nonetheless at 90dB the employer is responsible. Only accurate technical measurements can determine how noisy an environment is, but as a rough guide, if people must shout to be heard two metres away, or their ears ring after work, noise is excessive. Factories are not the only places affected - many offices and farms are noisy too. Since the risks of noise are cumulative, hours of work and length of service are relevant, as are leisure pursuits. The effects of loud noise go well beyond the ear. Aggression, poor concentration, learning difficulties, and feelings of hopelessness have all been described.

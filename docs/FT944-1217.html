			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar takes battle to Northern's heartland The top management of Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, yesterday took its battle for Northern Electric to the takeover target's Tyneside heartland, writes Chris Tighe. Mr Nigel Rich, above right, Trafalgar chief executive, and Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, posed for photographers on Newcastle Quayside before holding a press conference in the nearest hotel to the rec's city centre headquarters. They were accompanied by Mr Rodney Leach, strategy and finance director, and also by the senior executives of five of the Trafalgar companies based in north-east England, to underline the conglomerate's existing links with the region. Although they were, physically at least, only yards apart the two management teams did not meet, despite Trafalgar requests. 'We don't think there's any basis for a conversation at this stage', said Northern Electric.</p>

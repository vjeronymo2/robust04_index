			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREETING GORILLAS;  </P> <P> INN STILL IN  </P> <P> It's been approximately 10 years since I first saw your feature article about  the Old Monterey Inn. In case you haven't visited 500 Martin Street lately,  Anne and Gene Swett continue to provide the best aspects of every B&amp;B  they've ever visited, along with their own amenities. They serve a spectacular  full breakfast, different each morning. Throughout the day the huge Tudor house  and gardens are open for reading, lounging or partaking of always-available hot  and cold beverages. There are teatime cookies, followed by a sherry hour with  memorable canapes. And the Inn's accommodations are the finest anywhere. Rates  are from $140 to $195. Thanks for the introduction.  </P> <P> WILLIAM B. LENZ  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 8 (AFP) -- Hong Kong is to send a  top official to the United States next month to lobby for  Washington's renewal of China's most favoured nation (MFN)  trading status, a government spokesman said Tuesday. Chief  Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy,  will meet senior members of the U.S. administration,  congressional leaders in Washington and business and trade  groups in New York in late April to lobby for the unconditional  renewal of MFN for China in June. Chan, who is expected to be  in the United States for five days, said "the United States and  China are Hong Kong's two largest trading partners and a good  relationship between them will be a vital factor in Hong Kong's  long-term success."    It is estimated that failure to renew MFN would cut Hong  Kong's growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by up to three  percentage points -- a loss of between 19 billion-to-26 billion  Hong Kong dollars (2.4 billion-to-3.3 billion U.S.) in income,  and cost up to 75,000 jobs. "I shall be setting out in no  uncertain terms Hong Kong's commitment to free trade as a  general principle and the importance of the unconditional  renewal of China's MFN status to Hong Kong," she said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in  China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before  renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in  June. Since Friday, China has detained some dissidents in  defiance of U.S. warnings that improvements in its human rights  record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely  to top the agenda when U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher visits Beijing on Friday.    However, Chan said: "Hong Kong, more than any country, is  concerned about human rights, but we don't think, in principle,  it is right to use trade as a tool to achieve other objective."  "I also believe China's continued growth in economy will also  become more liberalize over the passage of time in its political  outlook," she said. [sentence as received]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Republic of Ingushetia"]    [Text] In a press conference yesterday, Republic of  Ingushetia President Aushev related his impressions of his  participation in a 7 April private session of the Federation  Council of the Russian Federation that looked at the situation  in the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone and confirmed an edict  of the Russian Federation president on extending of the state of  emergency on part on the territories of the Republic of North  Ossetia and the Republic of Ingushetia. The Ingushetia  president is known to have walked out, stating that the edict  took no account of the Ingush side's wishes regarding the  narrowing of the state of emergency zone down to Prigorodnyy  Rayon, the scene of hostilities in October-November 1992, and  the placing of the rayon governing bodies under the Provisional  Administration. None of the points in the Russian Federation  president's edict had been agreed on with the Ingush side,  whereas the remarks of the Ingush "vis-a-vis" from Vladikavkaz  had been reflected in the text of the edict.    Insisting on his own version that Russia and, in particular,  Sergey Shakhray, its vice premier and minister for the affairs  of nationalities and regional policy of the Russian Federation,  remain guilty for the conflict that continues between the  republics of the Federation, Ingushetia President Aushev doubted  the wisdom of Ingushetia's remaining in the role of Russian  Federation component if this does not find practical expression.</p>

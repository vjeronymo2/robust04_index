			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (15): Discretion and convenience - A French company's fleet management policy DISCRETION and convenience are the watchwords of fleet management at Alcatel Alsthom's headquarters in Paris. Cars and vans bought are most likely to be French in France, German in Germany and British in the UK . Decision-making is decentralised and conducted by each subsidiary rather than strictly controlled from Paris. If there is an overall strategy, it is to prioritise convenience and discretion - as well as to keep costs down. Convenience in practice means that where Alsthom operates in the home territory of a leading motor manufacturer its products are probably cheaper and easier to service than those of a foreign producer with a small market share. For the directors' cars local products also make for a lower profile. As fleet manager for all Alcatel Alsthom's operations in Paris and the Ile de France, Jean-Claude Rousson is responsible for handling the buying of cars for directors at Alcatel's five main offices in the Paris region and running a fleet of some 300 commercial vehicles, mostly light and medium-sized vans. Autonomy for all subsidiaries means that he does not get involved with the decisions for Alcatel Cable or any other division based in the same area. He nevertheless is the person responsible for keeping the board members on the road. His operations break down into two distinct parts; the cars for the directors and the commercial vehicles for the repair and maintenance teams. The logic behind the division is a simple question of quantity of vehicles and the tax treatment of them. In France it is not possible to recover the VAT on directors' cars, but it is deductible for the commercial fleet. The commercial vehicles are bought through an annual tender process in lots of typically between 50 and 100 units. Requests for tender submissions are sent to all leading vehicle manufacturers, but the final choice has consistently remained between Renault and Citroen. Peugeot misses out because of its essentially passenger car range. Fine tuning of prices and specifications are carried out after submissions have been received. The directors, on the other hand, are allowed a healthy choice of cars and tend to pick the top-of-the-range Citroen XMs and Peugeot 605s - a reflection perhaps that the Renault 25, due for replacement this year, is now looking a little tired. They are expected only to use company cars for company business and have a car of their own for private use. Insurance, maintenance and petrol are all paid by Alcatel. Mr Rousson explains that in addition to the practical reasons of price and servicing 'buying French is a group decision, but one without pressure. It is simpler, but there is also a certain sentimentality (towards the French marques).' His colleagues in foreign subsidiaries are not expected to import French cars or to buy locally-sourced French-made vehicles. Alcatel amortises the cost of its fleet over four years, but tends to keep vehicles longer - up to six years. The vans clock up an average of 50,000km a year. 'After that they are dead in terms of cost and usability,' says Mr Rousson. 'We keep them all that long and the chairman sets a good example.' The decision to buy rather than lease, Mr Rousson explains in terms of price, even though leasing and long-term hire are gaining in popularity among other fleet operators. 'We are able to amortise the cost,' he explains. Diesel-engined vehicles for the van fleet 'cost more at the beginning but that gives us more to amortise'. His relaxed position on commiting so much capital to his vehicle fleet is perhaps one that companies smaller than the giant Alcatel could not hold quite so easily. Buyers are penalised by a number of special taxes. Cars attract France's 25 per cent luxury goods rate of VAT (18.6 per cent is the standard rate) and a special Taxe sur les Voitures de Societe (TVS) that is calculated on the mysterious puissance fiscale (fiscal value based roughly on engine size and make), which adds an extra FFr5,700 (Dollars 1,053) to the cost of running the smallest cars and FFr15,000 the largest. Users also have to pay a taxe professionelle which varies from region to region. While the majority of fleet operators are still buyers, the proportion has been dropping since the mid-1980s and is now only 52 per cent, according to the motoring weekly Auto Plus, as leasing and long rental become more sophisticated. That challenge to the traditional modus operandi and the possibility that European tax harmonisation might reduce the cost of company motoring and, hence, increase fleet sizes has sparked a new interest in fleet operation in France. At present only between 16 per cent and 23 per cent of new cars, depending on the interpretation of the figures, are bought for professional use - a rate considerably lower than that of the UK. But as a sign that things are changing French fleet operators will next month be able to attend Auto Flotte 1992, the first exhibition of its kind in France.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'BREWSTER PLACE': OVERCOOKED PRIME-TIME MELODRAMA  </P> <P> ABC continues its streak of boldness. Its "Brewster Place," premiering at 9:30  tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, is a rare prime-time dramatic series about  blacks.  </P> <P> If only this weekly half hour were better.  </P> <P> Reprising her role as suffering Mattie Michael from last year's popular  miniseries "The Women of Brewster Place," Oprah Winfrey is again a fountain of  virtue in her eclectic black Chicago neighborhood. Too much virtue. Mattie is  such an icon of goodness -- and this series so determined to be uplifting and  inspirational -- that you can hardly stand it.  </P> <P> It's 1967, and after losing her beautician's job for criticizing her employer's  business ethics, Mattie is urged by her best friend Etta Mae (Brenda Pressley)  to join her in buying a neighborhood restaurant. Distrustful of all  relationships after having her heart broken by her no-good son, Mattie has to  be convinced by Etta Mae to take a chance: "A broken heart doesn't have to be a  cold heart."  </P> <P> After this overcooked melodramatic sequence, they buy the restaurant, setting  up next Tuesday's second episode when Mattie and Etta Mae suffer -- and  overcome -- one disaster after another: A load of meat is too big for the  freezer, which breaks down. A cash register malfunctions. A know-it-all white  cook (John Speredakos) won't shut up. A mean-spirited busybody (Olivia Cole,  held over from the miniseries) won't stop snickering. Customers demand their  food.  </P> <P> Just why the health department doesn't close this place down after the first  day is a mystery. Not to worry, though, for all ends tidily and happily.  </P> <P> "Brewster Place" moves into its regular 9:30 p.m. Wednesday time slot May 9,  supplanting that infinitely more engaging comedy "The Marshall Chronicles."  </P> <P> Winfrey, who is co-executive producer, displays some of the appealing humanity  that also characterizes her work on her syndicated talk show. And Pressley  provides occasional humor and Cole a refreshing spark of nastiness. But  "Brewster Place" is so saccharine and enervating and Mattie so sorrowful and  subdued that you feel weary just watching. Not too weary to change channels,  however. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

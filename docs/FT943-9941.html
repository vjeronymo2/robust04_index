			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Buyers take another look at Canada - International The Canadian bond market, which has suffered the twin handicaps of an adverse international interest rate environment and domestic political uncertainty, showed signs of perking up last week. The government's CDollars 1.9bn 10-year bond auction met strong buying from domestic and US investors, causing the spread between 10-year Canadian and US bonds to tighten from 208 basis points at the start of the week to 185 basis points on Friday. Investors, who had been staying away from the market, were encouraged by expectations of such a tightening ahead of this week's 10-year US Treasury auction. But there are other reasons why investors are looking again at the Canadian market. With 10-year yields still above 9 per cent and flat inflation, real yields are among the highest available - although in the longer term the Canadian inflation rate is not expected to remain flat, but to rise to between 3 and 4 per cent. For foreign investors, the weakness of the Canadian dollar is also attractive. It has helped encourage substantial flows from retail investors in Belgium, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, Germany, into the Canadian dollar eurobond market, where new issues totalling more than CDollars 750m were launched last week. There is a heavy schedule of redemptions in the sector, totalling CDollars 1.8bn in August, most of which is being reinvested in the market, as investors do not want to realise losses incurred on the currency. Dealers also report some nibbling by institutional investors, as well as fresh investment by retail buyers. However, European institutions have not yet been tempted back into the market in force, either because they are still overweight in Canadian bonds or because they remain cautious about volatility as a result of political uncertainty. The greatest danger for the market is an explosion of volatility ahead of the September 12 election in Quebec. Concern about the election has abated somewhat since the date was set; at the long end of the market, Quebec bonds have tightened from about 115 basis points two months ago to 95 basis points over Canadian government bond yields. But the election remains the overriding influence on the market, as the Parti Quebecois, which is in the lead according to opinion polls, has a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. According to Swiss Bank Corporation, 'even the most cursory look at how the Canadian bond market has behaved in the past shows that concern over Quebec separatism and associated issue of Canada's political unity is one of the most important factors in the market's behaviour'. However, the market has priced in the election fears earlier than usual this time round and may not react as violently as it has on past occasions, according to some analysts. Signs that the governing Liberals are narrowing the gap have helped reassure the markets. In addition, it is widely thought a a PQ victory would represent a vote for a change of government, rather than for separation, and would likely be followed by a referendum vote to remain in Canada. 'Even if the PQ wins, the standard pattern is that the market will pick up once the uncertainty (of the election) is out of way. We don't think separation will occur because the costs involved are so severe,' said Mr Simon Maggs, a bond analyst at UBS. While there could be volatility at the time of the election, analysts are positive about the market's longer-term prospects. 'We are cautiously bullish, but only the brave ones will go in before the election,' said Mr Kevin Logan, chief North American economist at SBC in New York. There is still some downside: while a PQ election victory is priced into the market, a landslide could be viewed by the party as a mandate for separation without a referendum, which is likely to cause a further sharp sell-off. However, Mr David Adamo, senior vice-president of fixed-income research at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, points to strong fundamentals, including low inflation and a pick-up in the economy allowing the provinces to meet their deficit targets. 'Going into next year, once the uncertainty of Quebec is out of the way, the spread between Canada and the US may get back to 100 basis points,' said Mr Adamo. The yield curve between two and 30 years, which has been hovering around 100 basis points, is beginning to steepen further, as the Bank of Canada appears to want to keep short-term rates as low as possible. With three-month bills currently down to 5.45 per cent, while two-year bonds are yielding just under 8 per cent, short-dated bonds are currently attractive, according to Mr Adamo.</p>

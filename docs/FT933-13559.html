			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Yuriko Koike - The Television Star / How candidates fared Ms Yuriko Koike, star of television and the Japan New party, was elected comfortably, as was Ms Takako Doi, the former Socialist leader, both in the western constituency of Hyogo. Ms Koike is likely to be the deputy parliamentary head of her party, while there were calls last night from within Ms Doi's depleted party for her to return as SDP leader. Both MPs say they support 'political reform', but have very different views on its meaning. Ms Doi would like her party to reform, though she was unwilling to change some of its cherished but unpopular foreign policy and unable to draft an alternative economic policy. Ms Koike wants electoral boundaries to be redrawn, making politics less expensive and less prone to financial scandal. She is also pushing for an overhaul of parliamentary style, saying 'there's no real debate in the parliament'.</p>

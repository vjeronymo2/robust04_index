			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F> unidentified correspondent; date and place not given; Kucan  speaks in Slovene with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Mr. President, your visit to  Croatia and your talks with President Tudjman are taking place  at a time when Croatian-Slovene relations have been assuming  more positive forms. Can you compare the state of relations  between the two countries at a time of their struggle for  independence, and today when these relations are not as idyllic  as they used to be four years ago?    [Kucan] I cannot see much improvement in our relations. They  are simply stagnating. This is a bad thing and does not reflect  the fact that we are two countries. It does not reflect our  interests and is far below the level of both countries' vital  interests. It is true, as you say, that our relations had a far  more glittering past, which was more beneficial to both  countries. This was at the time of dissociation and our nascent  independence when the two countries set their standards of  international conduct. These standards were based on the  realization that a peaceful way was needed, that arguments were  needed, as well as respect for others, that dialogue was needed.  All of this facilitates coexistence once it has been  established that living together in a shared state is no longer  possible. At that time, by these standards, both countries  established their recognizable individuality in international  relations. They managed to prove the fundamental validity of  their decision to exercise their right to self-determination.  It is then justifiable to ask: Why are they not capable now  of meeting these same standards in their mutual relations? Why  has their will decreased? Why do they not find the resolution  of these issues a priority? Why do they rather find priorities  elsewhere? To some extent we can justify and understand this as  a result of the different circumstances surrounding Slovenia, as  opposed to those surrounding Croatia. Given both countries'  ambitions, I am referring to their European ambitions. It is  nevertheless a short-sighted view that the issue of mutual  relations are not a priority. Countries that are incapable of  resolving their shared issues along European criteria -- without  creating difficulties for others and without shifting their  responsibility to others -- will not be welcomed by the family  of European nations.    Among other things, this demonstrates the need to establish  first, whether there is a political will to really start  resolving these problems. In other words, this is not a matter  of parading a nonexistent idyll which is of no use to anyone,  but the realization of the true gravity and importance of these  problems, which must be geared to resolving conditions along the  border. This is something which directly affects peoples' lives.    In this context, the economic sphere must also be mentioned,  as it directly affects the quality of life in both countries.  My principal task during my visit to Zagreb is to find out  whether there is such a will on the part of Croatia, something  that, in my view, is impossible to do without talking to Mr.  Tudjman.    [Correspondent] I will mention some outstanding issues: the  state border, the Ljubljanska Bank, Krsko nuclear power plant,  property relations. In your view, how much are these issues an  expression of the real state of affairs, and how much is there a  need for both countries to confirm their internationally  recognized independence on these issues?    [Kucan] Unfortunately, the reality does not allow a strict  separation of internal and foreign policies. One is in the  service of the other. Each democratic and wise policy has to  take into consideration not only the affirmation of the state in  the first place, but also whether it is able to organize life in  the state in a bearable way, and whether it is able to organize  it in such a way that it does not infringe on the equal rights  of other states and other nations.    The problems that you have just mentioned have been  inherited  from our life in the former Yugoslav state. In part we are able  to resolve them through bilateral talks and negotiations; in  part they need to be settled, for principled reasons, within the  framework of the succession of the former common state. We  should not forget that part of the succession issue is in  connection with other states that have been created, or are  being created, on the territory of former Yugoslavia. I would  not set them out as a condition, that only after these issues  have been resolved -- even though I am not underestimating their  seriousness -- it would be possible to resolve other issues.    The biggest difficulty for Croatia and Slovenia is the  decline in economic cooperation. As regards Slovene exports,  Croatia is the third economic partner, and as regards imports it  is in fourth place, and is declining. Unfortunately, this trend  is continuing this year. We can partially justify it with the  fact that Croatia lives somewhat according to the logic of a war  economy. However, that is not the right answer. Property  issues have not been settled, in addition to a series of other  things, which in the long run -- at a time when the situation in  the Balkans went this way -- are falling to a completely  different level of economic exchange [as heard]. This huge  decline does not just represent a decline in quantity, but also  a decline in the quality of relations.    Slovenia has concluded agreements on free trade with  Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and an agreement with  Poland is being prepared, and as regards the option of  concluding such an agreement with Austria -- given its specific  nature because of Austria's admission soon into the European  Union -- we are thinking about Austria and Croatia. We have  only signed a declaration on reaching such an agreement. This  is not to mention those that need to be signed, such as the  avoidance of double taxation, an agreement on securing  investments, which would show good will and an understanding of  how much our economies are linked. But for the time being we  have not talked about it. [passage omitted]    The problems of transition are very complex. Everyone is  solving them in line with their specific conditions; what  everyone has achieved as regards long-term and wise results.  The only way in which it is possible to look at these problems  is that each result would have to be a success for all of us.  Otherwise, Europe will remain divided, and not just  politically. It will also be divided into its developed and  underdeveloped economic parts. This is precisely where Croatia  and Slovenia should ask themselves where they will find a place  in that division, and how much they themselves will be to blame  if they remain behind the border signifying the economically  underdeveloped part of Europe. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Slovene and Croatian politicians agree that  good-neighborly relations require respect for the interests of  both sides. To what extent is this commitment being influenced  by some radical views held by a certain part of Slovenia's  political public? Can they decisively interfere in the creation  of far more positive relations between Slovenia and Croatia?    [Kucan] Individual radical views certainly do not contribute  toward better relations. They do not contribute toward the  belief that there is a will to regulate mutual relations, such  mutual relations that are based on the equality of both states,  on recognition of the principle of justice and mutual benefits  in resolving the most sensitive and disputed issues, such as  those you have already mentioned.    However, an integral part of pluralism and democracy is the  peoples' right to express their views and opinions, including  the most extremist and most radical ones. The question of state  policies is whether to accept these as a fact or to oppose such  extremist views with the arguments that a state policy must  have. To base a policy on extremist views is, of course, a  short-sighted thing. So is basing a state's approach to another  state on extremist standpoints. The real force that can change  the current strained relations between Croatia and Slovenia is  certainly not in the hands of extremists. The real power in  Croatia is in the hands of the legitimate bodies of government  and parliament, and President Tudjman. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] As far as European integration processes are  concerned, we must of course mention relations between Italy,  Slovenia, and Croatia, and the Ossimo agreement. Certain  political circles in Italy want the agreement to be revised.  Can such demands change the EU's [European Union] basic  criteria, which are vital for democracy in the EU and all other  states, and can they change the EU's relations with Slovenia and  Croatia.    [Kucan] Slovenia, Croatia, and the entire democratic Europe  are justifiably worried by the outcome of the Italian elections.  My opinion is that the outcome is an expression of the will of  the people of the Republic of Italy. Therefore, this is a fact  which we have to accept and respect. What will be the policy of  the Italian coalition government, including the neo-fascists?  This will be reflected in the government's standpoints and in  its specific measures to implement them. This is the only  relevant thing when making a political judgment. We base our  standpoint solely on this. Any prejudged condemnation or  suspicion would be a sign of immaturity in international  relations. It is true that Italy has blocked Slovenia's  participation in the east-west group negotiations in Warsaw. It  is true that it has prevented Slovenia from being one of the  nine states discussing a stability pact in Paris. I hope that  it will not use its veto to prevent Slovene negotiations with  the EU.    All these things require an adequate response once they have  taken place, a response based on European principles, on the  principles which the EU complies with, primarily on the  principles of the Helsinki and the Paris declaration, which are  the mainstay of the CSCE.    Our relations with Italy are formally regulated under the  Ossimo treaty. Slovenia insists on being a successor to this  treaty, while the Italian Parliament has recognized this. This  does not mean that all our relations are regulated or that they  are regulated in the best possible way. It is 10 years since  these agreements were signed.    Some problems which have not been resolved by these  agreements or which could be solved better, require good will,  mutual trust, and, just like in relations with Croatia, justice  and mutual benefits. We cannot tolerate a situation in which  unresolved bilateral relations are used as blackmail, for  instance as an obstacle, a condition attached to Slovenia's  participation in multilateral relations. I do not believe that  the EU will tolerate this, either.    As far as fascism is concerned, Slovenia is totally  explicit in this respect. Some xenophobic and fascist-style  phenomena in Slovenia must be met with condemnation on the part  of the democratic public. The Slovene people must be aware that  in World War II they were on the side of the victorious  anti-fascist coalition. It is precisely today that the 50th  anniversary of the invasion is being celebrated. Regrettably,  Slovenia has been unjustly left out. Slovenia is not there.  However, regardless of this, Slovenia's position during World  War II in the anti-fascist coalition is the Slovene people's  most convincing historic argument in Slovenia's international  relations.    [Correspondent] As far as the area of former Yugoslavia is  concerned, the question inevitably arises of resolving the  Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in  Croatia. What is your view of the Washington agreement? In your  opinion, does it mark the real beginning of the end of the war  in this region?    [Kucan] First, I would like to say that everything that is  going on now is a matter of redressing some initial mistakes and  some initial underestimation of the gravity of the reasons  behind, first the Yugoslav, and now the Balkan crisis. I  believe that as yet no one has a realistic notion of how to  solve this crisis as a whole, and of how to turn the Balkans, as  an area of permanent instability, into an area of relative  stability -- relative in terms of today's stability in Europe.    Every contribution, of course, which replaces the military  framework of the conflict with a diplomatic search for a  solution is welcome and worthy of every effort. From this  viewpoint the Washington agreement is also a precious  contribution toward ending the war. On the other hand, it shows  the futility and absurdity of the military conflict between the  Croats and Muslims. In my view, the most damaging consequence  of this conflict is the fact that it obscured the true nature of  the conflict, that it obscured the identity of the aggressor and  what its ambitions were in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    You see, the world is not talking about a war waged against  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In  other words, it is talking about a civil war, something that is  a far easier issue in terms for international politics. Such a  policy inflicted a great deal of damage on Croatia, in  particular.    During my international meetings and talks, I have been  protesting against attempts at putting an equals sign between  Croatia and Serbia, and their respective motives, ambitions, and  goals. I particularly protested, not very long ago, when  sanctions against Croatia were being discussed. From this  viewpoint, healthy relations between Croatia and Slovenia would  considerably reduce this risk. Hence, the Washington agreement  is a very important step, but I cannot see it as the last move  in resolving the crisis.    [Correspondent] The Washington agreement mentions the  possibility of setting up a confederation between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and Croatia. Is a new Yugoslav  integration possible in this area?    [Kucan] No. A confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation and Croatia is possible, should both countries be  interested in it, be genuinely interested in it, not giving in  to the imposed interests of some other states that wish to  simplify the situation and change the acute phase of the  conflict into a latent one, with the possibility of this latent  phase becoming an acute one again.    I cannot see any fundamental reasons or arguments for the  recreation of a Yugoslav federation, confederation, or  association, at least as regards Slovenia. Should it suit other  countries that were created or are being created on the  territory of former Yugoslavia, Slovenia will raise no  objections. That is for them to decide.    Slovenia is, by its spiritual, cultural, and civilizational  tradition, a central European state. It has European ambitions,  as I have already mentioned. They cannot be realized in a  package, or with the states of the former Yugoslavia, or with  the states of the Visegrad group with which we have developed  good cooperation, or with a central European group, but through  gradually fulfilling conditions set forth as criteria for making  a decision on whether Slovenia fulfils conditions for being  admitted to the European Union. Slovenia is immensely  interested in cooperating with all states, primarily with its  neighbors, with states in central Europe, and also with the  states of former Yugoslavia, according to the circumstances,  when the war stops there, when the process of transition starts,  and when they display the will for joining the European  integrations.    As part of the search for solutions to the Balkan crisis,  all  these states need to be given the opportunity to seek prospects  in Europe. Their isolation will serve to exacerbate the crisis,  and will do nothing for the stability of the region.    So, the quality of relations is not to be found in the  nature  of the association, but is the result of objectively formulated  interests and the possibility of realizing these interests on  the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In other words, the  nature of relations will differ considerably from relations in  the former common state. They will in no way be different from  the nature of Slovenia's relations with other states. This is  where our prospects are, and it has nothing to do with any  institutional links with the states emerging on the territory of  former Yugoslavia, or whether it suits others or not. Slovenia  will not oppose any attempt to set up something that is or was  similar to the former Yugoslavia.    [Correspondent] According to information at our disposal,  or rather, according to reports by the Slovene press, there will  be no meeting with President Tudjman on the one hand, but on the  other you will meet with President Tudjman [as heard]. How much  would this meeting contribute toward the efforts to more  speedily resolve the existing problems between Croatia and  Slovenia?    [Kucan] My view is that it is not up to the presidents to  tackle specific problems. They must ascertain if there is a  political will in both states to resolve the problems of  bilateral cooperation. It is sad that there has been no  dialogue between us for almost 20 months, despite our agreement  on the need for annual meetings. It is also sad that there has  been no dialogue at a governmental level. This could lead to  the conclusion that, in fact, there is no interest or firm  strategy, or idea of what importance both Ljubljana and Zagreb  attach to relations between the two states.    Responsibility for the failure to tackle issues cannot be  laid squarely with one side. Each side must be made aware of  its responsibilities. If this was the case, a cement mixer at  the border crossing in Plovanija would not be of vital  importance for determining the nature of the relations, or for  resolving the problems, and for whether we are prepared to  resolve them or not. It should not depend on this whether or  note I meet with President Tudjman.    In other words, under Slovenia's constitutional order, it  was  normal for me to ask the Foreign Ministry whether, in such  circumstances, we should accept the invitation. The Foreign  Ministry replied affirmatively. After that, and in view of the  unilateral move inside the disputed territory -- and this  territory is disputed because Slovenia believes firmly that it  is its own -- it was necessary to get the Slovene Government's  view. The Government judged the reply by Croatian Prime  Minister Valentic as satisfactory, and that the construction  work had been discontinued. This was a good reason for testing  Zagreb's interests and willingness to cement our relations, and  to intensify efforts to resolve our bilateral relations.    This is the main task of my visit. This is a working and not  a protocol visit. Ahead of me are extensive talks with  President Tudjman. As far as I know, he also thinks that time  is not the main reason behind the talks, but a need for a  profound exchange of views and arguments. I expect us to reach  the common conclusion that unilateral moves are not the way  toward finding solutions. Sound relations, in particular in the  economic sphere, and increased cooperation provide the framework  for resolving the problems much easier. However, isolated  problems and insistance on tackling them alone reflect a lack of  desire to resolve other problems. To what extent such views are  wrong and fateful, that is something I have spoken about before.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, thank you for the interview.</p>

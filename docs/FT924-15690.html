			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Frankfurt leads continental European markets higher THE German government bond market led most continental European markets higher yesterday as speculation mounted that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at its regular bi-weekly council meeting today. The benchmark 8 per cent bund maturing July 2002 closed on a yield of 7.41 per cent, down from 7.47 per cent on Wednesday. On Liffe, the December bund future opened at 90.90 but rose through afternoon trading to reach 91.35 by the close. Volume was heavy at 90,000 contracts. The Bundesbank yesterday injected DM15.6bn short-term liquidity into the money market at a rate of 8.9 per cent, against a Lombard rate - the central bank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions - of 9.5 per cent. The operation was taken by some dealers as a sign of easier monetary conditions ahead. Expectations centred on a  1/4 point cut in the Lombard rate. However, more sceptical analysts said money market operations were in the context of very tight conditions created this week as the authorities squeezed interbank rates higher. They pointed out that the central bank's main economic indicators were not pointing to a rate cut. M3 money supply grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent in August, higher than 8.5 per cent in July and well above a target growth rate of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Based on figures from the west German Lander, annual consumer price inflation is expected to be 3.6 per cent for September. UK government bonds ended sharply lower at the longer maturities yesterday as concern about the government's political problems and uncertainty over the future direction of monetary policy took hold. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2008 closed at 97 1/4 , well down from the opening level of 97 23/32 , for a yield of 9.34 per cent. Shorter dated stocks performed better, underpinned by hopes of a cut in UK interest rates if the Bundesbank eases monetary conditions today. On Liffe, the December gilt future opened at 96.23, rose to 97.10 during early afternoon but fell back to 96.16 by the close. Trading volume was light at 30,000 contracts. The market was unsettled by the weakness of sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The UK currency stood at around DM2.48 by the close in London, from DM2.5175 on Wednesday. ITALIAN government bonds rallied yesterday on increased hopes that the 1993 budget package would be passed by parliament, and an announcement that the government would ask for approval to borrow in foreign currencies. On Liffe, the December bond futures contract opened at 91.45 but rose to 92.75. On the cash market, the 12 per cent government bonds maturing May 2002 closed at 92.75 from 91.07 on Wednesday, yielding 13.8 per cent. Analysts said plans to take on foreign currency liabilities suggested the authorities were determined to hold the lira at around current levels on the foreign exchange markets. SENTIMENT in the French market improved on hopes of a German interest rate cut, with 10-year government paper yesterday matching the bund rally. The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002 closed on a yield of 8.61 per cent, from 8.67 per cent on Wednesday. The yield spread over bunds was little changed at 124 basis points. The French Treasury successfully auctioned FFr12.3bn 10-year and 30-year paper. Bids covered the available stock around two times. The franc strengthened slightly on the foreign exchange markets, closing against the D-Mark at FFr3.38. However, money market interest rates remained high, indicating continued pressure on the French currency. The Bank of France injected FFr10.7bn short-term funds to the money market, but overnight money rates remained at 15 per cent. SPANISH government bonds fell sharply yesterday following the failure of an auction of government paper but recovered ground with other European markets in the afternoon. The authorities declined all bids at the auction of three, five, and 10-year paper rather than pay higher yields. The auction followed the announcement that Moody's Investor's Service, the US credit rating agency, would review Spain's AA2 debt rating. The 10.3 per cent 10-year government bond opened on a yield of 13.27 per cent, but fell back to yield 13.58 per cent by early afternoon. However, a late rally saw bond prices close down only slightly on the opening levels and the 10-year benchmark finished the day at 13.32 per cent. US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday in the wake of more bad news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 99 7/32 , to yield 7.308 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly firmer, up  7/32 at 100 19/32 , yielding 3.672 per cent. The news that sparked the early buying was a 15,000 increase in weekly claims for state unemployment insurance. The figures raised hopes that the employment report for September would show a deterioration in the labour market, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again. Prices gained ground later in the morning when the National Association of Purchasing Management index for September showed a decline of 4.7 points to 49.0 and August construction spending a 0.8 per cent drop.</p>

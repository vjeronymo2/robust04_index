			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa has described the  authors of articles published in the international media as  misinformed. These articles have harshly criticized the economic  plan that President Rafael Caldera's government plans to  implement.    In a document released to the press, Sosa reiterates the  government's efforts to deal with the fiscal deficit.  Recognition is given to Democratic Action for granting the  president special powers in the Special Powers Law. Regarding  this law, Sosa said that the government believes it is  convenient to include -- in addition to the tax laws -- the law  on concessions for public works and services, reform of the  Emergency Law, and limited reform of the Basic Budget Law that  would simplify the drawing up and implementation of the nation's  budget. The finance minister insisted on the importance of tax  reform.    [Begin Sosa recording] That plan obviously includes the  overall reform of the state, monetary stabilization, and the  reduction of interest rates. But if we are unable to solve the  fiscal deficit, we will never be able to control inflation.  Without control of inflation, there will be no solution of other  matters. Now, if there are some economic experts who have  another formula, I have indicated at the end that all  observations and contributions made in good faith are welcome.  [end recording]    With regard to tax collection, the treasury minister was  asked if there would be an extension for filing tax returns as  the deadline approaches. There are problems with the payroll  lists, through which the forms are distributed. Sosa said he  understands that the tax collection authority has agreed to a  30-day extension.</p>

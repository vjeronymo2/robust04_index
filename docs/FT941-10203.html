			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Total steady in spite of oil price write-down Total, the French oil group, yesterday announced estimated net profits of FFr2.9bn (Dollars 492m) for last year, a slight increase over the FFr2.8bn in 1992. The result was largely in line with expectations. Mr Serge Tchuruk, group chairman, said the results demonstrated Total's resilience to recession in Europe, and the sharp fall in the oil price in 1993. The latest results included an exceptional inventory write-down of FFr800m relating to the decline in crude oil prices. Excluding the inventory loss, operating income rose from FFr7.3bn to FFr7.6bn, while cashflow surged to FFr11.3bn from FFr10bn. Sales remained stable at about FFr136bn. The effects of a capital increase in April last year, however, prompted a fall in earnings per share, from FFr13.8 to FFr13.2. In spite of the depressed market conditions, Total said it had managed to pursue its strategy of increasing reserves and production, developing gas activities, restructuring specialty chemicals activities and extending the geographical base. Mr Tchuruk mentioned several areas where the group was expanding its development and production of oil and gas. Total's projects in Indonesia and Colombia, for example, should help achieve the company's target - outside the Middle East - of a 40 per cent increase in production during this year and next. In 1993, the group's exploration and production division, which excludes the Middle East, saw operating profits fall from FFr2.9bn to FFr2.2bn. The decline was largely blamed on the downturn in the oil price, which averaged Dollars 17 per barrel of Brent crude, compared with Dollars 19.30 in 1992. The trading and Middle East division increased its profits in 1993, from FFr600m to FFr700m, reflecting the low exposure of upstream margins to declining crude prices, and an improvement in trading and shipping activities. Including the Middle East, the group's total oil and gas reserves rose from 3.95m barrels of oil equivalent to 4.07m barrels by the end of last year. Operating profits in the refining and marketing division rose sharply from FFr2.1bn to FFr3.3bn, the result of a slight recovery in refining margins and a strong improvement in Total's US operations. In chemicals, however, profits declined by 18 per cent to FFr1.4bn. Total said the fall reflected the impact of recession in Europe and, in particular, the weak demand from the automotive industry for its coatings and paint products. During the year, gross capital expenditures rose from FFr14.8bn in 1992 to FFr17.6bn, while the debt-to-equity ratio declined.</p>

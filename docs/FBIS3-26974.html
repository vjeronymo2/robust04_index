			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feburary 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said here today that the current  Russian diplomatic activities are aimed at blocking the  implementation of NATO's ultimatum on air strikes against  Bosnian Serbs.    "We are doing everything to prevent air strikes," Lavrov  announced in parliament, "and we consider the NATO ultimatum  illegitimate."    Russian repersentatives to the UN Security Council were  instructed to oppose NATO air strikes, he said, adding that as a  request by Moscow, the UN Security Council had created a special  committee to investigate the earlier mortar shell explosion in a  downtown Sarajevo marketplace, in which 68 civilians were killed  and 200 wounded.    The Russian official said that even a limited air strike  against Serb military positions would alter fundamentally the  political and military situation in Bosnia and the whole of  Europe.    It would mean, he said, the failure of a peaceful settlement  of the Bosnia conflict.    The deputy foreign minister said that NATO's threat to bomb  did not correspond to UN decisions. Russia was prepared to  object to any actions running counter to UN resolutions, he  noted.</p>

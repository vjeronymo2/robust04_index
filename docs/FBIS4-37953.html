			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops  entered Aden's suburbs, occupying on Sunday [26 June] a power  station and Radio Aden buildings about 10 kilometres (six miles)  from the city centre, an AFP correspondent reported.    The troops broke through southern defences, heading toward  the bay of Aden late Saturday. The Hiswah power station and  Radio Aden are on the coast road.    Renewed fighting broke a six-hour calm which fell as Sanaa  declared a ceasefire from midnight. The truce call was  immediately rejected by leaders in the breakaway south.    Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were  also trying to advance on the Little Aden oil refinery, 18  kilometres (12 miles) west of the southern stronghold.    The south accused the north of taking advantage of a lull in  fighting to move troops into position for an assault on the  refinery.    Radio Aden stopped all broadcasts late Saturday before the  northern troops arrived. They were camping out among the  transmitters on Sunday.    They were also installed in the Hiswah power station which  was put out of action three days ago when a fire broke out there  after a raid by northern warplanes.    Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations only to find  that tanker trucks had been unable to get through roadblocks  barring the route to the refinery.    Civil war broke out in Yemen on May 5 after rival leaders  failed to resolve differences over running the country. Former  tribal, conservative North and Marxist South Yemen merged in May  1990.    The south last month proclaimed itself independent.</p>

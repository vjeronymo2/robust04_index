			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais takes over Peru bank CREDIT Lyonnais has become the first foreign bank for many years to assume majority control over a domestic Peruvian bank. The French bank has regained control of the Banco de Lima after having a minority holding for a considerable time. Legislation hostile to foreign participation had forced Credit Lyonnais to reduce its original majority stake in the Lima bank to under 20 per cent. Lima bank was founded in 1952. To regain overall control, Credit Lyonnais has increased its capital in the Banco de Lima by Dollars 8m. The French bank said that it would seek to play a role in the forthcoming privatisation of Peru's state-owned companies and the development of the country's capital markets. Credit Lyonnais holds some Dollars 200m of Peruvian debt paper, including around Dollars 50m in short-term working capital debt - expected to be the first to be accepted in privatisations.</p>

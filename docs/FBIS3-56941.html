Once  again, as during the previous round in Geneva and Brussels, a  great opportunity to reach agreement has been wasted." This is  how Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special  representative and deputy minister of foreign affairs, assessed  the outcome of the talks on a Bosnian settlement which ended  here today, and which were attended by the delegations of the  conflicting sides -- the Muslims, Serbians, and Croatians -- and  the presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Although  co-chairmen Turvala Stoltenberg and David Owen proposed  solutions and approaches which could be "satisfactory in order  to stop the war," no compromise was achieved, the Russian  diplomat noted, speaking to journalists in Geneva's Palais des  Nations.    V. Churkin, who met the representatives of the various sides  during his stay in Geneva, describes the agreement signed today  between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia on the  opening of official missions in Belgrade and Zagreb as "an  important step in their relations." It may lead to the  emergence of "a more positive atmosphere for solving major  issues," in particular the problem of Krajina.</p>

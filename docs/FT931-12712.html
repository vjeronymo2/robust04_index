			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK wary over US remarks on UN BRITAIN yesterday expressed reservations over remarks by the new US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, suggesting it might be desirable at some time to raise the number of permanent members on the UN Security Council. British Prime Minister John Major hinted on his tour of India that he did not see a case for early council changes: 'I wouldn't wish to do anything to make it less effective.' Mr Major, who is anxious to form a good relationship with President Bill Clinton, added: 'These are matters that will have to be discussed if there is a general will for them to be discussed. But they are not new ideas. They've been around for some time.' In a wide-ranging discussion with State Department staff in Washington on Monday, it was put to Mr Christopher that '. . . the permanent members of the Security Council. . . reflect the realities of world power in 1945. Is it time for a change? Should the Security Council be expanded? And do you think any further nations should be offered a seat on the permanent membership of the Security Council?' He replied: 'Yes, I think it's time for some reorganisation of the UN to bring it into keeping with modern realities. During the campaign, President Clinton said that he could envisage the addition of Germany and Japan to the permanent members of the Security Council at the UN. And I suspect we'll see some developments in that direction. 'But, at the same time, I would want to acknowledge the complexity of that decision. I'm sure we've all been in organisations, and when you begin to make changes, there are other people who feel they are entitled to a seat at the table. So, I wouldn't want to underestimate the complexity of making that change, but I think it is time to bring the UN. . . into tune with 1993 realities rather than, as you say, with 1946 realities.'</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / People: Spray flies at North West Water North West Water, the UK's second largest water company, has lost its group finance director in the same week that it issued a 'counter-notice' to Ofwat, challenging the industry regulator's request for limits on price increases. However, the company, which refuses to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the departure of Steve Mc-Adam last Wednesday after just 10 months at the utility, indicates the two events are not connected. Bob Ferguson, formerly finance director of the core utility North West Water Limited, and since the turn of the year its deputy managing director, steps into McAdam's shoes. This is yet another change within the industry which has suffered a surprisingly high degree of turnover on its post privatisation boards, particularly among finance directors - much more so for instance than have the regional electricity companies. North West Water, like many others in its sector, had elected to bring in an appointee from outside the industry - Mc-Adam had previously been at Hewlett Packard in the UK, before he joined at the beginning of the year on the retirement of Archie Ramsay. 'Steve did not fit the team. Obviously the company has decided to go back to a safe pair of hands. They (the counter-notice and the resignation) just came to a head in the same week, but they were entirely unrelated' is all Ferguson is prepared to say. With the company since 1974, Ferguson, 50, had been perceived by many as Ramsay's natural successor. But he makes out that he was not disappointed to miss out on the group finance job last time around. 'I had an extremely interesting job as deputy managing director,' he contends. The City has been additionally puzzled that, whereas McAdam initially devoted a lot of time to investor relations, that role in the last month or two appeared to have been largely assumed by Alan Dean, group business development director and an erstwhile Rothschild director. 'Both Alan and I will play a prominent role in investors relations,' says Ferguson, but he acknowledges that the division of responsibilities is 'not totally worked out' yet.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIET '88 FOREIGN TRADE STAGNATES  </P> <P> Foreign trade failed to make headway in 1988 due to production of shoddy goods,  a fluctuating international economy and a failure of joint ventures to perform  as expected, a newspaper said today.  </P> <P> "Last year did not see any considerable rise in Soviet foreign trade, estimated  at 132 billion rubles ($213.8 billion)," the Government Herald said.  </P> <P> It said a drop in prices for basic fuel and raw materials and growing  protectionist trends in Western countries made international markets  unfavorable for Soviet goods over the last three years.  </P> <P> "Meanwhile, Soviet industry continues producing planes, vehicles, tractors and  agricultural machines whose specifications differ very little from previous  models and which are inferior to Western types," the Government Herald said.  </P></p>

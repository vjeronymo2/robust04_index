			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Demonstrations Against `High </F> Prices'; Forces Deployed in Medani"]    [Excerpt] London -- Well-informed Sudanese sources have  said that Medani, the second largest city in Sudan after  Khartoum, has witnessed widespread demonstrations against high  prices and living conditions, and that Central Security and Army  troops have been deployed in the streets to guard the main  sensitive sites in the city.    These domestic developments coincided with reports of the  abduction of Sudanese Ambassador to Mogadishu 'Abd-al-Baqi  Muhammad Hasan yesterday by gunmen while he was on his way to  his office from his residence.    With regard to the demonstrations in Medani, south of  Khartoum, the sources said that the demonstrations started the  day before yesterday and continued yesterday. University and  high school students and a number of workers and employees took  part in the demonstrations.    There have been no reports of casualties. However, sources  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the demonstrations were noisy and  violent.    Medani has over the past months witnessed widespread  demonstrations against living conditions, during which  demonstrators burned some installations, banks, and gas  stations. The security forces' intervention led to clashes and  casualties.    There have also been reports of demonstrations in al-Qadarif  city in east Sudan.    Meanwhile, the Sudanese Government made contacts with the  various Somali parties yesterday to secure the release of  Ambassador 'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad Hasan, 48, who was abducted by  three gunmen.

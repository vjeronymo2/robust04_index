			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters objected to any reliance on secondary sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support an owner's claim that the owner's project is a covered section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing project. The commenters stated that secondary sources, which reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions taken by owners after they obtained HUD financial assistance, will do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nothing to illuminate the project's original intent and should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilized. The commenters suggested that acceptable documents should include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only legally binding documents submitted to HUD at the time of negotiations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Federal financial assistance. The commenters also strongly objected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inclusion of ``any other historical data'' on the basis that this broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category of documentation would allow owners to circumvent the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project eligibility requirements of subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD declines to drop secondary sources as acceptable sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of documentation. HUD carefully considered which documents may evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project eligibility for the subtitle D system of preferences, and determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it was important to include secondary sources as acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation. As discussed in the May 3, 1994 interim rule, because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various types of housing projects covered by subtitle D and because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects were developed under several different programs and over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation at HUD which identifies the population group to be served by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project. Further, difficulty in identifying the population group to be served  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is added by the fact that the previous definition of ``elderly families'' in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1937 Act included disabled families, and HUD's policy required all housing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design a certain percentage of units to be accessible for persons with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical disabilities. The difficulty in identifying the population group to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be served is compounded by the fact that there often was no specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of projects as elderly (i.e., seniors) and standard program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents generally did not identify projects as elderly or, if they did so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not distinguish between projects designed primarily for seniors, or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons with disabilities, or for both. Given these difficulties, HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that it was important not to limit the type of evidence that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lend support to an owner's claim that the owner's project was originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed primarily for elderly families (seniors). Accordingly, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides, as did the interim rule, that if the primary sources do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide clear evidence of the original design of the project, then original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design may be established through secondary sources, of which there must be at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> two <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  secondary sources, establishing the identity of the project as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly (seniors) housing. Additionally, secondary sources become important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where primary sources conflict. Where primary sources conflict, then original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design may be established through secondary sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the use of project unit mix with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher percentage of efficiency and one bedroom units as a secondary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes no sense. The commenter stated that the size of the units is therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholly irrelevant to the original character of the property. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that if considered as a secondary source, project unit mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data must be applied uniformly, and HUD must develop and publish project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configuration standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD disagrees that project unit mix is totally irrelevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule ((59 FR 22918) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the text of the regulation itself, a project unit mix with a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units may be particularly relevant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguishing elderly projects under the previous definition of elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons (in which disabled families were included in the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects. Project unit mix, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination with other factors such as the number of accessible units, may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the former  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader definition of ``elderly families'' which included disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See 59 FR 22918 and &sect;880.612a(b)(1)(ii) and comparable sections in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts covered by this rule.) HUD points out that, as a secondary source,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project unit mix alone is not sufficient to establish the original character  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the project. The project owner must be able to produce another secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source to support that the project was originally designed primarily for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy by seniors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to establishing uniform project unit mix standards, HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relies on the language of the statute itself. In describing projects covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by subtitle D, the statute uses the term ``primarily designed for occupancy by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families'' which HUD has defined as having at least a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> majority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units designed for elderly families. In the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, HUD stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that in using the term `primarily,' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the section 8 units in those covered projects in which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> majority  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., seniors), or to the section 8 units in covered projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> majority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section 8 units in a portion of such project, but only where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed primarily for seniors. (Emphasis added.) (59 FR 22916) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be consistent with this interpretation that ``primarily'' means at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least a majority of the units, the rule has been revised to state ``project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit mix with more than fifty percent of the units which are efficiency or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-bedroom units.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that because there will be cases where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither the primary nor secondary sources establish original design and intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or where the project owner cannot produce original documentation, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence should be considered than that listed in the interim rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that the final rule provide that if a covered project is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for exemption from the familial status provisions of the Fair Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act because it constitutes housing for older persons it is also exempt under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D. The commenter also suggested that if the project owner has had a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair housing complaint filed against the owner by a non-elderly disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person on the basis of the person's eligibility to reside in the project that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this indicate's management's belief that the project was built to serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seniors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

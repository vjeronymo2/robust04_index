			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said that a  strong and stable economic development, self-reliance in energy,  and population control are the three characteristics of the  present government's economic policy for national development.  Addressing a Karachi Stock Exchange award ceremony for top  companies last night, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that on these  three pillars depend the future progress and prosperity of  Pakistan, and her government is moving to achieve these  objectives. We have already announced an energy development  program, which is expected to attract 700 billion rupees as  investment over the next five years. Work has started on the  Ghazi-Barotha project and difficulties facing the Hab power  project have been removed. Power production in Pakistan will  increase by 40 percent as a result of the two projects. The  government has devised a program for setting up a 300-mw nuclear  power plant with Chinese assistance and efforts are underway to  remove the difficulties in the way of acquiring a 900-mw nuclear  power plant from France.    The prime minister said the government has taken several  steps to stabilize the country's economic infrastructure.  Financial discipline has been introduced. Taxes on agriculture  have been levied and bank borrowings, which stood at 62 billion  rupees last year, have been brought down to 10 billion rupees.  The State Bank has been made autonomous to free it from  political pressures. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up to  $1.8 billion.    Referring to the policy of privatization, she said the  government would like to encourage it, but ensuring that public  units are sold to the right persons at the right price. Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said that her government is not afraid of taking  unpopular decisions which are in the interests of the nation and  long-term development. She said that she believed a long-term  solution of our problems would ensure the prosperity of the  nation. [passage omitted]</p>

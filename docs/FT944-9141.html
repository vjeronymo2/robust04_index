			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Major threatens election over EU bill Mr John Major acted swiftly yesterday to quell a revolt among Tory Eurosceptics by staking his administration's future on a bill allowing higher contributions to the European Union. The prime minister startled MPs at the state opening of parliament by warning that legislation to implement an agreement struck two years ago at the EU's Edinburgh summit was 'inescapably a matter of confidence'. The warning that a particular measure in the legislative programme was sacrosanct is unprecedented in recent times. It leaves Mr Major with no option but to call a general election if it is defeated or substantially amended. The government will publish the bill within the next few days and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, wants the crucial Commons second reading to be held before his November 29 Budget. It could complete all parliamentary stages before Christmas. The signs last night were that most of those who had threatened to oppose any increase in payments to Brussels would now fall into step. But a group of about half a dozen refused to back down publicly. The decision to pre-empt a revolt, which overshadowed the announcement in the Queen's Speech of a low-key legislative programme for the next year, was denounced by opposition parties as a panic move to disguise Mr Major's weakness. The speech included plans for nearly 20 bills, ranging from reform of pensions law to abolition of regional health authorities and the construction of a high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel. Most are relatively uncontroversial. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the government had clearly run out of steam. He added: 'It has surely come to something when a government can only secure the passage of its own legislative programme by threatening its own demise.' Mr Blair and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, support the principle of an agreement which would increase Britain's contributions to Brussels by an estimated Pounds 250m a year by 1999. But Labour will seek to amend the legislation to reflect its opposition to the Britain's social chapter opt-opt. Mr Blair indicated also that if defeat for the legislation meant a general election, Labour might well vote against it without damaging its pro-European credentials. Mr Major insisted: 'There is no room for compromise on this bill. This means its successful passage - in all its essentials - is inescapably a matter of confidence because of the agreements . . . with our European partners.' He added: 'No British government would have credibility in international negotiations if it failed to implement the agreements it had freely entered into with its partners abroad.' The idea of an early confrontation to face down potential rebels was first raised by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. There was then broad agreement within the cabinet the government could not afford a repeat of the struggle over Maastricht.

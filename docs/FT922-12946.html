			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Messages from the Titanic fetch Pounds 95,000 CHRISTIE'S South Kensington raised Pounds 95,000 (against a Pounds 30,000 estimate) for a collection of 448 messages which were sent and received by the Titanic, the luxury liner which sank in the North Atlantic on her maiden voyage in 1912. The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000) paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank her. There was keen bidding for a 10-page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target). Another item that attracted interest was a letter put up for sale by Eva Hart, one of the few survivors still alive, which was given by her father, who went down with the ship, to her mother, who was saved. Christie's had been excited by the appearance of a previously unknown album containing more than 50 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Its excitement was justified - the album doubled its estimate at almost Pounds 750,000. The top price was the Pounds 55,000 paid for a pen-and-pencil drawing of 'The Massacre of the Innocents'. The morning auction of Old Master drawings did well, totalling Pounds 687,764 and 94 per cent sold. A pastel of Princess Radziwill, painted in 1801 by Louise-Elizabeth Vigee le-Brun, just about doubled its estimate fetching about Pounds 50,600. The surprise of the auction was the Pounds 38,500 paid for a study of arms attributed to the Circle of Michaelangelo. Its estimate had been Pounds 5,000. Obviously, the buyer believed it to be by the the master.</p>

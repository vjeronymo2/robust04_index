			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Markets: A tale of two fortunes . . . - The Bottom Line THE OVERSEAS traders sector used to conjure up images of Somerset Maugham's rubber planters drinking gin slings at the club. The sector was abolished in 1990, but two of its former denizens - Harrisons &amp; Crosfield and Inchcape - reported results this week. Their fortunes have diverged in the 1990s; Inchcape's star rising, while recession has hit H &amp; C. Inchcape announced record 1991 profits on Monday of Pounds 185.2m pre-tax (Pounds 174m). H &amp; C's profits fell by a third to Pounds 71.2m, and had to dip into reserves to hold its dividend. This is a reversal of the City's view of the two companies in the late 1980s. Inchcape was regarded as an uninspiring overseas trader, but H &amp; C had persuaded the City it was transforming itself from a sleepy plantation company to a go-ahead conglomerate. H &amp; C's history over the last 10 years has been one of managing change. It lost control of its Malaysian plantations when the government decided they should be in local hands. Between 1982 and 1989 H &amp; C received nearly Pounds 300m in cash from the sale. It had substantial funds to reinvest, and it described its policy as 'highly selective diversity'. It chose chemicals, where it already had interests; timber and building supplies based on its expertise in its Borneo timber business; and animal feeds, agriculture providing a link with plantations. There have been a number of acquisitions: the biggest was the Pounds 116m bid for Pauls, the animal feeds group, in 1985; Southern-Evans, the timber company was acquired for Pounds 83.3m in 1988; and Crossley, the builders merchants, for Pounds 113m in May 1990. On Wednesday it said it would buy the BOCM-Silcock animal feeds company for Pounds 67m. Yet it was only plantations which increased profits. Often, the group has appeared to promise much, but failed to deliver. Criticisms centre on the timing of acquisitions, with some of the chemicals and building supplies businesses bought at the top of the cycle. Animal feeds is a much more defensive business and analysts question whether now is the time to be buying - although the price of BOCM seems to enhance H &amp; C's earnings straight away. Inchcape also diversified, although most of its acquisitions have been smaller. It has built an inspection and testing division, for instance. However, it is Inchcape's long-established activities that have provided recent growth. Inchcape's relationship with Toyota, the Japanese car maker, dates back 25 years in the UK. Its motors business - which made nearly 60 per cent of operating profits in 1991 - accelerated in the late 1980s and has held up in the recession. It is now set to jump following the Pounds 383m takeover of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn. Marketing and distribution is another of Inchcape's base businesses, and that division has increased operating profits from Pounds 22.3m in 1986 to Pounds 57.2m in 1991. Inchcape distributes Barbie dolls in Japan, Coca-Cola in Chile and Kelloggs cornflakes in Bahrain. Inchcape's success - but also its weakness - is in handling other people's brands. Manufacturers get uneasy when others make money from their goods - for instance, Inchcape's stake in the Rolex watch business in Singapore has been cut. Although Inchcape has generally been successful in finding new concessions to replace those it loses, it does lower the quality of earnings. The big question is over the motors side, especially after moves by Volvo, Nissan and Volkswagen to take control of the UK distribution of their cars. In 1990 Toyota paid Inchcape Pounds 60m for a stake in Toyota (GB), the UK distribution company, which will rise to 51 per cent in 1998. Inchcape will lose control of one of its best businesses, although it will have 49 per cent of what will be a larger company. Inchcape also acts for Toyota in Belgium and Greece, and it is conceivable that Toyota might want to take control of all its EC distribution. Inchcape's share price appears to ignore such concerns. Meanwhile, the cloud over H &amp; C hides the likelihood of a cyclical recovery in profits. Its shares rest only on its 9.8 per cent yield. It may be time for another reversal of the two companies' fortunes.</p>

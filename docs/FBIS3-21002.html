Home movies "with a screen measuring in square meters, which  shows even the smallest details of the picture with unimagined  sharpness and the whole range of colors."    It will be a few years until this happens, however.  Initially, the 50-man development crew at Schneider in Allgaeu  presented only a prototype of the new television generation,  after five years of work and expenditures amounting to double  digit millions. It works with expensive gaseous lasers and needs  a cooling unit the size of an armoire. Although not ready for  the market for a long time yet, the technological achievement  itself is described as "considerable" by entertainment  electronics giants. The industry is urgently in need of  innovations in order to revive the market. In Germany, after the  unification boom, sales of color televisions dropped from 5.75  million units last year to no more than 5.5 million this year.    Laser TVs, although not an entirely new idea, would arrive  right on time. The technology sounds simple but it is bulky:  Using a red-green-blue laser beam bundle, a projector shows  colored images on a screen, analogous to today's picture tubes,  in which electron beams are modulated by the video signal and  conducted in rows across the screen. However, precisely this  control is causing problems with the laser technology.    What works in the picture tube with changing magnetic fields  does not work with laser light. It can be done with mechanical  methods, such as mirrors, but the required speeds are extremely  high. With an ordinary television picture the pixels write 25  times 625 rows per second, equalling 15,624 times across the  screen. For HDTV [high-definition television] or flickerless  100-Hertz images, which are the future particularly for  large-screen projection, they must be twice as fast. Schneider's  R&amp;D chief, Guenther Elster, and project leader Christhard  Deter  insist that they have mastered these technologies. However, the  micromechanical know-how will not be revealed until all patents  have been secured.    It is conceivable that small polygons will be used as  mirrors, which rotate or swing around their axis. This  beam-deflection technique requires intermediate storage of the  image information in a digital memory, which passes them on in  correspondingly modified timing to the laser. A great deal must  still be done, above all for the laser technology. Only  semiconductor-diode lasers can offer small size and low prices  per unit. They have proved themselves in large-scale technology,  for example in CD systems. "For the colors red and green the  light intensities obtained today are already in the range of  data specified for multilaser projection technology," says  Professor Gunther Krieg, Dr. of engineering. For blue-light  systems, however, "solutions can only be expected in the next  two years."    Thus, the first projection units in video recorder format  for  DM 3,000 could be available three years from now, at the  earliest, in the opinion of Hans-Juergen Thaus. Middle-size  enterprises do not have the staying-power and, above all, the  financial strength to develop laser projection until it is ripe  for the market. Schneider is therefore looking for partners in  the industry, but there is mostly skepticism. Many contracting  parties have already been involved with similar technologies but  given up. At least half a dozen other companies could also  demonstrate that the idea in principle does function. But if  laser TV were to break through, most would have to worry about  their large capacities in the production of picture tubes or LCD  displays.    Nevertheless, the PR show has had a positive effect for  Schneider: The value of a share, which was introduced in 1986 at  a price of DM 540 and which had meanwhile plummeted to DM  112.50, in early August climbed to DM 423. Thaus is now hoping  that a U.S. company with a lot of capital will step in: "After  the world premiere, the bride has become a great deal more  beautiful."</p>

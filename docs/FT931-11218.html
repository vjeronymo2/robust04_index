			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germans expect earnings decline of up to 5% WEST GERMAN agricultural profits are set to decline by up to 5 per cent this year despite a modest recovery last year, the German government said yesterday in its annual agricultural report. Average agricultural profits rose by 4.3 per cent to DM47,721 (Pounds 20,000) per agricultural enterprise in the year ending June 1992. The rise was mainly a reflection of the higher prices of items such as pigmeat and milk and partly offset the 16 per cent plunge in farm income recorded the previous year. However, the agricultural ministry expects this year's profits to fall by up to 5 per cent again due to a general decline of agricultural prices and last year's drought. The German Bauernverband, the farmers' union, called the forecast over-optimistic and said farm revenues were likely to decline by between 5 and 10 per cent in 1993. Mr Gunther Bredehorn, agricultural policy spokesman for the government coalition Free Democrats party, added that West Germany's agricultural revenues were also likely to be further affected by the government's plan to reduce direct income subsidies to farmers. According to the plan, farm subsidies should be reduced for three years by DM360m a year, starting in 1993. The proposal is part of the Solidarity Pact which is currently being debated and aims to force government, industry and trade unions into finding ways to finance recovery in the eastern part of the country. Output statistics are not yet available for the farm sector in the former East Germany, which has virtually collapsed since unification. As far as farm jobs were concerned, the number of full-time agricultural workers dropped from 312,000 in 1991 to 174,000 last year. The number of agricultural enterprises in the east increased last year as large formerly state-owned farms are being restructured, with over 18,000 agricultural enterprises now registered there. Of these, 41.6 per cent consists of farms between one and 10 hectares. In the West, the number of agricultural enterprises continued to decline, dropping in 1992 by 2.8 per cent to 582,000.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Spain in largest D-Mark issue by foreign borrower SPAIN yesterday launched the largest D-Mark bond issue by a foreign borrower, taking advantage of stable conditions in the German market to launch an aggressively-priced DM2bn transaction. The mandate to lead-manage the floating-rate issue was won by Dresdner Bank following a competitive bidding process. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, two giants of the German securities market, took part in the bidding but unusually declined to participate in the deal. The 10-year notes pay 6.25 basis points less than the six-month London interbank offered rate. A Deutsche Bank official said a margin of 1 or 2 basis points under Libor was needed to sell an issue of this size. However, six co-lead managers and 25 co-lead managers joined the deal. Although the pricing was seen as aggressive by many participants, syndicate officials noted that paper issued by sovereign borrowers carries a zero risk weighting under bank capital adequacy guidelines - banks to not have to set capital aside against holdings of the bonds. Liquid, floating-rate bond issues by sovereign borrowers are also bought by central banks as a low-risk method of investing currency reserves. From an issue price of 100.15, the bonds were quoted at par bid by the lead manager. Elsewhere, dollar currencies continued to benefit from uncertainty in Europe over ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Hydro Quebec, the Canadian utility, officially launched its CDollars 1.2bn, 30-year global bond issue. The deal, larger than the CDollars 750m transaction expected by many firms, is lead-managed by Merrill Lynch and ScotiaMcleod. The bonds will be priced today to yield 85 to 87 basis points more than Canadian government bonds. Canadian National Railways launched a Dollars 200m five-year deal, increased from CDollars 150m, lead-manged by ScotiaMcleod. The 8 1/4 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.525, where the yield is 65 basis points more than Canadian government bonds. This was considered fair by participants in the deal, which reported buying by both retail and institutional investors. OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution, launched a Dollars 200m, 10-year deal lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities. The 7 5/8 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at 99.70, where the bonds yield 26 basis points more than US government paper. The yield was seen as tight by some syndicate officials. However, OKB carries a top triple-A credit rating and is one of the most popular borrowers in the Euromarket. This relatively small deal was easily absorbed. Toyota Finance Australia, a consumer finance subsidiary of the top-rated Japanese motor manufacturer, launched a ADollars 100m four-year issue lead managed by Hambros. The paper carries an 8 per cent coupon - the lowest in the history of the Euro Australian dollar market. In the late 1980s, Australian dollar bond issues often carried a coupon of more than 16 per cent. While little new money is flowing into the Australian currency, retail investors are re-investing the proceeds of maturing bonds. Around ADollars 900m bonds mature in July, and Dollars 1.125bn in August. The lead manager quoted the bonds at less 1.5 per cent bid, comfortably inside full fees of 1.75 per cent. The string of deals in dollar currencies looks likely to continue: a supra-national borrower is thought to be planning a 10-year global bond issue of at least ADollars 300m, although the lack of currency and interest rate swaps opportunities could delay any deal; Japanese borrowers including City of Kobe and Kanzai Airport are considering Eurodollar deals; the Asian Development Bank is still hoping to launch a Dollars 500m 10-year issue next week.</p>

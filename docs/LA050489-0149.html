			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> MOTEL EXPANSION REJECTED  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to prohibit expansion of the  Comfort Inn on Santa Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> Architect Doug Lowe failed to convince council members that he had met  requirements to add more parking and build deeper setbacks. His plan calls for  a four-story addition with 66 rooms onto the existing three-story motel.  </P> <P> Although Lowe had lowered the height of the addition and added some parking,  council members said the design still did not meet city zoning codes.  </P> <P> A dozen neighborhood activists opposed to the project claimed that it violated  several city regulations that govern setback sizes, land use and the placement  of on-site loading zones. Residents also argued that the increase in street  parking, traffic congestion and density would adversely affect their  neighborhood.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident It is curious that General Accident's shares should rise against the trend of a market led lower by US bonds. True, full year profits were at the higher end of market expectations. But with almost half its assets in North America, GA is unusually geared to US treasuries. Jitters in world bond markets have shaved 2 percentage points from the group's solvency margin since the year end. With solvency comfortably over 50 per cent, GA is hardly starved of capital. Yet a dividend equivalent to 5 per cent of shareholders' funds and covered only 1.8 times by earnings is a heavy burden. Should the bear market in bonds take hold, GA might find it difficult to increase the pay-out as fast as shareholders would like. That is all the more reason to hope that the earnings recovery continues. There should be more to come in the UK as premium increases already announced flow through into profits. GA's willingness to turn away motorists also suggests some sincerity about underwriting for profit at the expense of market share. Yet the bigger challenge now lies in the US and Canada, where underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 188m last year. The US in particular will be a tough nut to crack since GA lacks sufficient weight to influence market rates. Without a rise in insurance rates across the US market, GA can only increase premiums unilaterally even if that means losing business. Whether that will be enough to bring about decent profits remains an open question. The 20 per cent premium to net asset value at which the shares now stand demands no less.</p>

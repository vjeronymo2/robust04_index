			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THOMAS F. RILEY TERMINAL OPENS TO TRAVELERS SUNDAY  </P> <P> More than five months after officials had hoped the day would arrive, Orange  County's new and improved $310-million airport finally is scheduled to open at  6 a.m. Sunday, giving travelers their first chance to use the cavernous new  Thomas F. Riley Terminal.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old building that it replaces will close to the public tonight.  </P> <P> New close-in parking lots, costing $1 an hour or $14 a day, will also open just  after daybreak Sunday. The airport's remote lots, which had been scheduled to  close, will stay open for at least the next 90 days, though the price will go  up from $6 a day to $7.  </P> <P> Where the old terminal had just a single level, the new facility features two.  Departing passengers should head to the upper level, while arrivals and baggage  claims will pull in below.  </P></p>

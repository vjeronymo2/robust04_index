			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Freebies: The nation's largest theater chains are giving away promotional  samples of candy, popcorn and other goodies to regain revenue lost by cuts in  on-screen advertising. United Artists, the largest movie chain with 2,500  screens, handed out PB Max candy bars this month to patrons entering its  theaters in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon, the second largest chain with 1,690 screens, handed out packs  of sugar-free Dentyne chewing gum and samples of Hero's men's cologne at the  end of the movies. One industry source estimates the nationwide distribution of  a free product can generate up to $100,000 in ad revenues each month. Instead  of paying for ads on screen, which audiences have rejected, companies pay a fee  to the theater chains to hand out their products. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

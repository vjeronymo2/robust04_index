			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / US warns Croatia to stay out of Bosnia The US ambassador to the United Nations, Mrs Madeleine Albright, warned Croatia yesterday that it could face international economic sanctions unless it stayed out of the Bosnian war. The warning, issued during a news conference in Zagreb, the Croat capital, came as Moslem and Croatian negotiators in Vienna promised to make 'firm efforts' to stop the war in central Bosnia at a top-level meeting in Bonn on Saturday. Mrs Albright said the US was 'very concerned' by the reported activities of the Croatian military in support of Bosnian Croat forces. 'We have in a number of ways warned the Croatian government and military specifically on the subject,' she said. Her statement came hard on the heels of statements by President Franjo Tudjman and his senior officials that Zagreb might intervene directly to support Bosnian Croat forces encircled by Moslem-led Bosnian troops in the central Lasva valley. In spite of government denials UN officers and Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator on Yugoslavia, have claimed that Croatia has already given military help against both Moslems and Serbs. In an interview on Britain's Channel 4 television last night, Lord Owen said the international community should react as strongly as it did to the Serbian military intervention in Bosnia in 1992. Mrs Albright's strictures coincided with harsh criticism of all the participants in the Bosnian war from the Vatican, normally Catholic Croatia's unconditional supporter. 'No individual, much less politicians, can resign themselves to allow people to ravage each other and await a peace which would be the rotten fruit of exhaustion, or the crushing of one side by the other,' a Vatican spokesman said yesterday. Meanwhile, the joint statement issued in Vienna by Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, and Mr Mate Granic, Croatian foreign minister, said their plan to halt hostilities would be put to their respective presidents in Bonn on Saturday. They were making strenuous efforts to prepare 'a complete plan of the implementation of a ceasefire along all the frontlines'. An agreement in Bonn is clearly a vital condition for progress at full-scale negotiations, including the Serbs, due to take place in Geneva on January 18. But Lord Owen stressed that ceasefires alone would not solve the problem and that political solutions were required. In Paris, a defence ministry official said France was asking the US to help in two proposed operations in Bosnia to relieve Serb pressure on Moslem enclaves. It wanted air power and logistical support to lift the Serbian blockade of Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia and allow a Danish armoured column to relieve the besieged town of Srebrenica. It was announced yesterday that Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose of Britain would become the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia. General Rose, currently commander of UK Land Forces, will succeed Belgium's Lt-Gen Francis Briquemont, who has asked to be relieved at the end of this month.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on cuts to housing budget CUTS IN the government's housing budget threaten to reduce the quality of homes for rent, force more tenants on to social security benefits and create housing ghettos no better than the municipal housing estates of the 1960s, a new campaign will claim today. The Right to Build campaign will be launched by 15 housing associations at today's annual meeting of association chief executives in Bristol. It is likely to receive a warm reception from the executives, many of whom will lose government funding for building new homes for rent if the cuts are implemented. In his Autumn Statement the chancellor reiterated the Conservative election manifesto pledge of aid for 153,000 new housing association homes over the next three years. But he announced that the housing association grant rate would fall from about 72 per cent of the cost of each new home to 55 per cent in 1995. One consequence is that in 1995 housing associations will have to raise 45 per cent of the cost of each new home from the capital markets, rather than 28 per cent as now. This will make it much harder for associations to raise the private capital they need. Tenanted property is normally valued at about 50 per cent of its cost so with a loan of 45 per cent it barely has adequate security. Mr Graham Buck of Samuel Montagu, the UK merchant bank, said: 'If associations will be looking for more money I am not sure that there is the institutional interest to lend more.' Investors are likely to concentrate their funds on the most financially sound housing associations. The Housing Corporation, which pays out government housing grants, has anticipated this and prepared plans to reduce the number of eligible associations from 600 to fewer than 90. The plan, leaked shortly before Christmas, created uproar among housing associations. Ms Sheila Button, chair of the Metropolitan Housing Association, said: 'Rationing funds to a few big housing associations seems to go against everything the government has tried to do in breaking up big local authority housing departments.' Ms Leonie Cooper, chief executive of Rodinglea association, which specialises in housing single people and students, said several of the largest and most successful associations would be excluded from the new 'premier league'. She said: 'Special needs, co-operative and ethnic minority associations are threatened, too.' Builders fear that the reduced level of subsidy will mean lower quality homes. The higher level of private funding will also push up rents, to cover the additional interest bill. Much of the extra rent will be covered by housing benefit. Mr Len Bishop, chief executive of Hyde housing association, one of the UK's largest, said that as rents increase housing association developments will become welfare ghettos with almost all tenants on benefit. He said: 'The government will not save any money, because what it is taking from housing associations with one hand it will have to pay back in increased housing benefit.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No to the Massacre, No to Degradation"] </F>   [Text] Had most Arab rulers and officials not degraded  themselves, their dignity, and the rights of their nation, the  massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron would never have  occurred. The Zionist enemy's calculations would have been  totally different as well, especially since it is a usurper  entity, whose true aims cannot be concealed by claims of  security and military superiority while the memory of the  glorious battle and al-Husayn missiles is still vivid in our  minds.    Unfortunately, many Arab rulers and officials have degraded  themselves, Palestine, and Iraq, whom they are now blockading  after participating in the aggression against it. They were  against Iraq when it was facing Israel alone; a sole warrior  knowing no hesitation or compromise over rights despite all the  support Israel garnered from the imperialist and neo-imperialist  forces.    Here the degradation and the compromises have produced their  racist Zionist puss. The Zionist entity has dared to commit a  hideous massacre, killing prostrate worshipers in the mosque of  Ibrahimi, the grandfather of prophets, at dawn prayer on a  Friday in the holy month of Ramadan.    Could there be anything more degrading than this massacre?!!    If the boiling public anger were to react by avenging Arab  honor, becoming an anger for Palestine, its people, martyrs, and  our holy places, then it is also bound to clash with those  governments that pledged to guarantee the security of Israel and  the safety of its existence and borders. They used all their  political, financial, and military weight to kill the  Palestinian revolution, as a weapon and a source of strength.  They have also gone a long way toward sponsoring and  encouraging submission and deviation, until some of them joined  the U.S. settlement bandwagon, which was started by Bush and  Baker and is now continued by Clinton and Christopher.    When everything -- the land, the people, the holy places,  and  the factors of history and geography -- becomes negotiable, then  even the martyrs' blood is seen by these degraded weaklings as a  surmountable problem. For instance, they think it is sufficient  to switch the talks from Cairo to Washington, amid theatrical  appeals for self-restraint, in order to continue the  negotiations so as not to hamper the negotiation process. This  is itself a political massacre of the Palestine question.    We wonder, had this crime been committed by someone else,  would we have heard the same calm U.S. diplomatic talk? Or  would we have witnessed threats, fast UN resolutions, military  reinforcements from all direction, pressures, sanctions, and  land, air, and sea blockades on all political and economic  levels?!    With the Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath, the world stands face to  face with the U.S. sword that threatens world nations, their  rights, and honor. Here is the UN Security Council, despite all  the martyrs who fell on their national soil at the tombs of the  prophets and martyrs razed by Israeli Army bullets as a  punishment for their bereavement; here is the Security Council,  after quarter of a century of occupation and half a century of  usurpation, destitution, and murder, still holding consultations  in unofficial sessions to draft a resolution renewing its  confidence in the Israeli Government's ability to tackle the  situation in a just and wise manner.    In order to throw dust in our eyes, the capitals of  domination and oppression have issued verbal condemnations, shed  crocodile tears over the victims, and declared their deep  concern about the fate of the settlement and the negotiation  process!!    Amid this Arab fragmentation and all this degradation and  submission to the tyrant and the enemy, amid the absence of  international legality and the Arab League's use of the American  language rather than the Arabic language, and amid the dwarfing  of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference  Organization, this massacre has occurred with all its ugliness  and implications. It has shown to the people of Palestine, the  Arab nation, and all Muslims a glaring picture of their present  status and what their future will hold if this weakness,  fragmentation, and absence become solidified under agreements  that are now being dictated by Washington so that Tel Aviv, with  all its power and nuclear weapons, would be free to shed more  Arab blood and to occupy our lands and holy places.    What the enemies want must not be our inevitable fate. Here  is giant Iraq standing high and proud with its full willpower,  honor, and historic leadership; and here are the heroes of the  intifadah with all their vigor, filling the land of Palestine  with stones, bullets, and martyrs to prove that they are strong  and that their resolve knows no despair or fatigue. These  heroes disdain every false and crafty condemnation, because they  and all honorable Arabs and Muslims know that they have the  final say in this epic struggle, whose fire could not be  extinguished for 75 years on the land of Palestine. Their epic  is Palestine's modern history, which will become more radiant  with the blood of the righteous martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque.    Immortality and glory to the martyrs.    Glory to the fighting revolutionaries.    Long live Palestine free and Arab.    Long live our glorious Arab nation.    God is great.</p>

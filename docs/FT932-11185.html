			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Loss of guarantee will cut UK farmers' wool earnings in half UK SHEEP farmers face a reduction of almost half in their income from wool following the demise of the British Wool Marketing Board's guarantee price after 42 years. Last year the wool price was guaranteed at 117p a kilogram. The market price is about 64p - a marginal level for many farmers. The government's termination of the guarantee scheme could not have come at a worse time, Mr Alun Evans, chairman of the board, said yesterday. The world wool industry had been plunged into crisis by overproduction in the southern hemisphere and the recession. But the board had been preparing for the end of the scheme under the Agricultural Marketing Act and had cut its costs to the level of 13 years ago at 23p a kilogram from 35p at the peak. Staffing had been cut from 160 to fewer than 60. The BWMB will retain its statutory obligation to collect all the wool - 50m kg - from the UK's 100,000 producers, including those in Northern Ireland and the Western Isles. This is necessary because 60 per cent of producers grow about 20 per cent of the total clip in amounts of 400 kg or less. The wool is seen principally as a by-product of lamb production. 'In times like these nobody would be likely to collect the wool from farmers, particularly in the remote regions,' said Mr Evans. The world market for wool, which is totally free, is depressed by huge overhangs of stocks in Australia and New Zealand. Last week the Australian government announced a 12-month moratorium on sales from the country's 3.9bn-bale stockpile in an attempt to end the slide in prices, which are at historic lows. The BWMB has retained Pounds 10m in order to be able to make what it called a prudent downpayment on the coming clip, with the balance to be paid at the end of the season. It intends to maintain this system in order to ensure a smooth supply of wool. Mr Donald Holdsworth, chairman of the British Wool Federation, which represents the textile industry, said the smooth flow of wool to auction via the BWMB had greatly benefited the industry, which last year exported Pounds 550m worth of goods. The industry did not object to the removal of the guarantee scheme, but it did object to the timing, said Mr Holdsworth. In West Yorkshire more than 23,000 jobs depended on the wool industry. Both the Federation and the BWMB had tried to get the government to continue a modified guarantee scheme, or to phase it out over several years, to soften the blow. The BWMB estimated that over its 42-year life the guarantee price had cost the government between Pounds 8m and Pounds 11m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today noted  that the problem in the Aegean can be pinpointed to violations  by Turkish planes, violation of air-traffic rules, and  violations of Greek national airspace. Venizelos said that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher's position is an old U.S.  position, adding: Our country's position, however, depends on  national sovereignty and the need to defend the defensive  region. Venizelos stressed: Greece always acts defensively.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW PLEDGES NOT TO USE FORCE TO DISARM ARMENIAN MILITANTS  </P> <P> The Kremlin has pledged not to use force against thousands of armed militants  in Armenia and instead will let authorities in the southern Soviet republic try  to disarm those paramilitary groups, the new president of Armenia said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan also  said it is time to "expand state sovereignty" of his republic, and that he is  ready to negotiate with neighboring Azerbaijan over the bitter dispute  involving control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan, who was sworn in as Armenia's president last weekend, is in  Moscow to discuss Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's July 25 decree  ordering armed groups in Armenia to disband within 15 days.  </P> <P> He said had "positive" talks on Wednesday with Prime Minister Nikolai I.  Ryzhkov, Soviet Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin and KGB chief Vladimir A.  Kryuchkov.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, trying to quell violence in this ethnically diverse nation, had  threatened to send in army and Interior Ministry troops to forcibly disarm the  militants.  </P> <P> Many militants, especially those in the volunteer Armenian Nationalist Army,  the largest paramilitary group, have refused to comply. Armenia's Parliament,  which this week is considering a declaration of independence, rejected  Gorbachev's decree as interference.  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan said Thursday that he has been given assurances by senior  officials, including Interior Minister Bakatin, that the deadline for handing  over weapons would be extended.  </P> <P> "We have an agreement that we will be able to carry out the decree freely with  our own forces without intervention from outside," the Armenian leader said.  "We have a strict agreement. They will not send in any troops.  </P> <P> "As regards the deadlines, we talked about the fact that I am a new leader of  the republic and I cannot be held responsible for the sins of the previous  leadership," Ter-Petrosyan told reporters.  </P> <P> He also said that Armenia's Parliament was in control of the Armenian  Nationalist Army. But it was unclear whether the republic's new leadership  wields much influence over the paramilitary group.  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan, whose statements marked an easing of tension between Armenia and  the Kremlin, stressed that the main goal for Armenia is "to expand state  sovereignty and radically democratize social life."  </P> <P> However, he also said that it is possible for Armenia to have good relations  with its traditional enemies -- the Muslim Azerbaijanis, Turks and Iran -- and  that he is ready to open talks with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly  Armenian enclave that is part of Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Ethnic battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over who should control the  mountainous region have killed more than 200 people in the past two years.  </P></p>

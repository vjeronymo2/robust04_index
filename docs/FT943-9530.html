			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU cash call There were no real surprises for the market as Commercial Union finally revealed the terms of its acquisition of Group Victoire from Compagnie de Suez, the French financial services and holding company. The stock market had been on alert for a large fund-raising in CU for many weeks and had expected a rights issue last week. Analysts said the market had been satisfied with the terms and the size of the rights offer, a one-for-eight call at 475p a share to raise Pounds 322m. News of the rights issue, a share sale to French investment bank Societe Generale, and top-of-the-range interim profits of Pounds 181m, helped CU shares improve to 565p before closing a net 11 ahead at 563p. Composite insurer General Accident touched 605p immediately following the top of the range interim figures, but subsequently fell to close a net 13 off at 590p as insurance specialists pointed out the group's limited prospects for dividend growth Late stories circulated in the market suggesting that final go-ahead for the new Hong Kong airport might have been granted by the Chinese authorities. The project involves an investment in excess of Dollars 20bn and the prospect gave a big push to companies heavily involved in the colony. Cable and Wireless rose 7 to 449p on very heavy turnover of 7.9m shares, while HSBC settled 5 1/2 firmer at 794 1/2 p after 6.5m traded. NatWest Securities upgraded Cadbury Schweppes to a hold and the shares hardened 2 to 469p. The broker was also advising clients not to chase Unilever ahead of second-quarter results due on Friday, although it remains positive on the stock in the longer term. The Anglo-Dutch group is expected to produce a slight fall in profits, adversely affected by the costs of its new Persil launch and a detergent price war in the US. The shares retreated 18 to 1063p, mostly on concern over rumoured Unilever interest in buying Eastman Kodak's household products division. A price tag of between Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn has been mooted by analysts for the Kodak business. Results announced and pending in the chemicals sector affected a number of stocks. Holliday Chemicals moved ahead 13 to 250p after reporting a 46 per cent boost in half-year profits. Hickson International improved 4 to 177p awaiting interim figures scheduled for release today, while BOC receded 10 to 746p ahead of third-quarter figures due tomorrow. Consideration of the possibility that Reckitt &amp; Colman might be interested in purchasing Eastman Kodak's household products division saw the shares open weaker. However, they maintained their level as the market turned off and ended 9 down at 605p. Media conglomerate Pearson advanced 10 to 655p on speculation that a leading broker had upgraded its recommendation. Consideration of a sparkling set of figures from advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi prompted a rush of optimism over today's figures from WPP. Analysts expect WPP, which has taken so much pain since it acquired Ogilvy &amp; Mather just before the recession, to announce half-year profits of between Pounds 33m and Pounds 37.5m. Saatchi rose in early trading but profit-taking sent the shares back to close 2 easier on balance at 174p. WPP jumped 13 to 123p. The holiday price war continued to exact a toll on shares of Airtours, the tour operator slipping 5 to 455p. Director share selling was said to be one reason behind a fall in Granada of 7 to 526p. Reverberations from Monday's strong consumer lending figures were still being felt among stores stocks. Kingfisher added 2 at 517p, as did Marks and Spencer, at 433p. The shock announcement that Upton and Southern, the northern-based retailer, is to consider legal action against the directors of the Reject Shop chain, which Upton bought for Pounds 2.4m only six months ago, shook the shares. Upton, which said Reject's expected losses would be significantly greater than originally forecast, plummeted 12 to 14p, although dealers reported institutional buying towards the close. Materials group Cookson advanced 8 to 258p following a Hoare Govett recommendation. Engineering concerns Glynwed International and TI Group succumbed to a sell recommendation from Hoare. The former gave up 13 to 369p and the latter slipped 3 to 400p. Investors in industrial group Charter, up 9 at 745p, were cheered by news that the company will not raise its Pounds 260m bid for Esab, the Swedish welding equipment concern, after several investors in Esab said they will reject the offer. BPP Holdings forged ahead 25 to 215p as the education and training group reported improved interim figures. International conglomerate Hanson hardened 2 to 263p in hefty trade of 9.7m, with SG Warburg reported to have recommended the shares. Clothes and furnishings group Laura Ashley, off 2 at 69p, was said to be denying press reports of a takeover by Hugo Boss, of Germany. Enterprise Oil suffered from further selling pressure and switching into Lasmo, a course recommended by Kleinwort Benson, with the former closing a net 3 cheaper at 422p, after 418p. Lasmo settled 1 1/2 easier at 154 1/2p.</p>

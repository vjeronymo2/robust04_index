			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was received as a hero by about  10,000 jubilant supporters in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 March] at  his first rally in support of next week's elections.    The mood in the kwaZulu capital throughout Wednesday was one  of excitement and celebration, following the IFP's decision on  Tuesday to contest the country's first all-race poll.    Thousands of singing and dancing IFP supporters streamed  through central Ulundi during the day, before gathering outside  the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building to hear Mr Buthelezi's  first pro- election address. "Who is the president of South  Africa?" an official asked the excited crowd, which responded  with a resounding: "Shenge (Mr Buthelezi's clan name)."    The crowd sang, danced and ululated in a jubilant  celebration  of the impending election.    Despite being three hours late Mr Buthelezi arrived to  overwhelming cheers. In his address he acknowledged there was  little time for electioneering, but said: "Miracles may still  happen." He urged his followers not to be complacent, but to  face the "biggest hurdle which is the election".    The IFP president said he had been serving his people for 40  years and "now that my dream is coming true, I hope you will  allow me to complete my job by electing me".    The IFP had joined the elections to save the country from  disaster and to contribute to peace, he said. The IFP's  participation in national elections would not lead to an  immediate reduction in violence but the "proportion of violence  will be less," he added.    The party's late entry into the elections would hamper its  performance because voter education had not reached all his  supporters.    Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's  elections, Mr Buthelezi said he did not want to predict what  would happen, but added "that will be tested". "Some of our  offices can't cope with the number of people joining," Mr  Buthelezi said.    He later told a news conference he would accept the results  of South Africa's first all-race [passage indistinct]. "One  must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be  it -- whatever one's feelings may be."    On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said  these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would  head the party list for the national assembly. "As national  leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One  can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on  whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position.</p>

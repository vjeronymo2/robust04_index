			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NW Water ahead of expectations with Pounds 269m North West Water yesterday said it was comfortable with the initial outcome of the current price review process, as it announced a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. Replying to questions over whether North West felt the industry regulator had taken a tough approach to the draft price increases issued at the weekend, Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman, said: 'The logic and methods by which Ian Byatt goes about it leave one with a feeling of comfort.' The UK's 31 water and sewerage companies are preparing replies for Ofwat on the draft K factors - the rate above inflation by which they will be allowed to raise prices from 1995 to 2000. The final allowances will be announced on July 28. Analysts estimates for North West's increase range from 2 to 2.6. The utility kicked off the water company results season with better than expected figures, largely due to a reduction from Pounds 36m to Pounds 12m in provisions for restructuring the regulated business. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 247m to Pounds 269m on turnover up from Pounds 878m to Pounds 924m. The increase masked a disappointing performance from the process engineering business, where profits before interest and tax fell from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 8.8m. On the international contract business North West wrote off Pounds 8m in investments against Pounds 9.6m last time. The regulated businesses showed a 15 per cent increase in profits before interest and tax to Pounds 326m because of reduced working capital and operating efficiencies. A decline in industrial and commercial turnover held back the advance in sales to 6 per cent at Pounds 729m. Gearing fell from 29.1 per cent to 27.3 per cent. The final dividend is increased to 15.4p for a total 8 per cent higher at 23.07p (21.4p). Earnings rose from 62.3p to 70.8p. COMMENT North West warned at the interim stage that process engineering would be difficult, but one might wonder why it has taken the group two years to spot excessive overheads. The utility, as expected, has returned a sterling performance. All of this is almost irrelevant, however, given uncertainty over future price increases. Until the K factors are known the sector will be unattractive. Forecasts are for Pounds 290m this year, for a prospective multiple of 7 and a yield of 6 per cent. Yesterday's noises may leave existing investors as comfortable as the chairman, but they may not be enough to tempt new ones in.</p>

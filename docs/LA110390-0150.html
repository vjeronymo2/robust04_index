			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HERNANDEZ'S KICK ENDS BREA'S SEVEN-YEAR HEX  </P> <P> Football games like this are usually measured in yards. But you could size up  Brea-Olinda High School's 23-21 victory over host Valencia Friday night in the  width of the smile Brea kicker Marco Hernandez was wearing afterward.  </P> <P> Hernandez's 25-yard field goal sailed straight and true with 42 seconds left  and gave Brea Coach John Looney his first victory over Valencia in seven years.  </P> <P> "I told Marco to go out and win us the Orange League championship," Looney  said. "Inside, I was just praying he'd make it."  </P> <P> Hernandez's kick set off a wild celebration on the Brea sideline. And it gave  the Wildcats (6-2-1, 3-0-1 in league) the inside track on the league  championship. Brea can clinch the title with a victory at home next week  against Western.  </P> <P> The decisive field goal was set up on a 43-yard option pass play from Jamie  Baraglia to Mike Ryan after a lateral from quarterback Jason Luevanos.  </P> <P> Valencia (8-1, 3-1) took a 21-7 lead early in the third quarter on John  Fewell's third touchdown run of the game. Fewell carried 16 times for 131  yards. Brea's comeback started with Brook Coop's two-yard touchdown plunge in  the third quarter.  </P> <P> With 3:13 left after the second of three tough Brea defensive stands, Luevanos  hit a sliding Rick Taylor in the end zone from 11 yards out to cut Valencia's  lead to 21-20. But Luevanos' pass attempt on the two-point conversion was  batted away by Korey Alexander. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

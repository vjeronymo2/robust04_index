Fifteen  residents were killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in  Hebron and its environs during the riots which erupted following  the massacre. Another four were killed in similar circumstances  -- three in Gaza and one in Nabulus.    IDF spokesmen say they do not have accurate figures  regarding  the number of casualties in Hebron, adding that the issue is  still being examined.    The number of wounded rose yesterday to more than 250  people.  Approximately 100 cartridge cases fired by Barukh Goldstein were  found in the Cave of the Patriarchs' Yitzhaq Hall.    The security forces are preventing Qiryat Arba' residents  from entering Hebron. They can reach Jerusalem only in military  escorted convoys going through Bet Shemesh. Our correspondent  Mira Amsalem reports from Hebron that car traffic in Qiryat  Arba' is extremely limited.</p>

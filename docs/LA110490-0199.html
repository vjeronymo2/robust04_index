			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> QUIET ARREST FOR LONGSHOREMAN AT CENTER OF MELEE  </P> <P> A 49-year-old longshoreman has been arrested for non-payment of child support  three weeks after his attempted arrest at a union hall led to a strike that  briefly closed the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles district attorney's office reported that Roy Neal was  apprehended just after 5 a.m. Friday as he attempted to pick up a paycheck at  the Wilmington payroll office of the Pacific Maritime Association, which  represents shippers and other waterfront employers.  </P> <P> Neal, whose address is unknown, was arrested without incident and remains in  custody at County Jail on $5,000 bail. He is charged with violating probation  for allegedly failing to pay $3,904 in support payments for his two children,  authorities said.  </P> <P> In arresting Neal, the district attorney's office sent six investigators to the  maritime association office, fearing a repeat of an Oct. 10 melee at the  dispatch hall of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union,  Local 13. The hall in Wilmington was the scene of an angry confrontation  between 300 longshoremen and authorities when two district attorney's  investigators entered the building with an arrest warrant for Neal.  </P> <P> Hours after the Oct. 10 confrontation, about 500 longshoremen walked off their  jobs at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, idling 30 ships and tens of  millions of dollars in cargo. During subsequent talks with maritime association  officials, the longshoremen's leaders acknowledged that the 13-hour walkout was  illegal under the union's contract with employers. In addition, the union  agreed the striking workers would lose one day's pay, roughly $200 per  longshoreman.  </P></p>

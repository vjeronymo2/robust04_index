For that purpose the Islamic Republic of  Iran's Embassy, just as before, is seeking to restore peace to  Kabul by mediating between rival political and military groups.    In the eyes of political analysts there are three ways to  end  the Afghan crisis. The first is for one or two jihadi groups,  which are more popular than other groups, to act as mediators.  The second is that friendly and neighboring states mediate  among the fighting groups. And the third way is for an  international organization or authority to embark on mediation.    Although none of those ways has been able finally to resolve  the Afghan issue it does not mean that hope should be given up  for restoring peace and stability and stopping efforts to end  the internal war in Afghanistan. On this presupposition, the  Islamic Republic intends to continue its diplomatic efforts and  in this process expects cooperation from other rival political  and military groups.    From the Islamic Republic's point of view the occurrence of  any confrontation in Afghanistan, on any pretext at all, is  condemned. The experience of past bloody clashes has shown that  because of the extreme factionalism among the warring sides the  possibility that one side will dominate the other is remote.  Furthermore, this endless war does not have any consequence  except the further destruction of Afghanistan and the killing  and injuring of a greater number of the people of that country.  Also, it paves the way for abuse by foreign powers.    Islamic Iran -- which always was a friend and sympathizer of  the tyrannized people of Afghanistan during their 14-year jihad  against the sovereignty of communists -- does not expect the  jehadi groups to embark on slaughtering each other with the  massive volume of destructive weaponry in their possession. At  one time they were fighting along a unified front to topple the  rule of infidelity and atheism in Afghanistan. They should not  now utilize Afghanistan's resources and potential to destroy  rather than reconstruct it.    What so far has resulted in a military and political impasse  is a lack of unified and all-embracing leadership, the  insubordination of junior commanders toward their commanders and  leaders, the existence of irresponsible armed groups throughout  Afghanistan, the widespread availability of arms left from  before, and, generally speaking, the mistrust of rival political  and military leaders of each other. Such obstacles have caused  political analysts to believe that the first step for breaking  the impasse depends on further flexibility by the jihadi  leaders. So long as the Afghan political and military leaders  do not agree on a unified position, attaining an agreement to  end the fighting and establish peace in Afghanistan will be  difficult. That is why the Islamic Republic intends -- while  adopting a policy of noninterference in other states' internal  affairs -- to bring the positions of the jihadi groups closer  together through consultation with them and prepare the ground  for peace and the consolidation of sovereignty in Afghanistan.  It is expected that the jehadi groups will sincerely cooperate  and join their efforts with those of the Islamic Republic of  Iran to reach that sacred objective.</p>

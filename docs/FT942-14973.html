			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / IMF predicts 3% world growth The International Monetary Fund is forecasting world economic growth of around 3 per cent this year, with a stronger recovery to between 3 1/2 and 4 per cent growth in 1995, writes George Graham in Washington. In its world economic outlook, due out on Wednesday, the IMF predicts that growth in the developing countries will remain steady, while in the industrialised world only the US, Canada, the UK and the Nordic countries have pulled out of recession. IMF economists believe the Japanese economy has bottomed out, and that with normal output in continental Europe the world should produce strong growth next year. The fund notes that the current recovery has not been accompanied, particularly in Europe, by any appreciable recovery in employment. Details, Page 4</p>

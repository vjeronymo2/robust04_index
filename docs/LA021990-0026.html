			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLOGRAPHY REVIEW;  </P> <P> MUSEUM'S 'IMAGES' INTRIGUING, BUT ART IT'S NOT  </P> <P> Millions of people see the fool-the-eye three-dimensional dove on their Visa  card every day without realizing they're looking at a hologram, a miniature  marvel of technology and optics.  </P> <P> "Images in Space and Time," an exhibit of 200 holograms from 15 countries  continuing at the California Museum of Science and Industry, attempts to show  how the growing use of holography is affecting such diverse fields as medicine,  manufacturing, information storage and the fine arts.  </P> <P> The scientific and industrial applications constitute the most interesting part  of the exhibit. "Coronary Artery" by Lee Lacey (U.S., 1985) reveals how the  blood vessels embrace the heart muscle -- and how a doctor can find a partially  blocked artery that requires surgery. Lacey's "Holo/CAD" (1985) combines  holography with computer-generated drawings of an instrument panel for a new  car. The three-dimensional image tells more about how the finished panel would  look than a flat drawing would, enabling the designer to make adjustments early  in production.  </P> <P> Some Soviet experiments using holograms to replace fragile art objects in  museum displays are somewhat less successful. Holographic diamonds don't  sparkle, which takes a lot of the fun out of looking at a case of jeweled  medallions. As a hologram only records a single point of view, it's impossible  to examine some ancient gold ornaments from various angles to see how they were  cast.  </P> <P> Ironically, the most sophisticated technical accomplishments often produce the  least impressive images. Toshiro Kubota has devised a way of layering  monochromatic holograms to create fully colored, three-dimensional images: His  "Dojo: Japanese Doll" (Japan, 1985) represents a technological breakthrough,  but it's so realistic that to the casual observer, it just looks like a doll in  a case.  </P> <P> The examples of "fine art" are the least successful works in the exhibition.  The 3-D effect is initially intriguing, but when the novelty wears off, the  viewer is left contemplating a series of vapid technical exercises that are  devoid of content. These tendencies are summed up in Robert Schinella's  hilariously kitsch study, "Witch and Devil" (U.S., 1973), created for the  Museum of Witchcraft and Magic on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco -- where  it should have remained.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, none of the artists represented here seem able to go beyond that  penny arcade/peepshow mentality.  </P> <P> In "Wine Goblet" by Charles Lysogorski (U.S., 1986), the full bowl of a glass  hovers over its broken stem; odd bits of junk seem to float inside a real  aquarium in Claudette Abrams' silly "Personal Effects" (Canada, 1986). Michael  Snow's attempts to do portraits and figure studies make real people look like  cheap department store mannequins.  </P> <P> With 200 holograms on display, there's a lot to look at in "Images," but that  doesn't mean there's a lot to see. The viewer learns that holography is good  for more than those little doves that make it tough to counterfeit credit  cards. But the technology is still waiting for someone to explore its aesthetic  potential seriously, the way contemporary composers are exploring synthesized  sound.  </P> <P> A word of caution: The show is designed to be seen by someone about 5-feet-6.  Boxes are provided for children to stand on, but tall people should be prepared  for sore knees and shoulders from all the stooping they'll do.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Images in Time and Space" continues in the Armoury Room of the California  Museum of Science and Industry, 700 State Drive, through March 25. Information:  (213) 744-1966.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], met with Okinawa Governor  Masahide Ota at the Okinawa Prefectural Office on 6 April.  During the meeting, Kubo pledged that the SDPJ, as a member of  the ruling coalition, would do its utmost to resolve the issue  of the bases on Okinawa. He said: "We regard the issue of the  bases on Okinawa as a problem that should concern the whole  nation. We will work to resolve the issue." Kubo arrived in  Okinawa the same day to solicit opinions.    Concerning the passage of a bill on special measures for  promoting diversion of military-occupied land, Kubo said: "We  could not have expected the current Diet confusion.  Nevertheless, the passage of the bill is a commitment." In  this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would make an all-out  effort for the legislation. Okinawa hopes that the bill, which  will be submitted as a legislator-sponsored bill, should be  enacted during the current Diet session.    At the meeting, Governor Ota referred to the crash of a U.S.  F-15 jet fighter which occurred on 4 April, saying: "The  prefectural office has asked the Governments of Japan and the  United States to work to resolve the issue of the bases before  1995, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the  Pacific war. Since you work in the center of the ruling  coalition, I hope you will tell the government about the crash."    Also, with regard to U.S. Forces' facilities such as the  Naha  Military Port, whose return has been agreed upon by the Japanese  and U.S. Governments, Ota said: "I expect the government to  satisfy the Okinawan people by achieving tangible results."    In response, Kubo said: "The Hosokawa government has  expressed deep regret over the war since its inauguration. We  understand the Okinawan people's feeling." He then noted that  the Hosokawa government would tackle the Okinawa base issue as  its own task and that the SDPJ would discuss it at a meeting of  party members of prefectural assemblies to be held in Okinawa in  June.    After the meeting, Kubo headed for the spot where the F-15  fighter crashed for inspection. On the way, he was informed of  another crash by a helicopter belonging to U.S. Forces, and he  was apparently shocked by the fact that Okinawa is always  exposed to danger.    At the spot, Kubo looked at the burnt fuselage of an F-15  fighter while being briefed on the crash by Okinawa City Deputy  Mayor Eiken Kayo. Kubo said: "Duties of the government include  protecting the lives and assets of the people. I will report  the accident to the government. We have to consider what  measures should be taken to resolve the issue of the bases."</p>

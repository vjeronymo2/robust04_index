			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 1.2m for Tay Homes Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, increased pre-tax profits by 18.5 per cent from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.22m during the six months to the end of December. Turnover fell from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 26.6m as the number of homes sold rose by 6 per cent to 434. Earnings per share rose from 3.04p to 3.63p, a 19 per cent increase. The company which has extended its housebuilding operations to north Birmingham and north Bristol is increasing the interim dividend from 1.2p to 1.35p. Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said Tay had seen a significant improvement in sales since the new year with unit sales currently 8 per cent ahead of the corresponding period. Last November, when announcing a Pounds 10.2m rights issue, Tay said it intended to increase land purchases to take advantage of the housing market recovery. Since then it has bought a number of sites enabling it to maintain its land bank at 4,200 plots. In addition, it has 750 plots for sale in Scotland. No land sales are proposed this year. Gearing, which stood at 80 per cent at end-December, has been reduced to 35 per cent following the rights issue.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Why AVCs should be a low priority for a number of senior executives - Finance Pensions are one of the most tax-efficient ways of saving, which is why many employees who have not made full contributions to their pension scheme are encouraged to top them up. The two main ways of doing so are with additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), which form part of the main company scheme and free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs), sold independently by life offices and some unit trust groups. AVCs and FSAVCs are the most tax-efficient method of increasing your company pension, because they attract full tax relief on contributions. The fund also enjoys tax-free growth. However, John Shuttleworth, an actuary at accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that for senior executives earning over about Pounds 100,000 a year who joined their company scheme before March 17 1987, AVCs should be low on their list of choices. Their AVCs either buy a taxed pension or allow the executive to take cash from his AVCs, so avoiding commuting - taking cash from - his company pension. But either way, the tax-free lump sum is not increased. Directly or indirectly, the AVCs buy a taxed pension. So the advantages of AVCs for these executives, are exemption from income and capital gains tax on the underlying investments and any fall in the executive's marginal rate of tax in retirement. However, Shuttleworth says that the risk of tax rates increasing before the executive comes to take his pension is too high to be worth taking. If higher-rate tax rises from the present 40 per cent to 60 per cent, the executive will have received tax relief at 40 per cent but will be taxed on the pension at 60 per cent. 'In the present low tax environment, it is better to take cash now rather than to be in a cash deferral plan such as an AVC. For many pre-March 17, 1987 executives, the potential gain relative to other investments in paying AVCs is low, but the downside can be high. Other investments which do not carry the risks of a potentially poor return as well as giving greater accessibility in the case of a need for funds, can give a return as good as that with AVCs.' These include Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts, Personal Equity Plans and some National Savings products. Other investment, such as unit trusts also compare well. AVCs still remain a potentially good deal for two groups: those below senior management level who are higher-rate taxpayers but expect to retire as lower-rate taxpayers. They are receiving tax relief on contributions at 40 per cent but their pension will be taxed at the lower rate (assuming that any future increase in basic rate tax is below 40 per cent). Most employees who joined their company scheme after March 16, 1987 should also benefit, says Shuttleworth, since as a rule of thumb, about a quarter of each AVC emerges as tax-free cash, on which there is a genuine tax saving of up to 40 per cent.</p>

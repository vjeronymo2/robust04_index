			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Deadlock over EU pension fund rules Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands yesterday rejected a compromise aimed at opening up cross-border investment by European pension funds, on the grounds that it did not go far enough. Internal market ministers were again unable to agree on the pension funds directive, which is supposed to improve pension funds' ability to invest their assets in other countries of the European Union. Nine ministers yesterday supported a compromise deal which would allow member states to oblige pension funds to invest as much as 80 per cent of their assets in the currency in which its pensioners are paid. But Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, which impose no restrictions on their pension funds' investments, believe such an obligation would run counter to the single market's commitment to the free movement of capital around the EU. 'There is still a pension fund directive that we would like - but this isn't it,' said one UK official. Normally, the dissenting trio could be outvoted by the other nine member states, but the European Commission is also opposed to the 80 per cent limit, and this means approval of the compromise has to be unanimous. The Commission said it could accept a currency matching requirement of 60 per cent, but no higher. The internal market ministers also agreed a separate and controversial proposal offering patent protection to biotechnological inventions. For months the European Parliament has held up progress on the measure because of ethical objections, particularly to the possibility that the directive might lead to patents on genetically modified human cells or parts of the body. Ministers had to resolve a number of complex outstanding technical issues. Environmental groups and political parties have argued that approval of the directive could lead to higher prices for food, medicine and other products of biotechnology, with farmers obliged to pay royalties on new strains of plants and livestock.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Ruming [0151 3067 2494]: ``16 Achievements of </F> MEI Institute 44 Pass Appraisal'']    [Summary] MEI Institute 44, tracking the world  state-of-the-art, recently developed 16 military and civilian  optoelectronic devices, which passed product design finalization  on 23 March. Prominent among these 16 devices is the GR1342J  superradiation light-emitting diode, the first domestically  developed superradiation LED meeting early-90s international  commercial standards. This new device, fabricated with an  epitaxial technique and end-face film depostion, is used as an  intermediary between LEDs and laser diodes, and is an ideal  light source for fiber optic gyros. Other important devices  include the GD3255Y fast-response, high-sensitivity,  large-photosensitive-surface non-magnetic photodiode, an  embargoed optoelectronic detector used in asdic [i.e.  anti-submarine detection] systems; the GZ1140Z  broad-passband-range, low-intra-passband-ripple,  steep-transition-band CCD [charge-coupled device] recursive  filter used in new-generation radar systems; the SK161 coaxial  hermetic package used in high-power pulsed laser diodes for key  State projects and also for laser diode arrays and LEDs; the  GD5281Y high-sensitivity, broad-dynamic-range quadrant avalanche  detector [i.e. photodiode] used in missile guidance and  tracking, security monitoring, medical diagnosis, and robot  vision systems; the GH5200Q zero-light-detection switch; the  GH1200Z and two other models of optical couplers; and the  GH8740J and one other ac/dc solid state relay.</p>

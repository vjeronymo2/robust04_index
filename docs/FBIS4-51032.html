			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bian Hongwei: "Northeast Asia Building for Economic </F> Bloc After Cold War"]    [Text] Economic co-operation among Northeast Asian  countries is facing mixed blessings during the post-Cold War era.    Although huge co-operative potential exists, the so-called  regional "economic bloc" still remains just a theory, said Lu  Nanquan, secretary general of the China Society of Eastern  European and Central Asian Studies.    He made the remark at a recent symposium on co-operation  between China and neighbouring Asian countries, in which some 50  scholars took part.    The detente following the 40-year Cold War provides  Northeast  Asian countries with a solid external atmosphere for economic  co-operation, said Lu.    And the development of regional economic blocs in other  parts  of the world, such as the European Union and North American Free  Trade Agreement, provides great inspiration, Lu added.    In the broader sense, Northeast Asia includes Northeast  China, Russia's Far East, the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan and Mongolia.  Market economies now dominate the region and economic  development is the priority here.    Bilateral trade between the neighbouring countries has been  active in recent years. For example, the trade volume between  China and the ROK reached $8.9 billion last year, and that  between China and Russia totalled $7.2 billion, up by 24 per  cent over the previous year.    Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia,  and between the ROK and DPRK, has also seen steady growth.    "These factors form a solid basis for the booming economic  co- operation between nations in the region," said Lu.  <H5>  Potential </H5>   Northeast Asia boasts a sound economic foundation and rich  national resources, which hold great potential for the further  development of the region.    The United Nations Development Programme has decided to  invest $30 billion in the next 20 years in the Tumen River  Project, which should give a boost to relations among Northeast  Asian countries.    The fact that Northeast Asia includes developed and  developing countries facilitates co-operation in capital,  technology and natural resources, said Lu, adding that this also  provides opportunities for the flow of labour and products.    However, Lu admitted that it was difficult to push into  being  the theoretically-sound economic bloc.    The Cold War has overshadowed the region for so long and  with  such an intensity that it is a demanding job to integrate the  economic group, Lu said.    Countries of the region are miles apart in political and  economic systems, making it hard to eliminate ideological and  military conflicts quickly.    He also pointed out that Japan's attitude to creating a new  economic nexus is key, as it is the biggest potential investor  in the region. Unfortunately, its militant history brings many  doubts to further co-operation in the Northeast Asian region.    Economically, Japan is adjusting its strategy, shifting its  investment focus from North America and Europe to Asia. Within  Asia, Japan's emphasis will move from the Southeast to the  Northeast. The adjustment, however, takes time due to the cycle  of investment returns, said Lu.    He predicted that economic co-operation in the region will  spread from trade to manufacturing and technology, starting with  bilateral relations before turning in a multilateral direction.    Small economic co-operative zones will likely emerge first  to  form a basis for the development of the whole bloc, Lu added.    Another influential power to the booming economic group is  the United States, Lu said at the symposium.    Although America is far away from Northeast Asia, it has a  great impact in the region, especially on the Korean Peninsula.  <H5>  Interests </H5>   The United States is eager to protect its political and  economic interests in the region, which determines its  willingness to become involved in projects here, said Lu.    Judith Thornton, a professor with the University of  Washington in Seattle, shared Lu's view, saying the U.S. sees  itself as an active participant in and beneficiary of Asian  economic growth.    Seen from the economic point of view, the American scholar  said, U.S. involvement in the Asian-Pacific market stems mainly  from the self-interested actions of American exporters and  importers, borrowers and investors participating in the  fast-growing economic development.    She also pointed out that the potential areas of economic  co-operation lie in infrastructure construction, including  transport, telecommunications and energy.    Major ports in the region like Dalian, Vladivostok,  Nakhodka,  and Vostochniy have the potential to serve as a gateway to the  heartland of Asia and Siberia.    The Tumen River Project would encourage joint efforts by  Russia and China to build transport links. And it is just as  likely that expansion of China's transport network will be  competitive with the Eurasian Continental Bridge, said Thornton.    A pipeline carrying natural gas from Turkmenistan and  Kazakhstan to Central China will be constructed to bring the oil  and gas of Sakhalin to Central China, South Korea and Japan.    The pipeline is expected to be funded by Japanese lenders or  other international financial organizations such the World Bank  and Asian Investment Bank.    East Siberia contains significant energy supplies including  oil, gas and hydroelectric. Further development of the energy  sector will fuel the economic growth of the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Name indistinct], a U.S. national security  representative, and U.S. Ambassador to Latvia Ints Silins held a  news conference at the U.S. information center today on the  Partnership for Peace cooperation plan proposed by NATO. It was  again stressed at the news conference that this NATO program is  open for all East European states, irrespective of whether they  have expressed the wish to be involved in NATO.    Representatives of the Latvian Government have agreed to  that  program. Latvia would also feel more secure if it participates  in it.    Asked why the United States has not reacted to Russia's  increased military readiness [reference to 10 January  deportation of two Russian generals], Ambassador Silins noted  that not all tensions in interstate relations warrant a special  U.S. statement.    At the end, it was once again indicated that the United  States favors a speedier withdrawal of the Russian Army from  Latvia.</p>

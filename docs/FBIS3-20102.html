			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 25 (AFP) -- Heavily-armed riot police  clashed with youngsters in the French capital Friday [25 March]  when tens of thousands of students marched to demand the  withdrawal of a government cut-price jobs plan for young people.    Several hundred youths outside the peaceful main body of the  march threw rocks and stones at police who retaliated with baton  charges, making a number of arrests. Five officers were injured.    Interior Minister Charles Pasqua called in 3,300 riot police  after predicting there would be "1,000 trouble-makers" hidden  among the peaceful protestors.    Thousands of young people also turned out in provincial  cities across the country, after serious unrest in the western  cities of Nantes and Rennes overnight.    In Lyon, eastern France, about 10,000 young people rallied,  there were 4,000 at Besancon and 2,000 at Perpignan in the  south-west.    In Nantes another demonstration began Friday after clashes  overnight between hundreds of student militants and police for  the third time in a week. Thirty police, a television cameraman  and at least two demonstrators were injured, authorities said.  Twenty-two arrests were made.    In Rennes, youths hurled rocks and bottles at police who  riposted with tear gas for two hours early on Friday. Six  police and one youth were injured and 11 people were arrested.    In Paris, students organised their own system of guards to  prevent vandalism and fighting. Shopkeepers rolled down their  steel shutters and the authorities closed down metro stations on  the route.    A group of 50 "white helmets" were there to monitor police  behaviour and the way any arrests were made, a spokesman said.  The group was wearing white caps.    Student anger over the government plan has been heightened  by  uncertainty about their future in a country that has 3.3 million  unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom  more than 750,000 are under 25.    The plan states that young people with diplomas or  university  degrees may be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80  percent of working time, with 20 percent of training.    Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study  and  trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older  workers and replacing them with poorly-paid youths.</p>

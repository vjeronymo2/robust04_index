			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karlygash Yezhenova: "Grain Producers Who Have </F> Completed Mandatory Deliveries May Dispose of the Remainder as  They See Fit"]    [Text] Republic Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko has  signed the Decree on the Sale at Commodities Exchanges of the  Kazakhstan Republic of Permits Affording the Right of Grain  Export Shipments in 1994.    According to the document, the republic's Ministry for  Foreign Economic Relations is given the right to conduct  auctions at the International Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial  Exchange for the sale of permits to participate in the  implementation of intergovernmental agreements for grain export  shipments during the current year: 3,000 tonnes to Uzbekistan,  500 tonnes each to Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Iran, 360 tonnes to  Tajikistan, 150 tonnes to Moldova, and 50 tonnes to Turkmenistan.    Permitted to participate in the auctions are economic  entities that have presented contracts for grain shipments from  the 1993 crop net surplus as of 1 September 1994, and as of 1  November 1994, from the current year's crop under the condition  of priority fulfillment of contracts for grain sales to meet  state needs. All contracts must undergo preliminary expert  review by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Grains  exported in accordance with intergovernmental agreements are not  subject to customs duty. Grain exports through barter  arrangement are permissible.    Anatoliy Savelov, deputy chief of the Department for  Economic  Policy of the republic Cabinet of Ministers, provided the  following comments on the decree:    "In 1994, in contrast to previous years, a new, unified  procedure was established for selling grain to entities outside  Kazakhstan. Grain sales of the 1993 and 1994 crops will be  effected in three directions: mandatory grain sales to meet  state needs, grain shipments in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements, and sales of other net surpluses  of grain.    "Mandatory grain deliveries to meet state needs are effected  in accordance with the Decree of the Kazakhstan Republic Cabinet  of Ministers on Purchases and Shipments of Agricultural Output  for State Needs in 1994. According to the decree, the total  volume of mandatory grain deliveries to the state is 7 million  tonnes. This volume is divided among the 17 republic oblasts. In  this regard, it is stipulated that the directors of ministries,  associations, joint-stock companies, and other republic  organizations entrusted with functions as state clients, as well  as the heads of oblast and rayon administrations, are  responsible for the placement and fulfillment of orders for  grain purchases and deliveries for state needs in the full  amount and of suitable quality.    "Grain producers who have completed their mandatory  deliveries may dispose of the remaining grain as they see fit,  including exporting it.    "Rural producers have two ways of doing this.    "The first is to sell the grain through Kazakhstan's  fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. Here the Ministry  for Foreign Economic Relations conducts auctions at the  Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial Exchange in the sale of permits for  the right to effect export shipments of grain in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements. Obtaining a license in this manner  affords the following benefits: exemption from customs duty of  the entire volume of grain to be shipped, and first-priority  issue of serviceable, covered freight cars for grain shipment.    "The second method consists of nonauction sale for export to  any country of grain net surpluses for either the currency of  this country or through barter arrangement, at the grain  producer's discretion.    "In this event, the grain producer, or other economic  intermediary selected by the producer to sell its grain  surpluses, purchases export permits that are sold by oblast  organs of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations at  regional commodities exchanges.    "An economic entity is obliged to present a contract for the  grain shipment, including a shipment through barter arrangement,  to the oblast organ of the Ministry for Foreign Economic  Relations for its expert review. It must than obtain a license  and register the contract in question at the regional  commodities exchange.    "In all cases except mandatory deliveries for state needs,  grain sales must be effected prior to 1 September 1994 for sales  from the remainder of last year's crop, and after 1 November for  sales from the 1994 crop.    "The mandatory expert review of contracts is established  with  the aim of preventing grain shipments at dumping prices."</p>

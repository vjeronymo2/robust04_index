			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RITES SCHEDULED TODAY FOR PLANE CRASH VICTIM BARBARA GELLMAN  </P> <P> Services will be held today for Barbara L. Gellman, who died when her  twin-engine plane crashed into a fog-covered ridge Monday in Alameda County.  </P> <P> Although a positive identification is pending, "there's no doubt who it was,"  said Irwin F. Gellman, her husband. "I wish there were. It was her plane. The  only person who flew my wife's plane was my wife."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot of the  Cessna was warned three times that she was flying too low. The plane  disappeared from the radar screen of air traffic controllers and crashed at  11:25 a.m., Alameda County Deputy Sheriff Louis Lozano Jr. said. The FAA is  investigating the crash. "Why she was flying too low, I don't know," Irwin  Gellman said. "She was a very careful pilot."  </P> <P> Barbara Gellman was traveling from John Wayne Airport to Oakland to meet a  publicist to discuss details of a round-the-world trip she planned in her  plane, which she hoped would set records.  </P> <P> While flying was her hobby, Mrs. Gellman, 43, practiced law and was owner of  VIP Properties Inc., a real estate firm. She lectured nationally on real estate  law and syndication.  </P> <P> Born on Oct. 5, 1945, in Baltimore, she grew up in New Jersey, where she  attended Dwight School for Girls. She graduated from Indiana University and  attended Georgetown University Law School and George Washington University in  Washington.  </P> <P> She worked as an assistant attorney general with the state of Maryland before  moving to Newport Beach with her family in 1977. She was active in the League  of Women Voters and the Master Chorale of Orange County.  </P> <P> A chapel service will be held today at Pacific View Memorial Park, 3500 Pacific  View Drive, Newport Beach. The funeral will be at 2 p.m. Friday at the Harbor  Christian Church of Newport Beach, 2401 Irvine Ave.  </P> <P> Barbara Gellman is also survived by her children Susan, 16, Scott, 12, and  Charles, 10; her father, Horace Schwerin, and brother, Bruce Schwerin, both of  New Jersey.  </P></p>

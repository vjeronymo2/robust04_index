Kuptsov, by Erik Kotlyar, under rubric </F> "Law and Order": "First Interview With New MUR Chief, Exclusive  for SK Readers"]    [Text] It is no secret that the fight against crime  is spinning its wheels. Accusations leveled at the militia are  heard on all sides. People say that the fight is being waged  poorly, that officials are being bought and sold, and that  criminals are being coddled and retrained as chastisers. And the  fight is being increasingly drawn into political games that are  well seasoned with payoffs. There really is no fight at all! Are  these reproaches justified? Basically, unfortunately, yes, they  are! For the most part, such facts have been confirmed. But  there are a few things that are frequently forgotten in the heat  of the polemics. The structure of the militia includes criminal  investigation and prosecution services for which the elimination  of the criminal segment is their direct duty! If society rejects  that purpose, then those services are no longer needed and  should simply be abolished or transformed into something else.  But they do exist, and it is incorrect to say that the fight  against crime has been completely stopped. It is another matter  that the results have become the wrong ones! And that the  services are up to their ears in debt to the taxpayers.    Why is this happening? There are several reasons. The  main one is that the social environment and the modern economic  order are engendering and multiplying crime in the way that  dampness gives rise to mold. The rates of its multiplication are  greatly outstripping the development of those militia agencies  whose functions include the putting up of resistance to the  criminal forces (unlike the rates of formation of detachments  for the protection of law and order). As of today, the criminal  militia has not gone far in its development from the number of  personnel in the old times, when the situation was more normal  and it was possible to walk along the streets in Moscow at  night, arm in arm with one's girl friend. A second reason is the  fact that the highest echelon of authority has been corrupted.  Frequently that echelon sympathetically supports the criminal  element for their mutual advantage. The third reason is the  frustration of a society that has been shaken by the  unprecedented boldness with which the criminal world is invading  the customary way of life. And, finally, the last reason: the  frustration of the militia itself, which has become accustomed  to operating, like every other line service, in accordance with  a command from above. Fewer and fewer of these commands are  coming in. But, under conditions of the political instability  and confusion, it is simply impossible to operate at one's own  risk. There have been attempts to assume responsibility in  individual instances, but that did not lead to anything good.  Several times the "authorities," restrained by the desperate  risk of protectors of law and order, allowed themselves to get  under the so-called "pledge," by issuing threats to the  operational agents and their families. You have to agree that it  is a lesson that people remember! It is truly a "golden age" for  all kinds of rogues!    Of course, among the militia men there have arisen  doubts and, in accordance with the customary tradition (and, one  should not forget, we all have emerged from the Soviet  authority), searches for the extreme began. Why is it important  to find the guilty person? Because everyone has bosses, and, as  everyone knows, those bosses never want to share with anyone the  responsibility for what is happening! Their task is to analyze  the situation and punish people! "If you get money (but I  don't), you'll have to answer!"    It is no wonder that, with this kind of disjointed  resolution of a very serious question, the only thing that we  have today is the constant rotation of personnel among the  militia professionals, in the hope that the new employee will be  luckier than his predecessor. In one of the statements made in  the State Duma it was stated that workers who have distinguished  themselves are deliberately removed from the law-enforcement  system! But this is a special question, and it should be  analyzed in a special study...    It is a fact that today the reason for removing a  militia employee can be not only his poor performance in the  precinct, but also his failure to develop the proper on-the-job  interrelationships. Observing all of this, we are most troubled  that the person sitting in the chair behind the control panel in  the fight against crime is not the latest in a series of heating  specialists. Let me hasten to assure the readers that this has  not happened. The person who replaced Yu. Fedoseyev at MUR  [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department] was his deputy, a  person with a long biography in the militia, who, even in the  past, frequently executed the direct duties of the UGRO  [criminal investigation] chief -- Vasiliy Nikolayevich  Kuptsov.    The 42-year-old militia colonel is as erect as an  athlete and is meager in his words and gestures. He actually  does have behind him a difficult path from an ordinary militia  man in 1974 to responsible positions in which the only person  who can work successfully is one who has had good experience and  who enjoys authority among his comrades. V. Kuptsov meets all  these criteria. He graduated from militia school, and then a  branch of the RF [Russian Federation] MVD Academy. He worked "on  the ground" as an operational agent in a militia department, and  was also a department chief, senior operational agent for  especially important criminal-investigation cases, the first  deputy RUVD chief, deputy chief of BKhSS [Combatting the  Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation], and, over a  considerable period of time, MUR deputy chief. He is very  knowledgeable about operational work, and, most importantly,  makes a sober evaluation of the real order of things. The hopes  of Moscow's criminals that they will have an easy life with the  arrival of the new MUR chief are apparently in vain. One would  certainly want to believe and hope that this is so!    [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you arrived in the job of  MUR  chief at what is probably not the most favorable time. All the  barriers are shaking under the onrush of crime. Do you have your  own concept or will you develop MUR's traditional work practices?    [Kuptsov] I have been working at MUR long enough to assert  that the experience and traditions of the city's investigation  administration are unique. They took years to form, and every  administrator made his own contribution; of course, every one  who bears responsibility for the assigned job has his own  approach to those tasks. It is important that the basis of his  job should be the practical considerations in accordance with  the requirements of the time. Because crime changes very  quickly, and failing to take those changes into consideration in  operational work would be a big mistake! With the development of  privatization there appeared new methods of taking personal  savings away from private individuals with the help of various  swindles. We have introduced certain functional and structural  changes in the administration's work in order to specialize  individual links in criminal investigation specifically in those  types of crimes. The situation is exactly the same in the area  of crimes against property. The concepts of private and state  property are identically high-priority in the legal sense.  Correspondingly there must be a change in the level of  professionalism in the departments that are engaged in the  uncovering of crimes against all types of property, including  private and personal. Incidentally, for the period of transition  to market relations this is of great political importance.    Take, for example, such a type of crime as explosions.  Previously such unusual cases used to be investigated by us in  the general work flow. But currently a new type of crime has  turned into an entire "branch" that has acquired its own  specialists and underground industry. Consequently, MUR also  needs a department in which the trained operational agents can  make an educated evaluation and analyze each occurrence. That  is, life forces us to carry out a kind of "modernization" of  investigation as applicable to the "technology" of crime.    The same thing can be said about the discovery of illegally  acquired weapons. Everyone is well aware of how those weapons  are used. Frequently the people who perish are completely  innocent individuals who just happened to be at the scene of the  crime. Previously this phenomenon was viewed as a part of the  overall picture involving the crime that had been committed.  Currently we want to achieve the intensification of  investigation work to such a degree that the guns can be taken  out of illegal circulation even before they can be fired! In  order to do that, it will be necessary right now to have our  employees specialize. One important circumstance is that the  employees for the new types of work are selected strictly on the  basis of their on-the- job qualities. Other considerations are  categorically precluded. We take a very thrifty approach to the  personnel makeup that has developed at MUR and the city's  criminal investigation department.    [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you have mentioned MUR's  historic heritage. In those departments that will be affected by  the respecialization, won't the important experience and skills  that were previously accumulated be lost?    [Kuptsov] I can put your mind at ease. MUR will not part  with  anything beneficial that it has in its arsenal.    [Kotlyar] MUR was constantly understaffed -- something like  approximately 300 persons in the operational complement. How do  you propose to fill in that personnel gap? The complication lies  in the fact that the payment for the labor performed in the  various militia services is definitely not equal, and criminal  investigation in the table of organization is viewed not in the  most favorable light.    [Kuptsov] There really is a problem here. Many people are  more eager to go to the new services where the pay is better.  But the people who come to MUR are the romantics, who are seized  and attracted by our unusual job. I hardly think that there is  anywhere else that an enthusiast would be able to graduate from  the kind of school for detective service that we have in our  subdivisions. We have had good experience in training junior  operational agents. They learn the science of investigating from  start to finish in our system. From the operational agents we  create reserves for promotion. The most capable employees who  have reached the level of skill must definitely have growth  prospects. The young ambitious person must be assured that if he  works well, he will definitely by singled out and will be  trained for promotion. I am convinced that this kind of worker  will open up his capabilities even more in his next assignment.  We have certain administrators who like to "hide" their valuable  workers and keep them for themselves. That is a vicious  practice. It leads to a situation in which, in the final  analysis, we are deprived of the people whom we need. For our  work it is not just enough to have education. It is also  mandatory to do some work "on the ground," where it is necessary  to carry out directly the dirty work with criminals. Only then  will a person reveal his on-the-job qualities and his  understanding of how it is necessary to act in various  situations. Those who travel the entire path from the initial  cell in criminal investigation at a militia station, then  through the okrug links, and then gradually rise to the city  administration, are in my opinion people who have substantial  qualification. For them there are no secrets: they become easily  oriented, like highly trained professionals. Unfortunately, in  our service it sometimes happens that workers in the  administration make disdainful comments about those who are  working in the initial investigation teams. And the opposite  situation also occurs. Both groups of people are mistaken. It is  necessary to have worked at all levels in order to become a  full-fledged detective or operational agent.    As for the unequal payment for their labor, this question, I  am convinced, will be resolved properly! In the final analysis  we will achieve a situation in which steady collectives of like-  minded individuals who are devoted to their city and its  inhabitants will form gradually at MUR and the city's criminal  investigation links.    [Kotlyar] MUR employs slightly more than 300 people, and the  number of workers in criminal investigation for the city as a  whole is 4000. Have you developed a methodology for interaction  among all the parts of what would seem to be, on the whole, a  rather large detachment of people?    [Kuptsov] Your question is very correct. The bulk of the  work  must be conducted only where the crime has been committed. We  are already taking steps to guarantee the coordination of all  our subdivisions. Here, as you have correctly noted, we used to  make a strategic miscalculation. Without the mobile attraction  of all the city's personnel, it will be impossible to resolve  the crime problem, even if we increase the MUR apparatus to  3000! But the share of the central investigation department will  be a few more uncovered cases! But that will not provide much  until we achieve a situation in which all the crimes will be  identified at the place where they were committed. Another  question is that it is impossible to require the okrug  departments and stations to uncover all the crimes, irrespective  of the type of complexity. For example, murders by hire -- for  work like that we simply do not have enough manpower or  informational support. In that instance their share will be the  execution of the overall algorithm for actions -- the processing  of the housing sector, investigation of the scene of the crime,  etc. Such cases are within the competency of the city  administration, and we have opportunities to uncover them.  Although much also depends here upon the corpus delicti and its  complexity. Many crimes are within the capabilities of  specialists from the okrug criminal- investigation links. In  this respect all the city administrations and departments have  been given guidelines concerning what types of crimes should be  uncovered at their level. There must be no formal check-list  approach here -- not worrying about whether or not it is within  your capabilities, but just do it for the sake of the record,  and that's all there is to it! I think that, with the passage of  time, it might even be possible to reduce the apparatus in the  city administration, by transferring some of the employees to  the okrugs. MUR will retain the functions of providing  consultative and methodological guidance and of monitoring the  actions of the city's services, and, of course, the work  involving especially important and dangerous cases.    [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, have you noted any precise  delimitations in the area of the work between MUR and RUOP? We  sometimes hear people saying, "This is our job, but that  isn't..."    [Kuptsov] The concept of "our job or not our job" does not  exist. For Muscovites there is only a single concept -- the city  militia. And for the victim it is a matter of complete  indifference as to whether the person who came to his assistance  is a MUR or RUOP operative. The most important thing is the  final result. As for our internal evaluations, I think that, in  the interests of the overall job for which we all are  responsible, it is necessary to construct the work on principles  of good interaction and mutual understanding, rendering  assistance to one another in the name of our common goal. Then  the results will become obvious, and Muscovites will truly feel  that they are getting real assistance!    [Kotlyar] MUR has a good rule: preserve the, as it were,  "money- box of experience." That money-box used to be  represented by a consultative group made up of MUR veterans.  Others who are being called upon are former administration  chiefs from wartime and the postwar period and major  investigative specialists who retired for reasons of age, but  who are completely capable. Will this undertaking -- which is,  in our day, a rare and beneficial one -- be preserved in the  future?    [Kuptsov] Not only will it be preserved, but it will also be  multiplied. These people are the militia's "gold fund." Their  experience is invaluable. For young detectives they are not only  help, but also a personal example in behavior and attitude to  the job. Therefore we shall expand the group of our unique  specialists: their knowledge and work habits are an important  contribution to the administration's work.    [Kotlyar] During the short period of time in which you have  been heading MUR, have you encountered any difficult situations?    [Kuptsov] Maybe you should have asked me whether I have had  a  free moment recently. All you have to do is to glance at the  summary. Every day there are dozens of corpses, violent  incidents, attacks... The impression is that we are working in a  frontline city! The tension has remained unchanged. But I would  like to direct your attention to something. We have enough  manpower and enough intellect, but nevertheless the elimination  of crime is a comprehensive problem. Here it is necessary for  everyone to participate identically -- the manpower of the  procurator's office, the city authorities, and, most  importantly, the public, without which it would be impossible to  cope with the city's woes! Recently there has been a sense of a  certain loss of enthusiasm, or maybe a certain disappointment.  That's bad. I would like to take advantage of the opportunity  provided to me to make a statement in your esteemed newspaper,  and to call upon all the healthy forces in Moscow to render all  the assistance that they can to the militia, to be more  attentive to everything that is happening around them, and not  to avoid interacting with the internal-affairs agencies if such  interaction is required. I also state confidently, on behalf of  my comrades, that the people at MUR are well aware that the  basic weight and responsibility for preventing and uncovering  crimes lie on the shoulders of the militia.    [Kotlyar] Thank you, Vasiliy Nikolayevich, for having this  conversation with me. Please allow me to wish you success in  your job, which is a very familiar one for you but which is very  difficult today!</p>

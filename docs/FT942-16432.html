			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Nato's air onslaught risks alienating diplomatic ally By using one of the most powerful military weapons at its disposal - air power - the west has run the risk of throwing away one of its most powerful diplomatic weapons: a united front at the UN Security Council. The Nato air strikes will test to the very limit the common front between the west and Russia, which has transformed international diplomacy and given new teeth to the United Nations since the collapse of the Soviet Union. As one of the Security Council's permanent members, Russia is a party to all the resolutions which the west has invoked in justification of its action against the Bosnian Serbs. But Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister who represents the most liberal and pro-western part of the country's political spectrum, has often called into question whether these resolutions give Nato absolute freedom to launch attacks. Yesterday's action will echo loudly in Russia, where any sign that Moscow is cast in the role of lapdog to the west will provide the hardline opposition with a new stick with which to beat President Boris Yeltsin. In recent months western officials have been astonished by the trenchancy with which Russia has demarcated its perceived interests across a whole range of foreign policy issues: from respect for the rights of Russian-speakers abroad to the question of access to foreign markets for its arms industry. The US was surprised and initially dismayed by the firmness and skill of Russian diplomacy in February, when Moscow simultaneously protected and reined in its traditional allies by sending peacekeepers to the Serb sector of Sarajevo. Paradoxically enough, the resurgence of the old adversarial relationship between the 'superpowers' - with each side having clearly defined interests  -brought a new dynamism to the Bosnian peacekeeping effort. Mr Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the envoys of Washington and Moscow respectively, established a close working relationship that paved the way for a ground-breaking deal between Croats and Moslems on establishing a federation. But the involvement of the US and Russia on opposite sides has also raised the stakes in the conflict. In a state of affairs that is all too reminiscent of the cold war period, the Bosnian war is now a 'regional conflict' whose status unavoidably affects the wider relationship between the great powers. If the Yeltsin administration feels politically secure enough to make a cool judgment of its own strategic interests, it will not turn Bosnia into a make-or-break issue in its relations with the west. As some Russian nationalists will grudgingly concede, Moscow has far more at stake in managing its relations with Germany - the traditional friend of the Croats - than in shoring up, at any cost, a friendship with a small and unpredictable ally. A heavy-handed intervention in support of the Serbs and against the Moslems could also threaten the internal stability of Russia, which has at least 10m Moslem citizens of its own - from the independence-minded enclave of Tatarstan to the warrior nations of the northern Caucasus. However, opposition to the idea of punitive action against the Serbs runs across a wide political spectrum in Russia, and all factions in the Russian parliament can now be expected to redouble their campaign to end the country's participation in sanctions against Belgrade. Friendship with Serbia is a rallying cry for old-guard communists, for the maverick nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and for traditional Russian patriots who recall their country's role in liberating the Serbs from Ottoman rule in the 19th century. The wilder fringes of Serb nationalism provoke almost as much exasperation in Moscow as they do in the west. But Russia, in its newly self-confident form, cannot expose itself to the risk of diplomatic humiliation. In February, Russia was able, by some subtle diplomatic footwork, to raise its profile in Bosnia and score a diplomatic triumph, at the very time when the Serbian cause looked doomed to a humiliating reverse. Even more skill will be needed now to shore up Russian prestige, without damaging its broader strategic interests or upsetting the country's internal political balance.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent awaits news from the US Continental Europe spent the day worrying about a possible rise today in US interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff. Goldman Sachs yesterday trimmed its exposure to Europe but said that it maintained an overweight position, 'because short-term rates should fall by more than elsewhere (and by more than money market futures imply) and retail inflows into equities are running at healthy levels'. More specifically, Goldman's upgraded Finland, based on good recent earnings announcements, and reduced the weighting of France slightly, 'given that any decoupling from the Bundesbank seems unlikely for several months, and the risks of social discontent are rising'. FRANKFURT fell in line with weakness in the bund market, the DAX index closing off 24.33 or 1 per cent at 2,131,28. Turnover was relatively light at DM7.6bn. The market remained cautious with few participants prepared to come in ahead of today's expected news from the US. Corporate news was highlighted by Hypo Bank, which resisted steeper declines seen elsewhere to end the session off DM2.50 at DM467.50. The bank said that it would lift its 1993 dividend by DM1.50 to DM14.50 after reporting an increase of 33 per cent in group operating profit. Porsche, down DM15 at DM895, held few surprises as it reported 6 month figures, with most of the news having already been discounted. PARIS picked up a little of the day's losses in the last moments of trading. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a session low of 2,193.81, ended the session off 18.65 or 0.8 per cent at 2,202.69. Turnover was slack at around FFr3bn. After the market closed Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, was reported on wire services as saying that there was still room for further interest rate cuts in Europe. General activity was moderate with UAP rising against the trend, adding 90 centimes to FFr189.90, ahead of results due out after the close. The insurer reported a rise in net attributable profit to FFr1.5bn from FFr1bn. St Gobain, down FFr16 at FFr672, was affected, said dealers, by arbitrage between the shares and warrants as the subscription period for the rights issue closed. MILAN was unsettled by interest rates and next weekend's general election and the Comit index fell 9.51 or 1.4 per cent to 665.02. CS First Boston recommended taking profits on the basis of the market's outperformance during the last two months when the Comit index rose by more than 9 per cent; the fact that the Italian bond market had fallen more than other European bond markets while the equity market had outperformed, implying that relative valuations had deteriorated; and a possible consolidation after the general election. Merrill Lynch commented that political uncertainty compounded the problems of a market that appeared to be among the most expensive in Europe on the basis of earnings prospects. The investment bank added that liquidity might push the market still higher but it believed the situation was too risky to take an aggressive position until the policies of the next government were clearer. Italcable fell L475 or 4.4 per cent to L10,268 as investors demonstrated their disappointment with the weekend deal to merge five telephone operating companies into a single Telecom Italia. Sip slipped L18 to L4,351 after its announcement of a 42.8 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, while Stet, the holding company, eased L15 to L4,877. Cogefar fell L93 or 4.9 per cent to L1,799 in arbitrage trade linked to the rights issue. ZURICH was lower, in line with other bourses and bond markets elsewhere in Europe, and the SMI index fell 39.2 to 2,804.3. Interest rate sensitive issues were the hardest hit with UBS bearers losing SFr31 or 2.5 per cent to SFr1,195. Recently favoured cyclicals were resilient with Alusuisse adding SFr7 to SFr654. WARSAW plunged 8.8 per cent as small investors, losing their patience with the recent stagnant market, rushed to unload shares. The all-share Wig index fell 1,777.1 to 18,414.2, but volume was a thin 969,000 shares.

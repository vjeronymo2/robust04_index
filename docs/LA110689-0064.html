			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Curt Lindstrom, former Swedish national hockey coach, said he isn't surprised  by Soviet star Igor Larionov's allegations that Soviet players used drugs at  the 1986 World Championships in Moscow.  </P> <P> "The Soviets should receive a retroactive disqualification if it could be  proved. But, of course, it will very hard to prove it now," said Lindstrom,  whose Swedish team lost the gold medal game, 3-2, to the Soviets more than  three years ago.  </P> <P> Larionov, now playing with the NHL Vancouver Canucks, claimed in a new book  that the Soviet players and laboratory workers conspired to deceive drug  testers at the 1986 Championships by hiding urine specimens behind toilets.  </P></p>

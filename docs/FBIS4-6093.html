			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe was apparently having second thoughts Monday [18  April] about his plan to split from the Liberal Democratic Party  now that his bid for the premiership seems unlikely to succeed,  political sources said. Watanabe is backpedaling as the ruling  coalition is seen more in favor of naming Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata as successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, the sources said.    In a meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, Watanabe said,  "I  understand your feelings, so please give me a little bit more  time to think this issue over," an LDP official said.    Watanabe, 70, also admitted to wavering over whether to  split  from the LDP, citing major differences with the ruling coalition  over security issues. He heads the LDP's third largest faction.    He said, "I can tie up with the Japan New Party whose  policies do not differ from ours. If I had the courage to leave  and cooperate with such parties as Komeito, which took a big  step forward in approving a policy to join UN peacekeeping  forces, I would end up pursuing the same policies as the Liberal  Democratic Party."    Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying,  "Unless  the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political  forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use."    "Let us do our utmost to strip the coalition of its power by  criticizing its policy contradictions and inconsistencies, while  seeking public understanding of LDP policies," Kono said. Kono  was apparently referring to coalition differences over a plan to  hike the rate of consumption tax later this year and to map out  the specifics of contingency plans to respond to UN Security  Council resolutions to slap sanctions on North Korea over its  alleged nuclear arms program, the sources said.    Coalition deputies banded together Monday afternoon to  discuss their differences on these issues as a prerequisite to  agreeing to launch a fresh coalition government to be led by  Hata.    The deputies aimed to eliminate gaps over a proposed policy  platform document whose adoption would mandate instituting a tax  system with greater emphasis on indirect taxes and accepting  possibly tough UN resolutions to penalize North Korea for its  refusal to accept full checkups of its nuclear facilities.    Watanabe expressed his intention Sunday to quit the largest  opposition party in a bid to seek the premiership with the  backing of his own faction and some potential supporters in the  coalition.    Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election to  nominate the head of government as his party's official  candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop his ambitions for  the premiership, but Watanabe turned down the request.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party,  the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said Monday he  is opposed to nominating Watanabe as the coalition's candidate  for the premiership, party officials said. Murayama also  expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited even to join the  next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime minister, they  said.    So far, only about 20 LDP members are expected to quit and  follow their boss if he decides to leave.    Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who  voiced support for Watanabe's bid for the premiership left the  party on Monday. These rebels -- Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto,  Shizuo Sato, Koji Kakizawa and Shokei Arai -- are the members of  the former LDP policy study group, called the "Liberals."    They were followed by another LDP lower house member, Kenji  Kosaka, who said he will join Shinseito, a key party in the  coalition.    Another group of five LDP renegades -- led by Michihiko  Kano,  former director general of the Management and Coordination  Agency -- on Monday formed a new party called the New Party  Mirai (Future). Kano hinted at his readiness to vote for Hata in  the Diet vote.    Fumihiko Igarashi and two other Japan New Party legislators  told reporters they decided to quit the party and become  independents.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bag"-signed report: "Eastern Towns Invest Twice as Much </F> as Western Towns"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- In 1995, east German municipalities  will invest about twice as much per inhabitant as their western  counterparts. Despite substantial reductions in personnel  levels, personnel costs will remain the main problems for  municipality financial departments. Municipalities in the east  employ 370 full-time employees for every 10,000 inhabitants  compared to just 136 in the west.    According to a study conducted by the Institute for the  German Economy [IW] published in IW-TRENDS, revenue in the  eastern municipalities will rise by an annual average of 6.5  percent and will thus increase more substantially than  expenditure, which will grow by 4 percent. This means that the  deficit will fall from 5.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM3  billion.    Compared to the west, the revenue and expenditure of the  municipalities in the east will grow substantially faster:  Between 1991 and 1993, revenue in the east rose by an annual  average of 10 percent and by 6.5 percent in the west. On the  expenditure side, the ratio was 17 percent to 7.5 percent.    There is a substantial difference between the structure of  municipal finance in the east and in the west. In the old  laender, tax revenues account for barely 40 percent of the  budgets. In the east, they account for just 5 percent.  Alongside the collapse of production and the extremely high  level of unemployment, the sum of DM600 free of income tax is  also a factor. In addition, the tax on business assets will not  be levied until the end of 1995.    Starting from a low level, tax revenue rose as a result of  substantial increases in wages and salaries. In 1993, it  amounted to DM5 billion, which is twice as much as in 1991, and  thus accounted for a good 9 percent of expenditure. The IW  assumes that in 1995, the share will be 11 percent.    The second direct source of revenue, municipal charges,  contributed more to municipal budgets than taxes (4.9 percent).  In 1995, the ratio should be 9 percent to 11 percent, according  to the IW. The explanation for the relatively low revenue from  charges -- in municipalities in the west, it estimated that  charges will account for 15 percent of revenue in 1995 -- in  those in the east, some charges are not collected, such as those  for sewage treatment and street cleaning. About half the  revenue from charges in the east is used for kindergartens and  nursing homes.    The low level of self-financing capacity on the part of east  German municipalities makes it clear that they are dependent on  being allotted funds at the federal and laender levels and from  the German Unity Fund. The latter will cease at the end of this  year, but allotments for specific purposes and assistance with  debts will increase at the same time. Compared to 1991, the  revenues from taxes and charges will only rise by 8.6 percentage  points to 20 percent of overall revenue. That will represent an  improvement in financial capacity, but "not to an adequate  degree," says the IW.    In 1991, municipal revenue per inhabitant reached 96 percent  of the level in the west and will be somewhat higher than in the  west in 1995: DM3,898 in the east compared to DM3,534 in the  west. Expenditure has evolved in a similar direction. In 1991,  personal and materials expenditure as well as investment were  slightly above the western level, whereas interest rates and  social services were markedly below it. According to the IW,  the last two elements will be closer to western levels by the  end of 1995. In the case of per capita expenditure on  personnel, there will be a slight increase in the gap with the  west and a substantial one in the case of investment.    According to the IW, "only slight progress" is being made in  reducing personnel. Towns without administrative subdistricts  "only" reduced personnel by 18 percent between the middle of  1992 and the middle of 1993, and those with administrative  subunits reduced personnel by 30 percent during the same period.  Only "forced reductions" can create more room for maneuver for  self-financed investment.    The continued increase in investment is striking. The IW  estimates that in 1995, the eastern municipalities will invest  twice as much as their western counterparts. In 1993, local  communities financed 13.4 percent of all investment in the new  laender, whereas the figure in the west was only 7.9 percent.    The rapid increase in debt on the part of eastern  municipalities has led to a situation in which per capita  interest payments have increased by a factor of 10 between 1991  and 1995. The per capita level of debt is DM1,406. It is true  that it is only half the level in the west, but in 1991, eastern  municipalities had practically no debts at all, the institute  stressed.</p>

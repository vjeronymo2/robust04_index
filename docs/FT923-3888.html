			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Tsongas puts deficit in centre A HIGH-PROFILE campaign to place the federal budget deficit at the centre of the US political agenda is being launched next Monday by an influential cross-party group of politicians, led by defeated Democratic presidential contender Mr Paul Tsongas. This Concord Coalition will be unveiled in New York by Mr Tsongas and Republican Senator Warren Rudman, both of whom have made a demand for candour over US economic problems a central plank of their political platforms. By working on public disaffection, it aims to force President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, to focus during the election campaign on the deficit, on welfare entitlements and on strategies to encourage investment. It also intends to keep trying to mobilise support and pressing the successful candidate on the same issues after the poll in November. 'This is an attempt to bring together those people who believe that more of the same isn't going to work,' Mr Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, said in an interview in London with the Financial Times. 'We think there will be a role for us whoever's president; and whoever's president is going to find us very irritating.' The Concord Coalition (after Concord, Massachusetts, where the first shot was fired in the US War of Independence), also includes Mr Peter Peterson, a Republican and former commerce secretary, and Mr Lloyd Cutler, the Washington lawyer who was President Jimmy Carter's White House counsel. It will not advance specific policy proposals at first. Instead, it will concentrate on carrying forward the baleful campaign message which won Mr Tsongas sizeable support during the presidential primaries this year, underlining the need for Americans to make painful sacrifices so as to return the US to economic health. In addition to the progressive elimination of budget deficits, which he says are sapping the US economy and international strength, Mr Tsongas favours imposing a cap on welfare entitlements and favours increased investment in infrastructure and in education. He is targeting the educated young, worried business people, and the sometime constituents of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur and quasi-candidate who attracted brief but large support last spring on vague promises to cut the deficit and combat the political establishment. Mr Tsongas's support for Mr Clinton is lukewarm; he is critical of the Democratic candidate's proposals for a tax cut for the middle classes, for example. However, what he says about his own party's candidate pales by comparison with his withering condemnation of Mr Bush since the latter's acceptance speech at the Republican party convention in Houston. This, Mr Tsongas said yesterday, was devoid of substance. 'Bill Clinton will win because there is no rationale for four more years (of Mr Bush).'</p>

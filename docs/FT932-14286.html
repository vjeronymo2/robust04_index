			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private rail plan scrutinised THE government yesterday acknowledged for the first time that it was considering a plan by a private-sector consortium to finance a much-needed Pounds 900m upgrade of the railway line between London Euston, the Midlands and north-west England. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'It's a very exciting idea, and we are discussing with our colleagues in the Treasury how it would work.' The government had also been approached with similar plans for other lines, Mr Freeman said. The scheme under consideration, prompted by the government's recently avowed enthusiasm for attracting private finance into public-sector infrastructure projects, has been proposed by three of Britain's biggest engineering companies: GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty. It would involve the renewal of worn-out tracks, replacement of signalling and overhead electricity supply systems, realignment of curved sections of track to allow faster train speeds, and replacement of some bridges. One option for financing the scheme would be for the consortium to be granted a limited-life concession to operate the line, upgrade it at its own expense, and be paid by the government according to the number of trains using the tracks. The Pounds 900m bill for the project would also cover the purchase of a fleet of trains to be provided by GEC Alsthom. However, Mr Freeman yesterday said this part of the scheme might be funded separately under a Pounds 150m leasing facility awarded to BR in last year's Autumn Statement. Alternatively, the Pounds 150m could be used to lease more Networker commuter trains which could operate on Network SouthEast's Kent Coast and Great Northern routes. Tenders would be invited for both options, Mr Freeman said.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Blair ignores attack by Heseltine Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, launched a wide-ranging attack on Mr Tony Blair's inexperience yesterday, only to be ignored by the Labour leader. As politicians on all sides pondered opinion poll findings that Labour's popularity is declining, Mr Heseltine dismissed Mr Blair as 'irresponsible, young and inexperienced'. Speaking on BBC radio Mr Heseltine added: 'Why should you believe a man who has got all the major judgments wrong in the first half of his life, when he tells you he is going to get them all right in the second half of his life?' He listed adherence to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and opposition to union reform, privatisation, low taxes and low inflation among Blair misjudgements. Labour said that Mr Blair was aware of the attack but had 'not mentioned it to anyone'. Mr Blair yesterday told the first full shadow cabinet meeting since his election in June that private polling for the party supported an ICM poll in the Guardian showing Labour only 12 points ahead of the Conservatives, compared with 21 points in early August. He said the polling evidence reinforced his view that Labour would have to work hard to convert Tory unpopularity into Labour votes at the next election. 'We have a great opportunity to win that election, but we cannot rely on the Tories to win that election for us,' he said. 'We will win by offering the country a clear message, and in particular a clear economic alternative.' Ironically, Mr Heseltine's attack was followed by a cabinet decision to concentrate on positive presentation of government policies rather than attacks on the opposition. After a detailed discussion of its political strategy the cabinet agreed that the focus of this month's party conference should be on promoting the government's achievements and setting out its agenda for the second half of the parliament. Ministers said that the fundamental objective was to restore a sense of stability after two years of almost permanent political turmoil.</p>

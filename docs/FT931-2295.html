			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Markets: Investors in wonderland - Wall Street / The Budget and You THE behaviour of equity investors in the US is looking ever more paradoxical. Consider the following: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is bumping along at near record levels, but economists continue to emphasise the fragility of the US economic recovery. Corporate restructurings - meaning layoffs, asset sales and mergers - are producing improved productivity and profit levels at many US companies, but the buoyant price / earnings ratios of many company stocks seem to have discounted a level of improvement that may not be reached for another 12 to 18 months. The tax-increasing, deficit-reducing budget legislation presented by the Clinton administration was approved on Thursday by the House of Representatives, as was a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) fiscal stimulus package. But the budget could still be watered down in the Senate and in a joint conference between the two chambers of Congress. The recovery of US banks is considered a fait accompli, judging by investor sentiment and share prices, but warnings that the credit crunch is unresolved and that commercial property loans are still a problem are creeping back into the debate. Inflation is not thought to be a serious worry in either the bond or equity markets, but there is a lurking fear of prospective reflation resulting from the Clinton plan. Taken as a group, Wall Street investors appear to be undecided about which way to turn. Almost inevitably the lemmings who constitute the majority are allowing themselves to be pushed and shoved by short-term events and indicators. For example, Thursday's cut in German interest rates triggered a healthy 38.90 point jump in the Dow Jones index. But the short-termers may not recall the underlying rationale for the cut - the deepening recession in the national economy which serves as Europe's economic engine. Wall Street was delighted at the Bundesbank's rate cut, but most investors forgot that many US exporters and multinational companies will find it hard for some time to sell their products into the weakened European market. In the domestic US economy there are other examples of enigmatic investor sentiment. The US car industry is working hard to restructure itself, but all the strong medicine being taken in Detroit seemed to be eclipsed by the angst this week of one man at one US car company - General Motors. The reason was the melodramatic cliffhanger scripted by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the GM man with the allegedly magic touch. Lopez's indecision over whether to stay at GM or to take a top job at Volkswagen (he eventually chose the latter) looked at times like a cross between a Peter Sellers farce and a Samuel Beckett existential mope. The question it should raise for investors is to what extent GM's recovery plan depended on the efforts of one Spanish manager who was only brought to Detroit ten months ago. As for the pharmaceuticals industry, investors can bite their nails along with executives from that sector, who are alternating between states of panic and anger as they gaze at the price-ceiling and other policy options that may be part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care reform package, to be unveiled in early May. The battering taken by several drug stocks implies that what may be good for US society (cheaper health care available to a larger number of poorer people) could be painful for a number of drugs manufacturers.  ---------------------------------------- Monday      3442.41    +    14.59 Tuesday     3442.95    +     0.54 Wednesday   3426.74    -    16.21 Thursday    3465.64    +    38.90 Friday      3471.58    +     5.94  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Booby prize Nicholas Winterton's path into the Aye lobby on Tuesday night is not likely to lead him to a place of honour on the Olympic podium. The VAT-on-fuel rebel has agreed on behalf of the British Olympic Association to launch a private member's bill giving the BOA exclusive rights in Britain over the five-ringed Olympic symbol of the games. Increasingly, the association raises its multi-million pound funds through sponsorship and, not surprisingly, those companies which cough up want guarantees that they have exclusive rights to the logo in the UK. 'Until now we haven't been able to give that assurance because the rings have been in the public domain for a long time,' a BOA spokesman explains. Indeed, he admits, the organisation has quietly had to spend money on buying off companies intent on encroaching on the territory of the official sponsors. However, Winterton drew an unlucky 13 in the ballot for private member's bills; success also depends to a great extent on the popularity of the sponsoring MP. This has already been found wanting. Cancelling plans to address the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance at Westminster yesterday afternoon was one Kenneth Clarke. And guess who's the chairman of this increasingly prominent industry lobby? Right. Nicholas Winterton.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Owners Abroad profits cut to Pounds 5.8m Owners Abroad, the holiday group, yesterday announced 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m, after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs - including its successful defence against a hostile bid from its rival Airtours. This profit compares with Pounds 25.5m the previous year. Mr Francis Baron, appointed chief executive last November, said the company was pressing ahead with plans to reduce head office numbers and change branding strategy. Mr Baron said the restructuring plan, announced last December, would result in a one third reduction in head office staff by May, but the benefits of the branding changes would not show through until 1995. The City welcomed Mr Baron's plans for the group, with the shares rising 20p to close at 120p. The board is cutting the final dividend to 2.1p from 2.52p the previous year, resulting in an unchanged total payment of 3.5p. During its battle last year against Airtours, Owners Abroad said it would increase the full-year dividend by 43 per cent to 5p. Mr Baron said, however, that the group had recommended the dividend 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances' which had subsequently occurred. After the Airtours bid had been rebuffed, the group warned that 1993 profits would be half market expectations. Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger Allard, managing director, subsequently resigned. Mr Baron said it would now be inappropriate to pay an increased dividend. He said Owners Abroad had sufficient confidence in the future to pay a maintained dividend, despite a fall in earnings per share before exceptional items from 11.6p to 5.7p. After exceptional items, the loss per share was 0.6p, compared with a profit of 9.2p the previous year. Mr Baron also said the group planned to increase its 25 per cent holding in International Travel Holdings of Canada to 100 per cent for a consideration which is not expected to be material. ITH made a post-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m last year on turnover of Pounds 229.8m but is now profitable. ITH is the largest travel group in Canada, with a market share of 25 per cent. It specialises in holidays to the southern United States, the Caribbean and Central America. Because of ITH's strong winter market, Mr Baron said it would provide Owners Abroad with profits during its quieter season in the UK. Details, Page 25</p>

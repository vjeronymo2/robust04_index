			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK VOCABULARY  </P> <P> Jonathan Gold's April 21 review of Mind Over Four was an education for me.  </P> <P> First, I learned how to spell the rock guitar sound "NNNGAOOOWWww-wee-wee-wee!"  (But I'll never remember the italics on that first wee.)  </P> <P> And there were so many clever juxtapositions: "crunching riff," "swirlly  Siouxsie drone," "keening wail" (that sent me to the dictionary) and last but  not least, "a pan-tonal Brecht-Weill beat."  </P> <P> Gosh, Gold's writing makes the work of that British critic who, in prehistoric  times, was ridiculed for writing of "Aeolian cadences" in the Beatles' "Things  We Said Today" seem very feeble, indeed.  </P> <P> CHARLES GRIMES, Van Nuys  </P></p>

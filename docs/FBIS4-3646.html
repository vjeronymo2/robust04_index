			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Thousands of Iranian  students from Tehran University this morning held a rally in  front of the UN Office here to raise their strong protest to the  Serbian attacks against moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Shouting "death with the U.S." "death with the Serbians" and  "death with the Russians," the students condemned the occupation  of Gorazde, a UN-declared safe zone for Bosnian Moslems and the  silence of the United Nations toward the Serbian attacks them.    In a resolution read at the rally, the students announced  their readiness to be dispatched as Moslem volunteers to Bosnia  to defend the Bosnian Moslems against Serbian attacks.    They urged the United Nations and international community to  accept Iran's demand to dispatch forces to the balkan republic  as UN peacekeeping forces.    Last year, Iran offered to send 10,000-man forces to Bosnia  under the UN control to protect the Bosnian Moslems, but the  offer was rejected.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati and other officials reiterated Iran's readiness to  dispatch forces after the Moslem city of Gorazde was sieged by  the Serbian forces.    Rafsanjani Tuesday [19 April] made a telephone call to the  Greek prime minister and current chairman of the European Union  (EU), Andreas Papandreou, expressing concern over the tragic  situation in Gorazde.    He criticized the "negligence" of the United Nations toward  violation of the most basic regulations by the serbs in a UN-  declared safe haven.    While the Bosnian Moslems are deprived of having weapons  under the UN Security Council's resolution, the Serbs "are  receiving all types of arms from the neighboring countries,"  Rafsanjani said.    He noted that such situation would "lead the Europe toward  racism and exerting pressure upon ethnic minorities."    Also Tuesday, commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guards  Corps  (IRGC) Mohsen Rezai said that Iran insisted that "the UN  Security Council use volunteer forces from Iran and other  countries to stop the savage massacre of the Moslems."</p>

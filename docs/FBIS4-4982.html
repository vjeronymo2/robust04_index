			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S.-DPRK Dialogue Is a Key To Progress in </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] On 31 March, the UN Security Council [UNSC]  unanimously adopted a presidential statement which urges the  DPRK (North Korea) to accept additional inspections of its  nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and calls on nations concerned to continue dialogue with  the country based on an agreement reached between the United  States and the DPRK on 25 February.    In response, both the United States and South Korea have  reached an agreement to suspend the resumption of their joint  military exercise "Team Spirit."    We have maintained that the suspicion of North Korea's  nuclear development should be solved not through a "north wind"  [hard-line measures] such as economic sanctions but through  negotiations, and that the solution should lead to the  denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and to the  normalization of the whole situation. We would like to highly  appraise the UNSC's rational decision.    We sincerely hope that North Korean leaders will positively  react to the statement and they will accept additional IAEA  inspections to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development.  The international community's prudent stance is an indication  of its hope to resolve the nuclear suspicion through  negotiations. North Korea should not misunderstand this  intention.    Before the statement was issued, the IAEA special Board of  Directors had referred the matter back to the UNSC, claiming  that it failed to confirm that nuclear materials had not been  used for military purposes because its first inspection of seven  North Korean nuclear-related facilities in a year was obstructed.    In response, the United States, the UK, France, and Russia,  which are permanent UNSC members, worked out a draft resolution  which urged North Korea to accept nuclear inspections within one  month and hinted at future economic sanctions against the  country, stating that if North Korea does not comply with the  resolution, "a further step will be taken."    However, China did not change its policy of seeking a  solution through dialogue during recent successive visits to  China by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam. The country has called for a  presidential statement which has less binding power than a  resolution, and 10 nonpermanent UNSC members have agreed with  it. For this reason, it appears that the United States and  other nations have decided to take a course of moderation.    Consideration for North Korea is seen everywhere in the  presidential statement. While it says it is "regrettable" that  the IAEA inspection failed to bring a conclusion to the question  of whether nuclear materials had been transferred to military  weapons, the statement says it has attached "importance" to  North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspection.    The "25 February U.S.-DPRK agreement," to which the  presidential statement especially refers, stipulated  simultaneous implementation of the following: 1) North Korea's  acceptance of inspections of its nuclear facilities; 2)  resumption of South-North dialogue; 3) suspension of "Team  Spirit" military exercise this year; and 4) start of the third  round of the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. However, the United  States later proposed that the IAEA's full inspection of North  Korean nuclear facilities and exchange of special envoys between  the North and the South become a precondition to the start of  the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. North Korea has expressed  opposition to the U.S. proposal.    It is hoped that all the parties concerned will resume their  own dialogue with North korea as soon as possible in line with  the the UNSC presidential statement. Especially, the U.S.-DPRK  negotiation is the key dialogue.    North Korea has promised that if the U.S.-DPRK high-level  talks are held, it will discuss such issues as its complete  return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and  switchover of its nuclear facilities to light water reactors,  together with the issue of normalizing relations between the  United States and the DPRK. Moreover, the country has  maintained: "We have no obligation to accept full inspection of  our nuclear facilities because we have now just suspended the  effectiveness of our declaration of withdrawing from the NPT."    If the United States succeeds to have North Korea return to  the NPT through high-level talks, there will be no grounds for  North Korea to assert such a peculiar logic. The United States  and North Korea should resume their working-level talks  immediately and should make concessions to implement the above  four points at the same time.    Moreover, we hope that China will continue to serve as a  mediator between North Korea and the countries concerned from  now on and it will play a major role in achieving  denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. The real value of the  UNSC presidential statement, which China pushed forward, will be  judged from now on.</p>

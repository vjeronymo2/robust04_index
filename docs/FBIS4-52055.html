			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["World Is Watching U.S. Attitude" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Government in a  Foreign Ministry statement April 28 proposed to the United  States that the two countries hold negotiations for the  establishment of a new peace arrangement which will help to  check arms buildup and recurrence of war, stabilize the  situation and reliably guarantee a durable peace and security on  the Korean peninsula on a practical basis.    How the United States approaches the DPRK's new peace  overture for negotiations will be a touchstone proving whether  it wants peace or war, declares NODONG SINMUN today.    The news analyst says:    It is imperative to replace the armistice agreement with a  peace agreement and set up a new peace arrangement to take the  place of the present armistice mechanism, if the hostile  relations are to be removed and rapprochement is to be achieved  between the DPRK and the USA and genuine peace and security are  to be guaranteed on the Korean peninsula.    The continued acute military confrontation on the Korean  peninsula is attributable to the illegalities and the policy of  antagonizing and stifling the DPRK on the part of the United  States which has wantonly violated the Korean armistice  agreement and paralyzed the armistice mechanism.    If the present state of truce is to be maintained on the  Korean peninsula, the signatories to the armistice agreement  must fulfill their obligations pursuant to the agreement. Over  the period of a little more than four decades, however, the  United States has unilaterally and systematically broken and  violated the provisions of the armistice agreement. Their  violations of it have assumed more grave dimensions these days.    As a matter of fact, the United States disowns the  effectiveness of the agreement and even ignores its existence.    The illegalities of the United States have reduced the  armistice agreement to a mere sheet of paper and deprived it of  the role as an institutional mechanism to prevent the  aggravation of tensions and the danger of war.    Due to the maneuvers of the United States, the armistice  supervisory tool is paralyzed and the armistice mechanism is  incapable of performing its function.    With a view to concealing its violations of the armistice  agreement, the United States unilaterally forced the inspection  teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw  from the U.N. command-controlled area and unilaterally  designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate  of the U.N. Command to the Military Armistice Commission, for  which he is totally unqualified because of legal irrelevance, in  gross violation of the Korean armistice agreement.    The unreasonable behavior of the United States has reduced  the Military Armistice Commission to a de facto nominal and  inoperative body in which its legitimate component parties have  ceased to exist.    We can no longer entertain any expectation of the armistice  agreement and the armistice mechanism, which remain only in name  and are used for covering up the U.S. policy of strangling the  DPRK.    The nuclear issue and other acute problems cannot be settled  on the Korean peninsula as long as there exists the present  armistice arrangement under which the DPRK and the USA remain  hostile parties.    Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is  replaced  with a peace agreement and a new peace arrangement is set up to  take the place of the present armistice mechanism will it be  possible to remove the hostile relations and achieve  reconciliation between the DPRK and the USA and preserve a  genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula.    The United States must clearly see the essence of the  situation and the reality and accede to peace negotiations with  the DPRK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: "Russia-Kazakhstan: Military </F> Cooperation Acquires Treaty Basis"]    [Text] The mass media have been devoting considerable  attention to the subject of Russian-Kazakhstan relations and the  talks process between the two republics. And now this process  has reached summit level. Kazakhstan Republic President  Nursultan Nazarbayev has arrived in Moscow on an official visit.  What can we expect from his meeting with the Russian president?  What interstate agreements do we hope will be signed?    One of the main points of the talks is linked with the fate  of the Baykonur space center, which has very recently become a  bone of contention between Russia and Kazakhstan. As is known,  the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry  attempted to "close" the matter through talks at their level.  And a great deal was done during the preparatory period. But a  definitive solution to the question was only found when the  presidents met. Why?    It has turned out that recently relations between the two  republics have not been developing in the best of ways. Or  rather, not in the way people would like. Let us recall the  differences of view over a unified ruble zone; the future  operation of the Russian missile early warning station at  Balkhash; Baykonur, which we have already mentioned.... On the  one hand these contradictions are explicable. Kazakhstan is  seeking to play a role in the world arena which is more  autonomous and independent of Russia. And it has declared  everything located on its territory to be its own property. But  in terms of the Baykonur space center, let us recall that its  status was defined by an intergovernmental agreement of 2  October 1992. At that time Russia, in the shape of the Defense  Ministry and the Russian Space Agency, committed itself to  provide 94 percent of the funding of Baykonur and Leninsk. In  1993 the Russian Federation spent 47 billion rubles on keeping  these two facilities going. At a time when the Kazakhstan side  was unable to ensure full and prompt payment of the other 6  percent.    Today it is thanks to the Russian Military-Space Forces that  the social sphere operates and spacecraft are launched. The  world famous space facility is financially maintained by Russia.  But do you want to know something interesting? While Russia  was maintaining Baykonur, Kazakhstan was holding talks on how  either the United States or Ukraine might be enticed to lease  it. It was no coincidence that Alma-Ata [Almaty] started by  saying that the 1992 agreement did not match Kazakhstan's  interests. And then came the idea of creating a Baykonur-based  international consortium in which no provision was made for  advantages for Russia not only vis-a-vis the former republics of  the USSR but even in terms of other space powers headed by the  United States. Furthermore, according to an ITAR-TASS report,  some kind of agreement on the joint use of Baykonur was signed  during Nazarbayev's visit to the United States. Although the  details are not being made public, U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry's recent visit to Alma-Ata and Baykonur indirectly  confirmed the two sides' definite joint interest.    As for Russia, it -- and others -- was eventually offered a  lease on the space center, but on what were in fact unacceptable  terms. In terms of both cost -- billions of dollars -- and the  length of the lease. And although the positions of the sides  changed several times in the course of the preliminary talks, a  compromise on the main issue was not found until the last  moment. Nevertheless Russia, as we were told at the press center  of the Russian Federation Military-Space Forces, whose  representatives have participated in the talks process at  various times, is still ready to lease the Baykonur space  center. But not on just any terms.    It is no surprise that as a result of the uncertainty which  has been generated this unique ground complex with a developed  infrastructure has found itself without an owner and is now in a  sorry state. Some of the launch equipment is unusable, some  things have simply been stolen. Lower-story apartment windows  gape blindly....    Nevertheless there has recently been perceptible movement in  the Russian and Kazakhstani positions, facilitated by an active  process of negotiation -- visits by a Russian Federation  delegation to Kazakhstan and by a Kazakhstan delegation to  Moscow. Nor is it possible to disregard the fact that the  Baykonur problem comes into the context of the  military-political and military cooperation treaty between  Russia and Kazakhstan which is being prepared for signing. In  the course of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to  Kazakhstan mutual understanding was reached on Russia's  utilization of some Baykonur facilities to implement  defense-space programs taking account of Kazakhstan's interests.  Including long-term programs, some of which are tied in to  Russian accords with foreign countries and are geared to the  utilization of precisely Baykonur.    The mid-march return visit to Moscow by a Kazakhstan state  delegation headed by Premier Sergey Tereshchenko was also  devoted to seeking compromise. On this occasion talks were held  with members of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet.  The discussions covered military and military-technical  cooperation. the utilization of the Baykonur space center, the  peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, and the deepening of  relations in the field of the economy, science, culture, and  law. That is, the precise questions which are scheduled for  signing [as published] by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan  Nazarbayev and which figure on the agenda for the planned  meeting.    As for nuclear energy problems, the technological situation  at the Mangistauskiy power plant in Kazakhstan is now extremely  unfavorable: Nuclear scientists consider that keeping the  BN-350 reactor at a safe level is problematical. Repair work  and preventive maintenance have been cut back at this,  Kazakhstan's only nuclear power station. And the republic  cannot manage without Russia's help here, or in the future  operation of Baykonur, or in the building of a Kazakhstan  petroleum pipeline to the port of Novorossiysk, or on the  implementation of many other projects. So Kazakhstan and Russia  have a mutual interest in considered and mutually advantageous  solutions in these areas. And likewise, incidentally, in the  matter of creating a unified customs area, a free trade zone, an  interstate bank.... And ultimately, maybe, in creating an  economic union.    As this edition of the newspaper was being signed to press  the final results of the meeting between the Russian and  Kazakhstani presidents were still not known. It will take time  to study and analyze the documents that have been signed.</p>

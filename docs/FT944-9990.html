			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): There's room at the top - Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at problems with top performing trusts The main reason for investing in the stock market is to make as much money as possible . . . If you agree with this, you will be turning for guidance to Page 10 where we list the top (and bottom) performing unit and investment trusts over various periods. This will be a regular feature of the new Weekend Money section. Yet, is a top-performing fund the one to choose if you want to make money? The wealth warning on equity investment - 'past performance is not a guide to future performance' - might seem tiresome but, broadly, it is true. Indeed, there is an investment theory which says it is better to buy the worst performing fund in a sector than the best. Johnson Fry's Worst Performing fund operates on this principle by investing in the worst M&amp;G life fund each year. The reason some funds can fluctuate from top to bottom of the league tables between one year and the next is that their performance tends to be related to market conditions rather than their manager's skill. This is why the winners - particularly over the whole unit or investment trust sector - tend to be highly specialist trusts. A look at the top five funds over the various periods shows that a large proportion are single country funds, particularly those in the Far East. The top performing unit trust over one year - Baring Korea - produced growth of more than 50 per cent, but this performance cannot be divorced from the 30 per cent rise in the Korean market since the beginning of the year. It also accounts for the presence of three Korea trusts in the top five investment and unit trust tables over one year. Those who favour 'bottom fishing' will not have been disappointed - at the beginning of November 1993, Baring Korea was ranked 56 out of 57 in its sector. What goes up must come down, and it is Hong Kong which has been knocked off its pedestal by Korea's performance. Gartmore Hong Kong, which heads the five-year unit trust tables, is now ranked 58 out of 60 funds in the year to November 1, losing 13p out of every Pounds 1 invested over the period. Once again, the underperformance is linked to the local market, which has dropped 20 per cent since the beginning of the year. A similar reversal of fortune was also evident in the UK equity growth sector between 1992 and 1993. Many of the funds living at the bottom of the league tables at the beginning of October 1992 were recovery or 'special situation' funds which tend to invest in cyclical stocks. One year later, recovery funds were at the top of the tables, their assets boosted by the fall in interest rates after sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. So, the trick in making money in the stock market is not only getting the timing right but doing so against a volatile background. It is a high-risk strategy. If you are a more cautious investor, seeking to protect and improve the real value of your capital, you are better off steering well clear of the high-flyers. Instead, you need to look for consistency. Any realistic fund manager knows that to get into the top quartile (25 per cent) of long-term league tables requires consistent above-average performance. As time passes, the higher - but more volatile - performers will drop out, propelling the above-average fund towards the top. This is one reason why UK tracker funds - which aim to mirror the performance of a benchmark index, often the FT-SE A All-Share - tend to outperform other funds over time.</p>

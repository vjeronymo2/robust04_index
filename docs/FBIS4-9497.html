			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former Yugoslav </F> Republic of Macedonia, to the Bulgarian National Assembly in  Sofia -- live, in Macedonian]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, esteemed Deputies, ladies  and gentlemen:    It is a great honor and a responsibility to have the  opportunity today to address you, the people's representatives  of the Republic of Bulgaria, to speak at this loftiest  institution, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria,  and to address the Bulgarian people and all the citizens of your  land through you.    I would like to convey to you the greetings of all the  citizens of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia], the greetings of all Macedonians,  Albanians, Turks, and members of all the nationalities who live  in our land. I convey to you their warm greetings and best  wishes for the prosperity of your country and for the well-being  and success of all your citizens, as well as for success in your  responsible work. These greetings also signify full support for  your efforts for the democratic transformation of Bulgaria in an  historic period of transition.    On the other hand, it also means support for your efforts  for  peace, understanding, and good-neighborly relations between the  Macedonian and Bulgarian peoples and among all Balkan nations  and states.    These greetings also express Macedonia's striving to  develop,  on the broadest possible basis, good-neighborly relations and  mutual selfless cooperation with Bulgaria at all levels.    In this context, I would like to say that Bulgaria being the  first to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia  was an act of great historical importance. [applause] This not  only opened a new era in neighborly relations and cooperation,  but also was a major contribution to future cooperation between  the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples. Furthermore, this was a  major contribution to peace and stability in the southern  Balkans.    Adhering to political realism has proved to be the best  means  of overcoming various historical elements of distrust,  frustrations, and unfortunate oversights between the Macedonian  and Bulgarian peoples.    Ladies and gentlemen, the great changes that have taken  place  in the last few years on the territory of the former SFRY  allowed the Republic of Macedonia finally, after a long  struggle, to achieve its total independence as an  internationally recognized legal entity. This was an expression  of the century-long striving of the Macedonian people for their  own state, created by peaceful and democratic means, with the  maximum participation of the widest people's initiative on a  political and pluralistic basis. As a result of the referendum  and the free elections, for the past four years our country has  been steadily constructing a political, social, and  parliamentary democracy of a modern European type. Conditions  are being created for establishing and activating the market  economy. The free creative initiatives of the people are being  released in the economic and other spheres. Thus the political,  economic, and social character of the country is being changed.  This is a precondition for constructing the Republic of  Macedonia as a stable and democratic European state, a land of  free people and citizens, regardless of their ethnic, social,  national, religious, or any other affiliations.    Within this framework we have created new space for the  development, expression, and affirmation of Macedonian  creativity, science, and culture. Drawing from their ancient  national, cultural, and political traditions, personnified today  by the free Macedonian state, and in cooperation with the other  Balkan, European, and non-European nations, the Macedonian  people are today discovering broad prospects for effecting a  comprehensive national and social upsurge.    Our country, like many others at the present time, is  experiencing a difficult period of transition, with many  inherited and newly emerged difficulties of an internal and  international character. We are committed to a peaceful policy,  exclusively based on peaceful and democratic means and  cooperation and conducted through a dialogue of a bilateral and  broader international nature. How do we see Macedonia?  Independent Macedonia is a peaceful and stable Balkan state  with a European orientation. It is a factor for comprehensive  peace and stability in the Balkans. It is a state with open  borders and an affirmed policy of good-neighborly relations.    Unfortunately, we live in a region where a tragic war is  being waged in our immediate vicinity. We witness daily this  war's horrible repercussions, the ethnic cleansing,  international and interreligious hatred, the encroachment of  borders by force, all of which brings back our fresh memories of  the totalitarian and quasi-democratic systems in the Balkans,  the ideological confrontation of the Cold War, and the division  of the region into blocs. Unfortunately, Balkan history is full  of wars, clashes, international hatred, and nationalistic  deceptions. Therefore, today we all must draw lessons from  history and utilize them to the benefit of free men and our  nations, and with a due sense of responsibility, now more than  ever before, for turning the present world into a good place in  which we should all learn to live together. Everyone should  live his own life, but each one of us alongside the other, with  each helping the other.    Factors such as good-neighborly relations and confidence  could be the key to achieving peace and stability in the  Balkans. In addition, it is especially important to adhere to  the principle of respect for the existing borders between states  and the rights of minorities, resolving all problems through  political and peaceful means. In our country, we are trying to  improve relations among peoples and international relations  alike. In this manner, we managed to stay out of the war and  make a contribution to peace and stability in the region. In  this enterprise, we were guided by the lasting interests of the  Macedonian people and all our citizens, as well as their  striving to live in conditions of peace and good-neighborly  relations in the Balkans and Europe. We are convinced that this  is also in the interest of others, including the Bulgarian  people and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria. It is  our duty to express this interest in material form on the basis  of total neighborly trust, friendship, and cooperation between  us and our peoples. In this way, all of us together could turn  the Balkans into a region of peace, freedom, and cooperation.    In this context, I would like to impart my belief that only  in this manner will we be able to combine most effectively the  processes of European integration, of the large, so-called  European home, and extend this home into the Balkans. The  Republic of Macedonia is firmly following this road and is  prepared to cooperate with all Balkan and European countries. I  would venture the belief that within this context Bulgaria and  Macedonia have identical views, interests, and methods of work.    Because of the policy that our country has been following,  within a brief period of time we have achieved broad  international recognition and affirmation. We became a member  of the United Nations and of a large number of international  organizations. We established friendly and diplomatic relations  with dozens of European and non-European countries. We  cooperate for achieving peace with all members of the  international community and are striving toward our integration  in the European structures.    From a domestic viewpoint, we are preoccupied with adopting  measures for economic stabilization and strengthening the  institutions of power. In this context, I can say that while  all this is being effected under very difficult conditions of  transition and external pressure, we have succeeded in creating  a rule-of-law state and a parliamentary democracy.  Simultaneously, precisely like Bulgaria, many of our  difficulties result from the strong effects and the consequences  of the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.  The Macedonian economy is suffering great losses because of  these sanctions. So far, these losses amount to about $3  billion. However, this is not everything.    For two months now, Macedonia has been exposed to the  unjustified and unilateral measures of the Greek Government. A  strict embargo on our exports and imports was established. Our  country was almost hermetically sealed off. Because of this  embargo, our economy is incurring direct losses of more than $60  million every month. The embargo has grave consequences not  only for our economy but also for our country's social life.  However, with great economic sacrifices we are resisting this  situation. According to the IMF, we are conducting a successful  struggle against inflation. We became a member of all  international financial institutions. We began to  systematically resolve all problems related to privatization and  to intensify the process of privatization and transformation of  the larger economic systems. For this purpose, we need various  kinds of economic aid.    We attach special importance to developing our  infrastructure and our relations with our neighbors in this  context. We regard the construction of the East-West main  road-rail link, to which Macedonia, Albania, Turkey, and Italy,  as well as other international institutions, have committed  themselves, as an investment in developing the whole of  southeast Europe.    The construction of the railroad, which will connect our two  countries for the first time, will become a new, important  factor of great significance for developing Bulgarian-Macedonian  economic and other cooperation more successfully.    Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, we live at a time of great  changes. Therefore, we all bear a great responsibility to our  peoples, while at the same time we are trying to resolve  problems of vital importance for present and future generations.  Speaking about Macedonia, I can say with a full sense of  responsibility that we are firmly determined to direct  peacefully all our strivings and efforts toward strengthening  the free and independent status of the Republic of Macedonia.  We assumed such a commitment to our people through the  independence referendum. This commitment also stems from our  Constitution, which stresses that the Macedonian nation is based  on the principle of self-determination, an aspiration that our  people expressed in the referendum on the establishment of the  independent Republic of Macedonia. We view this as a historic  task and a responsibility toward our people. Simultaneously, we  feel a sense of responsibility to the historic heroism of our  ancestors, who for centuries struggled for their Macedonian  national name and dignity. We are also responsible for the  future of the younger generation, which should enjoy a better  life than us. With democratic means and the criteria of modern  times, we will create both the present and future life.    Ladies and gentlemen, dear Bulgarian friends, Macedonia  adheres to the principle of good-neighborly relations. Being  situated in the very center of the Balkans, at the very  crossroads, Macedonia has the privilege of having four different  borders with four nations and states, with which it has been  destined to share both good and bad. The history of relations  with the Balkan states and peoples is a long and complicated  one. It is full of many conflicts and misunderstandings, which  often related to Macedonia or neighboring territory.    Unfortunately, we are witnesses of the fact that problems  still exist among the individual Balkan states. We too are  involved in serious disputes, such as the one with our southern  neighbor. However, past experience shows that when each state  strives to resolve the problems on the basis of equal dialogue  the danger for the Balkan region can be eliminated. Even the  most complex problem can be resolved by peaceful means.  Neighborly trust can be directly and responsibly established as  a precondition for resolving any problem. This is an instrument  that can eliminate all sources of conflicts and instability in  the Balkan region.    The international community, through the documents of the  United Nations and the CSCE, has created powerful instruments  for establishing relations between states based on confidence  and respect. Thus, a powerful basis for respecting human  freedoms was also established.    In Macedonia, the democratic foundation for respecting human  rights is very firm. This includes the rights of members of the  ethnic minorities. We incorporated these minorities by  establishing our state upon the principles of modern  civilization. In effecting peaceful coexistence within our  country, we are actually working for stability not only in our  country but also in the entire region. This is our contribution  to peace, good-neighborly relations, and cooperation in the  Balkans.    Ladies and gentlemen, National Assembly representatives, in  conclusion please allow me to say a few more words. I would  like to express my great pleasure at being invited by President  Zhelev to visit your country. I had the opportunity to have a  broad exchange of views on the most important issues of  Bulgarian-Macedonian relations and cooperation. I am convinced  that, as a result of the talks that I had with President Zhelev  and other Bulgarian politicians, our relations will obtain new  positive stimuli, from which we will both benefit. We have  reason to look forward to fruitful cooperation in all spheres  and to open borders between our countries, based in law, as it  should be between two equal and sovereign states. I believe  that we have contributed to developing good-neighborly relations  between our two neighboring states and mutual friendship between  the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples, as two kindred peoples.  There are prospects and possibilities for even closer  cooperation in the future. You and the Macedonian  parliamentarians must make joint efforts to establish friendly  and fruitful Bulgarian-Macedonian relations.    During those two days, we also had the opportunity to  continue our dialogue on the most important international  issues, especially those of a regional character. I noted with  satisfaction a great coincidence of our assessments of the war  in Bosnia, namely that it is possible to resolve the conflict  through a peace treaty and by respecting the rights of all the  peoples that live in this state. No one dares to support this  war. We noted the vital interest of both Macedonia and Bulgaria  in ending the war, something that will facilitate the progress  of both countries. We reached an agreement to consult one  another on resolving other open issues in the region, as a step  toward building a new Balkan house of European prominence, one  that is attractive to all the Balkan peoples.    Finally, Mr. Chairman, please allow me to thank you once  again for the opportunity to address you from this lofty  rostrum. I wish you, all the National Assembly representatives,  and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, much success  and prosperity. [applause]</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crunch time in the world nuts market - Shortages that are driving up almond, peanut and hazlenut prices WHEN YOU buy your box of mixed nuts this Christmas, you could find it contains an unusually large proportion of Brazil nuts. Look carefully - the almonds, hazelnuts and even peanuts could be on the short side. The reason is a rare coincidence of problems in the nut market that has caused a near doubling in the prices of almonds and peanuts and a sharp, though slightly less dramatic, rise in the cost of hazelnuts. 'In most years we'll get one of our markets thrust into turmoil because of some supply side problem or a political problem,' says Mr Peter Morgan, edible nut trader for London importers Barrow, Lane and Ballard. 'To have so many of them up in arms is unusual.' Mr Morgan's company handles about 40,000 tonnes of peanuts a year, buying from around the world for customers mainly in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada. The price of American peanuts shot up from about Dollars 800 a tonne in the early spring to a peak of Dollars 1,500 following this summer's drought, which particularly affected growing regions in the south-western states of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Prices have settled back slightly to around Dollars 1,450 a tonne, but that is still way out of proportion to the actual shortfall in US production of about 15 per cent, says Mr Morgan. The distortion arises from the US quota system, under which three-quarters of the harvest are purchased from farmers at high support prices for the domestic market. The remainder receives lower support prices and goes for crushing or export. The harvest is expected to be down about 300,000 tonnes on the usual level at about 1.7m tonnes. But because farmers will sell for the domestic market first, exports are likely to drop by some 60 per cent, Mr Morgan says. Buyers are beginning to turn for peanuts to other countries, such as Argentina and China, where supplies are available at prices about Dollars 200 and about Dollars 400 a tonne respectively less than those for US produce. Interestingly, given the existence of the North American Free Trade Agreement, some Canadian buyers are switching from American to Chinese peanuts, even though the latter are regarded as being of lower quality. 'This is the fifth year since 1980 when we've had a real or false alarm,' says Mr Morgan. 'I'll have too many grey hairs if it goes on much longer.' Peanuts are particularly important for snacks and cocktail 'eats', as well as being ingredients in confectionery and peanut butter. Almonds and hazelnuts are vital for the baking and confectionery industries, with almonds particularly used by the huge marzipan market in Germany and the Netherlands. So all sectors of the nut-processing industry have been affected. Almond prices have been pushed sky-high by problems with the crop in California, the world's main growing region. Wind damage has caused a shortfall of 50m lb from a normal crop of about 550m lb and sent prices soaring from about Pounds 3,500 a tonne in early August to about Pounds 4,000 a tonne, twice the level a year ago, according to Mr Brian Newson, who runs the nut operation for Combined Shipping and Trading, a London-based commodities trading company. 'I think it's gone too high on the evidence of that news,' says Mr Newson. 'We're finding strong consumer resistance. These high levels have come as a bolt from the blue.' Hazelnut prices have been rising on expectations of a poor crop in Turkey, which produces about 70 per cent of world supply, and in the main European growing countries, Italy and Spain. Harvesting starts this month and in September prices shot up from about Pounds 1,800 a tonne to as much as Pounds 3,000 a tonne, before settling back to about Pounds 2,300. 'It was a wild situation,' says Mr Newson. 'I can't remember prices spiralling to that sort of level in such a short time.' The irony is that Turkey is sitting on a buffer stock of about 130,000 tonnes, apparently waiting for higher prices. 'The European Community is pressing them to release some of that crop to assist the market,' Mr Newson says. Among other nuts, cashew prices are beginning to rise because of fears of a shortfall in the forthcoming Brazilian harvest, and macadamias, increasingly popular as an exotic cocktail nut, have been driven up in the past six months by crop problems. Brazils, on the other hand, remain relatively cheap. But the Christmas box of mixed nuts is unlikely to reflect these price increases because processors tend to have forward cover until about January or February, according to commodity experts. That is when consumers could start to feel the crunch. 'It's very difficult to get price increases pre-Christmas,' says Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive of JLI Group, the UK food processing group. 'But most supermarkets are aware that prices will have to move in January. 'The impact of the devaluation of the pound - because most nuts are traded in dollars - and of the absolute price rises in dollars could mean a double whammy.'</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Clique of senior directors studied CRITICISM OF company exec-utives who take on too many directorships has not deterred a small but influential group of businessmen from continuing to serve simultaneously in a large number of boardrooms. A survey published today identifies a clutch of top industrialists who are paid to sit on six or more boards. The Cadbury committee on corporate governance suggested that three directorships should be the optimum level if executives were to make a proper contribution to the companies that employ them. The survey, conducted by Director magazine and Arthur Andersen Corporate Register, says that although the typical director of a public company is a 52-year-old chartered accountant, some keep a boardroom seat well into their 80s. The oldest public company director recorded is Lord Shawcross, at 90 a non-executive director of Caffyns, the motor distributor. At the other end of the scale, Mr Jean-Jacques Murray, at 26, is an executive director of Nu-Swift, the fire protection and equipment company. Professor Sir Roland Smith, whose 11 directorships last year made him one of the busiest directors, has since been toppled from the British Aerospace board and has quit two other chairmanships. According to the survey, Mr Peter Ryan, 61, holds the highest number of directorships. An engineer, he serves on the board of eight companies, including three non-executive chairmanships - at Protean, Stag Furniture and Torday and Carlisle. Behind Mr Ryan come six men each with seven directorships, including Mr George Duncan of Associated British Ports, and Mr David Haggett of Atkins Group. Five more directors, including Sir Robert Clark of Lowndes Lambert, Mr Michael Davies of Bredero Properties and Sir Judson Day of BAe, each hold six boardroom posts. The survey also shows that The Daily Telegraph has the largest number of non-executive directors, with 17 independent board members. The average salary range of non-executive board members is, according to the survey, between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 18,000, for which directors are usually expected to attend between 12 and 15 board meetings a year. Those with special responsibilities, such as a deputy chairmanship or audit committee membership, can expect to earn up to Pounds 30,000.</p>

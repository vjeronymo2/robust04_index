			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Oxbridge problem is its products' 'special' status Sir, In his article, 'Oxbridge arrogance' (Truth of the Matter, October 15), Nigel Spivey, editor of the Cambridge Review, joins his many colleagues in the Oxbridge establishment in dismissing me as a bigoted 'knocker' of our ancient universities. Referring to my book, The Oxbridge Conspiracy, he writes that 'to perpetuate the mythology of some cabalistic, public-school, backward-looking Oxbridge is pure prejudice, and it is a prejudice to which Walter Ellis . . . must confess'. In fact, my book makes clear (to those who bother to read it) that what is wrong with Oxbridge is not its residual bias towards the public schools, but the fact that its products, both state and private, are treated by English society as a special caste, whose entry to the corridors of power, privilege and wealth is assured, overwhelmingly, by virtue not of academic performance, but attendance. Other universities have bright people, too, but they must fight to be noticed. Spivey's reference to 'beefy' Magdalene College rugby players lining up to urinate in front of their retiring Master scarcely refutes this contention, even if several of the masterly micturators did come from a Swansea comprehensive. Nor, surely, is it helpful to his case to point out how 'gratifying' it is that so many of the nation's top jobs are held by Oxbridge graduates. Britain, he says, needs more arrogance, not less. Well, if so, we know who to look to for a lead. Walter S Ellis, 134c Coleraine Road, Blackheath, London SE3 7NU.</p>

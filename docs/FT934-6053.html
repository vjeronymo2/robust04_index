			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Clarke likely to ease pain of cuts on industry MR KENNETH CLARKE offered a clear hint yesterday that the burden of tax increases in next Tuesday's Budget would fall on consumers rather than industry. The chancellor's comments came amid Whitehall speculation that he will seek to soften the impact of government spending cuts on the construction industry by setting targets for privately-financed infrastructure projects. The officials said that to avoid the embarrassment of a tight squeeze on government capital spending they expected Mr Clarke to outline in greater detail the contribution he expected private finance to make to roads, prison building and housing. Speaking in his last Commons appearance before the Budget, Mr Clarke denied that he was offering a foretaste of next Tuesday's speech. But, in a generally upbeat assessment of economic prospects, his emphasis on the need to expand Britain's manufacturing base left Conservative MPs in little doubt that industry would escape relatively lightly. The chancellor told MPs it was true that 'we have to get industrial production up higher', adding: 'We all meet businessmen and those working in industry who know at the moment conditions are very difficult indeed.' He stressed the need for faster falls in unemployment, saying it remained at 'an unacceptably high level'. While the government faced a sharp attack from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, over its 'broken promises' on taxation since the general election, Mr Clarke reinforced expectations of further increases by saying the Conservative party had not committed itself never to put up taxes. But he appeared to rule out any increase in the standard 17.5 per cent rate of value added tax. This left Conservative MPs predicting that the brunt of tax increases was most likely to fall on income tax allowances and on a possible extension of the VAT base. There are also expectations that Mr Clarke will again postpone the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, meanwhile set the stage for a progressive squeeze on welfare spending by stressing in a speech last night that without cuts the system would 'collapse under its own weight'. Delivering a memorial lecture in London dedicated to the late Sir Ian Gow, Mr Lilley said there was a limit to what the state could provide without undermining the economy. Foreshadowing cuts in invalidity benefit and the transfer to employers of much of the cost of industrial benefits, Mr Lilley said: 'In the future welfare society we are building, as the economy grows, an increasing share of provision will be made by individuals, families and companies.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anneli Sundberg: "Choleric Candidate From </F> Keminmaa"]    [Text] Paavo Vayrynen considers himself persecuted in a  country of predators and twisted truths.    If will alone could determine the outcome of the election,  Paavo Vayrynen would become president. Vayrynen is trying to get  to Mantyniemi with frightening fervor.    He is trying to force a misguided nation to see matters his  way. He exhorts people to read books written by him; that is the  only way to find out the truth about Vayrynen and his political  platform. At least, the books disclose a master in the art of  nagging.    Who would know Paavo Vayrynen but Paavo Vayrynen himself? As  a matter of fact, he appears to feel that he is the only one who  really understands Paavo Vayrynen and knows how to evaluate him  correctly.    The large majority of citizens fear and detest a completely  wrong image of Vayrynen, a Vayrynen who is the creation of  baleful publicity, a Vayrynen that does not even exist--in  Vayrynen's mind.    The real Vayrynen can be found in paid ads and in books  written by Vayrynen.    "In my own view, I am just an ordinary Finnish man. I am  certainly not a saint, nor have I attempted to appear as one. I  use alcohol the same way as everyone else within the same sphere  of culture and customs: politicians, business leaders, civil  servants, and editors. Almost everyone who uses alcohol  sometimes drinks a little too much. And most Finns use alcohol.  But I have not pinched any female flight attendants."    For an ordinary man, Vayrynen has extraordinarily much to  explain.    Vayrynen must shovel through almost 1,500 pages of sludge in  order to unearth the real Vayrynen, the fighter, the  philosopher, and the patriot, whose pure and lofty ideals have  been dragged through the dirt, and whose character has been  distorted.    So what kind of person is the man on whose head nasty  publicity has pulled transmogrifying pantyhose, as on a robber?    He is choleric.    Vayrynen identified his character type as soon as he had  read  O. Hallesby's book, Human Character Traits in the Light of  the Bible.    According to Hallesby, individuals of the choleric type are  strong-willed, determined, energetic, practical leaders, and  possess common sense. "It is just as if obstacles would double  such a person's intelligence and energy. His being is then  certainly suffused by something tense and hard, but he is never  heard to complain. There is a refreshing and spirited air about  such a choleric person, something healthy and strong."    However, a spirited choleric also has some bad traits. He is  hard, power-hungry, vengeful, proud, and bursting with  self-confidence.    Vayrynen denies being vengeful. "I am certainly hard when it  is required, but my nature is still sensitive--even unusually  sensitive.... After reading Hallesby's book, I have tried to  train myself," he said .    Vayrynen cannot tell when he decided to become a politician.  "It is as if the positions and the tasks appeared by themselves.  The road chose me," he explained.    The wretched road has had a tough time with its choice. One  feels sorry for the road, as it could have chosen a much more  enjoyable traveling companion. Vayrynen alone can fill hundreds  and hundreds of blank sheets of paper without once erupting in  relieved laughter.  <H5>  Smoke and Fire </H5>   Vayrynen exhibits some kind of wry humor when he describes  the election campaign in which he was involved in Lapland during  the 1980's. He finally decided also to capture the votes of the  athletic public and participated in a 75 km cross-country skiing  event, with his own election number pinned to his chest. The  number was in the sequence allotted to competitive skiers, but  Vayrynen bravely endured all the jeers, as he expected to get  his picture in the newspaper. Unfortunately, the reporter at the  scene supported another candidate, and Vayrynen did not receive  the expected reward.    Even the most curmudgeonly sprouting Finnish statesman  sometimes lets loose among friends and acquaintances, and, for a  few hours, forgets his political machinations, relaxes, and  enjoys life.    Vayrynen also speaks about his friends, but he appears  mainly  to use them as guinea pigs for his political plans. Interaction  seems to be as enjoyable as loading a rifle.    As foreign minister, Vayrynen entertained international  guests, and, for example, acted as host for his Soviet  colleague, Andrey Kozyrev, whom he took to Lapland for some  skiing and relaxation. It is certain that his colleague had a  good time, as "in front of the fireplace, after supper, among  other things, I entertained Kozyrev with a detailed account of  Finland's history."    Germany's foreign minister and his wife were also the  objects  of Vayrynen's skiing diplomacy. As Vayrynen and guests were  having supper in a lean-to built by the Finnish Border Guard,  the wind changed direction and everyone was choked by the smoke.  "In the future, we must avoid this kind of hospitality,"  writes Vayrynen.  <H5>  Predators and Carrion Birds </H5>   Professional advertising people have tried to explain to  Vayrynen that his best election weapon is his family: his wife  Vuokko, and his three children, Tiinaliisa, 24, Taneli, 20, and  Lotta, 16.    "I am not going to play this game. My children have a right  to privacy. Vuokko participates in a manner appropriate in  Finland, with dignity," said Vayrynen.    Vayrynen really does not seem to need to create a political  profile based on his role as a father and husband. He  conscientiously lists the misfortunes encountered by his family.  The house burned down with all the family's possessions. The  baby died, and his wife's life was also in danger. Lotta broke  her leg. His mother died.    The brief glimpses from his private life drown in the  endless  ocean of political setbacks and misunderstandings, and  ever-surging plans and hopes. Vayrynen suffers, becomes  disappointed, his wings touch the ground, depression creeps up,  but he does not give up. He has learned that "even in politics,  the laws of the jungle apply."    "If others think that you are weak, they'll attack you. At  least the predators will move in on you. If you appear  sufficiently vulnerable, you will end up being devoured by  carrion birds," he notes.    A proud choleric person would naturally not deign to become  eaten by ravens. Being the quarry of larger predators is, at  least, something to be proud about, but Vayrynen seems to be the  victim of bad luck. The sky may darken with carrion birds, but  good predators are few and far between.    But, so far, there have been enough of them in Vayrynen's  immediate neighborhood that he can always find opponents larger  than he. An irresistible force pulls Vayrynen to the top, and he  spares no effort in his quest for the original source of power.    When, after having received a flying start in politics while  still in his early twenties, Paavo Vayrynen had become  disappointed with Ahti Karjalainen, who was clearly his senior  and much more experienced, he decided to establish contact with  President Urho Kekkonen.    The connection was established.  <H5>  Advice and Criticism </H5>   Kekkonen felt that Karjalainen was threatening his position  and took Vayrynen under his wings.    Vayrynen became a "teacher's pet" foreign minister and even  received written instructions on how to act from the president.  "During the next two to three years (they are the hardest),  try to act as if you were 10 years older. Walk deliberately,  with care. Sometimes speak slowly, as the Foreign Ministry is an  institution steeped in old customs. Dress with careful attention  to style. I have a bad habit of keeping my hands in my pockets.  I noted during the trip to the USSR that you too have the same  problem. Once I observed you saying to good-bye to a fairly  prominent representative of our hosts by shaking his hand while  keeping your other hand in your trouser pocket.    ``Now is the time for you to stay out of the limelight. Your  position demands a certain kind of publicity, but you should let  others worry about domestic matters. You have your hands full  with your primary duties.''    But Vayrynen, filled with his new importance, did not have  the patience to wait.    Kekkonen became angry and sent a critical card. Vayrynen  quickly regretted his disobedience and sent a letter.    "I got your message last night when I called my wife. And it  saddened me," he writes.    In his letter of atonement, Vayrynen whines over his  difficulties and asks for understanding. At the end, he gathers  up his courage and asks for more advice!    The still somewhat respectful disciple continues to write to  Kekkonen. The relentless challenger, who has experienced  disappointment in his many political hopes, also writes to  Kekkonen's successor, Mauno Koivisto.    "My life in Mauno Koivisto's Finland has not been easy,"  complains Vayrynen.  <H5>  Distress and Defiance </H5>   Time after time, Vayrynen bombarded Koivisto with letters;  he  complained, ordered, advised, begged, corrected, whined for  sympathy, and wondered about the poor relationship. Even  Vayrynen's acquaintances were puzzled with the manic letter  writing, which Vayrynen unveils in his books.    For instance, on Finnish independence day in 1990, Vayrynen  approached the president. He started by saying: "Again, I spend  my Independence Day writing you a letter."    Vayrynen had returned from Iraq, where a few Finns were kept  hostage. Ulf Sundqvist, Vayrynen's traveling companion, had  visited the presidential palace; Vayrynen had not. He felt that  he had been given the cold shoulder.    "I exposed myself to great risks and suffered through a  difficult journey in order to serve my country. I assumed that  my troubles would, at least, be rewarded by gratitude from the  leader of the state. This was not the case. You did not even  want to see me, and instead, demonstrated your point by inviting  only my traveling companion. In addition, I was distressed when  I heard that during my trip, you had criticized me on at least  two different occasions.    ``I intend to continue my political career. If I can attract  enough support, I intend to occupy some central political  position. In my view, I do not exaggerate if I say that it is  not in the country's best interest if we are unable to cooperate  on a practical level. I believe that I have done my fair share  in achieving this objective. And I intend to continue in the  same vein. But at the same time, I hope to receive some kind of  reciprocity from you.''    The letter was not written by a jilted lover, but by a man  who at his own initiative was conducting a one-sided  correspondence with the president, and who, at the time when the  letter was written, was hardly anything but a rank-and-file  Eduskunta representative, and whose trip was certainly not the  president's idea.    "In Mauno Koivisto's Finland, my greatest problem has been  my  personal relationship with the president," worries Vayrynen.    President Mauno Koivisto has been all too conscious of his  position, to succumb to becoming the executor of Vayrynen's  wishes. Of course, such a relationship constitutes a problem for  both parties, as one person has the power and the other one the  hunger for it.  <H5>  Dreams and Disappointments </H5>   To Vayrynen's disappointment, Prime Minister Esko Aho also  has proven himself to be difficult. After all, he was not  satisfied with the crumbs from Vayrynen's table. He became  "Koivisto's faithful factotum," and Vayrynen suspects that he  has his aim on the presidency.    It was probably disconcerting for Vayrynen to discover that  he has ended up in a similar position as that into which, in the  past, he drove Ahti Karjalainen. The acolyte tries to surpass  his master and obeys reluctantly--if at all.    In the presidential elections, Vayrynen has chosen Martti  Ahtisaari as his primary opponent. Vayrynen has also tried to  challenge heavier fighters and has never stayed in his own  weight class.    Popularity polls do not look too promising for Vayrynen.  Mantyniemi seems to remain a dream.    Vayrynen may end up writing letters to his third president,  unless we can find something else for him to do. During the last  years, Vayrynen has been so busy developing his thoughts and  ideas on the economy that we should perhaps offer him as a  traveling consultant to, for example, Russia, which has gotten  its economy into an even greater mess than spunky little Finland  has. In any case, Finland is an all too insignificant forum for  the son of the vegetable grower from Keminmaa who in his own  mind has the formula for the salvation of all of mankind.

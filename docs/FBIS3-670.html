Ciskei police who were monitoring the base from a dirt road  nearby said the brigadier entered the base about 3pm. He was  still there at 5.30pm. A guard at the base gate said there were  "problems being experienced by us as soldiers" and that the  brigadier was addressing them.    Earlier in the day SAPA reported that South Africa Law and  Order Minister Hernus Kriel, speaking in Berlin on an Eastern  Cape election tour, apologised for cutting short his address and  told his audience:    "I'm talking about the Ciskei, various problems in the  Ciskei, in Bisho. There's talk of a coup. I'm not involved in  the coup but ii am involved in the security side."    The National Party politician then left for Bisho, Ciskei's  capital, to monitor the situation.    Mr Kriel's spokesman, Craig Kotze, said the minister's  remarks had to be seen "against the background of increasing  tension in the homeland". He added:    "Obviously we will be monitoring the situation to see the  lives, property and interests of South African citizens (in  Ciskei) are not directly threatened."    Ciskei TEC [Transitional Executive Council] member Mickey  Webb said any rumour of a coup in the independent territory was  "devoid of all truth".    Quoting South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Pieter Goosen,  Mr Webb claimed he had been told Mr Kriel had denied making any  reference to a possible coup in Ciskei. [passage omitted]</p>

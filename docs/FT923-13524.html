			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: Terrible Mouth - Opera The premiere of Terrible Mouth, with music by Nigel Osborne to a text by Howard Barker, establishes Almeida Opera as a genuinely credible replacement to the much missed Almeida Festival. While it does not attempt to match the sheer scope and ambition of its predecessor, this season's programme, with the Osborne opera as its centrepiece and flanked by the British premiere of Oliver's Mario and the Magician (already reviewed here by Max Loppert) and a double bill of Vigeland and Krenek, gives a good sense of its distinctive direction. It underlines, too, the potential of further collaborations between the Almeida Theatre and English National Opera's Contemporary Opera Studio. Terrible Mouth is built around a critical episode in the life of the painter Goya. The initial impulse for the piece was Barker's; his libretto dates back to the mid-1980s, was written unprompted and subsequently taken up by Osborne in a commission from BBC Radio 3. In a Guardian article last week, Barker described the background to his Goya text, the derivation of his title (from the leering grin of a self-portrait) and its exploration of the painter's ambivalent attitude to the events he recorded and satirised, characterising him as 'a man as much fascinated as repelled by disorder and sudden death'. The six tightly-constructed scenes portray events in 1792 at a Spanish country house, where the reverberations from the French revolution are destabilising society. The house has been transformed into a military hospital, and when Goya arrives with his mistress, the Countess of Alba, he is confronted for the first time with the realities of war, with the blood and the suffering that has fuelled his art. The events force him to realise his complicity in these atrocities; the opera ends with Goya, in Barker's words, 'painting himself into oblivion', as he begins a neutral, formal portrait of the Man Without a Conscience, the owner of the house. Fundamental to the conception is a division of the part of Goya between an actor and a singer. Barker created the spoken role for Ian McDiarmid, the Almeida's artistic director; Omar Ebrahim takes charge of the vocal lines. They create a powerful dual image at the centre of the piece: the one deaf, raving and incoherent, the other all vision and lyrical articulacy. The other principal roles are sung, but the interplay of actors and singers is carried over into the six-strong chorus, the Chorus of the Maimed, which creates the vocal background against which the main events are etched, a soundscape of guttural sounds and whispers, explosive horror and menacing gestures. This is Osborne's third opera, and by some way his most consistently satisfying. After the miscalculations of the Opera Factory Hell's Angels in 1985, and the intermittent success of The Electrification of the Soviet Union for Glyndebourne in 1987, Terrible Mouth has a high musical specific gravity and tight dramatic coherence. It lasts barely 80 minutes, yet delves deeply into its subject matter; there are wonderful tensions between lyrical beauty and grim reality, some sonorous vocal lines and a harmonic scheme that plots the course of the opera with confidence. Osborne uses an ensemble of cellos perched high upstage as the basis of his musical structure; the remaining instruments, wind and percussion, provide local colour and sudden expressive effusions. David Pountney's production sustains and reinforces these nightmare visions and passing moments of lucidity. It is spare and direct, with the minimum of scenic clutter (design by Nigel Lowery) and gives free rein to McDiarmid's vivid performance. Ebrahim's intense Elizabeth Laurence is the Duchess of Alba, seductive and unfeeling by turn, Richard Van Allen the reptilian Man Without a Conscience. Neill Archer doubles the role of servant and revolutionary Captain; Clive Bayley is the sadistic surgeon, a sibling to the manic doctor in Wozzeck, while Anna Steiger is the Hooded Figure, the image of death and destruction whose rapt utterances articulate Goya's voyage of psychological revelation. They all contribute to a demanding piece of music theatre which may be short on compassion but is consistently absorbing and most eloquently argued. Almeida Theatre; further performances on July 13, 15, 16 and 18</p>

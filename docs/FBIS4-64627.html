			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ff" commentary: "Murderous Decision"] </F>   [Text] The Federal Government continues to participate in  the killing in Kurdistan. This was decided by Bonn by lifting  the halt to arms deliveries to Turkey. Germany sends weapons to  a state that systematically oppresses, drives away, and kills  the Kurds. This signals to the government in Ankara that the  destruction of the Kurdish people continues to be more or less  tolerated.    For this reason the question whether Turkish soldiers in the  southeast of the country fight with German armaments is  important, but not of a central nature. Now it becomes obvious  that Kinkel's order to examine evidence of the use of German  weapons was only a show to calm down critics. One can only call  it cynical how the Federal Government ignores statements by  eyewitnesses, misinterprets films, and adopts the excuses of the  Turkish Government in those instances where German armaments are  clearly visible in photographs.    However, the end of the halt to arms deliveries would be a  scandal even if Turkey were no longer to use any weapons from  Germany against the Kurds. The more armaments are streaming  into the country, the less the military needs to worry about its  stocks, the more unscrupulously can Ankara wage its war in the  southeast. In addition, the symbolic importance of the decision  made by Bonn is even more murderous than the continued use of  German weapons in practice: It confirms to the Turkish  Government its knowledge that, for Germany, good relations with  the geostrategically important NATO partner are more important  than the Kurdish people's right to existence.</p>

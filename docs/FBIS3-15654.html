			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Proposals from a Ukrainian delegation make the idea  of forming financial-industrial groups and joint-stock  enterprises within the CIS quite achievable -- This is how  Volodymyr Melnyk, senior official at the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers, assessed the preliminary agreements reached among the  Commonwealth states at their talks in Moscow. He also pointed  out that Kiev's official support of the idea does not contradict  Ukraine's admission as merely an associate member of the CIS  economic union. This standpoint has been officially proclaimed  earlier by the Government of Ukraine.</p>

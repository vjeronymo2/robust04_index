			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / French companies given budget boost THE first budget of France's new centre-right government includes proposals to invest FFr2.65bn (Pounds 310m) in public works this year in an attempt to create jobs and to bolster the troubled construction industry. The public works package, most of which will be spent on new roads, was one of a series of measures intended to haul the French economy out of recession and to alleviate the pressure on particularly vulnerable sectors, notably the building industry and small companies. The small company proposals, worth FFr1.6bn overall, include government provision of FFr400m to help businesses in difficulty and an injection of FFr300m into Sofaris, a special fund that guarantees loans to small concerns. Other proposals will make it easier and cheaper to transfer the ownership of companies, particularly private businesses, through the provision of tax breaks worth FFr410m in a full year. The state will also contribute FFr46m to encourage small businesses to relocate outside the Paris area. Small companies should benefit from the proposed changes to the value added tax system. The government is abolishing the month-long delay between companies paying VAT and receiving their refunds. This should yield savings of FFr11bn for the corporate sector, with FFr5.5bn going to small companies. The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, also took steps to boost investment in the run-up to his government's privatisation programme. It is expected to start in September and will involve the sale of several state-controlled financial and industrial groups. The government is waiving the tax payable on cash switched from money market funds into equity savings plans, in an attempt to encourage long-term investment in shares. Further it is exempting investors from paying bourse tax on the first FFr150 of each share deal to try to encourage small investors.</p>

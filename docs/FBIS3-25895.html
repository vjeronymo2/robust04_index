			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Deng Rong, the youngest daughter of China's  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, has started work on the second  volume of her best-selling biography of her father.    Ms Deng, who writes under the pen name "Mao Mao," told the  Shanxi Youth newspaper she was gathering reference materials for  the book and expected it to be completed within the next couple  of years.    It will focus on the latter half of Mr Deng's life, a period  in which he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution  before finally taking absolute control of the Communist Party in  1976.    Ms Deng described her father's later years as "the brightest  and most glorious chapter" in his life.    The first volume, published last August, has already  reportedly sold more than 20 million copies. Most were bought  up by government offices and work units eager to show their  enthusiasm for China's "chief architect of reform".    The new biography would rely to a greater extent on Ms  Deng's  personal experience rather than historical documents and the  memories of her parents which formed the basis of the first  volume, she said.    "I know a lot more and have a greater understanding of the  second half of father's life," Ms Deng, who was born in 1950  when her father was 46, told the newspaper.    However, it is unclear just how much detail about the  factional intrigues which led to the downfall of her father in  the Cultural Revolution Ms Deng will provide in her new personal  account of his life.    Most analysts are not expecting any major revelations in the  book, rather a subtle reworking of recent history to finally  establish a definitive place for Mr Deng in the annals of the  Communist Party.    "All this publicity about the life and works of Deng is  clearly designed to shape Deng's legacy before he finally dies  and thus hopefully ensure his ideas are not abandoned," a  Western diplomat said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 20 (BTA) -- "Ankara has no special  political or economic strategy about the Turkish minority in  Bulgaria or in any other Balkan state," says Turkish President  Suleyman Demirel in his first major interview for the Bulgarian  press, granted to the editor-in-chief of the TRUD daily Tosho  Toshev in connection with a forthcoming visit to Turkey by  Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev.    "Turkey's principled position is that people should not be  forced to leave the country where they were born and have  lived," the Turkish head of state says. Asked what Turkey had  done to help the financial development of Bulgaria's  Muslim-populated borderland areas, he answers that every state  is obliged to improve the economic conditions of its citizens.  He expresses the conviction that the economic situation of the  Bulgarians living in those parts can be improved by expansion of  trade and economic relations between Bulgaria and Turkey. "To  this end, the country should discuss ways and means to widen  trade and economic contacts," Mr. Demirel observes.    The Turkish president says that relations between Bulgaria  and his country have been "good" so far with the exception of  the 1984-1989 period. He sees the recently growing number of  high-level visits as a clear indication of the two countries'  political will to promote their relations in all spheres.  Bulgarian-Turkish trade has increased considerably, from $60-70  million in the early 80's to $329 million in 1993, Mr. Demirel  says. This is an encouraging sign for the tendencies of  bilateral relations, in his view.    The Turkish president describes as "promising" the prospects  of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Region, recalling that  Bulgaria and Turkey initiated its establishment. In an area  overwhelmed by past and present political and economic  difficulties, regional cooperation can help a lot to overcome  these difficulties, he emphasizes. "If together with the other  member countries we manage to do so, we will be able to reap the  fruits of regional peace and stability," Mr. Demirel notes.    Discussing the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President  Demirel describes as major progress the Muslim-Croat agreement  signed in Washington and expresses the opinion that the process  started with that agreement could provide a sound basis for  comprehensive peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The economic difficulties experienced by Turkey, the Kurds'  struggle for independence in Southeastern Turkey and the  successful performance of Islamic fundamentalists in the local  elections are also discussed in the interview.</p>

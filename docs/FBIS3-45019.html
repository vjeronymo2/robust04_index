			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "Qian Qichen Starts a </F> Visit to Six African Nations"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Qian Qichen,  Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, will start his  foreign visits in the new year and set off tomorrow to visit six  African countries: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar,  and Mauritius. He will exchange opinions with leaders of the  six countries on the international situation, African affairs,  bilateral relations, and other issues of common interest.    The Chinese foreign minister has been faithfully and  creatively performing his duties and carrying out intense  diplomatic activities. Last year, he not only received foreign  counterparts at home, but also made 10 visits to foreign  countries to attend international conferences. In particular,  he accompanied PRC President Jiang Zemin when he attended the  informal Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization summit  meeting, and held an official meeting with U.S. President  Clinton in Seattle, then he accompanied Jiang Zemin on his visit  to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal.    Strengthening and developing unity and cooperation with  Third  World countries is a basic foothold of China's independent and  peace-oriented foreign policy. At the beginning of the new  year, Qian Qichen's visit to the six African countries  demonstrates this.    Qian Qichen has mentioned many times that China attaches  importance to friendly cooperation with the African countries,  and always respects and supports their decisions to select their  own political systems and develop paths according to their own  national conditions. On the eve of his visit to African  countries in early 1993, he particularly stressed that it is not  good to neglect Africa or try to impose one's own ideas on  Africa. People should care about Africa, and respect the  choices made by the African nations and their people.    It was learned that before Qian Qichen became China's  seventh  foreign minister in 1988, he had already visited 21 of the 53  African countries.</p>

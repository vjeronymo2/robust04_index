			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hanson jibs at price of Krupp crane subsidiary HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has told Fried. Krupp, the German steel and engineering group, that it is not willing to pay the Pounds 250m (Dollars 442.5m) price tag for its loss-making crane business. According to one of Hanson's financial advisers, negotiations collapsed at a preliminary stage. Krupp yesterday confirmed that it was in 'co-operation' talks with foreign companies about the future of the business. While the talks continued the group was also undertaking a sweeping internal restructuring programme, a spokesman said. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said last week that the mobile crane business was the only part of Krupp's plant building division which failed to break even, and the market was expected to continue its downward trend. Similar negotiations and rationalisation measures are also under way with the O&amp;K cranes division of Hoesch, which is currently being taken over by Krupp. Hanson is still expected to make its next big acquisition in the US, although the group remains interested in expanding in continental Europe and is looking at several possible opportunities. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's newly appointed chief executive, believes that it is important for Hanson to branch out of its traditional Anglo-American markets but only at the right price. Krupp's crane-making business was seen as a possible bolt-on acquisition to Hanson Grove Industries, which boasts the largest hydraulic crane manufacturer in the world. Grove, which was spun off from Kidde after it was acquired by Hanson in 1987 for Pounds 1.75bn, made Dollars 85m operating profits on sales of Dollars 480m for the year to end-September 1991.</p>

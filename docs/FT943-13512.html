			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Synergen hit by failure of its main drug Synergen, once a star of the US biotechnology industry, has stopped researching Antril, its biggest product, and announced a restructuring which could lead to the company's sale. More than half Synergen's 630 employees will lose their jobs as it reverts to a business with no products in the pipeline for the medium term. The Colorado company's manufacturing plant for Antril will be closed and put up for sale. Selling the entire company was also a possibility, said Mr Greg Abbott, chief executive. Synergen shares fell yesterday by Dollars 4 to Dollars 4 7/8 . They were at a peak of Dollars 66 1/4 in December 1992. Antril, the company's main drug, was intended as a treatment for the complex and dangerous condition called sepsis. It is the lastest in a series of potential treatments to have failed and casts doubts on whether the condition can be successfully treated by any single drug. Genentech results, Page 22</p>

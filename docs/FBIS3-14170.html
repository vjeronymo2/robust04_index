[passage omitted]    Hours after the murder of two Frenchmen in the Birkhadem  area, south of the capital, France yesterday renewed its call to  its nationals who do not need to stay in Algeria to return to  France. [passage omitted]    The Algerian "Armed Islamic Group" has claimed  responsibility  for the two Frenchmen's murder in the Birkhadem area near the  capital on 22 March. A statement issued by the group, copies of  which AL-HAYAH has received in Peshawar by fax from abroad,  says: "The Armed Islamic Group in Algeria claims responsibility  for the murder of two French crusaders [salibiyyayn]." The  statement adds: "This operation falls within the program drawn  up by the group to eliminate any presence of Jews and Christians  in the land of Islam in Algeria." In its statement the group  said that the presence of the Jews, Christians, and polytheists  in the land of Islam is a direct support for an infidel and  illegitimate government which should be eliminated by the blade  of the sword.

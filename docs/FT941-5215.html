			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: With a greyer picture of the future in mind - The ageing of Europe's population poses big challenges for the state and the marketplace While there are few trends which can be forecast with confidence over decades, there is one prediction that can safely be made about the countries of western Europe. Their populations will grow much older over the next 40 years. In the 18 western European member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the number of people aged 65 and over will rise from 50m to more than 70m between 1990 and 2030. During the same period, the number of people of working age will fall. The result is that, by 2030, there will be fewer than three people of working age in these countries for each person over 65, compared with five now. Similar trends can be seen in other leading world economies, such as the US and Japan. The populations of the tigers of the Pacific Rim, such as Singapore and Taiwan, are also ageing fast. But newly industrialising countries, such as China, India and Brazil, will have a much lower share of elderly people in their populations over the next 40 years. Economists predict the ageing of the population in European countries will have an enormous impact on their economies and their international competitiveness. But there is little agreement over what the impact will be, according to Dr Paul Johnson of the London School of Economics. 'Demographic restructuring could alter patterns of consumption, production, employment, savings, investment and innovation,' he says. 'But because of the interactions between these separate elements, it is impossible to be sure of either the scale or, in some cases, the direction of the economic impact. Our understanding of the processes of economic growth and of innovation is too primitive to make long-term predictions.' This uncertainty extends even to the question of whether an ageing population will save more (to provide for old age), or save less as the elderly cash in their nest-eggs in retirement. A trend towards lower savings rates could threaten economic growth in countries with more rapidly ageing populations. A series of theoretical studies has suggested that there will be a decline in the savings rate as the population ages. Yet, according to Professor Claus Zimmermann of Munich university, there is clear evidence from all over Europe that the ageing population is saving more. 'We are not clear why older people save so much,' he says, 'but they do.' The economic consequences of ageing will be felt unevenly in Europe, as some countries face more radical demographic change than others. The greatest impact will be felt in Germany, where the population will decline by about 15m between now and 2030. Today, a fifth of the population is 20 or younger and another fifth 60 or over. By 2030, only 16 per cent will be under 20, 46 per cent will be between 20 and 60, and 38 per cent over 60. If ageing leads to any sort of competitive disadvantage, then demography could favour the economic performance of countries such as the UK and the US, where ageing will be less radical. But globally it would be the newly industrialising countries, such as China and Brazil, which would gain the greatest competitive advantage from demographic change. For the first half of the 21st century, they will have much younger populations than the economies of Europe, Japan and north America. Whatever the uncertainty over the overall economic impact of ageing, predictions can be made about its consequences in some economic sectors. One is the much tighter labour market which will result as the number of people of working age shrinks. Employers will no longer be able to count on a flow of young people to meet their staff needs. They will have to hold on to existing staff longer, rather than letting them go at retirement age or discharging them early as is now common. There will be pressure to increase the percentage of working age people actually in work - notably women who have left work to have children. Business will have to cope with changes in demand patterns as older consumers become more significant in their markets and younger people less so. Mintel, the UK market research organisation, says 'third age consumers' are emerging as a distinctive group keen to spend more on leisure, holidays and healthcare. This group will increasingly want to make individual provision for their pensions as cuts in welfare benefits reduce state support. That will boost financial services companies offering personal pensions and other suitable savings products. 'The European advertising industry is just beginning to think about addressing the older consumer,' according to Ms Danielle Barr of 3rd Age Marketing in London. 'There are phenomenal opportunities for companies which recognise the growing importance of this market and can succeed in it.' If European businesses do not recognise the opportunities, many US competitors will. American businesses have long recognised the importance of selling to older people, says Ms Frankie Cadwell of Cadwell Davies Partners, a New York advertising firm. Cadwell Davis, a subsidiary of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, specialises in selling to the over-50s, among the wealthiest consumers in the US. 'We are interested in bringing expertise on products and services in the mature market to Europe,' Ms Cadwell says. 'European companies haven't begun to address their ageing home markets as we have in the US.' Why that should be so is hard to explain. For, while there are many uncertainties in longer-term planning of business strategy, one fact is certain. The customers will be much older in 40 years than they are now.</p>

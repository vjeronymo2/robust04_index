			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Russia 'risking aid cuts by slowing reform' THE RUSSIAN government's moves to slacken economic reform and credit policy are threatening aid promised from the west, officials of international economic institutions warned yesterday. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are concerned that concessions the Russian government has had to make, in the face of a conservative onslaught on its reform programme, will render useless the proposed Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) aid announced last week by US President George Bush and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. This is seen as especially true of the Dollars 6bn fund earmarked for the stabilisation of the rouble. One official said last night: 'It is hard to see aid flowing in large amounts if the programme proposed to the IMF is substantially altered. If they don't get what looks like a fixed exchange rate for the rouble they won't get the money to stabilise it.' In the past three days of sessions of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies, the government has made clear that it intends to grant credits of up to Rbs200bn to agriculture and industry, and to raise pensions and other benefits. However, even these concessions may not be enough to placate the deputies. Last night it emerged that the commission preparing a resolution on economic reform, due to be debated today, had narrowly voted to propose that President Boris Yeltsin should be stripped of his emergency powers - including his post as prime minister. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the deputies supporting the government: 'As soon as Yeltsin gives up his powers as prime minister there is no government in Russia any longer. Everything would be paralysed. All of the government would immediately resign.' However, another minister revealed that the cabinet had prepared a list of names of those with whom it would be prepared to work as replacement prime ministers, and another list of names with whom it would not be prepared to work.</p>

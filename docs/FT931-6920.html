			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukrainians in Moscow to seek gas row solution RUSSIAN AND Ukrainian leaders gather for 11th hour talks in Moscow today to find a deal on debts and energy after Russia extended a deadline, which expired yesterday, for cutting off natural gas supplies to Ukraine. Mr Rem Vyakhirev, acting head of Gasprom, the state-owned gas monopoly said that the deliveries could be cut off as early as Sunday unless Ukraine paid world prices for 1bn cubic metres of gas it had received this year. The postponement of the threat is designed to allow for talks beginning today between Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former head of Gasprom and now prime minister of Russia. Although various figures have been provided - ranging from the world price of Dollars 85 per 1,000 cu m to Rbs26,000 (less than Dollars 50 at present exchange rates, including export taxes depending on which Russian official is talking) - it is not quite clear what world prices Russia wants to charge Ukraine. Nor is it clear what Ukraine means when it counters that it will increase transit fees on Russian gas exports to western Europe, 85 per cent of which cross Ukraine. While Ukraine has quoted a transit fee of Dollars 2.2 per 1,000 cu m, Russia says this is far higher than the world average. In an attempt to put western pressure to bear on Ukraine in turn, one Russian official said this week that Russia plans from March 1 to charge western customers for gas as delivered from the Russian-Ukrainian border. This would leave it up to western customers to bully Ukraine into setting an acceptable transit price for their gas supplies. Interfax news agency said yesterday that Gasprom had received permission to sell 20 per cent of its shares to the public but that foreign investors could account for no more than 9 per cent of the company's capital. Its articles of association as a joint-stock company are due to be registered soon by the Justice Ministry. Mr Viktor Kress, the governor of Russia's Siberian Tomsk region, has made a plea for foreign investors to help rejuvenate some 800 oil wells which would increase the western Siberian region's oil output by 2m tonnes a year to 14m. But a decision on whether to hold a tender for new oil-fields in the region has yet to be agreed between the region and the authorities in Moscow. Meanwhile, attempts partly to privatise the region's Tomskneft production company have ground to a halt, the region's privatisation chief, Mr Alexander Petrov, said earlier this week. He said the state-owned enterprise's managers, who want more of the company for themselves and their workers, had gone to Moscow to lobby the federal government for better terms.</p>

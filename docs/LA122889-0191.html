			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DALLAS ENTREPRENEUR SEEKS TO BUY BRANIFF  </P> <P> A Dallas entrepreneur who tried last year to establish an airline for smokers  now wants to purchase Braniff Inc., a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Kay Cohlmia was to meet with representatives of the troubled carrier today, he  told the Orlando Sentinel in a telephone interview. He said he has arranged  financing but would not give details.  </P> <P> Orlando-based Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 28 and has been  short of cash since.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the carrier's unsecured creditors said they have not been  approached by Cohlmia.  </P> <P> In October, Braniff hired Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, an investment banking  company, to find sources of financing, including possible buyers.  </P> <P> Cohlmia, 54, said he worked for Braniff as a baggage handler in the 1960s.  </P> <P> "I love that airline," he said. "It could be the best -- and will be -- if we  buy it."  </P> <P> Describing himself as a "hustler and an idea man," Cohlmia said he would turn  Braniff into a service-oriented airline catering to business fliers.  </P> <P> For 20 years, he operated Cohlmia Aviation Inc., which at its peak used a fleet  of more than 60 planes to ferry checks among banks, he said. It ceased  operating in December, 1987.  </P> <P> In 1988, Cohlmia helped set up the Great American Smokers Club, an organization  based in Texas that wanted to form an airline for smokers only.  </P></p>

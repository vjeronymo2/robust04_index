			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Canary Wharf administrators reassure tenants CANARY WHARF's administr-ators yesterday reassured tenants about their commitment to the development's upkeep and the river bus service, in the first of a series of meetings with the project's occupiers. The administrators told Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the advertising agency, that the river bus service would continue and the project would be maintained and kept secure. Nearly all Olympia &amp; York's 218 estate management staff are continuing to work on the scheme. Other tenant meetings this week will raise the question of whether rents on tenants' former premises taken on by Olympia &amp; York, will still be paid by the administrators. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, which handed responsibility for the leases of 60,000 sq ft of their former premises to Olympia &amp; York, will talk to the administrators today. Its training centre has moved into one of three floors, totalling 80,000 sq ft, in the Canary Wharf tower. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, yesterday called on the government to publish the study which found that a move of civil servants to Docklands represented value for money. In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, Mr Gould said: 'If it (the study) is as convincing as you claim, I am sure that you will be happy to release it into the public domain.' This would be the first test of the government's promise of greater openness, he said. Mr Gould also asked Mr Howard to clarify the inducements offered to civil servants to encourage them to move. He believed Mr Howard told the House of Commons that the civil servants would be assisted wherever they lived, and arrangements would be put in place to minimise the effects of the move. This differed from the report in Hansard that the department's staff would receive staff relocation assistance when they moved to Docklands. Dollars 30m more needed, page 32</p>

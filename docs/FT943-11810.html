			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Institutions call for change at Enterprise Norwich Union and the Prudential Corporation want Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, to surrender his role as chairman. The two institutions, which jointly own 10 per cent of Enterprise's shares, have together had a meeting with Mr Hearne and are waiting to hear how he plans to respond to their concerns. They are the biggest holders of Enterprise shares among investment institutions. There had been widespread speculation that Mr Hearne would be forced by investors, unhappy with his management of Enterprise's failed Pounds 1.6bn bid for Lasmo, to give up his role as chief executive. However, Prudential and Norwich believe it is in shareholders' interest for Mr Hearne to remain as chief executive, a position he has held since 1984, and for a new chairman to be found. The two institutions appear to be on a collision course with Enterprise and its board. It is the board's policy that over the coming two years the company should find a new chief executive to succeed Mr Hearne, who is 56. A friend of Mr Hearne said: 'It could all get very nasty. Graham is in no mood to stand down as chairman'. Mr William Bell, Enterprise's senior non-executive director who until 1991 was chairman of the oil company, is in the process of offering to meet Norwich and the Prudential to discuss their concerns. He will tell them that the company already had a strategy to establish a counterweight to Mr Hearne by the recent appointment of Mr Michael Pink as chief operating officer. The anxieties of the two institutions would not be allayed if Mr Bell were to offer a compromise solution of speeding up the search for a new chief executive, which could be Mr Pink, though he is only a year younger than Mr Hearne.</p>

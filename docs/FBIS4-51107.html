			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Change Our Laws Before It Is Too Late"] </F>   [Text] Someone stands in Victoria Park urging people to  protest about the Hong Kong Government's ability to jail --  indefinitely -- illegal immigrants who are needed as witnesses.    Another writes a letter to a newspaper criticising the Hong  Kong legal system for sentencing a man to six years for a  relatively minor burglary and sending another, who left his  assault victim permanently disabled, to a training school.    A third, who lives in a public housing estate, demonstrates  outside a fancy block of flats and berates wealthy residents for  living in the lap of luxury, while the working classes are  forced to exist in shoe-boxes.    What do these three people have in common? They could, in  theory, be charged with sedition. Ridiculous, you say. In  theory, yes.    But the laws of Hong Kong state clearly that a seditious  intention is an intention:    1) To bring into hatred or contempt or to excite  disaffection  against the administration of justice in Hong Kong.    2) To raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty's  subjects or inhabitants of Hong Kong.    3) To promote feelings of ill will and enmity between  different classes of the population of Hong Kong.    These offences are, in theory, punishable by a long prison  sentence. Of course, they are anachronisms which have been  lying untouched on the statute books for years. No one in the  present administration has ever given the slightest thought to  using them against the Hong Kong public.    But 1997 is looming and with it comes a host of  uncertainties  and unanswered questions. Among them is what will happen to  some of these laws?    It is a good question and one to which no one seems to have  an answer now.    Hong Kong law must be localised before 1997. It is a huge  task and the Government has not consulted China on some areas of  the law. Indeed, Hong Kong officials are still discussing what  to do among themselves.    There appear to be at least three options: rewrite the  legislation; talk to China about it through the Joint Liaison  Group (JLG); or do nothing and leave any changes to the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government.    While the Government ponders what to do, it seems that  members of the Preliminary Working Committee -- the  Beijing-appointed advisers -- are taking a very keen interest in  some of these laws.    It does not take a great leap of imagination to believe that  many of the old laws have a certain appeal to some people in  Beijing.    A few minor changes -- substitute Her Majesty for something  to do with the central government -- and you are in business.  You have some ready-made laws that are so vague, so open to  interpretation, that they could be used against anyone for doing  anything at any time.    According to the Basic Law, the SAR government should enact  laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition and  subversion against the central government and theft of state  secrets. Legislators in Hong Kong are concerned that Beijing  will impose its own legislation if the laws are not changed by  1997.    Most people in Hong Kong will agree that it will be highly  inadvisable to leave many of these relics from another age on  the statute books.    For example, there are some clauses in the laws of Hong Kong  that will send shivers down the spine of anyone who has an  interest in the freedom of the press.    Under the "Power to remove seditious publications" any  police  officer or public officer may: a) enter any premises or place;  b) stop and board any vehicle, tram-car, train or vessel and  remove therefrom or obliterate any seditious publication.    There are other examples and, as Martin Lee has said: "In  Hong Kong, we assume that the rule of law means laws that  protect our rights, freedoms and way of life. But when the laws  themselves are bad, our freedoms are in great danger.    "Thus far, the anachronistic laws restricting press freedom  have not been widely abused because of the link to the UK's  parliamentary democracy ... if the Hong Kong Government were to  behave irresponsibly, heads would conceivably roll in Whitehall.  But even this system of accountability ... will be removed on  June 30, 1997."    The Hong Kong Government has acted on some laws and amended  some ordinances. But it has been pointed out that Britain has  left some draconian laws on the statute books in other Asian  colonies, such as the Singapore Internal Security Act and a  similar law in Malaysia.    There is not a great deal of time left. Hong Kong should  identify all the problem areas. For example, the meaning of the  word subversion needs to be clearly defined, and then invite  China to discuss them through the JLG. [sentence as published]    If an acceptable new version of the laws can be agreed on by  both sides then so much the better. It will be an encouraging  sign that they can come to a sensible decision about a very  important matter.    If no such agreement can be reached then the Hong Kong  Government must take a deep breath and come up with its own  solution. It is impossible for some of these laws to remain on  the books.    They must be updated, improved and made relevant to modern  Hong Kong society.    Whatever the solution, the people charged with the  responsibility had better get a move on.    Time is running out.</p>

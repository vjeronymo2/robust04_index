			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Warburg stages late recovery but falls 11% THERE was a sharp profits recovery in the second half of last year for SG Warburg, the merchant banking group which controls Mercury Asset Management, though for the year as a whole pre-tax profits were down 11 per cent at Pounds 148.2m. Pre-tax profits in the second half, which ended on March 31, were Pounds 97m compared with Pounds 51.2m in the first half. Sir David Scholey, the group's chairman, said: 'At the halfway stage, it did not seem likely that we would be able to show a profit before tax for the year of Pounds 148.2m.' Lord Cairns, the group's chief executive, said that most of the recovery came from the group's debt and equity trading activities, rather than from its advisory businesses. For the year as a whole, profits earned in continental Europe were flat. There was growth in the US contribution, from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 12.5m. Lord Cairns said that the UK and Asia were both 'down a bit'. After tax and the deduction of minority interests' share of earnings, profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 84.3m. The group made a provision of Pounds 16m to cover possible losses on its loans to Isosceles, the financially troubled supermarket group. Of this, Pounds 8m was deducted from reported profits and the rest was charged directly to the group's general provision, which was Pounds 20m in its balance sheet of March 31, 1992. The general provision, after this write-off and after tax relief, is now Pounds 15m. First-half profits had been depressed by the Pounds 11.6m cost of closing the German subsidiary of its Pallas Leasing group. Lord Cairns said its Japanese operation had begun the current year profitably, after numbers employed in Tokyo were reduced last year. However, Japan incurred losses last year amounting to 'a number of millions', he said. The bank's corporate finance department, traditionally the heart of the group, had a quiet year in 1992, but was currently working on a 'substantial pipeline' of possible mergers and acquisitions for corporate clients. He said that the group in general had made a good start to the year and that had been reflected in the board's decision to propose a dividend for the year of 19p, a rise of 5.6 per cent. Earnings per share fell 21 per cent to 39.6p. Lex, Page 20 MAM, Page 22</p>

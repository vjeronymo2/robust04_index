			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Industrial output up slightly in US US INDUSTRIAL production rebounded modestly last month, after a dip in June, but the underlying trend was flat, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. Production rose 0.4 per cent last month largely as a result of a rebound in coal mining - which was depressed in June by a rail strike - and higher output at utilities. The increase reversed a 0.4 per cent fall in June and left industrial output 0.8 per cent higher than a year ago. Manufacturing output was statistically unchanged after a 0.2 per cent decline in June. The figures are consistent with a raft of recent data indicating the US economy is caught in a no man's land: it is neither showing signs of lapsing back into recession nor responding to repeated cuts in interest rates. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York brokerage, said the figures pointed to growth at an annual rate of 1.5-2 per cent, a disappointment for the Bush administration which had hoped for growth of 3 per cent or more in the approach to the November presidential election. In most past recoveries from recession the economy has grown at annual rates of 5 per cent or more. Production was weak in most industrial sectors last month with falls in output of motor vehicles, consumer appliances, defence and space equipment. Yesterday's figures followed reports earlier this week indicating sluggish consumer demand. Retail sales rose 0.5 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent drop in June. Inflation figures, however, were encouraging. The consumer price index rose only 0.1 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in the year to July. Many analysts expect inflation to fall below 3 per cent in the coming year.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Unlikely duo in the world of entertainment: The merger of Blockbuster and Viacom for the Paramount bid It is a blockbuster of a deal, in both name and nature, but the Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.67bn) merger agreement unveiled on Friday night by cable television company Viacom and video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment is getting unenthusiastic early reviews on Wall Street. The deal is the most startling alliance yet to emerge from the five-month-long takeover battle for film and book group Paramount Communications, in which rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network have gathered around them allied media and telecommunications companies. It also looks a considerable coup for Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster chairman, who in seven years has turned the business from a tiny chain into the world's largest video retailing empire. Blockbuster agreed last September to provide Dollars 600m to back Viacom's bid. On Friday, it agreed to put up a further Dollars 1.25bn in return for Viacom stock, allowing Viacom to increase the amount of cash in its cash-and-stock bid for Paramount. At the same time, Viacom has agreed to take over Blockbuster via a stock swap worth some Dollars 8.4bn - a deal meant to go ahead irrespective of whether the alliance wins Paramount. Wall Street is unimpressed. First, the deal seems a convoluted way of keeping highly-leveraged Viacom in the battle for Paramount, particularly as the new offer is in important respects inferior to the offer already on the table from QVC. Viacom has increased its cash offer for just over 50 per cent of Paramount's stock from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105, which compares with Dollars 92 from QVC. But Paramount has lowered the value of the securities being offered for the remaining 49 per cent to Dollars 52, based on Friday's closing stock prices, compared with around Dollars 75 from QVC. Viacom's total bid is thus worth around Dollars 78 a share, while QVC's stands at Dollars 83. Second, Wall Street is sceptical as to what Viacom will gain from a merger with Blockbuster, apart from immediate access to cash, a better chance of winning an already expensive Paramount, and a somewhat stronger balance sheet. At first glance, the two appear complementary. Viacom's main business is the creation of entertainment 'software', through cable television channels such as MTV, the pop music network, and Nickelodeon, a channel for children. Blockbuster's main business is entertainment distribution, through video rentals. Some analysts question the benefits of linking these two sides. The rental business looks very vulnerable to the revolution in the US communications industries. This promises a world of inter-active, multi-media home entertainment, where consumers can call up a movie at the touch of a button, rather than trudging to a video store. Blockbuster is the creation of Mr Huizenga, who started out as a rubbish collector and built this into Waste Management (now known as WMX Technologies), America's largest rubbish removal company. He retired from Waste Management in 1984 and three years later invested in the then tiny Blockbuster. Blockbuster now accounts for some 15 per cent of the US home video market and has 3,500 stores in nine countries. Even though the US rental market is mature, its income and revenue (Dollars 142m and Dollars 1.2bn in 1992) have been growing strongly, partly by capturing business from smaller rivals and partly from diversification. Blockbuster is now the third largest record retailer in the US, and has a separate joint venture with Britain's Virgin to develop music mega-stores. None of Blockbuster's diversifications will add significantly to the impressive software assets that would be fielded by a merger of Viacom and Paramount, and analysts are sceptical of the claims by Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, that Blockbuster gives him 'extraordinary capacity to exploit worldwide opportunities' in the entertainment business. Admittedly, Viacom is not paying much of a premium to gain control of Blockbuster. Shareholders are being offered around Dollars 31 a share, which compares with Blockbuster's close on Friday of Dollars 28 1/4 and a 52-week high of Dollars 34 1/4 . The 70-year-old Mr Redstone will retain control of the combined group, with 61 per cent of its voting stock, while Mr Huizenga, 55, will become vice-chairman. Friday's deal has left some analysts wondering not only if Mr Redstone has the firepower to win Paramount, but whether he may have just hitched a ride into the brave new multi-media future on the technological equivalent of a horse and buggy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PICTURE AT PARAMOUNT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Paramount  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Market capitalisation:          Dollars 9.3bn Employees                       12,650 Sep 12                          Viacom announces dollars 8bn agreed                                 takeover of Paramount.

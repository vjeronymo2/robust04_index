The  Greeks have broken the EU's economic legislation with their  trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM]. But Athens is to be given a maximum of two months  respite to lift the embargo; otherwise a trial will take place  in Luxembourg.    Legal action against Greece became more probable after 11  European foreign ministers meeting in the Greek town of Ioannina  on Sunday [27 March] unanimously condemned Athens's actions  against FYROM. The European Commission (EC) had asked the  ministers to give a political judgement before the Commission  took action against Greece.    Commission President Jacques Delors said that the crisis  between Greece and FYROM had too many political aspects for the  issue to be written off as simply an infringement of European  law. The ministers have now given the judgement asked of them.    Only Luxembourg Minister Jacques Poos tried to reach a  compromize during the informal European ministerial council  meeting in Ioannina. He suggested that Greece should lift the  embargo, and in exchange the EU would negotiate with FYROM about  the sticking points between Greece and FYROM.    The Greeks want FYROM to remove the "Star of Vergina" from  its flag, because it is regarded by Athens as a Greek symbol.  The Greeks also feel that FYROM's Constitution calls for the  absorption of the Greek province of Macedonia. Greece, a member  of NATO, apparently feels threatened by FYROM's 6,000-strong  Army.    Poos's compromise was unacceptable for German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel in particular. The proposal would mean  that the EU fully identified with the Greek demands. The  foreign ministers rejected the defense of Greek Foreign Minister  Theo Pangalos that Athens had announced the embargo for security  reasons.    An EU member state is allowed to take measures which  restrict  trade if its external security is threatened, according to  European rules. Pangalos believes that the European treaty also  allows the rules to be diverged from if there is a danger to  domestic security.    The violent demonstrations in Thessaloniki, Athens, and  elsewhere against FYROM are claimed as proof that Greece's  domestic security is at stake. Pangalos's arguments were found  wanting by Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans.    Now that the 11 foreign ministers are sticking by their  condemnation of Greece, the Commission, as the guardian of  European economic legislation, can no longer hold off from legal  action. European Foreign Affairs Commissioner Van den Broek said  on Sunday in Ioannina that a distinction would be made between  the EU's legal case against Greece on the one hand and the  continuation of the search for a political solution on the other.    Right from the start the Commission has tried to convince  Greece politically to lift the embargo against FYROM. At the  end of February, Van den Broek shuttled between Athens and FYROM.    He looked into the possibilities of an agreement between the  two countries. His conclusion was that the lifting of the  embargo would free the way for negotiations with FYROM. On  Sunday in Ioannina, Van den Broek once again called for a  political solution. However, it is not the EU which is playing  the main role in this respect, but the UN American mediator  Cyrus Vance.</p>

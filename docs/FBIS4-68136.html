			<p>BFN     [Text] The terrorist Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front  [IGERF] has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack against  the building that houses the Ankara branch of the Grand Hall of  the Freemason Organization. Last night two unidentified persons  hurled a bomb at 17 Tuna Avenue, Kizilay. The attack caused the  security forces and the people who live in the area to be  alarmed. The bomb exploded in the window of the keeper's  bedroom in the basement of the building. Luckily no one was  hurt.    An anonymous person called the newspaper SABAH immediately  after the attack. He said: We assume responsibility for the  attack on behalf of IGERF. We shall eradicate the roots of the  freemasons. Our activities will be maintained.</p>

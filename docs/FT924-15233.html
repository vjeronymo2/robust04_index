			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Building society mergers warning BUILDING society mergers involve more snags than is generally realised and firm guidelines must be followed to ensure the combined society is strong, according to Touche Ross Management Consultants. Its report appears when many large and medium-sized building societies concede privately that mergers are necessary to enable them to survive until the end of the decade. Even so, there has not been a merger of two top ten societies for more than five years because of the difficulties involved. Touche Ross said that mergers between societies of relatively equal size are more difficult than those between a large society and a small one, and such mergers often turn out worse financially. It says that both sides involved have to define business objectives clearly at the outset and keep track at each stage of whether financial and other targets are being met. Touche Ross says that even when managers on the two sides have the best of intentions, a merger creates a new management team that may find itself operating in an entirely different business context from those of either society before the merger. Touche Ross identifies information systems strategy as the second-greatest area of difficulty for merged societies. Combining the computer systems of two societies may take several years and it may be impossible to serve all customers of the combined new society at every branch.

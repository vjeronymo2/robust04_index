			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Modest pick-up in economy THE US economy is growing at a steady but moderate pace, figures for factory output and the housing market indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said industrial production rose 0.2 per cent last month and 3.5 per cent in the year to May. It revised upward production figures for March and April to show monthly gains of 0.2 per cent, rather than the zero and 0.1 per cent increase previously reported. The figures for factory output represent a sharp slowdown from winter, when monthly gains averaged about 0.7 per cent. The weakest sector last month was vehicle production, which fell 3.6 per cent relative to April. However, most analysts expect firmer industrial growth later this year provided domestic demand continues to revive after a weak first quarter. Housing starts rose 2.4 per cent between April and May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24m. Figures for April were revised upward to show an 8.1 per cent increase from March. The recovery of starts followed sharp declines in the first quarter when bad weather hit the housing market. Last month's increase was concentrated in the mid-west and south. Building permits - a good guide to future construction plans - also rose modestly last month after a sharp gain in the month of April. The two sets of figures point to a modest acceleration in economic growth this quarter after a disappointing 0.9 per cent annual rate of expansion during the year's opening three months.</p>

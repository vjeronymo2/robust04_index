			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F> and guest Jose Alejandro Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live  or recorded]    [Text] [Roque] Jose Alejandro Rodriguez, of the weekly  JUVENTUD REBELDE, is here with us today to discuss the  self-employment issue. As you know, this activity has prompted  many different opinions on whether this activity should be  allowed in this time of crisis in our country. Alejandro, your  idea please.    [Rodriguez] Yes, Juan Carlos. The self-employment activity  as  a labor system in the country was implemented some five months  ago by Decree Law 141. But like anything that breaks the  routine, anything that introduces something new, the  self-employment issue has prompted a major conflict in our  society.    [Roque] There are many skeptics...    [Rodriguez] Yes. And there are many aspects to discuss. But  I  will refer only to the extreme positions. There are those who  propose an unrestricted promotion of that activity, without any  control whatsoever. And there are those who are very suspicious,  fearful, and take this activity as a change in the social and  economic projection of our social activity. But I think we must  put this activity on a scale. We must take this self-employment  as a new activity joining the Cuban labor system. We must take  it as a feasible alternative, something that will reduce the  employment problem at this time of recession, and as a  possibility, an alternative way of providing services and  consumable goods to the people under severe economic conditions.    [Roque] The people must understand that this is the first  decree, the first measure being adopted, and that all measures  have to go through several stages. The first stage is to prepare  the measure and then to publish it. Then it must be implemented;  the consolidation of the measure will come afterwards. This is  important because consolidation cannot be achieved overnight. It  is a process that takes time.    [Rodriguez] I agree. But we must also take it in a good  sense, as a great prospect. We cannot take all the measures  being adopted in the Cuban economy as a partial solution, as a  temporary patch-up solution to current problems, but as a  prospect of how our economy will be designed for the future. I  think this is very important. All these measures are qualitative  changes. I am one of those who are convinced of the economic and  political feasibility of self- employment, although it must be  submitted to rigorous control and oversight. But I am also  convinced that it must be submitted to other economic control  systems, to discipline the work of these individuals who are  self-employed. I also think that well established and well  controlled self-employment as a social discipline is a useful  activity and must be defended. Besides, I think the people will  appreciate this activity because in the end we will all benefit  from it.    [Roque] Jose, you were just talking about the control that  must be imposed on self-employed workers. Why? There are those  who talk about the deviation of state resources. It is true,  this deviation of resources is a common practice. But why are  they deviated?    [Rodriguez] The deviation of resources must not be related  to  the self-employment activity. Sometimes we mistake the images of  things with the things themselves: the consequences with the  causes. The deviation is one problem, a weak and vulnerable side  of our economy that occurs in many areas of the Cuban economy.    [Roque] Let us take this under the current situation.    [Rodriguez] Of course, deviation of resources can also take  place in the self-employment area. When there is no stable state  supply of products to sell, these people could be using deviated  or illegal resources....    [Roque, interrupting] But we cannot stop being objective.  This is real. This is taking place, and we cannot avoid it.    [Rodriquez] That is right. But what we have, we cannot....  [pauses] Since this harmful practice can be reversed, and since  it can also become common practice, we cannot confront this  problem in the final stage, when the man is already selling the  product. I think the control problem affects all aspects of our  economy; and that must be resolved at the root, at the place  where the money is deviated. But it is also good to create  justice, Juan Carlos. We must not be mistaken, because people  often identify self- employed workers as individuals who only  want to rob the people through dirty tricks, individuals who  profit from the people's needs, and individuals who are  deviating resources.    [Roque] That is not always true.    [Rodriguez] No. I know honest people and hard workers. And  Decree 141 was made for those people, for those who want to make  a living by honest work, perhaps a better living than average  but a living supported by their work, by an honest and clean  activity.    [Roque] However, honest work demands clear and continuous  control. How can this be achieved? Is the country prepared for  strict control of self-employment?    [Rodriguez] The first impression is that the country is not  prepared. But this decree has been in effect for only five  months. These changes are taking place in a very dynamic way;  besides, this is a very decentralized activity. It will not be  resolved by the state council or by any ministry. This will be  solved at the level of the people's council, or at the municipal  level. We already have some experience on this. There are  provinces and there are regions. There are places where  self-employment activity is more intense, as in Holguin, for  instance. But this is the place also where it is more rigorously  controlled, and where there is the greatest will to implement it  because people are convinced that it is useful and is a way of  solving many daily and social problems.    But the role of the people's council is decisive. The  council  must decide on this activity in its territory. The measures are  written, but they must be fulfilled. There are also other  control elements. I an certain that in times of absolute  shortage, of scarcity, it is possible that some people would be  helping others to sell things, to use illegal resources. But  there are other aspects as well. We must look at this activity  in a realistic manner. To the extent that our economy is  reactivated, as production increases, there will always be the  possibility that self-employed workers will gradually be  supplied raw materials and provisions purchased from the state.    [Roque] What about the consolidation stage? This is an  important stage. We can talk about advantages, about the  negative and positive aspects of a given activity, especially  when measures are adopted to solve this set of problems, and  when a new activity emerges, such as the supply of staples by  the self-employed.    [Rodriguez] As for the consolidation stage, obviously there  are also other control measures. A new decree on violations is  under discussion. This decree will cover and punish all  irregularities in this area. I believe a strong oversight body  will be created. But there is another problem: economic changes  and tax policy. The self-employed must now pay a minimum tax.  But this tax is variable, and must be increased in accordance  with the increase in their income. The income declaration is  something new for us and is a way to control the self-employed.    [Roque] We are now getting to the end of our program. Can  you  make a final analysis of the subject we are discussing?    [Rodriguez] I simply want to stress the fact that among all  the transformations taking place in the economic area,  self-employment represents an alternative that supplements other  activities. I think it is a useful activity and a way of seeking  development. It is also an opportunity for a group of persons to  develop their potentials in a decentralized, simple, and dynamic  manner, to render services and goods to the people. But this  activity, to prevent abuses, must be subject to strict social  discipline and control. It must be demonstrated to society that  this is an honest activity, and that individual initiatives must  be promoted, though in a controlled manner, observing the rules  of cleanliness and of service to society.    Today I wanted to talk about the good and honest  self-employed workers who seek to make a living through their  honest effort, work, and initiative.    [Roque] Everything you are saying creates an economic  culture, an economic culture the country needs today more than  ever. But we can also say that this economic culture has not  been sufficiently assimilated, not only by the people, but also  by those who are in charge of leading important activities like  this.    [Rrodriguez] Yes. I think we must strive for the development  of this alternative, of this new activity. We hope it will grow  healthy and develop well because it is also a way of providing  alternatives to the people, alternative solutions to our  problems, of coexisting with them without fear, because I am  certain that it will not disrupt the current economic policy. It  is only a necessary supplement of activities, which will make  economic relations more dynamic.    [Roque] Our appreciation to Jose Alejandro Rodriguez for  participating with us in this program.</p>

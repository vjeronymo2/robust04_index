			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Two Taiwan police cruise  boats recently completed patrols of the Nansha [Spratly]  Islands, the first such move by Taiwan Police, according to  reports from Taiwan.    The primary task for the cruise by the two police 400-DWT  Boats was to survey the waters around Taiping Island and chart  routes from Taiwan to Taiping in order to provide important  information for the establishment of a peacekeeping force on the  island and facilitate future sails for ships and fleets.    According to the reports, on patrol were two associate  geology chief engineers of the "China Petroleum Corporation" in  Taiwan. They were to survey sites with exploitable oil and gas.  Meanwhile, a fisheries research boat named "Yuxun No.2"  carrying 31 oceanology experts joined the cruise.    According to reports, the Taiwan regime has reiterated that  the Nansha Islands are an inseparable part of China and  sovereignty belongs to China. In December 1992, the Taiwan  regime set up "the South China Sea Group" and mapped out an  "outline on South China Sea policies." Such policies aim to  firmly safeguard the sovereign rights in the South China Sea.  In September 1993, a large-scale, high-level symposium was held  on the South China Sea, called by Taiwan's "Ministry of the  Interior". Addressing the opening ceremony, Lien Chan noted  that no country can deny the fact that the islands in the South  China Sea belong to China whether in legal principle or from the  historical perspective. Officials from Taiwan's "Ministry of  the Interior" said that Taiwan will continue irregular patrols  to the South China Sea in the future.</p>

Mention of the interconnectedness of our country and the world was  minimal, and nothing was written that addressed the basic problem: too many  people. Too many people seeking the high standard of living now enjoyed by the  few developed nations, and those few already too many in relation to  consumption of world resources.  </P> <P> WILLARD OLNEY, Hesperia  </P></p>

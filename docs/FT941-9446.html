			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Technology: Plastic that grows on trees - The dream of a harvestable biopolymer could be soon be a reality Picture groves of 'plastic bushes' that produce plastic in the same way cotton plants make cotton. This is not an image from a whimsical Beatles song. It is a dream that scientists say will become reality by the end of the decade. The goal is to create a harvestable polymer that can be used to make everything from throw-away consumer plastics to car parts. 'Natural' plastic is not a new idea. In the 1970s, the oil crisis spawned research in the field when the future of petroleum-based plastics seemed under threat. Later, environmental concerns heightened interest in the material, which biodegrades rapidly. Petroleum-based plastic is not only one of the most difficult materials to recycle, it also has an inconveniently long life, often taking hundreds of years to decompose. With communities desperate to cut down on landfill volume, biodegradable plastic is an appealing concept. Early research into non-petroleum-based plastic faltered, but advances in genetic engineering over the past few years have re-awakened interest in the idea. 'Plants are the way to go because they would be the cheapest form of production,' says Anthony Sinskey, professor of microbiology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an adviser to Metabolix, the US biotechnology group. Sinskey says he and his colleagues have been able to capture the genes in certain bacteria that are responsible for producing biosynthetic material. 'Ten years ago, research in this area got stuck because the producing enzymes were difficult to purify and control,' Sinskey says. 'Molecular biology has changed the focus because now we can move the genetic information around, either to bacteria which reproduce rapidly, or ideally, to plants. 'Sunlight, which plants tap, is ultimately cheaper than petroleum or the glucose or lactose used in today's fermentation methods, and the plants don't have to make a lot of the material to make it economically worthwhile.' By transferring the plastic-producing genes to seeds, plants could theoretically be made to make polyester fibres. 'Potatoes and mushrooms might be good possibilities - we are experimenting with them,' says Tillman Gerngross, a research scientist at Metabolix. 'But so far, we have only been able to produce the reaction in a glass tube.' Plastic-making plants still may be a dream, but several companies have already scored successes with other methods. Britain's Zeneca, for example, is making biodegradable polymers from bacteria. The company sells biodegradable shampoo bottles under the brand name Biopol, and is exploring other potential uses for the material, including plastic film. US-based Cargill is also making biodegradable plastics, and plans to dedicate much of a new plant in Nebraska to making plastics from cornstarch. 'We see a big market in plastic-coated cardboard and diapers (nappies),' says Patrick Gruber, director of Ecopla, Cargill's biodegradable plastics division. Warner-Lambert of the US, which produced plastics from starch, even ran some trials at Disney World with a line of biodegradable utensils. The company also began selling peanut wrappers and composting bags. But these early forays met with limited success. Warner-Lambert decided to back out of the business in 1993 after several years of research. 'To get where we'd want to go with this, it would take a lot of money and time,' the group said. 'So we decided to concentrate on our core businesses instead.' Warner-Lambert, best known for pharmaceuticals, is still looking for a buyer for its bioplastics technology. There are two big problems with current biodegradable plastics. First, they are expensive to make, running to three or more times the cost of producing petroleum-based plastic. Second, early trials created weak materials that began to disintegrate under moist conditions and stick to the hands of the user. Scientists hope the latest advances will not only improve the quality of the final product but will also bring down costs. Petroleum-based plastic is extremely cheap as well as highly versatile. One of the keys to making natural plastics cheaper, says Dave Barstow, general manager of the biopolymers division at Zeneca, is ensuring that the plastics can be used easily in current moulding machines. 'Businesses won't buy a new machine to accommodate this product, so that is key to our long-term success,' he explains. Many in the market believe they may eventually be helped by increased environmental awareness. Companies concerned with their ecological image may adopt the idea of using the materials for packaging, and local government may step in. 'There is always the possibility that we may get some subsidies from communities worried about landfills and the high cost of recycling plastic,' says Edward Muller, chief executive officer of Metabolix. Still, Muller insists that the real key to success is in producing a cheap, easy-to-use material of exceptional quality. For that reason, Metabolix, along with other groups like Zeneca, is looking beyond biodegradability to plastics with superior performance qualities. 'We are exploring the material's advantages in electrical conductivity and resistance at different temperatures,' Muller explains, 'to see if we can find some potential new uses.' Another important potential market would be in drug delivery systems. 'Because the materials break down quickly over time, they could be used as capsules to release medicine over a short period to the body,' says David Kaplan, senior scientist with the biotechnology division of the Natick Army Labs, which uses US federal grant money to conduct research in the field. With a number of hurdles to overcome, non-petroleum-based plastics probably have a long way to go before they become a leading force in the worldwide plastics market. Still, research in the area is advancing, and interest in biodegradable plastics is strong. If all goes well in the laboratories, by the end of the decade seasonal workers may be hired for the summer on plastic plantations.</p>

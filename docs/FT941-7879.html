			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo rethinks indicators A leading member of Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday advocated the adoption of informal 'effort indicators' as a part of Japan's market opening measures. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the Japan Renewal Party and backroom mastermind of the coalition, said he opposed managed trade but supported the adoption of voluntary trade targets which Japan will make every effort to achieve, but would not be held to account if not met. The calls come after US threats to impose trade sanctions following the breakdown of US-Japan bilateral framework talks. The failure was blamed on Japan's staunch opposition to US demands for numerical targets on foreign market share. Mr Ozawa's comments spurred expectations on the foreign exchange market of a compromise over trade between the US and Japan, pushing the yen below the Y106 level for the first time in a week before closing down Y0.72 at Y105.95 to the dollar. The Japanese currency soared following the collapse of talks on speculation that the US would try to 'talk up' the yen to curb Japan's mounting surplus.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Clinton warned on limiting pension rises: Plan to cut cost of living increases will be a 'landmine' says finance committee chief PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was given early warning yesterday that any proposal to limit the automatic cost of living increases in social security pensions would face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the finance committee, through which any such proposal must pass, described the idea as 'a landmine' and 'a death wish'. He added: 'Let's get it out of the way right now.' Retirement benefits, he insisted, were not an entitlement, but the fruits of fully paid-up insurance and were disbursed out of a trust fund that was in comfortable surplus. However, Senator Moynihan said he was prepared to talk about increasing income taxes on pension benefits, another option known to be under consideration by the Clinton cabinet, which finished a weekend of deliberations on deficit reduction and economic stimulation at the Camp David retreat yesterday afternoon. A temporary freeze on pension cost of living adjustments has been proposed by Mr Leon Panetta, Mr Clinton's budget director, apparently with the support of some influential Democratic members of Congress such as Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader. Retirement benefits account for about one quarter of the federal budget and a one-year freeze on indexed increases could save as much as Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.9bn) in the first year. Sen Moynihan, however, disputed these calculations. Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, the Democratic chairman of the national governor's conference, which is holding its winter meeting here, also said yesterday that changes in social security as part of the deficit reduction plan had to be 'on the table'. The only semi-authoritative comment from the administration came from Mr Roger Altman, the deputy treasury secretary, who said, neutrally, in a television interview recorded before the Camp David discussions began that he did not know which way the decision on indexation would fall. But he added; 'There are some people who are strongly opposed.' Mr Altman did confirm that the stimulus package under consideration was 'roughly Dollars 20bn' - made of about Dollars 15bn in additional spending and Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn 'on the tax side'. Changes in social security payments invariably provoke intense controversy and Mr Clinton has had enough of this in his first 10 days in office. But Mr Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, warned yesterday not to read too much into early reverses for the president. Two weekend polls suggested that Mr Clinton's popularity is still holding up quite well. Weekend newspapers were also filled with much introspection over whether the media were being too hard on the new president and were possibly out of touch with the nation at large. The essence, but not all the details, of Mr Clinton's proposals is to be contained in his first state of the union message on February 17, to be followed by his first budget about a month later. The Clinton administration plans an initiative to remove constraints on bank lending and help ease the credit crunch, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said yesterday, sending the strongest signal yet on bank policy, Reuter reports. 'We are going to make a major effort to try to alleviate those supply side constraints on lending,' he said.</p>

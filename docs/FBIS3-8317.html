			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Regular" Friday interview with Prime Minister Vladimir </F> Meciar by correspondent Martin Bartisek; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Bartisek] The work aimed at gaining the  necessary 350,000 signatures required to call a referendum on  early elections ended last week. It appears that more  signatures than required have been obtained and that all of the  documents still have to be checked. But time is seemingly  against this endeavor.    Prime Minister, you have proposed 25-26 June as the date of  the election. But this means that the elections will have to be  officially called on 2 April at the latest. With regard to the  demanding nature of the measures that will have to be  implemented, this date appears to be virtually unrealistic. Do  you still think that elections can take place on this date?    [Meciar] Yes, I do. First, Mr. President does not have to  wait the whole 30 days. He could speed up his decision.  Equally, there is always a chance that the political entities  represented in the National Council [of the Slovak Republic]  might reach an agreement on holding elections earlier. After  all, opposition parties have been calling for early elections  the entire year, and now, when they have a chance, they scream  that they are not ready.    There are two criteria that should be considered. The basic  criterion is what is the interest of the state. The interest of  the state is to resolve this parliamentary crisis as soon as  possible because the economic and social effect of this crisis  on citizens and on the state is very serious. If we consider  the interest of the state to be a priority issue, nobody should  hesitate as to whether elections should or should not be held in  June. If, on the other hand, we take into consideration the  interests of political parties, the elections will take place as  late as possible.    We would act irresponsibly toward our state if we were to  subordinate the interests of the state to people like Mr.  Knazko, the chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, Mr. Cernak,  the chairman of the national democratic faction in the Slovak  National Party, and former Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac  until they have built up their parties. We would act  irresponsibly if we were to let the economy and the social  sphere be tossed around in uncertainty, if we let the name of  our state be questioned abroad. Here we can see a line dividing  us from those who apply their past attitude toward the state to  current conditions.    No matter what the election result, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia will have to lend its support to the  interests of the state and to give utmost priority to this  interest, while the movement's election results and interests  should take second place. Others should do the same thing, and  this would then clarify the election date issue. [passage  omitted]    [Bartisek] I do not think we have reached any significant  positive turning point since our last interview, when we agreed  that the internal political crisis had deepened in a certain  way. The failure to fill two ministerial posts in your Cabinet  continues to be alarming and, for the present Slovakia--I will  put this openly--it is to a certain degree disadvantageous. You  have said that somebody who is good enough to be a deputy prime  minister is good enough to be entrusted with the post of a  foreign minister. Can you clarify your statement a little?    [Meciar] To put it clearly, I would be at fault if my  failure  to put forward proposals resulted in not having ministerial  posts filled. However, in fact, we have to share responsibility  also with the person who failed to accept my proposals, without  giving any reason for doing so.    The fact that President Michal Kovac expressed a lack of  confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, supporter of  European integration, whom he had considered acceptable [as a  deputy prime minister] and whom he refuses now to consider  acceptable as a foreign minister, is a matter of political and  ethical dimension. It is not restricted to a legal  dimension--the field where the law does not oblige the president  to give any reasons for his actions.    The selection of a new foreign minister is now being  discussed in our talks with other political subjects. The issue  is whether, in the period until the elections, the Cabinet  should be joined by members of other parties. Talks are under  way. We should be clear about the fundamental stance on 7 March.  Once we are clear about our stance, we can take further  decisions to solve this burning problem.    I am alarmed by the fact that, after having a crisis  introduced in the parliament, the failure to meet each other  halfway on personnel issues is also being introduced in the  Cabinet. However, we will not allow this to have an impact on  the way the Cabinet functions. This will not happen. The Cabinet  functions and works as responsibly as possible.    [Bartisek] New candidates should emerge following coalition  talks between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the  Slovak National Party. [passage omitted]    [Meciar] I would wait before drawing any conclusions.  There is no doubt that, as far as the privatization post is  concerned, the candidate will be generally acceptable. As far  as foreign affairs are concerned, I will take into account not  only the coalition talks between the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia and the Slovak National Party because one or two other  partners are being considered, too. Perhaps the Foreign Affairs  Ministry will be the post where we reach an agreement to widen  [the range of the Cabinet]. [passage omitted]    [Bartisek] Coexistence Chairman Mikulas Duray made a rather  important statement addressed to Slovak political parties when  he said: Some government coalition statements have created a  political configuration that might be described as representing  fascism with a human face.    This image literally creates fear. Therefore, I would ask  you  for clarification coming from you as the coalition  representative.    [Meciar] Mr. Duray should own up to responsibility for his  statements.    He has already called the government fascist. This is  nothing  new in his vocabulary. He repeats such statements. Following  the first accusation, the authorities began criminal  proceedings, but, because he is a deputy of the [former  Czechoslovak] Federal Assembly, it is not clear who has the  power to strip him of parliamentary immunity. If this is done  by the Slovak National Council, it would mean that by doing so  they accept all deputies of the Federal Assembly as full members  of the representative body. This is why the affair came to a  standstill and they have asked the Constitutional Court for  interpretation. This is preventing the bodies that are  responsible for dealing with such statements and that are  drawing conclusions regarding personal responsibility from  concluding the matter.    Let me present some facts. No one can doubt the fact that  the Slovak Republic has been recognized abroad. The signing of  the association agreement means the recognition of the Slovak  Republic's democratic regime. The fact that we have gained  access to the Council of Europe means recognition of our  democratic regime. We have joined Partnership for  Peace--without the recognition of a democratic regime there is  no partnership.    We have to stop this self-damaging, self-degrading, and  self-destructing carried out by Slovak Republic citizens,  regardless of their nationality. Elections have to take place,  among other reasons, to give our citizens a chance to tell those  who are engaged in this self-destruction, who are tearing our  society apart: We have had enough of you; we do not want you  anymore; go somewhere else--do not do these things from inside  the parliament. This is why I think that a purification through  elections will also help regarding this aspect. [passage  omitted]</p>

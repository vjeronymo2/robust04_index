Christopher at a meeting of the U.S. Senate's subcommittee  on  March 2 had said that according to the legislation adopted in  Latvia, Russians cannot become citizens of the country and have  no right to vote.    The U.S. Ambassador in his explanation said that Christopher  apparently had not been precise enough, as it was clear that  many ethnic Russians are Latvian citizens and have the right to  vote in elections.    The Latvian foreign minister also expressed worries about  Christopher's remarks that Russia had the right to stimulate  Latvians to extend the citizen's status to a wider circle of  residents and grant the voting right also to the Russians living  in the country.    The ambassador said that it was only the ethnic Russians  living in Latvia who were referred to in Christopher's  statement. The remarks also had indicated only legal and  democratic methods of action by the Russians toward achieving a  settlement of the citizenship issue, only attempts to convince  the Latvians that the interests of ethnic Russians should be  taken into account.    Silins in his concluding remarks pointed out that there was  no change in the United States position in principle toward  Latvia, and that this was also in evidence during recent visits  by Latvian delegations to the United States, as well as in  permanent support to Latvia by U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The ambassador at the conversation also asked about the  process of the Latvian-Russian talks.    He said the U.S. ambassadors to Central and Eastern Europe  were scheduled to meet in Warsaw soon.</p>

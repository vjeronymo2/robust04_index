			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate named a 12-member committee to hear evidence in the impeachment  trial of U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is serving a  five-year prison term for perjury. Senators acted after Rep. Jack Brooks  (D-Tex.) came to the Senate floor to formally notify them of Nixon's  impeachment by the House on grounds he lied to a grand jury and federal  prosecutors. Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, reviewed the  three articles of impeachment against Nixon, approved 417 to 0, and told  senators the House "demands his conviction and appropriate judgment thereon."  Senators then acted to summon Nixon, who is incarcerated at Eglin Air Force  Base in Florida.  </P></p>

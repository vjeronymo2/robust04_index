			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "More Orders for Eastern Germany"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 25 Apr -- In 1993, the FRG placed over 17  million German marks [DM] in orders from the new laender, says a  second report on federal orders from east German enterprises  which Reinhard Goehner [Christian-Democratic Union],  parliamentary secretary of state in the Economics Ministry,  placed before the government on Tuesday [19 April]. According  to the report, over DM11 billion in federal orders went to  eastern Germany in the second half of 1993, an increase of 5  percent against the first half of the year. Goehner spoke of a  "very satisfactory report," especially because it takes into  account the many large infrastructure investments in the new  laender. More than 90 percent of federal construction projects  in the new laender were carried out by east German enterprises.  In 1992, only about DM7.5 billion in federal orders went to  eastern Germany. Goehner said that developments indicate the  chancellor's calls for double the volume of orders from the new  laender have been largely fulfilled. The point now is to keep up  this figure. Apart from the orders initiative of German  industry, which ordered about DM35 billion in goods and services  in the new laender in 1993, the FRG's efforts are a major  contribution to the boom in eastern Germany. Success is due  mainly to east Gemran enterprises' entitlement to participate in  cheap west German tenders, whereby east German enterprises can  execute an order for the same price as the cheapest German  bidder. To encourage the emergence of a middle class, these  enterprises will be paid a bonus of up to 5 percent,  irrespective of the size of the order. Goehner appeared  disappointed that no other west German land apart from Hesse and  Berlin had adopted the preferential guidelines for east German  enterprises.</p>

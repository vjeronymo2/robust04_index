			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Reform of counties is revised THE LOCAL Government Commission yesterday moved closer to conflict with the government by announcing drastically revised plans to restructure councils in Derbyshire and Durham. In the commission's final recommendations for both counties urban areas have been split off to form all-purpose 'unitary' authorities, with the two-tier structure of counties and districts retained for the 'doughnut-shaped' rural areas remaining. Plans announced by the commission in May called for the two-tier structure to be abandoned in both counties. Original proposals to abolish Cleveland county council and split it into four unitary districts have been retained, however. Sir John Banham, commission chairman, tried to avert a split with the Department of the Environment, which has called for unitary authorities, even if they create greater expense. He told Mr David Curry, local government minister, that district councils could make new joint proposals for unitary authorities in the areas where he had called for the status quo to be retained. He ruled out creating unitary authorities on existing district boundaries. The government has six weeks to respond to the proposals. The Association of District Councils, which is opposed to the proposals for both Derbyshire and Durham, said districts would be producing options for merged councils. Employers gave the proposals a frosty reception. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern region chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, said the proposals for Cleveland were 'a complete mess'. He said: 'It's going to be a greater burden of cost, and a greater burden of bureaucracy on the businesses of the area.'</p>

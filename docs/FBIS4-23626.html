			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 11 (AFP) -- Nigerian police Saturday [11  June] closed down the Concord press group, owned by Chief  Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last June's presidential  election who earlier in the day was placed under house arrest.    Around 80 policemen armed with assault rifles burst into the  group's premises in the northern suburb of Ikeja and ordered all  personnel out of the offices and cut off all access to the  building, an AFP correspondent at the scene reported.    The Concord, the group's flagship daily, has stepped up its  criticism of Nigeria's military regime over the past week,  calling for the restoration of democracy and the formation of a  government of national unity under Abiola.    The millionaire businessman, widely seen as having won the  presidential poll on June 12, 1993 that was subsequently  annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, was  preparing to declare an alternative government when he was  placed under house arrest early Saturday morning.    The Concord group comprises around a dozen publications.</p>

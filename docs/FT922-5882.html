			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (4): Looking across frontiers - The UK / Examining the health of its container makers THE UK packaging industry is large by any measure: it has an annual turnover of about Pounds 8.5bn, and represents some 10 per cent of GDP. A service as well as a manufacturing industry, it has much to contribute to current UK industry demands for efficiency, economy and reliability. Over the last five years it has also had to react to environmental demands - or what its main customers, the food and beverage producers, see as consumers' 'green' demands. It has also, like most UK industrial sectors, been forced to react to the coming of the single European market which has brought with it a jostling for position among the larger materials and containers companies both from within the Community and outside. UK businesses have bought into continental European footholds, and vice versa - especially where it makes no sense to transport air in empty containers across long distances. UK companies and their continental competitors have also set up sales organisations across Europe, so as to be able to operate across national frontiers more easily. America, Japan and Scandinavia, the other homes of advanced packaging technology, have been anxious,too, that the large EC market should not close its doors on them, and companies from these centres continue to acquire or start EC based European companies. Typical of this is the Scandinavian move into the UK board industry and PLM's takeover of Redfearn Glass. In June 1990, the UK's largest independent paper and packaging company, Reedpack, went into foreign ownership when it was taken over - for Pounds 1.44bn - by Swedish group Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), although it has since divested parts of the business - for example, RPC Containers (the plastics containers company), acquired by the management just over a year ago. The other main pre-occupation of the industry, however, over the past two years has been the state of the domestic and international economy. With approximately two thirds of materials and containers being used for food and drink, and a further 5 per cent for pharmaceuticals, much of the industry, although not recession-proof, has not suffered nearly as badly as other sectors. UK manufacturers' sales figures of materials and containers are not yet available for 1991, but there is likely to be little increase on the 1990 figure of Pounds 8.5bn. According to Rowena Mills Associates (RMA), the specialist economist in the packaging industry, the 1990 split in value by sector was: paper and board 33 per cent; plastics (film and containers) 30 per cent; metal (cans and drums) 20 per cent; glass 5 per cent; labels 5 per cent and other materials 7 per cent. Between them, the three major businesses - paper and board, plastics and metals - account for 85 per cent of the Pounds 8.5bn. Plastics continues to vie with the fibre-based materials for the number one spot, and, in terms of tonnages consumed, showed a similar growth to the previous year. At 4.6 per cent, it rose from 1,418,000 tonnes in 1989 to 1,483,000 tonnes in 1990. This was lower than in the mid to late 1980s, when growth ran into double figures, but reflected factors other than those purely associated with the recession, says RMA. Lightweighting and downgauging, the process of reducing the weight/unit ratio and perhaps, to some extent, environmental factors are thought to have been at work. Among the plastics materials, low-density polyethylene was the only polymer that fell marginally. Bottle demand in all polymers was up by some 11 per cent and PET (polyester) demand continued to rise rapidly - up by 43 per cent. Most of this growth was accounted for by film rather than what is now the traditional container for carbonated beverages, the PET bottle market. Environmental concerns and the consequent legislation will change the way plastics develop in the future, compared with the last 30 years, according to recent research work by Maack Business Services in Switzerland. While it believes that there will be large substitution losses from polyethylene, polystyrene and PVC across Europe, there will be balancing growth in polypropylene (PP) and PET up to the year 2000. Plastics packaging films are here to stay, but Maack predicts that more than 20 per cent of the PP market in 2,000 will represent substitution of other polymers, while for PET the percentage is even higher, at more than 50 per cent. Recession was responsible for a relatively poor year for paper and board. Demand for packaging and wrapping fell back 10 per cent, from 76,800 to 69,000 tonnes, and paper sack sales continued to decline, as industries such as cement reduced their demand. Fibreboard, corrugated and solid board case materials fared better in this sector, with food and beverage transit packaging holding up, partly as a result of increased summer beverage sales; but demand for consumer durables, notably white goods (another big user of fibre board) fell back. Industry estimates put 1990 square meterage of corrugated fibreboard at 3,401m, compared with the 1989 figure of 3,360m. Cartons volume was down very slightly in 1990, at 0.5 per cent, with only the gift carton area suffering in a sector that largely remained unaffected by recession. Half are used by the food industry. The UK folding carton industry has sales of about Pounds 920m, converting more than 600,000 tonnes of material a year. In Europe, only Germany converts more - in the region of 700,000 tonnes. Sales of open-top cans for human food fell, and there was limited recovery for those for pet food. The excellent summer of 1990 contributed to a 9.5 per cent increase in sales of carbonated drinks, and nearly 6 per cent for beer, giving a strong push for the beverage can. Overall, 13.7bn metal cans and containers were sold in 1990 (1989: 13.1bn). According to CMB Foodcan, , despite the challenges from many quarters, the can has notched up some notable successes - not least in the petfood sector, for which in the UK 2bn steel cans are currently being produced each year. Beverage cans (both steel and aluminium) exceed 7bn a year. One area on the metals front where environmental perceptions have had a clear impact has been in the market for aerosols. For a second year, sales dropped by over 4 per cent. Glass containers were also helped by the good weather in the summer of 1990  -at 1.9 per cent, the increase was slightly more rapid than the previous year. But, says RMA, while there was much talk about the environmental friendliness of glass, there was no significant shift for specific products towards this material on these grounds. The 1990 figure was 5,972m units, compared with 5,862m the previous year. Labels have seen a significant shift from paper and wet glue to self-adhesive varieties. Labels as a whole grew from 703m to 723m square metres in 1990, but, according to RMA, self-adhesives forged ahead by some 9 per cent, while competitive materials dropped back. Although there are giants, as in any industry, the packaging business is characterised by its hundreds of medium to small companies. Paul Curtis, chairman of the Institute of Packaging and a manager at carton converter BPCC Taylowe, says there are some 230 registered carton manufacturers competing in a market for which around a 2 per cent growth is predicted by some analysts. However, the market share is all important. Sixteen companies account for almost 60 per cent of the total market. All have turnovers in excess of Pounds 10m a year. Another 63, in the Pounds 1-Pounds 10m turnover region, account for the next 34 per cent. This leaves approximately 150 businesses competing for the remaining 7 per cent. There is no doubt that the main challenge to today's packaging industry is concern for the environment. Recycling of paper and board is well in place, cans are a valuable source of metals, and plastics packaging can provide the material for other products or fuel for energy. But much of the development in the use of recycled materials and their economic viability will rely on the success or failure of collection schemes.

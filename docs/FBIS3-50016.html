The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reasserts Romania's  firm attachment to the aims and principles of non-proliferation  of nuclear arms and welcomes this important decision made by the  Ukraine, a decision apt to contribute to strengthening security,  stability and confidence in our geographical zone, in Europe and  the whole world. Romania, while duly appreciating the signing  of the Moscow documents as an important example of nuclear  disarmament, expresses its hope that other countries holding  nuclear armament in their possession will take new steps towards  liquidating their arsenals, the statement concludes.    Other subjects mentioned at the news briefing: Scheduled for  27-28 January 1994 in Rabat, the proceedings of the eighth  session of the Joint Romanian-Moroccan Intergovernmental  Commitee for Economic and Technical Cooperation will be chaired  by the two countries' foreign ministers. This will occasion  Teodor Melescanu an official visit to Morocco at the invitation  of state minister in charge with the external affairs and  cooperation Abdellatif Filali.    The two sides will tackle and establish concrete measures  and  actions apt to lead to the relaunch of the bilateral political  dialogue, to boost commercial relations and favour the  furtherance of economic cooperation in fields of joint interest,  such as port facilities, road building, drilling, technical  assistance, professional training. The sides also propose to  negotiate and sign an agreement to guarantee and promote  investment, as well as a cooperation protocol between the two  foreign ministries and the programme reflecting the 1994-1996  cultural agreement.

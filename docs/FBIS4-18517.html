			<p>BFN     [Text] Finnish and Russian parliamentarians have begun  their joint working seminar on the Council of Europe in the  Eduskunta building in Helsinki. The seminar is attended by  parliamentarians from Sweden and Britain too. They regard the  participation of the Russian Liberal Democrat chairman Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy as important for dialogue. Sinikka Siekkinen  reports:    As most of the Russian delegation arrived at the Eduskunta  building by coach, Zhirinovskiy came on foot from his quarters,  thereby again attracting the greatest attention. Zhirinovskiy  voiced the view that Russia does not want to become a member of  the Council of Europe, but intends to set up its own council for  East Europe.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in English] We organize now a  council for East Europe -- Russia, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia,  Serbia, Bulgaria. It's good, it's better. [end recording]    Zhirinovskiy also welcomed Finland as a member of the  council  for Eastern Europe. Zhirinovskiy also reiterated yesterday's  statements on the Baltic countries and gave to understand that  not even UN membership benefits Russia, if it is up to him.    David Atkinson, the British MP, was pleased that  Zhirinovskiy  attended the seminar and heard what he had to say.    [Begin Atkinson recording] I'm delighted he is present and  that he will hear from my mouth my message to the seminar this  morning. [end recording]    Atkinson said that he would warn Zhirinovskiy of the  consequences of his policies, particularly if he intends to seek  to become president of Russia. The Swedish parliamentarian  Doris Haavik also thought it was self-evident that Zhirinovskiy  was allowed to take part in the Helsinki conference. According  to Haavik, isolating him would instead be dangerous, but  appearing in democracies was very important. Haavik said  Zhirinovskiy should not be silenced; he reveals himself best  when allowed to speak.</p>

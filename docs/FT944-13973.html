			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Samsung drives on towards globalisation - The Korean group is in the throes of a management revolution The recent decision by Samsung to build a large electronics complex in the Cleveland region of north-east England is the latest move by South Korea's largest chaebol (conglomerate) to transform itself into one of the world's leading multinational corporations. In the past few weeks, Samsung has also announced the establishment of large manufacturing facilities in China, Thailand and Mexico. The drive toward globalisation is causing a management revolution at Samsung, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor memory chips and one of Korea's leading producers of consumer electronics, ships, machinery and petrochemicals. Mr Lee Kun-hee, chairman, is deeply concerned that the group, which his father founded in 1938 as a rice-trading and textile business, remains psychologically ill-prepared to compete in the global market. The 52-year-old Mr Lee, who was educated in Japan and the US, last year introduced management reforms that emphasise individual initiative in a group that was known for its rigid hierarchical structure and was heavily influenced by Japanese corporate practices. Announcing the changes, the normally reclusive Mr Lee distributed videotapes of lectures to senior management that engaged in masochistic corporate self-criticism. He warned that Samsung was in danger of becoming a second-rate international business unless the group rapidly shifted its focus from quantity to quality and overhauled its cumbersome bureaucracy. 'Despite the enormous changes in the world, Samsung has yet to comprehend how far behind we are in these rapidly changing and competitive times,' he wrote in a group pamphlet that has become mandatory reading for employees. Mr Lee's diatribe was sparked after a trip to the US, where retailers told him that Samsung consumer electronics suffered from a poor image because of high defect rates. As part of its new approach, Samsung's 180,000 employees in Korea work a shorter and earlier schedule of 7am to 4pm to encourage them to be more productive. Senior executives must spend four days out of their six-day week at factories and meet customers and suppliers instead of remaining behind their desks. Workers are instructed to stop assembly line operations when they spot a production defect and fix the problem. Managers are sent on trips abroad, ranging from three months to one year, to study local market conditions and improve their understanding of different cultures. It is too early to say whether these management practices are cosmetic or will have a significant effect on corporate performance. But there has been resistance among employees to changes, which are considered 'too radical', according to one Samsung executive. An internal survey revealed that a majority of workers disliked the new working hours. Samsung has no plans to export these management practices to its overseas facilities. Moreover, the group seems torn between its traditional commitment to growth and Mr Lee's goal of promoting quality at the expense of quantity, even if it means loss of market share. Samsung and other chaebol are increasingly aware that rampant diversification is hindering global competitiveness. The groups need to concentrate on a few core industries to achieve success abroad, but Samsung is still finding it difficult to wean itself away from empire-building. The most controversial aspect of Samsung's corporate strategy is its plan to enter the passenger car business by 1997 at a cost of at least Dollars 5bn. The government, and some analysts, warn that the move is risky because Korea could face a production glut in the next few years, as the country's four existing carmakers expand capacity to as much as 6m vehicles a year. 'We need to develop car manufacturing if our engineering operations are to be competitive in the early 21st century, while remaining one of Samsung's main business areas,' said Mr Kim Moo, vice-president of Samsung Heavy Industries, which is managing the car project. Samsung needs to develop other industries that will match the success of its electronics business, which accounted for 55 per cent of the group's net profits of Won418bn (Dollars 524m) in 1993, but only a quarter of its total sales of Won41,365bn. Other Samsung businesses are much less profitable. But one problem with the car project is that it will divert financial resources from the electronics business, when the group needs to spend vast sums on the development and production of a new-generation 256-megabit memory chip and other costly programmes to strengthen its position as one of the world's leading electronics companies. Whether Samsung can achieve balanced growth, without encouraging excessive diversification, may prove to be the true test of Mr Lee's management reforms.</p>

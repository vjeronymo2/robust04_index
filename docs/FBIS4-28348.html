			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jun Kusaka] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 5 Jun -- During a recent interview with  reporters from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and other press groups,  European Commissioner Antonio Ruberti (in charge of science and  technology) said that the European Union (EU) will urge Japan to  hold regular Japan-EU ministerial consultations after the first  such session to be held in Tokyo on 7 June, to strengthen  cooperation between Japan and the EU in science and technology.  He further said that he will suggest at the upcoming meeting  that Japan should cooperate with the EU in reducing the emission  of carbon dioxide and in space development.    During a ministerial meeting in January 1993, Japan and the  EU agreed on strengthening cooperation in new areas, such as  assistance to developing countries and science and technology,  in addition to the existing industrial cooperation. In  accordance with this agreement, the "Japan-EU Science and  Technology Forum" will be held on 7 June. Ruberti and Mikio  Omi, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, will  attend this forum.    Ruberti proposed holding regular consultations of experts in  addition to annual meetings of ministers concerned, saying:  "Efforts should be made to hold forums on a regular basis."    He pointed out the need for strengthening cooperation in  nuclear fusion and biotechnology programs, which is already  taking place between Japan and EU, or is being conducted on a  multinational basis among Japan, EU, the United States, and  Russia. He then said that during his visit to Japan, he "would  like to stress the need for cooperation in the area of the  environment," such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions.    With regard to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, Ruberti  showed an intention to discuss long-term tasks, as well as  short- term concerns, such as technical development, electric  power, and gas.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Observer: EC networker James Elles, 44, the Old Etonian son of Baroness Elles, has dreamt up a spiffing way of getting free air tickets across the Atlantic for him and his chums in the European Parliament. The Tory MEP for Oxford and Buckinghamshire has set up something called the Transatlantic Policy Network. Its aims - strengthening the US-European alliance now that the cold war is over - sound pretty grandiose. But Elles has persuaded US Democratic party big-wig Bob Strauss and Gatt director Peter Sutherland to climb aboard as honorary presidents - so he should be able to drum up plenty of support on both sides of the Atlantic. Who knows, it could prove a nice little bolthole for Elles if, heaven forbid, he loses his seat in the forthcoming European elections.</p>

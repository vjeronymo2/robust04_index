			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Observer: Viennese whirl Vienna may conjure up strains of Strauss and romantic images of nights at the opera. But it seems self-respecting Saudis, used to only the most luxurious of life-styles, regard a posting to the Austrian capital as a positive hardship. Hence the tough job faced by the Saudi delegation to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in finding the right head for the cartel's public relations department. The lucky candidate is Mohammed Abdul-Aziz al-Sahlawi, who is reported to have accepted only on condition that he also continues to draw his full salary at home, where he is professor of economics at the King Fahd University of Petroleum. Pecuniary wheeler-dealing apart, the appointment of Sahlawi, a US-educated engineer, is a clear sign of Saudi Arabia's new dominance within Opec.  This is the first time in 15 years that the world's biggest oil exporter has put forward one of its own nationals for a senior post inside the organisation. The surprise decision also leaves a disgruntled Kemal Saiki, who has been running the public relations side for the fractious oil producers for the past year and had been promised the top job. Alas, being Algerian, he's tarred by the Saudis with the same brush as Opec's current president Sadek Boussena. Saudi Arabia is dissatisfied with the way Boussena has managed Opec politics to meet his domestic agenda and he will almost certainly be voted out of office in June.</p>

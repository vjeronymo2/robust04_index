			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd sale Triplex Lloyd, the Birming-ham-based industrial engineering group, has sold its ED Hinchcliffe curtain walling subsidiary to Norcros, the building and consumer products group, for a nominal sum. Hinchcliffe, which lapsed into loss during the first half and checked profit growth at Triplex, will be merged with Crittall, the UK's main curtain walling company. It is the sixth disposal of a building products company by Triplex. With the exception of two companies, having a combined turnover of Pounds 11m, Triplex has ended its involvement with the sector to concentrate on products for the automotive and power industries. The net effect of the disposals has been to give Triplex Pounds 6.5m in cash.</p>

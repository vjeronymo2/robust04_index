			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (13): A boost for push-button power - Mobile phone calls will soon span the Continent MOBILE telephones will soon become truly mobile. Within the next two years, it should be possible to drive from Helsinki to Rome and use the same handset anywhere along the route. It is an impressive vision, although achieving it has taken rather longer than was originally hoped. Fifteen countries signed the memorandum of understanding in 1987 to set up the pan-European cellular communications network, with a target of July 1991 for the launch of a service covering at least each country's capital city. Problems with the technology, wrangles between different manufacturers and other delays meant that by the end of 1991 only a handful of countries had anywhere near a functioning system. 'I think the original targets were a bit tongue-in-cheek,' says Mr Chris Gent, managing director of Vodaphone, one of the UK's two cellular phone operators. 'They needed to give people some sort of impetus, but the fact that we have got as far as we have is quite an achievement.' The aim of the initiative - called GSM, the Groupe Speciale Mobile  - was to set up a standardised cellular network for the whole continent, run by individual operators in each country. Mobile phone users will be able to make and receive calls in any country in the system. Their phone will register on the country's network when it is switched on, and the network will record and regularly update its location so that incoming calls are automatically rerouted. System users' details will be recorded on a 'smart' card, the size of a credit card, containing a microchip. When this is plugged into the slot in a GSM phone, the phone will temporarily 'adopt' the user's number, and all calls will automatically be billed to the card owner. This will allow users to travel without their own phones, but use standard handsets fitted in hire cars, for example. In addition to standard facilities such as call hold, call transfer and multi-party, a 'short message' service will allow messages of up to 160 characters to be sent to a subscriber and stored even when the phone is turned off. A cell broadcast facility will allow short messages - for example, warnings of traffic delays or accidents - to be sent to all phones within a certain geographical area. Perhaps most importantly, the system will be fully digital, improving both voice and data transmission. Digital encryption also makes calls virtually invulnerable to interception, making the system suitable for police and the military. Fax and data transmission will be much faster than in existing systems at 9,600 bits per second, and as the system is digital modems will not be required. GSM is at last becoming a reality, although it seems unlikely that all these features will be available before the end of 1994. And there are still some teething problems. While the technological challenges presented by the system itself have been largely overcome, testing equipment to ensure products meet the system's exacting standards is still being developed. For example, while Telecom Finland and the UK's Vodaphone successfully tested the first sections of their GSM systems last year, neither is able to sell any phones. 'It is,' as a telecoms expert put it, 'a bit like building a beautiful motorway and there being no cars to run on it.' To speed up the process, an interim testing standard has been adopted, less exacting than the full specification, and testing equipment should be available before the summer. This could mean, however, early subscribers to GSM facing the possibility of having their equipment recalled if it fails to pass the more stringent full tests later next year. There are other possible disincentives. GSM phones will initially be much more expensive in the UK - between Pounds 1,200 and Pounds 1,500 (Dollars 2,100 and Dollars 2,625), against the Pounds 200 to Pounds 400 paid for existing analogue cellphones, although the difference in price will be less in other countries where analogue phones are more expensive. They will also be much bigger, and more than twice the weight. Most operators are confident that economies of scale will allow for a swift drop in prices, and that, having successfully developed suitable digital hardware, manufacturers will now concentrate on miniaturisation. Mr Damien Callaghan, a spokesman for Cellnet, Vodaphone's competitor in the UK market, says: 'GSM is not a technology issue, it's a marketing issue. Initially our salesmen face the challenge of selling something that is bigger, more expensive, doesn't do as much, and can't be used in as many places as our existing product. 'By 1994, however, we believe all that will have changed.' Cellnet is introducing its own GSM service later this year. Vodaphone, whose service was launched last December, says it expects to provide nationwide coverage by the end of 1993. Before that it plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM, which could prove a blueprint for similar systems in Europe. The Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, will be a low-cost urban-based portable telephone service aimed at domestic consumers. Call charges are expected to be cheap, from only 10 pence (Dollars 0.17) a minute within a user's home town, to 20 pence a minute for national calls. If they occasionally roam further afield, MCN subscribers will be able to access the nationwide and pan-European GSM service albeit at a premium rate. Mr Gent believes the UK mobile communications market could be as large as 7m by the end of the century, with the as yet untapped domestic market accounting for half of this. This venture and similar ones elsewhere in Europe will face competition for the domestic market from Personal Communications Networks. These will comprise pocket-sized phones using higher-frequency 1.8GHz (Gigahertz) radio signals over shorter distances to link users to traditional telephone exchanges via a system of relay stations. Supporters argue that PCN has a number of advantages over GSM, including smaller phones, and a greater network capacity as cells are smaller, and so the same frequency spectrum can carry a greater volume of calls. Three UK companies - Microtel, Unitel and Mercury communications  - are developing PCNs, with the latter two having agreed to share much of the infrastructure and already installing it. On a Europe-wide basis, however, GSM remains the most important advance since the development of cellular phones. It is also a catalyst which is changing the way European telecommunications operate. Many countries are using it to introduce competition to nationalised monopolies. It looks likely to spread into eastern Europe, where, as demonstrated in east Germany, cellular systems can be a cheap and effective way of introducing a business communications system. Whether it will go any further is doubtful. While Australia, New Zealand, and some Middle Eastern and African countries have shown interest in GSM, both the US and Japan have plumped for different standards. The dream of a global mobile communications system remains some way off.</p>

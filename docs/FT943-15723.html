			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (9): In pursuit of the client's interests - David Dodwell finds out how the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's data-base benefits the territory's small operators / The HKTDC From a desk-top computer in his tiny office in Hong Kong's teeming Mong Kok, John Williams dials down his modem line to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's trade data-base, TDC-Link. His company makes highly sophisticated car burglar alarms, and he wants to check on new export opportunities. Within three minutes, he has a list on his office printer of 32 companies spread across Europe, the US, Japan and south-east Asia that in the past two months have inquired about buying car burglar alarms. The list not only has company names, addresses and telephone and fax numbers, but also the names of purchasing managers. 'It certainly beats cold-selling,' says Mr Williams. The software package to hook him up to the TDC computer cost just HKDollars 300 (Pounds 25). TDC-Link, in operation since 1991, is one of a number of services provided by Hong Kong's TDC to reduce the barriers and risks many small companies experience when they come face-to-face with the challenges of exporting. In a territory made up almost entirely of small companies, this is a priority. It is one of a number of services that trade promoters in other parts of the world would do well to take note of - in particular in countries such as the US, the UK, Germany and France, where governments acknowledge that 'big industry' accounts for too large a share of international trade, but confess to immense problems in drawing small companies into cross-border commerce. TDC-Link is underpinned by a vast computer data-base built up by the TDC over a decade. It carries details of 57,000 Hong Kong companies and records of 250,000 buyers or suppliers worldwide. In addition, its data-base of companies across mainland China grew last year from 60,000 to more than 110,000. The TDC's 51 offices worldwide are feeding trade inquiries into the data-base at a rate of 13,000 a month. Apart from raw trade inquiry information, TDC-Link carries market and product or sector reports prepared by its own research staff, a news data-base, a global directory of brand names, import regulations, quota prices, shipping schedules, and even real-time exchange-rate and stock market information. For Hong Kong companies without computers, or lacking modem access, the TDC operates five Data-shops across the city-state which provide one-stop-shop access to the same range of information. So far, the service is available only to Hong Kong-based companies, but that does not mean foreign companies are completely shut out: a TDC Phone-Fax service, set up in April 1992, takes trade inquiries by telephone from anywhere in the world, and aims to supply the information required by fax within 30 minutes. The TDC's four Phone-Fax operators handled 47,000 inquiries last year. It is moot why trade promotion agencies in countries such as the UK and the US have failed so far to establish similar services. The answer must in part be that exporting has not until recently become the focus of high-level government priority. But it must also partly be due to the fact that in most countries, trade promotion - or rather, export promotion rather than trade promotion, since few share Hong Kong's recognition that most companies have to import in order to export - is the responsibility of a government department, subject to civil service rules, and perhaps most important of all, subject to treasury spending restraints. The Hong Kong government broke this link in 1966 when it set up the TDC as an independent trade promotion body funded not out of taxes, but by a tiny levy on imports and exports. The decision gave the TDC financial independence and - as the territory's trade has grown - unimagined affluence to pursue the interests of its clientele: Hong Kong's traders. The levy first set in 1966 was for 0.05 per cent on all imports and exports  -a sum that industry as well as government regarded as a modest enough tax on trade to be acceptable. By 1986, following the hectic emergence of Hong Kong's role as entrepot for trade between China and the outside world, the TDC was facing embarrassing affluence. The response was to trim the levy to exclude re-exports. As Hong Kong's trade has continued to grow strongly - to a point where in 1993, the territory had become the world's eighth most important trading power - the time came early this year to cut the levy afresh, particularly in view of a trend in recent years to charge for services, even though in many circumstances this was at a subsidised rate. The levy now stands at 0.035 per cent on all direct imports and exports. 'The levy on trade has served us well,' says one Hong Kong trader. 'It is a puzzle why chambers of commerce and trade organisations in other countries have not taken a similar route.'</p>

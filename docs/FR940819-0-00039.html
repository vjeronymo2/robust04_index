			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM included a notice that in the final rule the FAA would amend the antidrug rule to change the terms ``passing'' and ``failing'' a drug test. All of the DOT agencies that require drug testing, including the FAA, have received reports of some confusion in their respective industries regarding the use of the terms passing and failing a drug test and how those terms relate to different drug test results ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , confirmed or verified positive or negative test, cancelled tests, etc.). The final rule changes these terms wherever they are used throughout the antidrug rule to the more accurate ``verified positive'' or ``verified negative.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the revised appendix I published in this final rule includes a number of minor editorial changes. For example, throughout the antidrug rule the phrase ``functions specified in section III of appendix I'' is used. This final rule replaces that phrase with the term ``safety-sensitive function,'' which is defined accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Contract Air Traffic Control Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was noted in the preamble to the NPRM, when the FAA's final antidrug rule was published in 1988, air traffic control (ATC) facilities operated under contract with the FAA were explicitly excluded from coverage under the rule. It was subsequently determined that employees of contract ATC facilities would not be included in the FAA's program for Federal employees and should be subject to the FAA's rules for the aviation industry. This final rule changes the definition of covered employers to include such facilities. The FAA's air traffic control facilities and facilities operated by the military (whether directly or by contract) are not affected by this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air traffic control facilities, whether they are currently required to perform testing by contract or not, should submit plans to the FAA within 90 days after the rule's effective date, as required by paragraph A.5., Section IX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Refusal to Submit to Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final antidrug rule included amendments to the airmen certification sections of the FAA's regulations under which a refusal to submit to testing could be the basis for a certificate action. However, the rule did not have an express requirement for employers to notify the FAA of refusals or a specific mechanism for providing such notice. The NPRM proposed a reporting requirement that (paragraph E of section VI of appendix I to part 121) would correct this gap in the requirements of the rule. However, the proposal did not include a specific time for notifications. The final rule specifies that employers must notify the FAA of refusals to submit to required tests within 5 working days. The final rule also clarifies that sanctions do not attach to refusals to submit to either pre-employment or return to duty tests since the redefinition of ``return to duty tests'' makes such tests essentially voluntary. An individual who refuses to submit to pre-employment or return to duty testing but then wishes to perform a safety-sensitive function would have to subsequently agree to take and have a verified negative drug test result on such a test. The individual would then be subject to follow-up testing while performing safety-sensitive functions, because the individual might have refused based on recent drug use. The individual would not, however, be subject to certificate action for declining what is essentially a test taken voluntarily as a precondition to performing safety-sensitive duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Employees Covered By the Antidrug Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule modifies the specified safety-sensitive duties slightly to parallel the classes of covered functions in the FAA's new alcohol misuse prevention program rule (14 CFR part 121, appendix J). This modification is not intended to significantly change the antidrug rule's coverage. The most significant changes are the elimination of flight test and ground instruction duties. The former category is eliminated because the FAA has determined that as a practical matter, these duties are essentially subsumed in flight crewmember or flight instructor duties. Ground instruction duties have been eliminated based on the FAA's desire to reduce the burden of the antidrug rule on the industry and the determination that individuals performing such duties could be removed from the program without jeopardizing public safety. Additionally, the categories of ``aviation screening duties'' and ``ground security coordinator duties'' have been established to clarify the FAA's original intent with respect to covered security functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although most commenters supported these changes, one commenter believed that rather than specifying categories of safety-sensitive duties, the rule should provide the Administrator with the discretion to establish these categories without rulemaking. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation. While flexibility might be desirable, the FAA believes that it is essential that adequate notice and opportunity for comment be given to individuals the FAA intends to subject to the requirements of this rule. Publication of the safety-sensitive functions as part of the final rule also ensures that affected employees and employers have actual or constructive knowledge of the requirements of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has previously received a petition for rulemaking on the issue of the appropriate scope of covered employees under the antidrug rule. Because the issues raised in the petition have been resolved in this final rule, the FAA has closed this action. (Docket No. 26620)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the covered employee categories are being revised, we are republishing with this final rule the Drug Testing Management Information System (MIS) Data Collection Forms, which were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68198), and became effective on January 1, 1994. These forms provide the FAA with additional data for use in monitoring the antidrug program and reflect the changes in employees covered by the antidrug rule. There are no other significant changes to the forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Pre-Employment Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed to revise the antidrug rule's pre-employment testing provision (paragraph A of section V of appendix I) to make the provision less burdensome. When it was published in 1988, the antidrug rule required pre-employment testing before an individual could be hired to perform a function specified in appendix I. As interpreted by the FAA, testing was required of individuals not currently employed by the employer, of current employees moving from a non-covered to a covered safety-sensitive function, and in circumstances where an employee was removed from the random testing pool for any length of time or was unavailable for testing for an extended period of time. Individuals who had a verified positive drug test result or refused to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test also had to pass a pre-employment test prior to performing or returning to safety-sensitive duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA continues to believe that pre-employment drug testing has utility for those individuals who have not previously been subject to the FAA-approved random drug testing program of an employer. However, we have reassessed the need for pre-employment testing in other situations, such as when an employee has been on leave of absence or working outside the territory of the United States. The FAA believes, and all of the commenters addressing this issue concur, that safety can be maintained even if the requirement for pre-employment testing in some circumstances is eliminated. Therefore, the FAA has revised its antidrug rule to require pre-employment testing of an individual only prior to the first time the individual performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer. Such an individual must have a verified negative drug test result on a pre-employment test prior to performing a safety-sensitive function, and the employer could not permit the individual to perform such a function until the employer receives the verified negative pre-employment drug test result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employers would be permitted to require an employee to submit to pre-employment testing in cases where an employee previously subject to random testing by that employer has been removed from the random testing pool for reasons other than a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

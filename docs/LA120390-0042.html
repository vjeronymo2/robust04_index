			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALMI VENTURES BRUCKNER 7TH IN SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> MUSIC: NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR GUIDES SYMPHONY TO A MAJOR-LEAGUE ORCHESTRAL SOUND.  </P> <P> Only the big, the bold and the brave venture Bruckner.  </P> <P> Not every symphony orchestra dares approach the massive and mystical, sprawling  yet subtle, essentially Wagnerian rhetoric of the unhappy Austrian master. The  inherent technical demands are as daunting as the interpretive challenges.  </P> <P> Impatient modern audiences, moreover, don't invariably relish sitting still for  Bruckner's romantic indulgences and developmental convolutions. Not everyone  finds the lengthy route that leads to the ultimate cathartic cadence heavenly.  </P> <P> The San Diego Symphony, having endured all manner of fiscal and artistic  crises, hadn't attempted much Bruckner prior to Friday night, when Yoav Talmi  programmed the mighty Seventh. An official spokesman admitted that he couldn't  recall a precedent. A check with the orchestra librarian revealed that this  repertory hadn't even been attempted by the orchestra since 1977.  </P> <P> Talmi, the new music director, obviously is no wimp. Bruckner happens to be one  of his specialties. He rushed in where many a lesser conductor feared to tread,  and emerged triumphant.  </P> <P> He proved that the San Diego Symphony, in its present incarnation, is a fine,  responsive, virtuoso instrument. He played that instrument with poignant  finesse.  </P> <P> Many conductors use Bruckner primarily as an excuse for muscle flexing and  conspicuous perspiring. They revel in the extrovert gesture, piling climax upon  climax. Above all, they make the music thunder.  </P> <P> Although the forces at his command -- especially the brass -- are not exactly  overpowering, Talmi did not shirk the thunder when it was essential. However,  he put it in perspective. That perspective focused, with good justification, on  Bruckner's lyricism.  </P> <P> The Israeli maestro knows a useful secret: If one performs heroic music with  sensitivity, even with delicacy, the bombast will take care of itself. There is  no need to stress the obvious, no advantage to making the grandiose sound  vulgar.  </P> <P> Talmi's beat is clear, his emotive vocabulary restrained. Under his stylish,  subdued urging, the strings shimmered, the winds sang crisply and the brass  declaimed with elegant point.  </P> <P> Using the Nowak edition, he sustained transparent textures, balanced the choirs  with special tact and invariably savored melodic grace. Although he lingered at  the most poignant melodic flights, he never let tension flag.  </P> <P> He invested Bruckner with the virtues of Schubert, analyzed the vast symphonic  panorama as if it were chamber music. The 63 minutes passed quickly.  </P> <P> The attentive audience that nearly filled Copley Hall gave him an ovation. He  deserved it.  </P> <P> As a prelude to Bruckner's profundities, Talmi devoted the first half of the  concert to the elegant charms of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. Ida Levin  invested the solo lines with sweet if somewhat wispy tone, and the orchestra  provided deft accompaniment. This was a competent, enlightened performance.  </P> <P> The Bruckner was more than that.  </P></p>

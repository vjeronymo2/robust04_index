As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests'' that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related in business matters. <FOOTCITE>148</FOOTCITE>  For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition that is identical to the definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR 124.100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 148 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See generally Texas-Capital Contractors, Inc. v.

In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 104. The affiliation requirement is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the size standard required for eligibility from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities. <FOOTCITE>149</FOOTCITE>  We believe that the affiliation rules described above will accomplish this objective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 149 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Second Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;272. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Rural Telephone Company Bidding Credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 105.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCTA, USIN and SDN argue that the FCC should retain the rural telephone company bidding credit provision adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> but delete the accelerated build-out requirement as a condition for receipt of bidding credits. USIN asserts that bidding credits will not help attract capital when tied to such an expanded build-out requirement. According to USIN, making bidding credits contingent on an accelerated build-out effectively nullifies the provision because the commitment of additional capital for network build-out will reduce the amount available to finance the license price by enough to offset any benefit conferred by the availability of the credit. <FOOTCITE>150</FOOTCITE>  SDN agrees that additional build-out should not be required as a prerequisite for rural telephone company bidding credits, but states that a rural telephone company should receive additional bidding credits if it substantially covers its certified rural service area during its license term. <FOOTCITE>151</FOOTCITE>  NTCA argues that the accelerated build-out requirement for bidding credits should be eliminated since this requirement is unrelated to the statutory purpose of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas. <FOOTCITE>152</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 150 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> USIN Petition at 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 151 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SDN Petition at 14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 152 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 106. SDN also contends that the risk of forfeiting the bidding credit (plus interest) for failure to meet the expanded build-out commitment will have a chilling effect because of the difficulty of anticipating potential problems that may be encountered in attempting to extend service rapidly to remote areas. Further, SDN maintains that an accelerated build-out requirement could engender a perverse incentive for a rural telephone company that would otherwise concentrate primarily on providing PCS service in the rural portions of a BTA or MTA (which, according to SDN might be a commercially-attractive strategy because of in densely-populated areas. <FOOTCITE>153</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 153 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SDN Petition at 14&hyph;15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 107. Finally, SDN and USIN contend that it is inequitable to provide rural telephone companies with a less favorable bidding credit provision than other designated entities. In this regard, USIN argues that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> fails to explain why rural telephone company bidding credits should contain more restrictive terms than other designated entity bidding credits. On the contrary, SDN contends that rural telephone companies should receive a greater bidding credit than other entities, because they face higher service and construction costs. Accordingly, SDN maintains that if accelerated build-out is to be included in the rural telephone company provision, an incentive should be provided in the form of bonus credit over and above the standard bidding credit available to other designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 108.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we adopted a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies designed to further promote the investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas. <FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>  We generally concluded that any special measures adopted for rural telephone companies, including bidding credits, should be limited to bidding for licenses, in their rural service areas. We found that this limitation satisfied Congress' objectives without unduly favoring rural telephone companies in markets where there was no compelling reason to do so. Specifically, we concluded that Congress was primarily concerned with assuring rural consumers the benefits of new technologies and providing opportunities for participation by rural telephone companies in the provision of wireless services that supplement or replace their landline facilities. <FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, we provided that rural telephone companies would be eligible for bidding credits for specified licenses only in their service areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 154 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 155 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;243. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 109. However, unlike bidding credits available to women and minority-owned firms, we linked the amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies to their commitment to achieve certain expanded infrastructure build-out requirements in their rural service areas. We provided that the amount of the bidding credit would be proportionately linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agreed to expand its build-out commitment. In this regard, we indicated that failure to meet the expanded build-out commitment would result in liability for a penalty in the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate applicable to installment payments. We further provided that grant of the licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits would be conditioned upon payment of this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable. We concluded that this added construction requirement would fulfill the congressional objective of developing and rapidly deploying new services to those residing in rural areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

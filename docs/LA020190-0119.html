			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR 'A COMMUNITY THAT WORKS'  </P> <P> Several weeks ago I noticed a hillside area near my house which was being used,  I guessed, as a "turn-out" for viewing the city below by people who had an  obvious, blatant disregard for the city litter laws. I also noticed several  retaining walls along the road that had been "tagged" with graffiti.  </P> <P> Consequently, I called my Neighborhood Watch adviser at the Police Department,  and she assured me that patrols in the area could and would be increased,  especially at night, and she thanked me for calling because the information I  had given her helps the department be more effective.  </P> <P> I then called the Glendale Beautification number and spoke with the person in  charge of "Knock-Out-Graffiti," who arranged to have the retaining walls  cleaned. Within a week the graffiti was completely erased.  </P> <P> I just wanted to say thank you to the representatives and employees of the city  of Glendale. It is a pleasure to live in a community that works!  </P> <P> DONNA FUREY, Glendale  </P></p>

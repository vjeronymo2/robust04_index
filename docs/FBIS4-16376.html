			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Andrey Krylovich and </F> Anatoliy Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- South Korea views as  "constructive" Russia's proposal to convene a multipartite  conference on questions of the security and nuclear-free status  of the Korean peninsula. This was stated today by Han Sung-chu,  the foreign minister of the Republic of Korea at a meeting with  Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly. The South Korean minister is in  Moscow on an official visit.    The Russian initiative provides for the participation in  such  a conference by both Korean states, Russia, the United States,  China, Japan and also the United Nations and the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Together with all the interested parties, the minister said,  we will continue to analyze and study this proposal in an active  way.    Relations with the Republic of Korea, I. Rybkin noted, are a  priority in Russian foreign policy. There is no doubt  whatsoever that we are worried by the situation which has  developed on the Korean peninsula.    The chairman of the State Duma told the South Korean  minister  about the work of the Russian Parliament, stressing the  importance of interparliamentary ties.    Han Sung-chu conveyed the wish of the Republic of Korea  President Kim Yong-sam to address the Russian parliamentarians  during the course of his coming visit to Moscow.

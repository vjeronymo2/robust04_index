			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Aegis restructures to shift gravity base - Law change prompts media group to run down French connection AEGIS' centre of gravity has, until now, been France: the London-based holding company of the Carat group could rely in the past on its French business as its main source of revenue. However, a change in the law in France on media buying, which took effect in April, has radically changed the picture. Yesterday's announcement of the proposed refinancing is an attempt by the company to shift that centre of gravity. For the first time Omnicom, the large US-based agency, will have a substantial interest in the company; at the same time, Aegis will use Pounds 15m of its newly-raised money to purchase the half of HMS, the profitable German media-buying company, that it does not already own. The new French law, known as the Loi Sapin, has meant that media buyers can no longer bulk-buy advertising space at a hefty discount and sell it on to advertisers at a profit, at the same time as taking commission payments from television companies and publishers - a system that was not visible to advertisers and resulted in very high margins for the French media buyers. As Mr David Forster of Smith New Court, points out: 'The result has been that margins in France have come rattling down.' Media-buying revenues, overall, could be eroded by up to 40 per cent in France - last year the country accounted for nearly Pounds 792m of Aegis's Pounds 2.84bn turnover. The development has called into question the entire group's capital structure. 'The group's profit base and cash flow are now insufficient to service the existing level of bank debt, meet deferred consideration obligations and pay the fixed dividend and interest obligations on the Europreference shares and the stock,' said Aegis yesterday. The main features of the proposed refinancing will, in effect, mean Pounds 61.2m of new equity finance: Pounds 15m from Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution; Pounds 15m from Omnicom; Pounds 15m from Electra; and Pounds 16.2m from SFEC. The restructuring will result in the conversion into ordinary shares of Pounds 72m of Europreference shares, Pounds 25m of stock and Pounds 7m of 55 per cent preference shares. There will also be an exchange of warrants for ordinary shares and cancellation for voting deferred shares. Aegis said the refinancing would strengthen the group's finances by increasing substantially its equity base, reducing fixed dividend and interest obligations and removing about Pounds 30m of deferred liabilities. 'Payment of the dividend on the Europreference shares, due on December 13, would significantly worsen the group's financial position and it is highly unlikely that the group would be able to make such payment,' it said. The board had tried to structure the refinancing so that each party, including existing ordinary shareholders, would retain an interest, 'which will allow them to participate on an equitable basis in the future growth of the company'. Mr Forster, however, was not convinced yesterday. 'It's not a very happy situation,' he said. 'An awful lot of people have made an awful lot of money out of the business over the years. The only people to have consistently suffered are the ordinary shareholders.' From 170m shares in issue now, there will be 934m shares after it has been fully diluted. Ms Lorna Tilbian, at SG Warburg, agreed that the ordinary shareholders had been 'diluted out of sight'. While she was still concerned about the operation of the French part of the company, she said that following yesterday's events the 'risk is very much diminished'. She is also watching Omnicom's long-term involvement: its 9 per cent stake could rise to 13 per cent if it exercised its warrants and there is no 'standstill' agreement not to proceed further.</p>

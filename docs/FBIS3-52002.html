Above all, this  situation is due to the fact that the opposition parties are  fragmented and apparently have removed themselves to the  sidelines of the process of change in which the whole country is  involved.    These comments were made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez, the  minister of government, in an extended conversation which he had  with the editors of LOS TIEMPOS during a working breakfast held  in La Paz. In the course of the conversation the minister made  several statements about the political panorama reflected in the  present situation. On this basis he made several predictions  about the prospects for the 1997 general elections, which will  be held at the end of the constitutional term that began in  August 1993.    Quiroga flatly denied that his party has any pretensions to  long-term dominance in the exercise and projection of political  power which the MNR now holds. He rejected accusations of that  kind which are often made by opposition groups. He stated that  the time for long term political dominance by a single party has  passed and cannot be repeated, due to the political progress  which the democratic process has made in the national community.    In that framework the minister of government pointed out  that  to keep democracy healthy and to make it possible to continue  with the political and institutional development of the country,  the country needs to have a strong, capable, and well-organized  opposition with which it will be possible to reach effective,  cooperative agreements. At the same time such an opposition will  assure organized society of an effective role in checking on the  performance of government bodies.    In that sense Quiroga stated that the government of  President  Sanchez de Lozada has observed with concern how the opposition  parties, principally consisting of the Nationalist Democratic  Action Party (ADN) and the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary  Left], presently appear to have "lost their way" in terms of  their political position. They even appear to be markedly  disorganized internally. In his view these are aspects which  cannot in any way be considered positive developments for the  development of the democratic system in the country.    Minister Quiroga said: "The conduct of the leaders of the  ADN  and the MIR, since Hugo Banzer Suarez and Jaime Paz Zamora,  their respective leaders, abandoned them, following the last  municipal elections, makes them look like the `tail end' of the  CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland party]. This is only a  regional party, without any significance at the national level.  It is not in a position, nor is it able to play the role of  leader of the opposition."    He noted that, in this situation, the government coalition,  with the MNR as its central axis, has gained control of 65  percent of the municipal councils in the country following the  most recent local elections. This shows that the alliance  established in August 1993, with each one of its components  retaining its own, ideological position and participating  separately in the election campaign, has good prospects for  continuing to control the national administration even beyond  1997.</p>

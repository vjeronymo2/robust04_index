			<p>BFN     [Text] Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says the U.S.  restrictions on Sweden exporting its new JAS Grippen jet fighter  are counterproductive and could hasten the development of a  joint European defense industry. Almost a third of the  components of the single engined JAS are made in the United  States, and because of this Washington requires veto rights for  each individual export deal. Bjorck describes this as unfair  saying Sweden cannot accept a system that puts its interests  subordinate to those of the United States. He added that  companies in Sweden's defense sector would look at European  alternatives for the plane unless Washington relaxed its policy.</p>

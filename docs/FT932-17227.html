			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan sets export goals for metals sector KAZAKHSTAN, which exported virtually no metal when it was part of the former Soviet Union, has set 1993 export quotas for zinc, lead and copper at 90,000 tonnes, 70,000 tonnes and 120,000 tonnes respectively, according to a report from the Brook Hunt &amp; Associates UK consulting group in association with the Kazakhstan International Metal Exchange. Brook Hunt estimates that last year 220,000 tonnes of Kazakh copper was shipped to the west while 145,000 tonnes went to the Ukraine, some of which also found its way to the west. Refined lead exports were about 80,000 tonnes and shipments of zinc were 'rather less.' The report suggests that Kazakhstan's metals trade 'degenerated into an unregulated free-for-all' but steps are being taken to put control of export sales in the hands of a central government organisation. 'This will not mean that the overall volume of shipments will necessarily fall,' it says, however. It adds: 'Domestic manufacturing capability is extremely limited and there are few other goods that can earn hard currency.' A team from Brook Hunt and personnel from the Kazakhstan Metal Exchange visited the principal mining and metallurgical operations of the central Asia republic, a land-locked country which covers an area six times the size of France, and discovered that 'the fate of domestic, non-integrated miners (the majority) has been virtually ignored. 'They have been deprived of development capital and have continued to be paid in roubles, at prices reflecting internal costs, for concentrates sold to the smelters.' This has caused an acute shortage of raw material from domestic sources for Kazakh smelters which are increasingly relying on imported feed. The report says annual mine output of copper is about 302,000 tonnes compared with refined copper production capacity of 570,000 tonnes and actual production of 370,000 tonnes. Mine lead production is 105,000 tonnes compared with refined capacity of 420,000 tonnes and refined output of 282,000 tonnes. The figures for zinc are 266,000 tonnes of mine production, 380,000 tonnes of refined capacity and 272,000 tonnes of refined output. Brook Hunt suggests that some of the proceeds from metals sales to the west should be invested in improving Kazakhstan's domestic mine capability. 'There are some new deposits which appear to have favourable grades and several are already part-developed but the local combines do not have the funds at this stage to proceed further. Foreign companies are being invited to participate in these projects.' It also says that mining and metallurgical industries should diversify into labour-intensive industries producing consumer goods to satisfy demand in the central Asian republics. At present there are no alternative jobs available for workers displaced from the mining and metals industries, particularly in remote centres such as Balkhash and Dzhezkazgan. The report adds: 'It is considered that society (in Kazakhstan) would not be prepared to accept the concept of unemployment and it is unlikely that government could afford to introduce a social security system to deal with large numbers of unemployed.'

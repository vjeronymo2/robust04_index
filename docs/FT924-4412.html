			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Norweb advances 11% to Pounds 37m NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, said yesterday it planned for real growth in dividends of 6 to 8 per cent until the end of the century, as it unveiled an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. The performance was helped by staffing cuts - in distribution 100 jobs were lost against a five-year plan of 700 - and a reduction in losses in the supply business from Pounds 25.6m in the first half last year to Pounds 12.9m. Separately, the company indicated resistance to signing long-term contracts with generators for coal-fired electricity prior to the completion of the government's review of energy policy scheduled for publication in January. In the six months to September 30, Norweb recorded pre-tax profits up from Pounds 33.4m to Pounds 37.1m on turnover ahead from Pounds 575.6m to Pounds 610.8m. Earnings per share were 15p (12.9p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5.9p (5.3p). In distribution, operating profits were down from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds 50.3m but this was partly because last year's profits were increased by clawback from the previous year's under-recovery in tariffs and partly because of Pounds 6.3m provisions for pensions and restructuring. Underlying growth was 6 per cent in profit and 0.8 per cent in units, said Mr Ken Harvey, chairman. Manpower reductions in distribution mean the company has cut its staff there by 500, half way into a five-year programme by which it intended to shelve 700. Further job losses are in prospect in the contracting business where the company is negotiating a new terms and conditions package with unions, and wants to cut the 650-strong workforce by about 150. In the first half contracting incurred losses of Pounds 900,000. The aim is to be back in profits next year. Mr Harvey said the supply business was expected to make profits this year. Non-franchise customers were up 58 per cent in the first half. Tariff increases next April would be well below inflation. Retail profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.6m, the result of cost inflation outstripping a 10 per cent rise in sales in high street shops and 'mainly' one-off provisions following an expansion into out-of-town stores. Shops are performing 'better than expected' in the run-up to Christmas. COMMENT With so much uncertainty surrounding the electricity sector, regional companies will be doing their best in the next few weeks of results to make the most of their dividend potential. Norweb, the first to report, has set a high growth target, which is perhaps just as well considering its involvement in combined cycle gas turbine generation and retailing. Shares have suffered in recent weeks because of the CCGT links; but they edged ahead slightly yesterday as the market approved attempts to improve cashflow and minimise chances of unfavourable decisions by the regulator. Expectations for full-year pre-tax profits vary widely around Pounds 150m but more important is the dividend. This is likely to be about 19.8p, giving a yield of 5.7 per cent, about average for regional electricity companies.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Starry-eyed investors await Italy's telecoms rebirth - Haig Simonian examines speculative interest in the reorganisation of the state-controlled Stet and Sip Shares in Stet and Sip, Italy's two leading telecommunications companies, have gyrated this week as investors grappled with the dilemma of matching glowing economic prospects with domestic political uncertainty. Though majority state-owned, the two stocks count among Italy's leading blue chips. Their prices closely reflect general investor confidence in Italy as much as the companies' own financial expectations. However, both groups have moved into focus in recent months. Telecoms stocks are in vogue among international investors. The Italian companies are particularly attractive, because long-running and expensive modernisation programmes are nearing an end, and tariffs are beginning to emerge from the straight-jacket of state control. Privatisation has added a new speculative lustre to the shares. Last month, Lehman Brothers, a close Stet adviser, issued a bullish investment report on the stock entitled 'A Star is (Re)Born'. Such enthusiasm is still running ahead of reality. After years of dithering, disorganisation, inter-company rivalries and plain mismanagement, Italy's telecoms sector is set for long overdue rationalisation. No other big European country has such a complex patchwork in the telecommunications field. Stet, the overall holding company, presides over a collection of separate companies, some quoted, with activities covering domestic telephones services (Sip), intercontinental traffic (Italcable), equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network services (Sirti). Separately, ASST, controlled directly by the ministry of posts and telecommunications until last year, and now renamed Iritel, handles domestic trunk calls and some international traffic. Each has is own, sometimes overlapping, responsibilities, board of directors, buildings and even chauffeurs, adding significantly to costs and confusion. The reasons for the profusion are political, based on the need to share out jobs between coalition parties, all craving for their allocation of top state-sector patronage. That is about to change. Under a new project, approved in principle by the government earlier this year, the separate layers will be rationalised to create one company, expected to be called Telecom Italia. The new entity, whose precise structure remains vague, should group all the telephone services now conducted by Sip, Italcable, Iritel and Telespazio. The first step is due early next year, when Sip and Italcable are planned to merge. While attractive in principle, details of Telecom Italia have yet to be fleshed out. Still to be decided are the fates of Sip's highly profitable cellular telephone business, and the outlook for the Italtel equipment manufacturing side. Italy now has Europe's third- biggest cellular network, with about 1.1m subscribers. So far, Sip has a monopoly, although several private groups are jostling to win the long-awaited mandate to set up a second network. When that will come about remains uncertain, as do vague suggestions by the government that Sip's cellular business would be spun off separately. Italtel's future is also in the balance. Although not expected to form part of Telecom Italia, which will concentrate on services, Italtel is an important element in the Stet group. Executives from Stet and Italtel, which is 20 per cent-owned by AT&amp;T of the US, have for months been talking with other leading telecommunications equipment makers to broaden Italtel's ownership structure. The outcome of the negotiations, designed to broaden the company's access to international contracts, remains unresolved. While the broad future of Italy's telecoms sector has been defined, many gaps remain to be filled. The government and the Iri state holding company, which controls Stet, have indicated they are prepared to float a majority of the shares. Observers remain confused as to whether Stet itself, or the future Telecom Italia, will be the privatisation vehicle, although the latter seems more likely. The government is also undecided about the precise structure of the future telecoms business. Its continued indecision has been reflected in its failure to appoint merchant banking advisers for the sell-off. The delay lies in underlying political differences about privatisation, which have not yet been resolved. Some ministers are pressing for a UK-style public flotation. Meanwhile others, led by Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, want to create a 'hard core' shareholding group, in which leading Italian technology companies, such as Olivetti and Pirelli, would form a prominent part. Mr Savona's argument is believed to be based on the claim that only by linking industrialised companies closely with the telecoms sector will it be possible to guarantee their future role at the forefront of that sector. Though apparently protectionist in scope, the aim is more to keep Italian companies abreast of the latest developments in the increasingly overlapping telecoms and information technology businesses than to exclude outsiders. Critics, however, say any attempt to create a privileged position for domestic companies will damage telecoms privatisation. Investors will be put off by the idea of a domestic 'hard core', which will reduce liquidity of the privatised stock. And creating a close link between the privatised telecoms company and the biggest domestic suppliers could compromise independence in purchasing and equipment decisions, affecting long-term profitability, it is argued. The appointment of advisers on privatising Italian telecommunications will have to await government decision on just how the sector should be restructured. With domestic politics in a particularly volatile state, the decision may be handed over from the present government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to a successor formed after the next elections, widely expected early next year. Whoever decides will also have to rule on the thorny issue, still being debated behind-the-scenes, on what role should be reserved for Italian companies in the shareholding structure of any privatised telecoms concern. This is the concluding piece in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state telecommunications operators. The other articles appeared on October 11, 26, 28 &amp; November 4.

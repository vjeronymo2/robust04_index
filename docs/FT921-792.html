			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Jeyes to over Pounds 4m HELPED BY acquisitions, Jeyes Group, the Norfolk-based manufacturer of cleaning and hygiene products, lifted pre-tax profits by 17 per cent, from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 4.18m, in the 12 months to December 28 1991. At the same time, the group announced the acquisition of the Quickies and All Fresh brands from SmithKline Beecham, the international pharmaceuticals company. Both are brands of moist wipes, one of Jeyes' core product categories. The consideration is a minimum Pounds 1.5m cash, together with Pounds 100,000 for the manufacturing equipment and stock. Of the purchase price, Pounds 250,000 is deferred until January 1993 and further consideration of up to Pounds 200,000 will become payable dependent on sales performance. In 1991 Jeyes' UK consumer business achieved an 8 per cent growth rate in sales 'despite difficult market conditions'. There was, however, a 60 per cent increase in exports, with the launch into Japan and the Middle East contributing to the growth in the division. Group turnover and operating profits both improved 19 per cent - to Pounds 61.8m (Pounds 51.8m) and Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 4.14m) respectively. Crowner Products, which makes cleaning and hygiene products for the industrial market, was acquired in February 1991, and Sweden-based Rufus Forpackings, which makes impregnated wipes, was bought in November. Net interest took more at Pounds 745,000 (Pounds 579,000). The directors recommended raising the final dividend to 3.8p (3.2p) for a total of 6.4p (5.4p), payable from earnings of 19.6p (16.3p) per share.</p>

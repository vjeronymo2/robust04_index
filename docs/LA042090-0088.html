			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> FDA Orders Perrier to Change Its Labels: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  told Perrier to remove the phrase "naturally sparkling" from bottles of the  imported mineral water.  </P> <P> The FDA said Perrier's claim to be "naturally sparkling" is false because the  water is not naturally carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring in  Vergeze, France. The water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a  gas reservoir beneath it after impurities in the gas are filtered out. The firm  said all Perrier bottled after July 29 would bear the new label, which will  say, "Natural mineral water."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PURCHASING MANAGERS SEE GROWTH, BUT FEAR FUTURE  </P> <P> The economy will steer clear of a recession next year but will grow only  moderately, the nation's purchasing managers predicted today.  </P> <P> Although a recession isn't forecast, more corporate purchasing executives are  worried about economic conditions than ever before in the 27 years the National  Assn. of Purchasing Management has asked its members to say how they feel about  the future.  </P> <P> "The exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in 1990 is  overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth, albeit moderate," said Robert  J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee.  </P> <P> Corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they must make spending  decisions based on assumptions about how business will be, how much inflation  will erode buying power and other factors.  </P> <P> The organization's semiannual forecast, released at a news conference, said 64%  of the members expect business to be better rather than worse in 1990 than in  1989.  </P> <P> The forecast said economic growth will average 5% next year, before adjusting  for inflation, with the second half of the year improving from a weak first six  months. Rising capital expenditures, expanding exports and slowing imports will  contribute to the increase in economic output.  </P> <P> Inflation will continue easing next year after turning out to be milder than  previously expected in 1989, the group said.  </P> <P> Purchasers said their prices increased an average of 2.6% in 1989, sharply  lower than the 5% reported for 1988 and less than the 3.7% increase originally  predicted for 1989.  </P></p>

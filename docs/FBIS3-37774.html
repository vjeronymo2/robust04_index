			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nikolay Obertyshev, Russian ambassador in Vilnius,  was summoned today by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys  concerning the illegal transit of military equipment through the  territory of Lithuania.    As has been reported, a Russian train with 26 military  armored vehicles aboard crossed the territory of Lithuania last  weekend without informing the border guards in advance. The  vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen who did  not have the obligatory permission from the Lithuanian Ministry  of Interior Affairs to transport weapons.    Minister Povilas Gylys voiced his concern to the Russian  ambassador concerning the incident and asked Russia to observe  the transit regulations in future.    Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska told the Baltic News  Service correspondent that similar incidents could have a  negative impact on the possibility of signing an agreement with  Russia on its military transit through Lithuania. Events like  this do not prove that Russia would observe the agreement, he  said.</p>

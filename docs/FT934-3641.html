			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Jobs: How shut-outs differ from drop-outs - Student success-rates cast doubt on universities' protests about government policy change Gorblimey] Can it be that a British government has at last decided that a sacred cow of 30 years' standing is largely bull? The protean creature concerned is degree-level education which has grown to absorb almost 10 per cent of the Pounds 32.3bn yearly public cost of education as a whole. What return taxpayers receive on their Pounds 3bn outlays for degree studies is another question. It has rarely been asked, let alone answered, by the country's leaders since the growth policy was first recommended by the Robbins Committee, 30 days before President Kennedy died in Dallas. The committee itself evidently just assumed that producing more graduates would automatically improve Britain's economic performance, besides making for a more civilised society in general. And the non-appearance of the said benefits did not deter a succession of governments from continuing the growth, albeit irregularly, so that the number of full-time students today stands at a million in the round. Then suddenly last week the policy was thrown into reverse by the budget, which ordains that the intake of new undergraduates must be cut by 3.5 per cent next year. Whether that means John Major and company have tired of waiting for the promised benefits and are preparing the beast for protracted slaughter, who but themselves can tell? The issue is so potentially explosive that no ambitious politician would admit having any such intention, whatever the truth of the matter might be. Either way, universities are resisting the change with protests, and not only because it's a poor reward to them for raising staff productivity by 30 per cent in four years. The cut is senseless when white-collar jobs are scarce, they say, since it means that no fewer than 10,000 people who could otherwise have been admitted to degree studies, will now have to be turned away. With due respect to the universities, however, their readiness to quote figures on student admissions contrasts sharply with their statistical shyness on an allied question. It is: how many of the undergraduates who start their courses, quit them without obtaining a degree? While the existence of drop-outs is now at least acknowledged in an annual report, it presents the data in a way far from user-friendly to taxpayers. Indeed, the figures are at once both so re-stricted and so complicated that the number of students who fail to complete their courses can only be estimated, not least because the document neglects to state how many started out. Moreover the information applies solely to the 40-odd older universities, so the former polytechnics lately elevated to the same title are left out of account. Even so, drop-out rates are surely important enough for approximations to be better than no indications at all. Hence the table below which refers to students who ended their undergraduate courses, either with or without gaining a degree, during the three years 1990-92. Each university's name is followed by the estimated total of such students, and next by the actual number who were successful, which is given in the report. Then comes a double complication. Not only does the mix of subjects taught vary from one campus to another, but different kinds of studies present differing levels of difficulty to the students taking them. Among the 20 separate groups of subjects listed in the data, the country-wide success rates range from 81 per cent for architecture and suchlike to 91 per cent for business and administration. But neither the campus-to-campus variances nor the difficulty differences are allowed for in the figures headed 'drop-out rate' which accordingly, as well as being estimates, are an unfair measure to judge any individual university by. A better yardstick is the plus or minus score that follows, which does allow for the variances. It is arrived at by giving each campus a 'target' consisting of the number of drop-outs it would have if its students had conformed to the national averages for the particular groups of subjects they studied. The target is then compared with the estimated number of drop-outs, which I feel confident is in no case badly astray. For example, the estimate for Cambridge is 241 - 861 or 78 per cent better than its target of 1,102. Salford is the opposite with a target of 588, and an estimate 77 per cent worse at 1,043. But in the light of government policy, individual differences are less salient than the overall figures. There, the gap between the actual successes and the estimated total is 31,676 - three times as many drop-outs just from the older universities as the number of new entrants the whole lot of institutions are complaining they will collectively have to turn away.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        Estimated              Drop-out   % better(+)                        total u/g    Number     rate      or worse(-) University              students  successful     %       than target  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Cambridge              8,400      8,159        3          +78 2  Oxford                 9,075      8,625        5          +60 3  Durham                 4,410      4,111        7          +47 4  Warwick                5,692      5,195        9          +33 5  Bristol                5,674      5,185        9          +33 6  Southampton            5,256      4,764        9          +30 7  Nottingham             5,850      5,279       10          +24 8  Leeds                  8,402      7,550       10          +22 9  Loughborough           4,455      3,954       11          +21 10 Aberdeen               3,571      3,216       10          +20 11 Hull                   4,695      4,425        6          +19 12 Lancaster              4,360      3,930       10          +18 13 York                   3,364      3,015       10          +17 14 Birmingham             6,750      5,996       11          +14 15 Exeter                 4,453      3,958       11          +12 16 Belfast                5,600      4,959       11          +11 17 Sheffield              6,542      5,722       13           +5 18 Manchester             8,654      7,568       13           +4 19 Leicester              4,122      3,622       12           +3 20 Bath                   3,070      2,653       14           +2 21 Wales                 17,277     15,184       12           +2 22 Sussex                 3,657      3,210       12           +1 23 Kent                   3,819      3,351       12           -1 24 East Anglia            3,634      3,192       12           -1 25 Ulster                 6,039      5,250       13           -6 26 Essex                  2,824      2,458       13           -6 27 Stirling               2,131      1,873       12           -8 28 UMIST                  3,688      3,089       16          -10 29 Edinburgh              6,147      5,309       14          -10 30 Surrey                 2,779      2,351       15          -12 31 Strathclyde            5,908      4,974       16          -12 32 Aston                  2,985      2,555       14          -13 33 St Andrews             2,484      2,143       14          -15 34 Reading                5,452      4,646       15          -17 35 Keele                  2,492      2,106       16          -20 36 Bradford               3,596      3,040       16          -21 37 Newcastle              6,332      5,279       17          -24 38 Glasgow                6,770      5,626       17          -25 39 Liverpool              6,674      5,527       17          -33 40 London                26,833     22,109       18          -38 41 Heriot-Watt            2,859      2,278       20          -38 42 Brunel                 2,179      1,722       21          -42 43 Dundee                 2,074      1,714       17          -43 44 City                   2,485      2,008       19          -48 45 Salford                3,989      2,946       26          -77  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall                 247,502    215,826       13         same  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE SHARING OF A COMMON BOND;  </P> <P> THE HELMS AMENDMENT CREATES 'AN UNEASY ALLIANCE' BETWEEN THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL  AND THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS  </P> <P> Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) peers across the huge, wood desk in his private digs  in the Cannon House Office Building, drawing a careful parallel between  Hollywood and Washington -- both of which, he says, are "one-industry towns  fueled by gossip."  </P> <P> "When I was first a staffer here on the Hill," Grandy says, gesturing in the  direction of a block of restaurants and shops not far from the Capitol, "there  was a little joint up there that was a watering hole for members of Congress  and their staffs.  </P> <P> "When (Sen.) Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) walked in, it was no big deal, but if Robert  Redford walked in, the place was all aflutter. Now, similarly, at Ma Maison or  the Bistro Garden or Spago in L.A., if Robert Redford walks in, OK, there's a  passing glance perhaps -- to see what he's wearing.  </P> <P> "But if Ted Kennedy walks in, or (retired Lt. Col.) Ollie North, for that  matter, you're talking about something truly fascinating."  </P> <P> Grandy looks up, chuckling. "There is a subtle fascination with each other that  is at the bottom of all this," he says of the common ground between Washington  and Hollywood. "It's almost clandestine. Politicians are fascinated by people  in the arts. People in the arts, in turn, are fascinated by politicians."  </P> <P> This affinity has a great deal to do with how arts issues are dealt out in the  Capitol crucible. Arts politics defies many traditional political laws of  supply and demand. Politicians who gravitate to arts causes tend to do so  because of personal interest in the subject matter -- sometimes even in  apparent defiance of the demographics of their legislative districts.  </P> <P> Arts issues navigate through Congress largely because of this intensely  personal chemistry. In most years, no one notices, because monetary amounts are  small and the issues unlikely to stir major debate. But this year has been  different. Passions have been aroused by a debate over the proper role of the  National Endowment for the Arts. The political tempest this has stirred  sometimes has even overshadowed the revolution in Eastern Europe, defense  spending and the national debt.  </P> <P> Few politicians here could have the natural license Grandy does to draw his  parallel about arts and politics. A former actor, he played Gopher in the  television series "The Love Boat" -- but that was just an interruption in a  Washington career that began in 1970 when Grandy worked as a legislative aide.  </P> <P> Grandy is recognized on the street here sometimes more from his television  persona than for his performances on the floor of the House of Representatives.  His point is that little separates actors and politicians, and this commonality  says a great deal about the confluence of the arts and the making of public  policy.  </P> <P> "No question about it, politicians and artists are both about the same thing,"  said Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance and a  longtime arts-political observer. "Both of them are about getting the feel of  society. Both are very big players in that tunnel of the present that  everything needs to move through to get to the future."  </P> <P> "It's the kind of an issue that you feel the country needs," said Rep. Sidney  Yates (D-Ill.), the 80-year-old dean of arts supporters in the House. "It's the  kind of sustenance that the country needs for its well being, its way of life,  the atmosphere of living. Somebody has to do that kind of work in Congress.  These issues are important and they show an importance to the people."  </P> <P> Grandy's theory -- widely echoed on Capitol Hill -- is one of a variety  proposed by congressmen, senators and their staffs for the peculiar compulsion  that drives the symbiosis of the arts and politics. It is a relationship that  far predates this year's fractious debate over censorship, freedom of  expression and the rights of taxpayers -- as if their collective could ever be  quantified -- not to have to pay for art they don't like.  </P> <P> It is an attraction that transcends many usual measures of political worth.  Political players agree that arts legislation, arts appropriations and arts  issues produce little in terms of votes at reelection time, campaign  contributions or any other common political currency.  </P> <P> Arts issues have a broad constituency in Congress, but recent events suggest  the support may be wider than it is thick. When President Ronald Reagan  attempted to slash the NEA's budget by 50% in 1981 -- with elimination of the  agency proposed for the following year -- arts political leaders formed the  Congressional Arts Caucus and Concerned Senators for the Arts.  </P> <P> Today the Arts Caucus, the second largest in Congress, claims 251 members of  535 in the House and Senate. Ironically, the caucus membership does not include  Yates. "I don't happen to belong," Yates said, "because I try to work in other  ways." Concerned Senators claims a membership of 68 -- more than a two thirds  majority of the chamber.  </P> <P> The emotional volatility of arts issues, however, has largely neutralized this  apparent power of raw numbers in the arts debate this year. Despite the breadth  of membership in the two groups, they were unable to avert the divisive debate  last summer over whether the NEA should make grants to support controversial  art -- including that which is sometimes offensive, obscene or indecent to some  viewers.  </P> <P> In a single Sept. 28 vote in which the Senate, by a margin of 62 to 35, tabled  one in a summer-long series of amendments proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  to impose harsh restrictions on the NEA, seven Senate members of the arts  caucus -- including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) -- voted with Helms.  </P> <P> It has occurred at a time when, coincidentally, the arts caucus has, by most  accounts, evolved into more of a luncheon club at which congressmen and  senators can be photographed with movie stars than a meaningful political  entity.  </P> <P> "I guess I've never really looked to the caucus for great help," said Rep. Bill  Green (R-N.Y.), who represents a strip of Manhattan that includes more museums  and arts institutions than any other single congressional district in the  country. Green is also a member of the caucus executive board. "It is a  wonderful opportunity to get your picture taken with Alan Alda," he said, "but  I don't know that there's much beyond that."  </P> <P> Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) agrees the organization has drifted from its  franchise. "I'm concerned we've gotten away from being able to articulate  better what the purpose of the endowment is," said Jeffords, who was a founder  of the arts caucus while he was a member of the House. "Our purpose is not just  to have lunch with a superstar. Our purpose is to protect the arts and their  function in our society."  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, 17 members of the caucus, led by its chairman, Rep. Bob Carr  (D-Mich.), visited Los Angeles. At least two closed discussions of censorship  concerns were held with local arts officials -- one at the Los Angeles Theatre  Center and the other at the American Film Institute.  </P> <P> Carr insists that the power of the caucus to assure the political well-being of  arts issues is intact. "I think (caucus) members who may have voted in favor of  (Sen. Helms) were playing defensive ball," Carr said. "When we get the issue  off the front page, those members can be counted on to vote for increases in  the NEA budget and to support the activities of the caucus. On any one vote,  people have one eyeball on their reelection and the 30-second TV spot that an  opponent can run on them."  </P> <P> The volatility of the situation has left the arts with just a handful of truly  staunch defenders -- fewer than 20 in both the House and Senate by most counts.  In fact, the burden of defending arts causes has fallen in large degree to just  three people: Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) in the Senate and Yates and Rep. Pat  Williams (D-Mont.) in the House. In 1965, Pell was an original sponsor of the  legislation that initially established the National Endowment for the Arts and  National Endowment for the Humanities.  </P> <P> Moreover, the 1989 battles have occurred just ahead of what could turn out to  be a watershed year for arts politics. Both Pell and Yates have been identified  with arts causes for decades and both men are clearly nearing the ends of their  public careers. Each has announced for reelection in 1990, but both face  potentially bruising and financially well-heeled reelection campaigns.  </P> <P> There is a more than passing chance that each of these arts policy legends --  and with them their enormous clout in seniority in the Senate and House --  could disappear from the political scene next year.  </P> <P> Yates faces a potentially serious primary challenge in his Chicago district  next year from Edwin Eisendrath, 31, a young Chicago alderman from a wealthy  family with a track record of arts patronage. Opinions about what will happen  are divided among seasoned Chicago political observers. Many experts think  Yates will eat Eisendrath alive, but others see the race as threatening to  Yates' 40-year career in the House.  </P> <P> Even if Yates wins, however, the 1990 census is expected to show a drop in  Illinois population and strip the state of perhaps two House seats. Chicago  political observers say Yates' Ninth District may be at risk in  reapportionment.  </P> <P> In Rhode Island, Pell anticipates a general election challenge from Rep.  Claudine Schneider, a moderate-liberal, pro-choice Republican who, though she  has not yet announced her candidacy, reportedly has told Pell privately she  intends to try to unseat him. Observers here say they expect the campaign could  be expensive.  </P> <P> Schneider, an arts caucus member, is expected to formally announce just after  the first of the year. President Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush have already  made fund-raising appearances on her behalf. Schneider's track record on arts  issues is unestablished, but she did speak on the House floor during the  censorship debate in support of controversial photographs produced by Robert  Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano that were the initial causes of the NEA crisis  earlier this year.  </P> <P> Even the theoretical possibility that Yates and/or Pell might vanish from the  scene at such a politically risky juncture for the arts has caused apprehension  in the creative community. "There is no question that Congressman Yates and  Sen. Pell have been of immense help to the arts ever since the arts have been a  part of the federal program," said NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer.  </P> <P> "If they were to pass from the scene politically, it would leave a tremendous  void. How it would fill itself, I can't tell you. There are some very strong  people coming up behind, but I don't think (for instance) that you can replace  Sidney Yates. He has not only been a passionate advocate of the arts, but he  has consummate skill in the workings of the Congress. You're not going to clone  him."  </P> <P> But the American Arts Alliance's Murphy has a longer view. "You know what  happened in the dance world when (the legendary George) Balanchine died (in  1983)? While there is a Balanchine alive, it's real hard to identify clearly  the other talent that exists because the spotlight is so directly on one  person," Murphy said.  </P> <P> "When those leaders aren't there, other people juggle for that spot. Other  times, it'll move into a situation where there is more than one, with  leadership by sharing. You can't identify that new leader until the first one's  not there."  </P> <P> The line of succession in the Senate remains unclear. In the House, Williams  has already established himself as a forceful and passionate political advocate  for the arts. Reps. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) and Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) could  eventually step into Yates' shoes, should Yates not win reelection next year or  retire in the near future even if he does prevail in the 1990 race.  </P> <P> The situation is so fraught with uncertainty that Williams has already publicly  said he may seek a strategy to delay action on a bill extending the NEA's life  -- the agency technically expires next year -- until 1991. The strategy is  controversial, but AuCoin and others in the House and Senate believe it may be  necessary to avoid election year gutting of federal support for the arts driven  by sound-bite politics that cast roles in the debate strictly of congressmen  who favor obscenity and those who oppose it.  </P> <P> "I think it's a smart strategy," AuCoin said. "The last thing I want to do is  give Jesse Helms a horse to ride. Reauthorization ought to occur when people  have time to listen without having feverish panic running through them. That  doesn't happen when the turbochargers are on in an election year."  </P> <P> In a sense, said Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.), the Great Arts Controversy of 1989  caught many people in the House and Senate by surprise -- so much so that the  political initiative was lost, at least temporarily. "The arts have a tradition  of bipartisanship here, but we haven't had any controversy around the arts,  other than a little bit (every few years when the NEA comes up for  reauthorization)," Coleman said.  </P> <P> "Nothing had triggered some sort of political tooling up, so to speak. My sense  is that we don't hear from the arts community except in a time of budget  restraint and that's about it. I guess it's human nature, but if you're going  to be involved in the process, you have to be attuned and involved and have a  presence that is consistent and continual."  </P> <P> Williams, chair of the House Education and Labor Committee's subcommittee on  postsecondary education that will have jurisdiction over the NEA  reauthorization debate, conceded that defections from the ranks of arts  supporters by many senators and congressmen played a key role in the political  turmoil of the last few months.  </P> <P> Williams said the fact that 1990 is an election year is crucially important. He  said defections from the ranks of senators and congressmen who may normally be  counted as arts advocates are inevitable in a political climate in which  conservatives have promised to make any vote or public position in favor of  controversial arts projects into high-profile campaign issues. Thus, Williams  said, many in Congress who would normally provide votes to stave off  encroachments on artistic freedom may elect to cover themselves politically,  instead.  </P> <P> "It (the disarray among arts supporters in Congress) has something to do with  the fact that people in the House and Senate who insisted on the (Helms'  original amendment) were cleverly appealing to the lowest common denominator,"  Williams said. "That is the fear of the unknown by the American taxpayer and  the unwillingness of the American taxpayer to have their tax dollars used for  any effort for which they are not in full agreement.  </P> <P> "Short-run appeals to the dark side of human nature are quite often successful  -- in the short run. What Sen. Helms is after will bear some political fruit,  but only in the near term.  </P> <P> "If you can tap that fear of that unknown, you can open up a political vein in  America. Many members were simply very hopeful that a compromise that didn't  violate the freedom of artistic expression could be reached (and congressmen  stranded by political risk of bucking Helms would be let off the hook). I think  in reaching the compromise, we breached the threshold of censorship."  </P> <P> Williams referred to language in the NEA's 1990 appropriation bill that  prohibits support to obscene artworks that do not meet high standards of  artistic excellence. The wording itself appears to most legal experts to  effectively prohibit nothing, but early tests of the NEA's nervousness about  coming in conflict with the political sentiment that led to the language has  already led to a crisis when Frohnmayer cut off -- and then restored -- a grant  to an AIDS-related art show in New York that contained some politically  provocative and sexually explicit work.  </P> <P> The episode underscored the political vulnerability of the arts endowment since  Frohnmayer, a former Portland, Ore., lawyer, stumbled badly in making political  decisions about how to control the controversy. His having to take a crash  course in Washington political reality could not come at a less propitious  moment.  </P> <P> Helms, who has consistently refused to discuss his arts philosophy or political  strategy with reporters in any depth, declined half a dozen interview requests  in the preparation of this article.  </P> <P> At the same time, politicians and arts-politics observers here agree that the  nation's arts community suffers from a striking naivete in its attempts to deal  with the political rough-and-tumble of Washington. This naivete -- combined  with a paralyzing inability to take action when this year's political crisis  first developed -- made a bad political situation far worse than it should have  become, these observers say.  </P> <P> "I think most congressmen . . . have a sort of generalized warm and cozy  feeling about (NEA grant) money coming, for instance, to the Omaha symphony,  and they feel some pride in that," said James Fitzpatrick, a prominent  Washington arts lawyer and president of the Washington Project for the Arts, a  local artist-run gallery and collective. "But the arts as an effective positive  lobbying force has never been one where there has been perceived to be any need  for it.  </P> <P> "Politically, art has become an issue in a negative context. That has to change  dramatically. There's going to need to be a new, energetic, pro-active strategy  that much more aggressively defines the federal government's involvement in the  arts as an essential part of our economic and cultural life.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to find ways in 30-second sound bites to carry the message  that, just like great education and good health, a flourishing arts community  is important to our civilization. Unfortunately, I don't think the arts  community, at this point, is either prepared or capable of doing it."  </P> <P> Jeffords, the arts caucus founder, said artists and arts organizations tend to  leave their heads in the political sand until some immediate crisis looms, then  bombard the Washington offices of a too-narrow group of congressmen with  panic-stricken demands for help. "I think the arts community has a tendency to  stay within themselves and to really live in a world of their own," he said.  "They need to break out of that. They need to understand the real world of  politics."  </P> <P> Politicians are openly skeptical of whether artists and arts groups are equal  to the task of adapting to Congress as it may evolve on arts policy issues in  the 1990s. "To date, arts groups have only been required -- let's face it -- to  influence a handful of members of the House and Senate," Williams said. But the  political gloves have come off in the last year and arts issues have been moved  into the realm of some of the traditional high-controversy grist of the  political mill.  </P> <P> "Now, I assume it has occurred to them (arts leaders) that they have 535 people  they have to influence if they are to avoid worsening government censorship,"  Williams said. "Are they up to it? I don't see signs that they are."  </P> <P> * Washington Profiles: A look at the leading art advocates in Congress. Page  101.  </P></p>

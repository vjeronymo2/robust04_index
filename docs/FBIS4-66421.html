			<p>CSO     [Text] ``No fancy ideas. Just the execution of rock-bottom  rationalization and the promotion of a shift toward commercial  business...'' So commented Yutaka Hineno, a managing director  and the general manager, the Aircraft and Special Vehicle  division, talking about the difficulties of their  defense-related business. The sales to the Defense Agency in  FY92, which normally amount to about 80% of said  division's  total sales, drastically reduced due to the defence budget cut  caused by the end of the Cold War, resulting in a two digit drop  for the first time in four years.  <H5>  Shrinking Pie </H5>   A budget cut of 580 billion was decided last year for the  current Mid-Term Defense Program (FY91-95) which was started  with a total budget of &yen;22,750 billion. It was a downward  adjustment implemented one year earlier of the schedule. Such an  adjustment was more or less expected by defense-related  companies. The real test is what is going to be announced in the  next Mid-Term Defense Program, whose preparation starts next  year. Shigeru Hatakeyama, the administrative vice-minister,  describing the difficulty in having the budget proposal  approved, comments, ``I have been explaining to the Ministry of  Finance that the defense budget is stiff and stark and there is  very little left to be shaven off. But they insist that, if  that's the case, we should reduce the number of airplanes and  ships to lessen the burdens of the later years of the term; I  feel that they are not ready to give us a break yet.''    As if there haven't been enough problems, the government's  intention to increase the purchase of U.S. made equipment, not  just because of the traditional dependency on the U.S.  technology, but also because of its desire to improve the trade  friction with the U.S., is becoming more conspicuous these days,  so that the Japanese defense manufacturers may have to face a  more difficult time in the future as they have to share the  shrinking pie.    Hineno himself admits that ``the orders of tanks and  fighters  have reduced considerably already, and will continue to do so  toward FY97.'' Even after that, they'll have to depend on an  uncertain prospect that the next generation support fighter FSX,  which is being developed, and the next generation small  observation and reconnaissance helicopter OHX will enter the  production periods.  <H5>  Defense Agency Appreciates </H5>   The Defense Agency appreciates Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  (``MHI'') efforts and asserts, ``We are impressed with MHI's  solid quality and technology, but also their pride and strong  sense of responsibility as the leader of the defense industry.''  This confidence is shown in the delivery record; the equipment  contract for this company for FY92 was &yen;339.3 billion  (market share: 24.5%), a whopping lead over the second  place  Kawasaki Heavy Industries's &yen;113.3 billion (8.2|).    However, the fact that they are the giant means also that  they will be hurt most by the defense budget cut. In the mean  time, the focus of the technological innovation is shifting  toward the software industry linked with electronics technology,  as was evidenced in the ``Patriot'' missile in the Gulf War.  Hineno avows that, ``The basis of our division is the defense  business. The technology will keep improving itself, so that we  will do our best to sustain and improve our defense-related  basic technology even if it means a lot of pain to us.'' The  Defense Agency's top brass coincide by saying, ``We know that  the situation is not easy for them, but MHI fully understands  that once they lose control of R&amp;D, which is the basis of the  defense business, it would be difficult to reconstruct it.''  <H5>  Commercial Business is the Key </H5>   The only key to solve this bind is the commercial business.  The plan is to double the commercial sales to &yen;100 billion  by FY97, while preserving the defense technology.    The defense business has been allowed to add up the cost  under the Defense Agency's auditing, and they have been  guaranteed of a certain profit unless they make an exorbitant  error. This practice has caused this division to lose sight of a  sharp cost awareness. ``The defense division has been treated as  a sacred area so far, but no more. From now on, cost reduction  shall be the top priority for them, regardless of the fact  whether we are asked to do so by the Defense Agency or not,''  declares Kentaro Aikawa, the president. We heard a doubt whether  the technologies generated in the defense business can be  smoothly converted into the commercial business or not, because  the cost is the top priority in the commercial business, while  the performance of the product is the top priority.    As the cost reduction measures, they are already increasing  the ratio of imported parts, rationalizing the production lines,  and reviewing the ratio of the direct/non-direct departments.  Also, they are evaluating the possibility of applying the  research and production technologies generated for the missile  guidance electronics to commercial uses. Although it is certain  that these countermeasures won't have any impact on immediate  terms, the slowdown in the defense business provides them a good  chance to tighten the belt on the cost factors, and the effort  of creating new businesses will be helpful in restructuring of  the division. The defense division, which has always been the  core of the company, in parallel with the prime mover division,  is now at a major turning point.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (5): Trying to win it the Ali way - Hugh Carnegy finds most Norwegians are still Eurosceptics At first sight, the bid by prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's minority Labour government to persuade Norwegians to join the European Union looks like an exercise in political masochism. In 1972, Norwegians voted no in an earlier referendum on the question, after a bitterly divisive campaign that toppled the Labour administration of the day and prompted the resignation of the then prime minister, Mr Trygve Bratteli. Twenty-two years on, the country appears to be, if anything, more hostile to EU membership. Opinion polls have for months shown opposition - excluding undecided voters  - at around 55 per cent, ahead of the 53.5 per cent majority achieved by the No side in 1972. Senior government officials freely acknowledge that the task of reversing this obstinate trend in time for this year's referendum on November 28 will be, at best, extremely difficult. 'We have said all along that if we get the campaign right, we have a chance. But if we get it wrong, we have no chance at all,' says an aide to Mrs Brundtland. To that end, the emphasis from the government side to date has been on preparing the ground for a Yes campaign that will not move into top gear until after the summer holidays, rather than campaigning itself. This is partly to ensure that the Labour party, in particular, does not splinter over the issue despite the anti-EU stance of many of its supporters. But it is also a deliberate attempt to try to draw the sting of the No side before the last vital few weeks of the campaign. The prime minister's aide likened the tactics to those once employed by former world heavyweight boxing champion Mohammed Ali. 'We will take all the punishment and then try to hit them at the end.' So far, the government's plan has gone well - notwithstanding the lack of movement in the opinion polls. Labour survived a surge in last autumn's general election by the fiercely anti-EU Centre party which saw the opposition Conservative party - the strongest advocate of EU membership - knocked back into third place in numbers of seats in the Storting (parliament). The accession agreement secured with Brussels in March was accepted as favourable by key sceptics in the government, notably Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister. Lately, a Labour party congress has seemed set to endorse EU membership as official party policy. Above all, the Yes vote in this month's Austrian referendum has started a ball rolling, which Mrs Brundtland hopes will pick up speed with a Yes vote in fellow applicants Finland and Sweden in October and mid-November, creating a momentum which will turn the issue her way in Norway. Crucially, opinion polls in Norway have shown a small majority for joining the EU if neighbouring Sweden, where opposition is also still very strong, decides to join. EU supporters believe large numbers of voters - perhaps 40 per cent or more  - are still undecided or persuadable. Mr Johan J. Jakobsen, former leader of the Centre party, now leader of its parliamentary group and a leading figure in the well-organised No campaign, admits that a Swedish Yes vote would make for 'a very close race' in Norway. The other side of the coin, however, is that a Swedish No would all but ensure a Norwegian No. Given the great uncertainty that still surrounds the outcome in Sweden, the No side in Norway remains extremely confident that it will prevail. In 1972, the key factors in the No victory were the fear of the politically-important fishing communities that allowing outside fishermen access to Norwegian waters would devastate already depleted stocks, and a broader fear that a process of population shift away from Norway's remote northern regions would be accelerated by membership. There are strong echoes of these themes again in the new No campaign. 'The main issue is the question of democracy,' says Mr Jakobsen. 'Many Norwegians feel the EU is developing in a direction in which democracy will be diminished. They are against an integrated, federal Europe. They fear we will have no influence and too much power will lie in the hands of bureaucrats.' Secondly, he says, there is a fear that Norway's control over its natural resources - its oil and gas, its fisheries, minerals and water  - will be subjugated to policy made in Brussels. This in turn, he says, will mean Norway will have less ability to sustain its policies of sustaining rural communities through big regional and agricultural subsidies and of maintaining the extensive welfare system. The Yes campaign acknowledges the potency of these arguments in a country jealous of its independence, which it won from Sweden only in 1905 and which was interrupted traumatically by Nazi occupation during the second world war. 'I believe if you analyse all the important elements in the popular resistance to membership, it boils down to uncertainty, fear and insecurity about everything from defence to unemployment,' says Mr Arve Thorvik, leader of a group of prominent people who campaigned for a No vote in 1972, but now favour membership. The Yes side's attempts to overcome these fears have so far been ineffective, however. Norway's membership of the European Economic Area market access agreement with the EU means most of the trade benefits of full membership have already been achieved. Politically, the argument that Norway, already a member of Nato, needs to deepen its involvement in European moves towards common security policies is undermined by conflicting signals coming from inside the union of what its existing members want to achieve. 'We have to sell an argument that is hard to sell these days, and that is solidarity,' says Mr Thorvik. 'There is no immediate economic argument for entry, the main argument is political and it is difficult to sell an EU which itself is lacking in direction.' What the Yes side is left with is the worry that Norway will be left isolated if it stays outside the EU. But Mr Jakobsen is unimpressed by this line of attack. 'We are not afraid of that,' he says. 'Norway is in Nato and plays a role in so many international organisations. Norway will always be an interesting partner for other countries.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Special Services Have Not Lost </F> Interest in the Dnieper Region"]    [Text] In a conversation with a UKRINFORM correspondent,  the chief of Ukraine's Security Service Administration in  Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Lieutenant General Volodymyr Slobodenyuk,  pointed to a considerable increase in interest that foreign  special services are showing in the Dnieper region. Last year,  officers of the administration kept under their control the  unofficial presence in the region, under various covers, of more  than 20 trained foreign intelligence agents. The  counterintelligence department thwarted attempts to create two  intelligence cells in the region, including one representing the  interests of one of the Near Eastern countries. Hostile actions  on the part of a number of European countries, the United  States, and China were also uncovered, recorded, and discarded.    The interest on the part of foreign firms and informers on  their payroll in the Dnieper region, where Ukraine's powerful  scientific and industrial and defense potential is concentrated,  is not accidental. Many unique technologies, designs, and  samples of technology and materials that have not yet been used  anywhere else in the world are being created there.</p>

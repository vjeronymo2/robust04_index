			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 12 TASS -- It remains to see whether  the population of the maritime territory (the Russian far east)  will be able to survive next winter. This is how the situation  was described by participants of an extraordinary meeting of the  Council of the Maritime Trade Union Federation and the  Coordination Committee for Joint Actions, which took place here  today. The meeting discussed the extraordinary situation in the  territory, which is deteriorating with every passing day.    More than one-third of the territory's production capacities  have already come to a standstill. The number of unemployed has  topped 10,000, according to official figures. Unofficial  sources claim their number is five times bigger.    The average monthly cost of a basket of 19 staple foodstuffs  now equals to 100,000 rubles in the maritime territory as  against 46,000 rubles in the Russian capital and in the rest of  the country. According to the most modest estimates, forty per  cent of the territory's population are now below the poverty  line.    The cost of power-carriers is growing and the sum of default  payments has grown to astronomic figures due to this. For  instance, the local enterprises owe only "Dalenergo" (far  eastern power society) as much as 200 billion rubles. The main  power supplier is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has no money  even to carry out current repairs and to prepare for the winter  season.    The cost of coal has increased. The local consumers were  compelled to give up using imported and liquid fuel. The local  resources, which have to be regularly augmented, have diminished  to a critical level. The participants of the meeting pointed  out that the Russian government, overlooking the region's  specific features, was continuing to increase taxes and tariffs  on electricity, thereby contributing to the boosting of  socio-economic tension in the maritime territory.    The centre's latest instruction to raise the cost of one  kilowatt of electricity makes the situation in the territory  simply explosive. This view was shared by the heads of urban  and district administrations of the territory, executives and  managers.    In their opinion, preferential tariffs for electricity  should  be fixed to pull the maritime territory out of the social, fuel  and power crisis. They also called for the territory's  inclusion in the list of regions of the far north and  application to it of the law on privileges to their population,  paid from the federal budget. Moreover, they believe it is  necessary to change the taxation system by differentiating it  and substantially reducing the taxes on profits, collected from  enterprises.    The meeting recommended Vladimir Ignatenko, the presidential  representative, to urgently inform Boris Yeltsin on the  situation in the maritime territory.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREE SPEECH  </P> <P> In reply to James K. Hahn, our esteemed city attorney (letter, June 9), I'd  like to point out that the enemies of free speech and the free press are fond  of citing "lurid examples" to turn us away from our guaranteed constitutional  rights. They say, "Yes, of course, free speech, but this thing goes beyond the  bounds of . . ., etc."  </P> <P> The problem with this is so many people have their own particular and personal  hang-ups, leading to a far-ranging litany of "lurid examples." One man's free  speech is another's "lurid example." And this is why I believe our Founding  Fathers, in their infinite wisdom, put no reservations on freedom of speech or  freedom of the press.  </P> <P> Our freedom of speech and press was never meant to safeguard "Goldilocks and  the Three Bears," or "Pollyanna." Those things need no protection.  </P> <P> The precepts of free speech and press were meant to safeguard those things  which might seem offensive to certain people, and being offended or even  disgusted is a lesser imposition than the abrogation of those rights which make  this a free country.  </P> <P> Should a person have the right to yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater?  Reluctantly I'd have to say yes. Because the potential harm is far less than  giving up our rights to a free society.  </P> <P> BILL IDELSON  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Northern Foods ahead 24% midway NORTHERN Foods increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 68.4m in the six months to September 30, helped by contributions from the Express Dairy and Eden Vale chilled food operations acquired a year ago. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, said the result was achieved in spite of worse-than-expected trading conditions, which he believed would persist at least until next spring. He warned that devaluation of the green pound, used in EC farm trade, combined with inflation, would add between 6 per cent and 8 per cent to food prices next year. But recession would make it hard for manufacturers to pass on the increase. Nonetheless, he said Northern Foods' margins would improve next year as it benefited from rationalisation of its dairy and meat businesses. The company aimed to cut costs by between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m and shed 3,000 jobs by June. The pre-tax result, up from Pounds 55.2m a year ago, was achieved on sales of Pounds 969.9m (up from Pounds 655.6m). Operating profits were 41 per cent higher at Pounds 81.2m, but the operating margin slipped to 8.4 per cent from 8.8 per cent. Earnings per share rose 3 per cent to 8.92p from 8.66p, reflecting the Pounds 227m rights issue to fund the Pounds 359m purchase of Express and Eden Vale. Excluding these and lesser acquisitions, sales rose by 7 per cent and operating profits by 8 per cent. Express and Eden Vale were being integrated on schedule. Head offices and two dairies were being closed, a Pounds 9m bottling plant was being built, and London milk rounds were being turned into franchises. Operating profits and sales improved in dairy, convenience foods and grocery, helped by strong growth in recipe dishes, new grocery products and higher milk prices. Growth in bread and sandwiches was below expectations. Operating profit on meat fell 7 per cent and sales stagnated. The division's plants were being reduced from 11 to five. Northern Foods made capital investments of Pounds 45m, chiefly in its dairy, meat and convenience foods businesses. Acquisitions increased debt to Pounds 255.9m (from Pounds 109.7m) and finance charges to Pounds 12.8m (from Pounds 2.5m.) The interim dividend rises 5 per cent to 3.4p. Lex, Page 20</p>

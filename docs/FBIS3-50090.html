			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.L. and P.W.R.: "Walesa and Olechowski Are </F> Surprised"]    [Text] President Lech Walesa expressed his "surprise and  lack of understanding" and the foreign affairs minister his  "surprise and sorrow"--all this was in official communiques  issued by their press spokesmen. The reason for these statements  is the establishment by the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee of an  extraordinary subcommittee, whose task is to evaluate the  condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ].    The subcommittee was set up through the votes of the  deputies  of the governing coalition and the Union of Labor party.  Deputies of Democratic Union refused to take part in the  subcommittee's work; the establishment of the subcommittee was  criticized by the Deputies' Club of the Nonparty Bloc in Support  of Reforms.    According to Olechowski, the decision establishing the  subcommittee infringes upon the powers of the minister of  foreign affairs. Also at a meeting with Sejm Speaker Jozef  Oleksy the minister expressed his sorrow at the fact that it had  been set up.    There were rumors in the Sejm building that the entire  subcommittee affair might lead to a conflict between the  coalition and the Belweder. It was speculated that, if the  coalition had received the post of a deputy minister in the MSZ,  which it demanded, the subcommittee would probably not have been  established. Tadeusz Iwinski, deputy of the Democratic Left  Alliance, denied this information. He believes that the  committee will help select the right people for the MSZ posts,  such as the posts of ambassadors. He also said that, in recent  years, many candidates without the right qualifications have  been appointed to these posts.</p>

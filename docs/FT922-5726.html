			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology: Optical illusion on disc Until last year Carlin Music, one of Britain's oldest music publishers, kept 85,000 contracts in filing cabinets. Contracts were pulled out whenever they were needed and as a result many became dog-eared. Occasionally a copy might even go missing. The catalogue continued to grow and Carlin finally realised that it needed a more efficient method of storage. 'Adding more staff and filing cabinets would have only made the problem bigger,' says Amos Biegun, computer manager at Carlin. The obvious alternative was an electronic imaging system, but until recently they have been prohibitively expensive. Now, however, falling hardware prices and software packages which will run on industry standard PCs have brought such systems within the reach of small businesses like Carlin. Beginning in December Carlin began the process of replacing its manual filing system with a document imaging system based on a PC-based document image processing (Dip) software package called ScanView Professional from Greengage Development, a leading UK-based Dip developer. Using a high-speed, 20-page-per-minute document scanner Carlin's contracts were scanned into the system and squeezed using file compression techniques. They were then stored electronically. Because Carlin needed to store so many documents, an optical 'juke box' was also installed which makes several discs - each of which holds up to 30,000 pages - available instantly. The system including hardware cost about Pounds 30,000 and is expected to pay for itself quickly. Carlin is now considering using Greengage's latest product, FilePlus V2.0, for its other document storage and retrieval needs including copyright, royalties and accounting. Greengage will be one of the exhibitors at the two-day OIS/Document Management 92 conference and exhibition at Wembley Conference and Exhibition Centre in London, which begins on Tuesday. The event has been arranged by Meckler, the IT conference and exhibition organiser, and Cimtech (the National Centre for Information Management and Technology).</p>

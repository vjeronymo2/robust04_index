			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: And now for yet another sterling effort - London To Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of Wellcome Trust: Dear Mr Gibbs, I hear you are looking for someone to manage the Pounds 2bn-plus cash you raised this week when you sold 270m of your Wellcome shares. I would like to apply for the job. Perhaps I should tell you the way I am thinking about the stock market just now, and give you some idea of how I would invest your money. I know you want to increase the yield you get on your investments so that you can spend more on medical research. I understand you are planning to put Pounds 500m or so into an indexed fund to start off with, and hope to get about 40 per cent of the cash into equities over the next nine months. You will be putting the rest into fixed-interest stocks. Then, I hear, you are looking to have about 80 per cent in shares two years from now. Well, I have to say I cannot see out two years at the moment. My horizons have got rather shorter of late. In fact, I am not sure I can see anything beyond the next few months. It strikes me that the recession is turning even nastier. Look at the man in the street. House repossessions are still bad and mortgage arrears are rising, so where does that put the consumer-led recovery? The CBI survey this week showed that companies are not cheerful, either. Everyone thought that company chairmen would be making more optimistic noises over the next few weeks as they announced their interim results. But, already, we have had some gloomy remarks. Take ICI. Sir Denys Henderson is a clever chap. He managed to get his own share price up by saying he was thinking about demerging the business. At the same time, though, he hit the market with news that profits were down and would have been much worse but for the redundancies his company has made. Trading is still weak, he says, and he cannot predict the end of the recession. And listen to what the banks are saying. Midland and Lloyds both reported figures this week. Although bad debts are down a bit, activity is at a low level. New loans are not being made at anything like the rate which would suggest that companies are beginning to expand again. Now look at the equity market. It has been falling pretty well non-stop since post-election euphoria ran out in May. True, it did bounce for a couple of days this week and reached 2,423.2 on Wednesday. But, by last night's close, the Footsie was back under 2400 at 2399.6, up only 22.4 on the week. The rally on Tuesday and Wednesday was down partly to you putting some of that cash into the market. Wall Street was going up, too, which always helps. And, on Wednesday, BAT Industries announced a big rise in earnings. I would not read too much into BAT's profit increase, though; much of it was just recovery from the dreadful losses it had made on its mortgage indemnity insurance. So, I reckon that rally was just a brief respite in the downward trend. I have to admit here that I got that idea from Nick Knight, the Nomura strategy guru. He was right to be bearish when most of the other stockbrokers were trying to get people to buy shares after the election. Now that the others have reduced their forecasts for the market, he has cut his again. He has worked out that, in each of the past three election years, the market has fallen quite sharply from a post-election high. The average fall is 21 per cent. And, so far, the Footsie has fallen only 12 per cent from the high in May. So, he says, it would have to go down to about 2,150 just to fall by the average. What would drive the market down that far, you ask? Well, Nick thinks the UK is heading for a sterling crisis (you remember them, we used to have them regularly before the pound went into the European exchange rate mechanism). Sir Denys of ICI and Brian Pearse at Midland Bank both put in their oar on Thursday, saying we should devalue sterling in the ERM and then interest rates could come down. Sir Kit McMahon was saying much the same thing in the Financial Times 10 days ago and he used to be number two at the Bank of England, so he ought to know. It gets rather hard for the government to maintain any credibility for its stance on the exchange rate when top people are saying that sort of thing. And Norman Lamont does not seem to be doing a great job as chancellor of the exchequer in calming fears. Indeed, some say he is so relaxed he is horizontal. The foreigners who buy and sell sterling may well think the time is right to get out. In the end, that could mean higher UK interest rates, not lower, and then the recession will turn into a slump. If the government is forced into abandoning its zero inflation target - and the sooner the better, I say - then your long-term plan to be in equities looks a good one. But I am a bit worried about your keenness to buy gilt-edged stock at the moment, though. I realise I am on tricky ground here, as you know all about gilts from your time running that discount house Gerrard &amp; National. But the government is going to have to issue an awful lot of gilts this year; and if sterling came under pressure and interest rates had to rise, I do not think that gilts would do terribly well. Anyway, you can get pretty much the same rate of interest by putting the cash on deposit, or by buying gilts issued by other governments. I hear the French ones are quite attractive. I expect you would like to know what my track record is as an investor. I have to confess my investment in residential property is not doing too well. On the other hand, the cash I have in the building society is as safe as the houses it is lent on. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

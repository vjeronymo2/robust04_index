			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China welcomes foreign investment in manufacturing  telecommunications equipment but will bar overseas companies  from the industry's service sector in order to protect its own  infant industry, a senior Chinese official says.    In response to confusion over China's policy, Xu Shanyan, a  director-general in the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, also said yesterday foreign investors could  not sell telecommunications equipment to China. Joint-venture  manufacturing of equipment was allowed, he said. It was only  the service sector they would be excluded from.    One of the reasons for shutting out foreigners was China  needed to co-ordinate its policies and services and to link them  up into a national network. Foreign participation would cause  confusion. China's telecommunications industry was still in "a  primitive stage", said Mr Xu. He added the move did not  conflict with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade which China wanted to join. But China did want to  improve its manufacturing capabilities, he said.    "We would like to actively co-operate with foreign  manufacturers. We are still exploring beneficial ways for  foreign investment." Some foreigners are wary of China's  demands. "The industry is moving so fast that we just can't  move operations of our most advanced equipment to China," said  one American businessman.    Mr Xu said by the end of the decade China could have as many  as 140 million telephone lines, compared with about 40 million  now, and the waiting list for installation could be reduced to  one month from the current six or more months. China is due to  spend about U.S.$41 billion over the next six years to create a  telecommunications network. It will include massive  construction of trunk optical cables, satellite earth stations,  digital microwave lines, a postal air cargo system and expanded  telephone exchange capacity.    In Beijing, the number of telephone lines increased from  113,000 in 1980 to 560,000 in 1990. The city, with a population  of 10.5 million people has a telephone exchange capacity of 1.05  million lines with 663,000 actually installed. By the end of  the year, capacity should rise to 1.54 million with  installations at 970,000, according to Jia Yong, vice-director  of the Beijing Telecommunications Administration.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK rejects Chinese veto over projects BRITAIN yesterday acted swiftly to reject a warning by China that it had the right to veto all long-term projects and contracts in Hong Kong after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. In the latest of the increasingly acrimonious exchanges between the two countries on the colony's future, the Foreign Office said Beijing's threat was contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's future mini-constitution, 'contracts which are valid under Hong Kong's existing laws will continue to be valid and protected. . .after 1997,' the Foreign Office statement said. The statement was in response to China's claim that any government contracts not expressly approved by Beijing, except for 'the provisions on land leases', would expire with British sovereignty over the colony. Earlier yesterday, Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad, called in Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese ambassador in London, to express the UK government's 'surprise and concern' at other complaints by Chinese officials last week over a projected ship container terminal in Hong Kong. Mr Goodlad said Beijing's charge that the Hong Kong government had failed to consult China in the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) before announcing a grant for the colony's ninth container terminal was inaccurate. There was no requirement for such consultation in the JLG since it was a land grant and not a franchise, Mr Goodlad told the ambassador. On the other hand, consultations had been held in a separate body, the Sino-British Land Commission, and the land grant for the terminal had been approved by the Chinese on March 20. He stressed that there had already been eight other terminals for which a similar procedure had been followed and the Chinese had raised no complaints. Britain is also involved in a running battle with Peking over the funding of Hong Kong's multi-billion pound new airport project, which also risks being cancelled if China carries out its veto threat after the colony's handover in 1997. Contracts not completed by then could be at risk. It is clear, however, that all these economic disputes are rooted in Peking's bitter opposition to Mr Patten's democratic reforms. Though very limited by normal western standards, these reforms are clearly seen by the present Chinese government as the thin end of the wedge, leading to a form of self-government entirely alien to its communist philosophy.</p>

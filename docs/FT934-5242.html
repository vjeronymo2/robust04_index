			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Fiscal magician conjures away gloom on deficit The chancellor donned the mantle of a fiscal magician yesterday by conjuring away previous gloomy projections of large budget deficits over the next few years. Against fevered speculation in recent weeks of large tax rises, Mr Kenneth Clarke performed the vanishing act largely through announcing deep cuts in public spending that will hit defence, local government and transport particularly hard while allowing room for growth in social security spending. An important element of Mr Clarke's plan to cut the budget deficit to Pounds 12bn in 1997-98 - as against the Pounds 30bn predicted by his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont in the March Budget - is the Treasury's new projection of robust economic growth during the 1990s, with inflation remaining weak. The Treasury believes fairly strong economic activity over the next few years should boost tax revenues, while because of low wage and price pressures, spending can be cut without significantly affecting the level of public services. While keeping the Treasury's previous forecast that the gap between public spending and revenues will be about Pounds 50bn this financial year, Mr Clarke reduced the forecast of the 1994-95 deficit to Pounds 38bn from the Pounds 44bn predicted in March. To achieve the cut, he announced a reduction in the public expenditure 'control total' to Pounds 251.3bn in the coming financial year. The chancellor said the 1994-95 spending reduction was Pounds 3.6bn, allowing for an accounting reclassification of government payments to private-sector electricity generators. Total general government spending, which takes in cyclical social security spending and debt interest, is pencilled in at Pounds 292bn in the next financial year as against the Pounds 296bn previously projected. Under the chancellor's new plans, the public-sector borrowing requirement for 1995-96 is set at Pounds 30bn, less than the Pounds 39bn projected in March. Part of the reason for the more bullish projection is that in this year the control total has been cut by Pounds 1.5bn on the government's previous plans while revenue growth is expected to be relatively high.</p>

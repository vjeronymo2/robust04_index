			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Ciments Francais offer CIMENTS Francais, the French cement producer, said yesterday it was offering Pta4,587 a share for the remaining 22 per cent of Cementos Rezola, the biggest producer in Spain's Basque Country, which it does not already control. The offer would cost Ciments Francais some Dollars 44m, and has been set at a premium of 93 per cent of Rezola's current share price. Ciments Francais has already said it plans to delist Rezola once it gains full control. The Basque producer will probably be absorbed into Ciments Francais' larger Spanish affiliate, Financiera y Minera, one of Spain's biggest cement producers. The Ciments Francais offer comes just a few days after Corporacion Banesto, the industrial arm of the Banesto banking group, offered a premium of 32 per cent to buy out and delist Sanson, another cement producer from northern Spain. Analysts say the moves reflect further consolidation in the Spanish cement sector.</p>

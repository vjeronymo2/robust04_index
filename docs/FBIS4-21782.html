			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  prevented Jewish worshipers from Hebron from entering the Cave  of the Patriarchs.    An Army source told our correspondent Moti Amir that the  settlers caused a disturbance at the site and that the soldiers  were forced to confiscate the weapons of some of the Jews in  order to prevent a worse confrontation between them, the IDF,  and Arab residents. No one was arrested but the soldiers took  down the particulars of some of the settlers.</p>

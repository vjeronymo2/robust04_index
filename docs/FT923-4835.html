			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Funding programme to have dual function THE Treasury's new Ecu10bn multi-currency funding programme, announced yesterday, represents an innovative two-pronged attack on the government's financial difficulties. The financing will have the dual function of supporting sterling in the foreign exchange market and funding government spending. The Bank of England, charged with arranging the Ecu10bn borrowing, must tread a fine line between securing the lowest possible interest rate costs and achieving its foreign exchange objectives. The first part of the financing consists of a multi-currency revolving credit facility totalling Ecu5bn, the largest ever completed. The entire proceeds of the facility will initially be drawn down in D-Marks and then sold for sterling, providing a substantial boost for the pound. The first half of the facility, due to be signed today, will be drawn down in the next few days, and the remaining DM5bn later in the month. The interest rate on drawings is  3/32 point above the London interbank offered rate, and drawings can be made in D-Marks, dollars, yen, Swiss francs or Ecu. The facility, arranged by Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and National Westminster Bank, runs for three years. The zero risk weighting of UK debt, which means that no extra capital has to be earmarked, allows banks holding the paper to earn a reasonable return. The margin, given the extremely large size of the deal, was considered about as narrow as banks would accept. Although a recent three-year loan for the European Community paid interest of only  1/32 point over Libor, the size of the deal was much smaller at Ecu500m and the deal proved difficult to syndicate: Credit Lyonnais has kept about 70 per cent of the paper. In the case of the UK's Ecu5bn facility, the four UK banks are taking about 70 per cent of the paper between them, with the remaining 30 per cent split between a group of international banks. The other half of the Ecu10bn borrowing programme, which starts next month, is much less defined. Although termed a 'multi-currency note issue programme', it does not consist of any pre-set documentation, but rather will be made up of a variety of borrowings, which could be structured in any form - bills, notes or bonds, - for any maturity, and in any currency. However, the need to match funding costs and foreign exchange action will limit the range of options. Once a further Ecu5bn has been raised - which is expected to be before the end of the financial year - the Bank may raise additional amounts to refinance the bank credit on finer terms. The whole amount will again be used to buy sterling. It is possible some of the funding could be done through the Bank's existing Ecu bill and note programmes, but any such funding would be in addition to the existing programmes. Apart from its recent forays into the Ecu market, the UK has not raised funds in a foreign currency since the mid-1980s, when a series of floating-rate notes denominated in dollars were launched. Its last syndicated facility was a Dollars 1.5bn facility in 1977.</p>

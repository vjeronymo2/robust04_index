Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi wrote separate inscriptions on the  fifth anniversary of the magazine's publication.    Jiang Zemin's inscription reads: "Make a success of party  building research and serve the party's basic line," whereas Li  Peng's inscription reads: "The more we carry out reform and  opening up, the more we need to strengthen party building."  Qiao Shi's inscription reads: "Build the party into a strong  core that leads the cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics." Song Ping, Bo Yibo, and Song Renqiong also  wrote inscriptions.    During the forum, Hu Jintao, Song Ping, and comrades in  charge of relevant departments held spirited discussions with  veteran comrades, party workers, and comrades from news  organizations who were invited to attend the forum. They  discussed ways to further strengthen research and publicity  regarding party building theory in order to better serve the  party's basic line under the new situation characterized by an  accelerated drive for reform, opening up, and socialist market  economic development.    In his speech, Comrade Hu Jintao first affirmed the  achievements scored by DANGJIAN YANJIU magazine and noted:  Since its inception five years ago, DANGJIAN YANJIU has been  run efficiently and has played an important role in research and  publicity regarding party building theory, thanks to the party  Central Committee's concern, the solicitude and guidance of  veteran comrades, and the support and assistance of people  engaged in party building around the country.    Hu Jintao said emphatically: The key to developing the  favorable situation further and to constantly advancing the  great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  lies in building our party well. During the new historical  period, we have amassed a wealth of useful experiences in party  building but are also confronted with many new circumstances and  problems. We should understand the status and role of party  building from the vantage point of the general international and  domestic situation, long-term interests, and the future. We  should study and solve new party- building tasks; boldly carry  out practical work and explorations; sum up the ingenious  efforts of people and grass-roots units on a timely basis;  strengthen all facets of party building ideologically,  organizationally, and in terms of the work style; further  increase the rallying power, appeal, and fighting capacity of  party organizations at all levels; and give greater scope to the  party's role as a leadership core.    Hu Jintao expressed the hope that all comrades at the office  in charge of party building under the CPC Central Committee's  Organization Department and at the DANGJIAN YANJIU publishing  house would carry on their efforts, sum up their experiences,  build upon their achievements, uphold the goal of publishing the  magazine, maintain the magazine's distinctive features, and make  fresh contributions to further strengthening research and  publicity regarding party building theory.    At the forum, Zhao Zongnai, deputy director of the CPC  Central Committee's Organization Department, urged people  engaged in party building to gain a profound understanding of  the guidelines of the party Central Committee's directive on  strengthening party building, strive to integrate theory with  practice, serve the party's basic line, and make DANGJIAN YANJIU  magazine an even greater success.    Comrades in charge of relevant departments present at the  forum included Xu Weicheng, Zhang Quanjing, Zheng Keyang, Zhang  Yunsheng, and You Lin. Veteran comrades invited to the forum  included Chen Yeping, Guo Feng, Gao Yang, Li Lian, Zeng Zhi, and  Zhou Yi.</p>

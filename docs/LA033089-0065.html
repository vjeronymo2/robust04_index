			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF PERMIT CLOUDS STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAS PULGAS CANYON  </P> <P> Ever since a developer purchased a rugged 26-acre coastal canyon in Pacific  Palisades last year, plans to develop the site have been shrouded in secrecy.  </P> <P> Now, they also are clouded by controversy.  </P> <P> California Coastal Commission officials said recently that the developer may  not be able to continue geologic testing in Las Pulgas Canyon unless he  complies with the conditions they imposed on him two months ago. Although the  commission granted the developer a permit to do the testing, it has refused to  actually issue the permit until he complies.  </P> <P> Commission staff members said the developer, Neil Senturia, had requested  last-minute changes in the permit conditions, which were levied by the board  after an investigation revealed that Senturia had illegally graded the slopes  in the canyon. Coastal Commission Chairman Michael Wornum earlier called it  "one of the most serious violations I have ever seen."  </P> <P> Senturia was ordered by commissioners in January to fill in the roads that he  cut into the landslide-plagued canyon and to post a $12,000 performance bond to  ensure that he would comply with the commission's directive. But the bond was  received late, and an environmental watchdog group, Save Las Pulgas Canyon,  complained that the developer had failed to provide it with restoration plans  as promised.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Too Late to Fix'  </P> <P> "Before I can issue a permit, I have to make sure that they have done  everything that they said they would do in order to comply with the  conditions," said Pam Emerson, a commission staff analyst. "I can't issue part  of a permit. Now is too late to fix a mistake if they've made one."  </P> <P> Commission staffers said Senturia had requested a change in the landscaping  plans included in the restoration project. Emerson said a decision on whether  to grant the coastal permit probably would be made this week.  </P> <P> The permit snag was just the latest problem to flare up in the long-running  dispute over the fate of the canyon. Residents of the nearly 170 homes above  the canyon, hit by a major landslide six years ago, say they fear that any  further work in the canyon may jeopardize their hillside residences.  </P> <P> And backers of the group trying to preserve the canyon as open space say  Senturia has purposely delayed the restoration project, which was supposed to  have been completed last week. In addition, they question whether the $12,000  performance bond was enough to restore the huge road cuts in the canyon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'As Cheaply As He Can'  </P> <P> "I think he's trying to get by as cheaply as he can," said Ron Wolf, president  of Save Las Pulgas. "In my wildest imagination, I can't see $12,000 coming  close to paying for the work necessary to restore the canyon."  </P> <P> Senturia could not be reached for comment. However, his attorney responded to  the charges by sending a letter to the group accusing one of its members of  trespassing on the property. Wolf denied the charge.  </P> <P> Relations between the developer and the environmental group have deteriorated  so badly that Senturia recently met with Councilman Marvin Braude to plead his  case and apologize for illegally grading the fragile canyon slopes. Braude said  he advised the developer to attempt to "get the community involved" and make  amends with the Save Las Pulgas group.  </P> <P> Sources involved in the fight over the canyon said Senturia is considering  building about 40 homes on the site, which borders Sunset Boulevard just north  of Temescal Canyon Road and extends to Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision on Work  </P> <P> L. Paul Cook, president of C.W. Cook Co., the civil engineering firm that  Senturia hired to handle development plans, said an amendment to the permit  conditions is being sought because of a decision not to do some of the  landscaping work by hand.  </P> <P> "We decided to use a different method of landscaping rather than have workmen  planting in some of those landslide areas," Cook said. "After we do some of the  remedial work, we can decide what needs to be fixed and what doesn't need to be  fixed."  </P> <P> Senturia purchased the canyon site at a fire-sale price of $1.4 million last  summer. In previous interviews, he has insisted that he cannot divulge any  plans about the site because no sound development plans can be drawn until  geologic testing has been completed.  </P> <P> However, the secrecy about the property has generated fear about the fate of  Las Pulgas Canyon. A major hotel chain reportedly offered Senturia $30 million  for the land last year, and a Los Angeles real estate broker who specializes in  international properties disclosed that several foreign investors were eyeing  the site to build a private estate.  </P> <P> Although the Coastal Commission said it would grant Senturia a permit to  continue geologic testing if the restoration work is done, several angry  commissioners said such a decision would not preclude a investigation into the  grading violation. Peter Douglas, executive director of the commission, said he  wants to see the restoration work done as soon as possible to "minimize the  damage" done to the canyon.  </P></p>

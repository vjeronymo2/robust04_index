Should that be the case, people of all nationalities in China  would still be under the reactionary rule of imperialism,  feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and our party would still  be struggling arduously underground." (Footnote 1 --  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 1975-1982, p 138)  Deng Xiaoping's words are no exaggeration at all. A piece of  vivid and clear evidence is the liberation of the people of all  nationalities in Xinjiang.  <H5>  A Wise Policy Leading to Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang </H5>   Xinjiang has been an inseparable part of the territory of  the  fatherland since ancient times. In modern times, the various  nationalities in Xinjiang had launched repeated indomitable  struggles aimed at casting off the yoke of imperialist and  feudal rule. Mao Zedong had the utmost concern for the  historical destiny of the people of all nationalities in  Xinjiang. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the CPC  entered into a united front with a local strongman Sheng Shicai  [4141 0013 2088]. Over 100 CPC members, including Chen Tanqu  [7115 3389 4428] and Mao Zemin [3029 3419 3046] were sent to  Xinjiang to work by Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee.  They did numerous good deeds. Mao Zedong sacrificed a relative  for the liberation of the various nationalities in Xinjiang; Mao  Zemin, his younger brother, was murdered by Sheng Shicai.  Tianshan was washed in blood, but his righteousness was  awe-inspiring.    The year 1945 saw the Chinese Revolution triumph on a  national scale. People of all nationalities in Xinjiang had been  looking forward to liberation with as much eagerness as people  hit by a drought longing for clouds. Mao Zedong, profoundly  conscious of the wishes of all nationalities in Xinjiang,  devised a sensible strategy to bring about its peaceful  liberation. During the Second Plenum of the Seventh CPC Central  Committee in March 1949, Mao Zedong earnestly urged Wang Zhen  [3769 7201] to continue to carry forward the revolutionary  spirit of fighting heroically, undeterred by difficulty or hard  work, as the latter made preparations to lead troops into  Xinjiang and do more good deeds for the people of Xinjiang.  After the CPC-KMT peace talks broke down in late April, the KMT  regime's chief representative as well as its northwest military  and political commander, Zhang Zhizhong [1728 3112 0022], stayed  behind in Beijing. The CPC Central Committee considered using  Zhang Zhizhong's connections to bring about the peaceful  liberation of Xinjiang. In a telegram to Peng Dehuai [1756 1795  2037] on 28 April, Mao Zedong said, "Solve the northwest problem  in a peaceful way. It seems that the possibility is there. Zhang  Zhizhong and others have now decided to remain in Peiping and  are edging closer to our side. Perhaps we need to consider  solving the northwest problem peacefully with his help."  (Footnote 2 -- "Selected Telegrams Relating to the War to  Liberate the Great Northwest," from Party Documents,  1990, Vol 5)    In early July 1949, Liu Shaoqi [0491 1421 1142] led a CPC  delegation in a secret mission to the Soviet Union to discuss  with Stalin a number of matters relating to the establishment of  a people's republic in China. The Soviets raised the Xinjiang  issue in the discussions and gave the Chinese some pointers. As  the CPC poised itself to liberate the entire nation, the Soviet  leader said, the Americans were cooking up a plot, specifically  they were encouraging the five northwest warlords headed by Ma  Bufang [7456 2975 5364] to withdraw their units to Xinjiang and  set up a "Nation of Islam" in opposition to the Chinese  Communists. Should the Americans succeed in their plot, China's  civil war would become an international issue, which would  complicate things. The Soviet Union therefore proposed that the  CPC liberate Xinjiang ahead of time.    The military commission under the CPC Central Committee had  earlier decided to "begin working on Xinjiang" next spring.  Armed with the information provided by the Soviet Union, and  after analyzing the nation's situation comprehensively, the CPC  Central Committee decided to tackle the Xinjiang situation  earlier. On 6 July, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Peng Dehuai in  which he sketched a blueprint for solving the northwest issue,  including the problem in Xinjiang. He wrote, "Besides the  military solution, we also must try the political solution. What  are your opinions? This is what we think. The northwest is vast  in territory and is home to many nationalities. Furthermore, the  number of party cadres of the Hui nationality who enjoy public  trust are few and far between. The political solution,  supplemented by combat, is the only way to solve the problem  rapidly, properly, and thoroughly. Now that our troops have  gained the upper hand, it will do more good than harm to combine  the political solution with the military solution. Specifically,  we should organize a military political committee bringing  together KMT members who are leaning our way and our own people  as an interim transitional body. The KMT people we have in mind  are none other than Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi [0265 0155 5030],  and Deng Baoshan [6772 1405 3790]." "Tao Zhiyue [7118 1492 1471]  is now wavering and showing signs of leaning toward a peaceful  solution for Xinjiang. We think we should ask Zhang Zhizhong to  put together a Xinjiang military and political committee as an  interim body, with himself as chairman and our man (is Wang Zhen  going to Xinjiang?) as vice chairman. There should be one other  vice chairman, someone from Yili." (Footnote 3 -- "Selected  Telegrams Relating to the War To Liberate the Great Northwest,"  in Party Documents, 1990, Vol 5) On 23 July, Mao  Zedong sent a telegram to Peng Dehuai about the offensive  against the two Ma's and the issue of sending troops into  Xinjiang, saying, "Wrap up the campaign against the Ma's by the  first half of August and spend anywhere from half a month to one  month for rest and reorganization. March westward in September  and occupy Lanzhou, Xining, and the three prefectures of Gan,  Liang, and Su in October. It may then be possible to capture  Dihua in winter instead of waiting until next spring. Older  Brother Chen (referring to the Soviet Union--ed.) is extremely  anxious that we take over Xinjiang as soon as possible and may  give us every assistance, including dozens of airplanes. Shaoqi,  Gao Gang, and Jiaxiang are over there now. As soon as you  finalize your military plan, they will consider the question of  aid. In my opinion, provided the Pingliang battle wipes out the  forces of the two Mas, then the military situation in the  northwest would basically cease to be a problem. The occupation  of the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang  would largely be a question of getting there and taking over,  with no major combat involved. With Older Brother Chen's air  force giving us assistance, it should not be hard to take over  Xinjiang." (Footnote 4 --"Selected Telegrams Relating to the War  To Liberate the Great Northwest," in Party Documents,  1990, Vol 5)    Between 24 July and 11 August, the 1st Field Army of the PLA  launched a battle of pursuit and attack in eastern Gansu (the  Pingliang battle), tracking down the forces of Ma Bufang and Ma  Hongkui [7456 7703 6652] and liberating a vast stretch of land  including Pingliang and Tianshui. On 4 August, Mao Zedong sent a  telegram to Liu Shaoqi with the following message, "Since the  main forces of Hu Zongnan [5170 1350 0589] were annihilated, the  two Ma's retreated in defeat again and again. By taking  Pingliang, one part of our troops has now consolidated their  grip on the plains. The other part would occupy Tianshui within  a few days and then move onto Lanzhou, which is expected to fall  in late August or early September. We can then make preparations  to advance to Xinjiang." (Footnote 5 -- "CPC Xinjiang Historical  Materials Series," The Peaceful Liberation of  Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990, p 46) On the  same day, Peng Dehuai issued a combat order to attack and take  over Lanzhou and Xining. A decision was made to concentrate the  best troops on the campaign against the forces of Ma Bufang.    To coordinate with the PLA's march into the northwest, the  Soviet Union on its own proposed a three-prefecture revolution  in Xinjiang to take on the KMT. It suggested that the CPC send  somebody to get in touch with the revolutionaries so as to pin  down the KMT, which would help liberate Xinjiang. The CPC  Central Committee figured there was not enough time to send  somebody from outside the region to the northwest. Nor would it  be easy for such a person to get there. So a tentative decision  was made to order Deng Liqun [6772 0500 5028], political  secretary to the delegation, to leave Moscow for Yining in his  capacity as a liaison for the CPC Central Committee. Mao Zedong  noted, "The key to solving the Xinjiang issue lies in close  cooperation between our party and the Uygur nationality. Working  on that basis, we can compel the KMT to give in and put Zhang  Zhizhong, Tao Zhiyue, Liu Mengchen [0491 1322 4783] and others  at our service. That way we can take over Xinjiang peacefully  with a minimum of destruction and reorganize the KMT's forces in  an orderly manner. (Footnote 6 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical  Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang,  Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 75) This can be described  as the CPC Central Committee's basic policy for solving the  Xinjiang issue. On 18 August, Mao Zedong, as chairman of the  preparatory committee for the CPPCC, wrote Ahmetjon a letter  inviting the three prefectures to send a Xinjiang representative  to attend the CPPCC scheduled to be convened shortly. Mao Zedong  and the CPC Central Committee thought highly of the revolution  in the three prefectures, calling it "part of the democratic  revolutionary movement of the Chinese people." "The struggle of  the people of the three prefectures of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan  is an essential contribution to the liberation of all Xinjiang  and all China." (Footnote 7 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts  Since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 82) He also said,  "We consider the nationality army a well-trained people's army  of the Uygur nationality. By pinning down 100,000 reactionary  KMT troops with its own revolutionary activities in the past few  years, it has played a major supporting role for the Chinese  Revolution." (Footnote 8 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since  the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 87)    As the PLA advanced in the northwest and across the nation  triumphantly, Tao Zhiyue, commander in chief of the KMT garrison  headquarters in Xinjiang; Bao Erhan [7637 1422 3352], chairman  of the Xinjiang provisional government; and other patriotic  generals and personalities realized that the "KMT is doomed and  incapable of further military resistance. So they are inclined  toward a peaceful solution and are working hard on its behalf"  in an attempt to stage an uprising for peace. (Footnote 9 --  CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful  Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990  ed., p 219) In planning such an uprising, however, Tao Zhiyue  however had to wage an uphill battle because he had no military  forces at his command. At the time some of the KMT troops in  Xinjiang were under Ma Bufang (reorganized as the First Mounted  Division), but most belonged to Hu Zongnan (reorganized as the  78th Division and 42d Division). Commander Ma Chengxiang [7456  0701 4382] of the 1st Mounted Division, Commander Ye Cheng [0673  2052] of the 78th Division, and Commander Luo Shuren [5012 1859  0086] of the 179th Brigade under the 78th Division were  staunchly in favor of resisting the communists. Ma Chengxiang  was unshakable in his loyalty to Ma Bufang before the latter was  routed. Nor did Ye Cheng and Luo Shuren vacillate before Hu  Zongnan was cornered, so they were hardly open to persuasion by  Tao Zhiyue. In plotting his uprising, therefore, Tao Zhiyue had  to overcome many complications and move one step at a time.    On 26 August, the PLA stormed and captured Lanzhou. On 5  September, Xining was liberated and the old den in which the Ma  family had been entrenched for decades was utterly destroyed.  The situation was getting more and more favorable for a peaceful  uprising in Xinjiang. Under the pressure of events, Ma  Chengxiang, Ye Cheng, and Luo Shuren "all agree to a peaceful  transformation. But they balk at reorganization by the people  from Yili and would rather go to Jiuquan and wait for  reorganization by the PLA." (Footnote 10 -- CPC Xinjiang  Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of  Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 202) Tao  Zhiyue and others approached Saveleyev, the Soviet consul  general in Dihua (present-day Urumqi), pledging not to put up  any resistance to the PLA and asking to get in touch and open  negotiations with the CPC through the Soviet Union. On 6  September the troops under Ma Chengxiang and Ye Cheng in Suilai  (now Manasi) and Qitai began withdrawing. Because of the  historical understanding between nationalities, however, some  members of the Hui and Han nationalities fled east following the  retreating KMT units, while some members of other minority  nationalities escaped to the sub-provincial administrative  region. (Footnote 11 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials  Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang  Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 219) Whatever their nationality,  the masses were panic-stricken; everybody feared for his own  life. Sensing the opportunity, Ma Chengxiang, Ye Cheng, and Luo  Shuren vainly tried to launch a counterattack. Xinjiang was in  the grip of a crisis.    To hasten and bolster Tao Zhiyue's and Bao Erhan's peaceful  uprising, Mao Zedong took a number of important decisions on the  Xinjiang issue. First, in view of the strained relationship  between Dihua, on the one hand, and the three prefectures, on  the other, and considering the panicky mood among the masses,  the CPC Central Committee did not adopt the suggestion by the  three prefectures of sending minority troops to relieve the  retreating KMT units. Moreover, it ordered forces under Tao  Zhiyue to "remain on garrison duty in the various regions and  counties as usual instead of coming together at a particular  spot. Troop reorganization must wait until the PLA enters  Xinjiang and relieves each garrison in order to avoid chaos."  (Footnote 12 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series:  The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin  Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 61) Second, in a meeting with Zhang  Zhizhong on 8 September, Mao Zedong told him that the liberation  army had decided to enter Xinjiang along two routes, through  Lanzhou and Qinghai, respectively, and expressed the hope that  Zhang Zhizhong would telegram military and political leaders in  Xinjiang to ask them to launch an uprising. Mao Zedong also said  that provided Zhang Zhizhong sent them a telegram, the local  leaders would surely go along. Zhang Zhizhong agreed readily and  sent a telegram to Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan on 10 September,  followed by another to Tao Zhiyue on the 11th. After receiving  his telegram, Tao Zhiyue saw "a ray of hope on the horizon.  Everything we do becomes infinitely more powerful. So we can  press forward with an indomitable spirit." (Footnote 13 --  Brightness Bound: A Historical Record of the 25 September  Uprising, Liaison Department of the Xinjiang Military  Region, 1982 mimeograph ed.) Third, Mao Zedong sent a telegram  to Peng Dehuai demanding that they concentrate on the march onto  Xinjiang. On 10 September, the 1st Field Army of the PLA  launched the Hexi battle. Xu Guangda [6079 0342 6671], commander  of the 2d Corps, pursued and attacked in a northwesterly  direction along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway. Wang Zhen,  political commissar cum commander of the 1st Corps, led the 2d  Army into Hexi by taking a shortcut through Qinghai and occupied  Zhangye on 19 September. On the 20th, the 1st and 2nd Corps  joined forces in Zhangye and continued to press onward to  Jiuquan, practically knocking on Xinjiang's door. Fourthly, Mao  Zedong sent a telegram to Deng Liqun demanding that the latter  enter and garrison Dihua as soon as possible. Accompanied by  Yeshyev, Soviet vice consul general in Dihua, Deng Liqun arrived  in Dihua on 15 September and held talks with Tao Zhiyue and Bao  Erhan on 16th. At the meeting he transmitted the instructions of  the CPC Central Committee that Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan  immediately send someone to Lanzhou to discuss with Peng Dehuai  finding a peaceful solution for Xinjiang.    Then a minor setback occurred. Alisituofu, the Soviet consul  general in Yining, objected to Tao Zhiyue letting Ma Chengxiang  and Yi Min [0122 2404] get away and demanded that the CPC  Central Committee order Tao Zhiyue to take Ma Chengxiang and  other reactionaries into custody. Let them go or detain them? In  a telegram to Deng Liqun, Mao Zedong said, "Let bad elements  like Ma Chengxiang, Luo Shuren, and Ye Cheng flee by plane. The  more the escapees, the better."    On 25 and 26 September, Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan issued  separate telegrams announcing an uprising. On 28 September, Mao  Zedong and Zhu De sent a telegram to Tao Zhiyue, Bao Erhan, and  other political and military personnel in Xinjiang involved in  the uprising, praising and encouraging them. At the same time,  Mao Zedong ordered the PLA's 1st Corps to advance onto Xinjiang.  With that peaceful liberation came to Xinjiang, opening a new  chapter in its history.  <H5>  National Unity: Key To Solving Xinjiang Problem </H5>   After the CPC and PLA entered and garrisoned Xinjiang, how  did they lead the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to  build a new Xinjiang? At the time all trades and industries were  in a state of depression and a hundred tasks awaited to be done.  Problems abounded. What was the key to solving the Xinjiang  problem? In the opinion of Mao Zedong and the CPC Central  Committee: "The key to solving the Xinjiang problem is close  cooperation between our party and the Uygur nationality." On 23  October, Mao Zedong again stressed this point in the "Telegram  of the CPC Central Committee to Peng Dehuai" drafted by himself,  "Only by establishing a brotherly relationship with the Uygur  nationality (and other nationalities) can the PLA build a new  Xinjiang with people's democracy." (Footnote 14 -- Mao  Zedong Manuscripts since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p  88. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1987, p 88) Xinjiang is  inhabited by minority nationalities, of which the most important  is the Uygur nationality. Thus national unity is critical and is  a prerequisite for and a basic guarantee of every other  undertaking.    Mao Zedong said, "It would be impossible to totally resolve  the nationalities issue and completely isolate the reactionaries  among the minority nationalities without a large number of  communist cadres from the minority nationalities." (Footnote 15  -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the PRC,"  Vol 1, p 128. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1987) Owing to the  longstanding influence of the Soviet Union and because of the  fact that some minority members had studied in the Soviet Union  and that the struggle had been going on for some time, there  were already some advanced communists or sympathizers among the  minority nationalities. Earlier they had put together an  alliance of communists and then an alliance in defense of peace  and democracy. So there already existed a solid base for setting  up a communist organization among the minorities in Xinjiang. On  15 October 1949, Seipuddin Aziz submitted his application to  join the CPC while attending the CPPCC in Beijing, at the same  time conveying the strong desire of other comrades to do  likewise. On 23 October, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote this comment  on Seipuddin's party membership application, "I endorse Comrade  Seipuddin's application to join the party. Have Seipuddin  himself take this letter to Peng Dehuai for the latter's safe  keeping. After the Xinjiang bureau comes into existence, Comrade  Seipuddin can then complete the formalities by filling out a  party membership application form and submitting it to the  bureau." (Footnote 16 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the  Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 86. Zhongyang Wenxian  Chubanshe, 1987) In late December 1949, the Xinjiang bureau  admitted its first 15 party members with the approval of the CPC  Central Committee. For starters, there were Seipudding Aziz of  the Uygur nationality, who became a member on the recommendation  of Wang Zhen and Deng Liqun; Bao Erhan (Uygur), on the  recommendation of Wang Zhen and Xu Liqing [1776 4539 3237]; and  Chen Xihua [7115 6932 5478] (Han) and Zhao Delin [6392 1795  2651] (Xibe), on the recommendation of Xu Liqing and Deng Liqun.  They were followed by 11 other people, who joined the party on  the recommendation of members of the bureau. They were Shu  Mutong [5289 1970 0681] (Xibe), Maerguofu Yisihakefu [7456 1422  2654 1133 0181 2448 0761 4430 1133] (Tatar), Abdullah Muit [7093  0008 6757 3583 0678 3341 4476 5030 2251] (Uygur), Abdullah  Zakrof [7093 0008 6757 2139 2089 0344 3157 1133] (Uygur),  Anniyaer Jiakulin [1344 1441 1422 6328 1655 2651] (Kazak),  Anniyaer Hanbaba [1344 1441 1422 3352 1572 1572] (Uzbek),  Yibulayin Tuerdi [0122 0008 2139 7299 0685 1422 0966] (Uygur),  Wuyiguer Shayiran [3527 0181 0657 1422 3097 0181 3544] (Uygur),  and Abuliemiti Makesutuofu [7093 0008 0441 4717 2251 7456 0344  5685 2094 1133] (Uygur). Each of them submitted an application  for examination and review, along with the recommendations of  two full party members. Upon direct approval by the Xinjiang  bureau, he became a member without going through a period of  alternate membership first. These 15 party members represented  seven nationalities and 14 of them were members of minority  nationalities, including eight Uygurs. In early 1950, the Dihua  municipal CPC committee and its counterparts in the various  districts and prefectures began admitting party members  directly. By late November 1950, 995 people had been accepted as  party members, the vast majority of them being key elements of  the revolution in the three prefectures and leaders of  progressive organizations.    To nurture minority cadres, Mao Zedong at the time demanded  that provincial CPC committees in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang,  Ningxia, and Shaanxi as well as the local CPC committees of all  prefectures inhabited by minorities organize cadre training  classes for minorities. He also demanded that Xinjiang turn out  within three years about 10,000 minority cadres with a knowledge  of policies who were also in close touch with the masses and  were loyal to the people's interests. Acting on these demands,  the Xinjiang CPC bureau immediately moved to put together local  minority cadre training classes, the first one of which began in  early April 1950. Addressing the opening ceremony of the first  class, Wang Zhen compared such training classes to "factories  producing people's cadres." (Footnote 17 -- Deng Liqun's  "Xinjiang Memoirs," 17 February 1989, appearing in  Xinjiang Party History Work Correspondence, 1989, Vol  2) Not only did the Xinjiang CPC bureau organize local cadre  training classes for minority nationalities, but party  committees in the various regions, prefectures, and counties  also got into the act. After their graduation, the trainees  participated in social reform on all fronts, tempering  themselves and acquiring new skills in the process. Those who  performed well were recruited into the party or Communist Youth  League. In no time, the first generation of CPC-trained minority  cadres emerged and became the backbone of leading groups at all  levels. According to statistics as of October 1950, of the 165  commissioners, deputy commissioners, and county chiefs in all of  Xinjiang, 107 were minority cadres.    To solve the nationalities problem and achieve national  unity, there is no alternative to doing more good deeds for the  people of all nationalities. In accordance with Mao Zedong's  instruction to the PLA stationed in Xinjiang--the main purpose  of its being in Xinjiang was to do more good deeds for the  people of various nationalities--and in keeping with its own  fine tradition of being a working force and production force as  well as a fighting force, the PLA units successfully suppressed  the bandits and put down the rebels, protecting the people's  lives and properties and stabilizing social order. (Footnote 18  -- Remembering Mao Zedong, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe,  1977, Vol 1, p 498) They took part in local party building and  government building, putting an end to the historical oppression  and enslavement of the various nationalities and turning them  into the true masters of the nation and society. Under the  leadership of General Wang Zhen, the PLA stationed in Xinjiang  in particular responded to Mao Zedong's call to the military to  participate in production by furthering the Yanan spirit and  launching a mass production campaign. It was a huge success.  Wang Zhen put it in no uncertain terms, "We do not compete with  the people for grain. On the contrary, we help the people grow  grain. We must demonstrate to the Xinjiang people the  superiority of collective labor and the collective economy."  (Footnote 19 -- Wang Zhen, "Production and Construction by the  Military in Xinjiang: Principles and Tasks," in Selected  Historical Materials on the Xinjiang Production and Construction  Corps, Vol 1, 16 January 1950) Taking a long-term view,  Wang Zhen regarded the use of troops to open up the wasteland as  a strategic measure that would develop the border, lessen the  burden on the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang,  strengthen national unity, and consolidate the new frontier.    The troops participated in production to ease the burden on  the people, According to calculations as of January 1950, it  took 20,000 tons of grain imported from the Soviet Union in  addition to the 20,000 tons shipped from the rest of the  province to feed the 193,000 troops stationed in Xinjiang. At  3,000 rubles per ton, the imports cost at least 162 billion yuan  (old currency), including freight costs. Because of the troops'  involvement in production, they were able to grow their own  grain by June and July, eliminating the need for imports and  saving the nation a large sum of money. Meanwhile, grain  shipments from the rest of the province also were reduced,  easing the burden on the various nationalities. Under KMT rule,  peasants parted with over 700,000 dan of grain in feudal land  taxes an other additional levies. Even more onerous was "going  on a public errand." The masses in southern Xinjiang had to  transport military provisions to Dihua (now Urumqi) and northern  Xinjiang using small donkeys. One round trip could take anywhere  from a couple of months to half a year. To the man on the  street, "going on a public errand" was something to be dreaded.  After liberation, the units became self-sufficient in grain and  the peasants turned over just 440,000 dan of grain in 1950.  Public errands too were abolished. In other words, while the  size of the units was doubled, the burden on the masses was cut  by almost one-half. People of all nationalities in Xinjiang  realized from this the spirit of the CPC-led people's army of  wholeheartedly serving the people, which was totally different  from KMT troops oppressing and plundering the people. Mao Zedong  had high praise for the military, saying, "Wang Zhen's troops  entered Xinjiang and wasted no time in devoting themselves to  careful budgeting. By practicing self-reliance, they produce  what they need. They are now solidly on the right track and have  won the enthusiastic support of the minority nationalities."  (Footnote 20 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding  of the Republic, Vol 3, p 384. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe,  1989)  <H3>  Advance Steadily and Cautiously, Carry Out Social Reform  Step By Step </H3>   According to the Marxist view, social reform is  indispensable  to really solving the nationalities problem. Marx and Engels  said, "Once the exploitation of man by man is eliminated, the  exploitation of nationality by nationality will also be  eliminated." "Once class antagonism within a nation disappears,  the hostile relations among nations will also disappear."  (Footnote 21 -- Selected Works of Marx and Engels,  Renmin Chubanshe, 1972 ed., Vol 1, p 270) What direction then  should social reform in minority-inhabited areas follow?    In June 1950, Mao Zedong told the 3d Plenum of the 7th CPC  Central Committee, "Social reform in minority-inhabited areas is  a matter of utmost importance and must be handled carefully.  Under no circumstances can we be impatient. If we get impatient,  things may go wrong. If the conditions are not in place, don't  reform. When only one condition is in place, don't reform  either." "Don't engage in any reform of a mass nature without  mass support, without the armed forces of the people, or when  there are no cadres of the minority concerned." (Footnote 22 --  Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 5, p 23)    Following the instructions of Mao Zedong and the CPC Central  Committee, Xinjiang experimented with rent reduction in 147  villages in agricultural areas across the province between  September 1950 and October 1951. Beginning in September 1951, a  campaign was launched in all agrarian areas in Xinjiang to  reduce rents and denounce local despots. By May 1952, the task  of rent reduction and local despot denunciation was accomplished  in over 1,500 villages with a combined population of almost 4  million in 58 counties in nine sub-provincial administrative  regions, so it was a great success. But reducing rents and  denouncing local despots weakened feudal forces without  fundamentally changing the feudal land system. Many peasants  said, "The landlord class and feudal land system are like a  mountain. Local despots and other counter-revolutionaries are  the wolves in the mountain. The campaign of reducing rents and  denouncing local despots has gotten rid of the pack of wolves,  but the mountain is still blocking our advance." (Footnote 23 --  "Report on Land Reform To Be Carried Out in Agrarian Areas This  Winter and Next Spring," by Zhang Bangying [1728 6721 5391], 25  August 1952) This fully shows that the urgency of the peasants'  demand for land in the wake of the campaign to reduce rents and  denounce local despots.    With Mao Zedong's approval, land reform was carried out in  four stages in agrarian areas in Xinjiang between September 1952  and December 1953. The landlord class, which had lain like a  dead weight upon the people of all nationalities for thousands  of years, was overthrown, feudal land ownership was eradicated,  and 3.45 million peasants divided 7.37 million mu of land among  themselves. Not only did peasants of all nationalities succeed  in casting off the oppression and exploitation of the  reactionary Han ruling class, but the oppression and  exploitation by feudal forces represented by the landlord class  within a nationality also came to an end. Politically and  economically the peasants had truly stood up. Peasants of all  nationalities were encouraged and elated. At a meeting  celebrating the victory of land reform on 23 March 1952, Uygur  peasants in Paha Taikeli village in Shufu County wrote a  letter--"Dedicated to Mao Zedong"--in the form of a poem to  express their respect. In the letter they told of their  suffering in the past, described the joy of land reform and  standing up, and expressed their profound and unparalleled love  for the CPC and Mao Zedong. They wrote, "In celebrating the  victory, our village is a more lively and festive scene than it  is when we celebrate a festival. Land reform has really done us  a world of good. The person who has improved our well-being so  much is none other than Savior Mao Zedong. Your ideological  splendor shines all over Paha Taikeli." On 30 August, Mao Zedong  wrote a letter in reply, "Thank you for the letter you wrote me  in March as you celebrated the victory of land reform. You have  been liberated from the bondage of feudal land ownership. I hope  you will be even more united in response to the `Be patriotic,  harvest bumper crops' slogan, apply yourselves to production,  improve your own material lives, and, on that basis, elevate  your cultural standard step by step." (Footnote 24 --  Selected Correspondence of Mao Zedong, p 440)    By 1957, socialist transformation involving agriculture,  animal husbandry, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce  had basically been accomplished in Xinjiang, signaling that  Xinjiang had largely abolished the exploitation system and set  up a socialist economy. The establishment of a socialist system  opened up a brave new world for the political, economic, and  cultural development of Xinjiang and for the achievement of  equality, mutual aid, unity, cooperation, common prosperity, and  happiness among the various nationalities.    During the period of socialist transformation, by and large  "our policy was quite cautious and reliable and had strong  support among the various minority nationalities." (Footnote 25  -- Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 5, p 277) People  of all nationalities in Xinjiang were sincerely thankful to Mao  Zedong for the new good life he brought them. Kuerban Tulumu, an  elderly man from the Uygur nationality in Hetian prefecture, was  determined to go to Beijing riding on a donkey to thank Mao  Zedong and present to him the raisins he made and the coarse  cloth he wove. For a time this incident was much talked about  with fondness and had a profound effect on the public  psychology. It fully revealed the unparalleled love and feelings  for Mao Zedong on the part of the people of all nationalities in  Xinjiang.  <H3>  Development and Stability: Two Major Themes In Modern  Xinjiang Today </H3>   With the completion of the socialist transformation of the  private ownership of the means of production and creation of a  socialist system, what should be the focus of work in  minority-inhabited areas? Or, should we say, what should be the  top priority in such work? For a long time this question  remained unanswered. Still, Mao Zedong demonstrated his usual  theoretical wisdom on this matter as well.    Nineteen sixty-two saw the Yili-Tacheng incident. In April  1962, 60,000 residents in the border area near Yili and Tacheng  fled to the Soviet Union. On 29 May, a handful of hooligans went  rioting in Yining. The main explanation for the Yili-Tacheng  incident was the instigation planned and organized by the Soviet  authorities over a number of years. Nevertheless, our failure to  make proper or adequate provisions for the livelihood of the  people of various nationalities also played an important part.  Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the  autonomous regional CPC committee and regional people's  committee handled this matter correctly and resolutely. To  stabilize Xinjiang, the CPC Central Committee ordered the  production and construction corps in the Xinjiang Military  Region to take over agricultural and pastoral production and  other grassroots work left behind by the border people who had  fled to the Soviet Union and set up state farms, pastoral areas,  tree farms, and mines along the Sino-Soviet border.    The events in Xinjiang set Mao Zedong thinking long and  hard.  On 27 September 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong issued important  instructions on Xinjiang work at an enlarged meeting of the  standing committee of the politbureau of the CPC Central  Committee. In Xinjiang, he said, "We must first do a good job in  economic work to keep agriculture, animal husbandry, and  industry growing year after year. The economy must be more  prosperous every year than the year before, and the people must  live better every year than the year before." "It takes  accumulation to pay for socialist construction, but accumulation  must not be excessive. The state must procure grain from the  peasants, but state purchase quotas must not be too burdensome.  We must not go too far with state procurement. Lessen the burden  on the people. Improve their lives." "Second, put politics in  command. Step up ideological and political education." "Take  pains to improve relations among the nationalities. Enhance  national unity."    Such were Mao Zedong's ardent expectations and immense  concern for the rank-and-file cadres and the people of all  nationalities in Xinjiang before he died, pointing up a  direction for solving the Xinjiang issue. In fact, Mao Zedong's  instructions identified the two major themes in modern Xinjiang,  namely development and stability, which held the key to solving  the Xinjiang problem. National unity and social stability are  the prerequisites for economic development, without which we  would be in no position to do anything. Ideological and  political work, therefore, must be intensified and unity among  the nationalities must be enhanced. On the other hand, only when  production increases year after year, the economy becomes more  and more prosperous, and the people's livelihood improves all  the time can we really have solid national unity and social  stability. Development is the most reliable guarantee of  stability. The top priority in Xinjiang is economic development.    This is why. First, Marxism attaches the utmost importance  to  the development of productive forces. In Marxism, productive  forces are seen as the ultimate determining factor of all social  development. Socialism, in particular, must devote itself to the  development of productive forces. "The consolidation and  development of the socialist system must also rely on the  liberation and development of productive forces. Thus, putting  economic development on the top of the agenda is consistent with  the fundamental principle of Marxist historical materialism.  Second, it is in line with the basic interests of the people of  all nationalities in Xinjiang to develop the economy and improve  their lives. Xinjiang is a land of many nationalities. While  inequality among the nationalities has been disappearing since  the PRC was founded, there is no denying that economic and  cultural gaps between minority-inhabited areas and places where  the Han people live, between the west and the coastal region,  remain very wide. Only a mighty push to develop the economy in  minority-inhabited areas can gradually narrow the gaps and truly  bring about prosperity for all nationalities and solidify  national unity. Third, located on the fatherland's northwest  frontier and bordering on five nations, namely the Soviet Union,  Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, Xinjiang occupies a  vital strategic position. Only when its production has taken  off, its economy is booming, the people's livelihood has  improved, and society has achieved stability can we have a  strong border defense and demonstrate the superiority of Chinese  socialism. In Xinjiang, whether the economy is growing and  whether the people's livelihood is improving not only will  impact national unity domestically but will also have direct  international repercussions. Mao Zedong had said at the time  that people of all nationalities in Xinjiang must live better  than they did in the KMT era and even better than their  counterparts did in the Soviet Union.    Mao Zedong's instructions represented the first time he put  forward the criterion of productive forces since 1945 when he  made a similar point in "On Coalition Government." He wrote,  "When all is said and done, whether the sum total of party and  government policies in China and their implementation have been  a good thing or bad for the Chinese people, whether they have  had major or minor effects will depend on whether they have  helped stimulate the development of productive forces of the  Chinese people and by how much, whether they have hampered or  liberated productive forces." (Footnote 26 -- Selected  Works of Mao Zedong, 2d ed., Vol 3, p 1079) In his  instructions, Mao Zedong did more than reiterate the productive  forces criterion, he also refined it in a major way by demanding  that we not only ask whether productive forces have been  developing year after year, but also whether the people have  been living a better life each year. The reason is that while  the development of productive forces provides a material  guarantee for an improved livelihood for the people, it does not  automatically improve their living standards. If the people are  saddled with a heavier burden because of high accumulation, high  procurements, and indiscriminate fee collection, they would not  lead a better life even if production is rising and the economy  is booming. That Mao Zedong made the improvement of people's  lives an important part of the criterion of productive forces,  therefore, was both theoretically and practically significant.  To improve the people's lives requires easing the burden on them  as well as increasing output. Easing the burden on the people  essentially means easing the burden on peasants. Without easing  the burden on peasants, there can be no sustained developments  in agriculture, in animal husbandry, and, ultimately, in  industry, and no economic prosperity.    The autonomous regional CPC committee and regional people's  committee firmly implemented Mao Zedong's instructions. The  autonomous regional CPC committee submitted two documents to the  CPC Central Committee: "Report on Strengthening Economic Work in  Compliance with Chairman Mao Zedong's Instructions on Xinjiang  Work" and "Report on Putting Politics in Command in Compliance  with Chairman Mao Zedong's Instructions on Xinjiang Work." These  two documents focused on the dual themes of development and  stability, respectively, and aside from a number of leftist  ideas, were basically correct. As a result, the Xinjiang economy  made rapid progress in the 1963-66 period. In the era of taking  class struggle as the key link, however, one was not in a  position to truly focus on economic work; given the prevailing  historical circumstances, Mao Zedong's instructions were not  carried through.    Under the theoretical guidance of Deng Xiaoping's thesis of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics since the 3d  Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the Uygur Autonomous  Regional CPC Committee and people's government have unwaveringly  adhered to the basic line of concentrating on economic  construction, upholding the four cardinal principles, and  sticking with reform and the open policy. The result is a  revitalized Xinjiang, a Xinjiang profoundly changed in many  aspects. The economy is developing steadily and national unity  has been strengthened. Be that as it may, the task of developing  the economy and improving the people's livelihood in Xinjiang  remains an arduous one. We need to keep up the hard work for a  long time to come and Mao Zedong's instructions about  development and stability will still be of immense instructive  significance.</p>

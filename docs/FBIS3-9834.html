			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by "is" in </F> the "Only Question" column; place and date not given: "Budget  Deficit for First Three Months Stands at 7.5 Billion"]    [Text] [SME] Late last year, the National Council of the  Slovak Republic approved a law on the 1994 state budget, which  foresees a budget deficit of 14 billion Slovak korunas [Sk].  What is the size of the deficit today?    [Filkus] As of today, the deficit stands at Sk7.5 billion.  This demonstrates that the assumption of a deficit at the level  of Sk14 billion by the end of the year, which was viewed [by the  previous government] as a realistic macroeconomic indicator, was  not a realistic macroeconomic assumption.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Labour leaders move to quell row LABOUR leaders were acting last night to head off damaging personal recriminations over responsibility for the party's fourth successive election defeat as the National Executive Committee prepares for a post-mortem on Thursday. The special one-day NEC will examine a report by Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary, which lays some blame on conflicting centres of power within the group charged with overall control of the campaign. Yesterday, however, Mr David Blunkett, an NEC member, was among a number of senior Labour politicians calling for a halt to personal accusations. He said the defeat raised questions far beyond the conduct of individuals. 'We should concentrate on what went wrong and the real causes of the defeat, rather than squabble about superficial aspects of the campaign,' he said. Charges and counter-charges have flown between a group of individuals reporting directly to Mr Neil Kinnock and full-time officers who conducted the campaign from Walworth Road. The headquarters staff claim that some individuals had too much influence over the campaign strategy. Mr Whitty will argue in his report that senior politicians should in future have a greater role in planning. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, has said for the the first time that he is prepared for the influence of unions in Labour party policy to be reduced to less than 70 per cent. His remarks, in Direct, the GMB general workers' union magazine, come after a period in which union leaders, including himself, have been defending Labour's links with the unions. Some are reluctant to allow the union block vote to fall below 70 per cent of this year's annual conference. Until now it has been 90 per cent.</p>

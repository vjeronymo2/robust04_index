			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COLD WARRIORS' DRAW CRITICISM  </P> <P> It was with a feeling of revulsion that I read the article "Regrouping in the  Cold War" (Times, March 16).  </P> <P> My disgust was caused, not by Times Staff Writer Mike Ward's journalistic  style, but by the subject. How depressing it is to be reminded that there are  among us radical groups such as the John Birch Society, members of which  continue to embrace McCarthyism.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the great majority of people in this country reject the kind of  political depravity espoused by such organizations as the Birchers. The only  redemption I find in the article is that I can offer it to my students as an  example of what Samuel Johnson meant when he said: "Patriotism is the last  refuge of the scoundrel."  </P> <P> TIM KARAMITROS  </P> <P> Sierra Madre  </P></p>

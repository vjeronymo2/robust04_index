			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / People: Jefferies - ear for tenants' grouses Some 500,000 housing association tenants in England will soon have someone new to complain to if they are unhappy with the management of their homes. Roger Jefferies, chief executive of the London borough of Croydon until March, will become the first housing association tenants' ombudsman on November 1. Jefferies, 53, should be able to offer a particularly sympathetic ear to tenants' grouses. A qualified solicitor, he is author of Tackling the Town Hall, published in 1982, about ways in which citizens could complain about or appeal against their local authorities. After leaving Oxford, Jefferies entered local government as an articled clerk with Coventry city council. Having qualified as a solicitor, he became assistant town clerk at Southend-on-Sea in 1968. In 1970, he was appointed operations director for the London borough of Hammersmith, becoming chief executive of the west London borough of Hounslow in 1975. In 1990, Jefferies moved to Croydon, taking early retirement three years later during a reorganisation of the council's management structure. At the time, he was London's longest serving local authority chief executive. Between 1983 and 1985, Jefferies was seconded to the Department of the Environment where he was under secretary responsible for planning and land use policy. He was president of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives in 1990-91, the period during which the poll tax was introduced, and its abolition announced after the fall of Lady Thatcher. As ombudsman, he will be armed with statutory powers given by parliament to the Housing Corporation, the quango that regulates the housing associations that receive government grant. However, he will operate independently of the corporation, so that he is not bound by its policy in dealing with tenants' complaints. Jefferies says he is looking forward to setting up the new service, and to working with the interesting variety of organisations that make up the housing association movement.</p>

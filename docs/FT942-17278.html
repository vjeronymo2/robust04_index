			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Business school urgently seeks head Manchester Business School has started an urgent search for a new head. Candidates will have to be ready to start in September and be immediately available part-time. The search follows the decision of Professor Tony Cockerell, former deputy director, to give up the role after July. Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable and Wireless and chairman of the school's board, said there was no time to follow normal recruitment practice as this would take 18 months. Manchester University is being asked by the board to set up a search committee for internal candidates, but applicants from other universities or industry and commerce worldwide will also be considered. The post is seen as one of the most prestigious of its kind in Europe and the US. The Manchester school's director, Professor Tom Cannon, left in 1992 following the resignations of an advisory board of private-sector leaders who opposed plans to pool the university's undergraduate and postgraduate resources in a new institution, called the Manchester Federal School of Management. The federal school started up in January, and from October will offer flexible courses combining management studies with other subjects.</p>

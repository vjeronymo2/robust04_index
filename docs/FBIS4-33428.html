			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry  confirmed today the recent release from prison for humanitarian  reasons of Mexican citizen Marcelo Garcia Ruvalcaba, who had  been sentenced by a local court for the crime of terrorism.    The foreign minister told PRENSA LATINA that Garcia  Ruvalcaba  has a serious kidney problem, and in view of the situation, the  Cuban Government made the extrajudicial decision to release him  for humanitarian reasons.    The Mexican citizen was sentenced to 10 years in prison by  the People's Provincial court in this capital on 28 February  when it was proven that he had brought into the country hand  grenades and counterrevolutionary pamphlets aimed at carrying  out terrorist activities.    Garcia Ruvalcaba established ties in the Caribbean country  with individuals hostile to the revolution. He admitted his  guilt in the public trial attended by representatives of the  Mexican Embassy and relatives of the defendant.    The Mexican citizen is an employee of Continental Airlines  of  the United States. He has a residence in Los Angeles where he  traveled after his release.    The Cuban Government's decision on 26 May was previously  passed to the Mexican Foreign Ministry through the proper  diplomatic channels.</p>

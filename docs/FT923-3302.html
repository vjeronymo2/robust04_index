			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: Restaurants hit back THE GLOOM that was settling earlier this year over that privileged group, professional restaurant reviewers, seems to be lifting. Many restaurateurs are responding to the need for smaller bills by offering more Italian food. Although the Forte group has installed Nico Ladenis in Nico at Ninety (tel: 409-1290; all numbers should be prefixed with 071) at the Grosvenor House, revamped the Criterion Brasserie (925-090) on Piccadilly Circus with Bob Payton, and appointed Helmut Berger as the head chef at the Cafe Royal (439-6320) it has also launched what it calls a family of Italian restaurants around London which includes Tutto] W2 (724-4637), Scarto] SW1 (222-3338) and Issimo] EC3 (623-3616). Other restaurants offering good value include a new brasserie at 190 Queensgate, SW7 (581-5666) specialising in fish instead of the former expensive restaurant; Calzone in NW3 (794-6775) and W11 (243-2003) The Boulevard in WC2 (240-2992) Brasserie Lott, SW3 (584-4484); and Wagamama, WC2 (323-9223) offering reasonably priced Japanese food. Two pubs have sensibly decided to put small dining areas to more profitable use: The French Dining Room has opened above the French House in Dean Street, WI (437-2477) and The Lansdowne operates as a sister to Farringdon Road's Eagle in Gloucester Avenue, NW1 (483-0409). New and prospective restaurateurs are being encouraged not so much by any upturn in consumer spending but rather by the weakness of the property market. High premiums have always been a new restaurant's first financial hurdle and the rent is the highest of any restaurant's fixed costs. Today, however, it is a buyer's market, at least for the brave. The Argyll (352-0025), which opened earlier this year on the Kings Road, managed to pay no premium at all and keep refurbishment costs to Pounds 120,000. Banks and receivers, not normally known as a restaurateurs' best friends, are now taking a more kindly attitude as they try to dispose of sites that have succumbed to the recession. Hence, Lexington will soon reopen on the old Soho site of Sutherlands, and Beauchamp Place in place of the old Menage a Trois. Martin Lam, formerly head chef at L'Escargot, will together with his wife, be opening his own restaurant at Ransome's Dock, Battersea (223-1611) on the site of the former Le Chausson. The restaurants' future success will depend on how and whether they can pass these financial benefits on to their customers. The most dramatic example of how the British restaurant goer may benefit comes from New York. Faced with empty tables over a long hot summer, some 50 New York restaurants, including some of the top names, such as Le Perigord, Gotham Bar and Grill and Bouley, came together at the instigation of Tim Zagat, restaurant guide publisher and Joe Baum, restaurateur, and offered three-course lunches at a fixed price of Dollars 19.92 (Pounds 10) excluding tax and service. The campaign, launched in mid-July ,brought restaurant madness back to New York and was continued at some restaurants until early this month. It filled tables and, although it may not have generated substantial profits, created a lot of goodwill. According to Bryan Miller, food critic of The New York Times, the long-term legacy may be more creative marketing by restaurants - discounts, pre- or post-theatre or ethnic themes - and repeat customers in the quiet months after Christmas. But, in the short term, the event has reminded New York restaurateurs of something fundamental: restaurant goers are voracious for bargains. A maxim, I would argue, equally valid on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

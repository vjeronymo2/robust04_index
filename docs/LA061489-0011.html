			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COMING HOME TO SMUG AMERICA'  </P> <P> Having also lived abroad and experienced many different countries, I had to  chuckle to myself as I read Meisler's criticism of present America because it's  all so true but no one here seems to know it.  </P> <P> In my experience, Europeans consider us either silly for our prudish mores  (remember the international giggle over Gary Hart, not over the girl, but that  it brought him down?), and for our wacky consumerism, and plastic art and  literature. Or we're looked on sadly for our violent crime and insatiable money  thirst. Or we're feared as a danger for the fact that our huge war arsenal is  in the control of thick-headed chauvinists, and for our disrespect for the  environment and untainted food.  </P> <P> Meisler failed to note one difference between the U.S. and other countries  which I found to be the most profound -- our lack of personal freedom. Like  most Americans, I carried the American freedom myth to Europe and ran smack  into my biggest culture shock. While societal laws and rules are there, of  course, the pervading sense of total personal restriction is not. The soul and  will felt free. I became so pleasingly used to this that I forgot how men cower  here until I visited East Berlin and commented to my girlfriend that "this  place is just like the States." A fellow who works in my office just returned  from his first trip to France and observed that, for example, you can "state  your case to a cop there," while we all know what would happen if we talked  back to one of our "holier-than-thou" cops.  </P> <P> I plan to make my home in Europe and only hope that the Americanization we keep  hearing about hasn't advanced too far.  </P> <P> MARK ALBERICI  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

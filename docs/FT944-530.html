			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Buy-out preferred for British Coal arm A management and employee buy-out team has been selected by British Coal and its advisers as the preferred bidder for Coal Products, the smokeless fuel and foundry coke manufacturer. British Coal also said it had sold TES Bretby, its scientific services subsidiary, to John Mowlem Construction, which is paying Pounds 3m in two instalments. The announcements mark important steps in the privatisation programme for British Coal's non-mining activities. RJB Mining is paying Pounds 815m for its English mining assets, while Celtic Energy is buying its opencast sites in south Wales. The Coal Products buy-out bid - led by Mr David Foster, operations director, and backed by Legal &amp; General Ventures - has been selected from a shortlist of four. The other three bids were from Anglo United, Coal Developments and a management buy-in led by NatWest Ventures. The preferred bidder will have a period of exclusive negotiations intended to allow completion of the transaction by January 31. Terms of the possible deal were not disclosed. Coal Products is the UK's largest manufacturer of solid smokeless fuel with about 30 per cent of the market. More than 1m homes still use solid smokeless fuel. It also has about 60 per cent of the UK foundry coke market, and supplies industrial coke to a number of major customers. Its four main plants are at Immingham on the Humber, Coventry, and Aberaman and Cwm in south Wales. TES Bretby does chemical analysis for the coal industry and other UK industrial customers. Its contracts with British Coal will be transfered to the successor mining companies until March 1998. Mr John Gains, managing director of John Mowlem Construction, said the acquisition would enhance its position in a sector where it was already strongly represented through its geotechnical business.</p>

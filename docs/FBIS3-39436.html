Foratom, the European federation of nuclear trade  associations, has written to Sir Leon Brittan, the European  Union's [EU] external economic affairs commissioner, warning  that unless Western nuclear companies are protected against  legal action they will withdraw from nuclear repair work in the  region.    The companies are concerned that they would be liable if  there were an accident during work to repair or replace ailing  Soviet-designed nuclear reactors.    The move will delay the flow of European Commission nuclear  safety funds to the region under its technical assistance  programmes. It will also prevent companies from signing large  repair contracts under the Nuclear Safety Account, the  multilateral aid fund set up by the Group of Seven  industrialised countries after the July 1992 Munich summit.    International experts have identified a number of  Soviet-designed reactors that are in urgent need of repair, in  particular the first generation pressurised water reactors, the  VVER 230s and the RBMK Chernobyl design. In December 1993 the  EU's economic and finance commissioner Henning Christophersen  described the nuclear safety situation as a "time bomb ticking  away in East Europe".    While Western nuclear companies have been prepared to  participate in studies and training at the plants, they will not  replace equipment until they have legal protection against the  consequences of accidents.    Most of the countries with VVER 230s and RBMK reactors in  operation have not signed the 1963 Vienna Convention, which  ensures that full responsibility for damages caused by accidents  falls exclusively on plant operators.    The Commission has said it cannot guarantee to pay damages.  Instead, it has asked countries receiving aid to sign bilateral  agreements with nuclear companies protecting them against legal  action. The nuclear industry argues that such deals do not give  it sufficient legal or economic protection.    Foratom met Commission officials yesterday in the first of a  series of meetings to find an interim solution which would allow  vital safety work to go ahead. One option could be for  recipient countries, West European governments and possibly the  industry itself to set up a fund which could be tapped if an  accident occurs.</p>

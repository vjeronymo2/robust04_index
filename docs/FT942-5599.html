			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Limit seeks approval to amend its investment policies The largest Lloyd's investment trust is to seek permission from its shareholders to amend its investment policies, in line with potentially far-reaching changes at the insurance market. The London Insurance Market Investment Trust said yesterday that it would seek permission to invest directly in both managing agents, which administer syndicates, as well as in new corporate underwriting entities. The trust, which obtained a stock market quote last November, currently supports a wide spread of agents and syndicates. Its Pounds 502.5m underwriting capacity is allocated to 101 syndicates managed by 33 agents. The announcement follows a report by Lloyd's last month which envisaged the creation of 'corporate syndicates', which would draw all their capacity from one single corporate investor. In addition, a number of managing agencies - including leading players such as Brockbank and Kiln - are examining the creation of new 'dedicated' investment funds which would exclusively back syndicates managed by one agency. Hiscox Group is currently the only agency to have established such a fund. Limit's statement said: 'If these structures are created, Limit may wish to invest directly in other corporate capital entities.' It added that Limit may also 'wish to invest a small amount of its capital in minority interests in managing agents for the purpose of enhancing its underwriting potential.' In addition, Limit said the amount of capacity - potential underwriting income - supplied by it to syndicates could increase by up to Pounds 30m in 1995 as a result of recent rule changes by Lloyd's. Limit made both announcements when reporting its results for the four and half months between its listing last November and the end of March. Investment income amounted to Pounds 4.8m. Under Lloyd's three-year accounting convention, income for the period does not include results from underwriting. After expenses of Pounds 900,000, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 3.9m.</p>

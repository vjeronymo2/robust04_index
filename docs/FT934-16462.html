			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Risky changes for a secure future - The new strategy being pursued by Amstrad MR ALAN Sugar, Amstrad's colourful chairman and chief executive, was in the City yesterday to give analysts the chance to quiz him on the company's 1992-93 trading figures. An unusual move; he traditionally demands they trek out to his stronghold in Brentwood, Essex. But anybody hoping that the irrepressibly combative entrepreneur had been chastened by last year's trading loss and the rejection by shareholders of his 30p a share plan to buy back the company would be disappointed. He was in London to donate a new operating theatre to Great Ormond Street Sick Children's Hospital. 'Otherwise it would be Brentwood as usual', he grunted. Nothing, however, is going to be 'as usual' at Brentwood for the foreseeable future. Amstrad is set on a series of changes designed to secure its future but which are, also, in Mr Sugar's opinion, the riskiest of the options open to it. They include the appointment of a chief executive to oversee a series of acquisitions to take Amstrad into new growth areas, attempts to forge alliances with services companies to secure more dependable revenue streams and a gradual move away from reliance on personal computers which have been Amstrad's biggest money spinner in recent years. The new strategy arises out of Mr Sugar's argument that Amstrad's core businesses - personal computers, facsimile machines, video recorders and satellite dishes - can produce Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m a year in pre-tax profits, but not a lot more. Yesterday's results, showing a Pounds 16.3m operating profit including interest, are his evidence: 'It is a mature business that we are in. It is highly competitive. The day of the blockbuster product seems to be over - although if one comes along, we are not going to turn it away.' 'We have to glue on to the core business other businesses that have a synergy with electronics, electrical goods and so on.' Hence the need for a chief executive. Mr Sugar has no liking for the notion of running a group of 30 or so separate autonomous companies: 'It would be very boring. It would be very much accounting, very much reporting. What we need is a chief executive whose qualities lie in these areas'. 'We have to have a management capable of looking after all these companies. We've seen the fallen idols of the 1980s; all those people who bought companies one after the other. The only people who seemed to make any money out of it were the lawyers and the merchant bankers.' He points to DanCall Radio, the digital telecommunications company which Amstrad bought last month as an opportunistic deal. Tipped off that the company was for sale by a mutual supplier, Sugar bought the lossmaking Danish concern for Pounds 6.4m. It gave Amstrad cheap entry to a complex and potentially lucrative technology. 'When we bought the company we bought a lot of inventory and we will churn and turn that into cash and that cash will be used to run the company. The fruits of what is about to start now will be seen in a year to 18 months time when the new digital telephones start to roll off the line.' Mr Robert Watkins, who was identified with many of Amstrad's earlier blockbusters but left to work for Binatone last year, has been lured back as managing director of DanCall. The main shift, however, is in Mr Sugar's thinking on product strategy. He is clearly irked that markets which Amstrad pioneered - compact audio systems, inexpensive personal computers and satellites - have been hijacked by competitors prepared to lower margins. He has no doubt that Amstrad can build, for example, a competitive cellular telephone: 'It will not be long before the rest of the world catches up. So we have to find ways to make sure that when we create things, we can hold on to it a little longer.' His idea is to strike a deal with cellular service providers. In exchange for a lower-cost handset than they are able to supply at present he will claim some form of commission on the use of the service. Customers in the UK, for example, buy a digital handset for Pounds 350-Pounds 400. The cost is subsidised by more than Pounds 100 by a service provider like Mercury One2One. While nothing has yet been decided, according to Mr Sugar, it will only make commercial sense for a service provider to pay a small commission to reduce or eliminate the subsidy. Cellular experts agree that Mr Sugar's strategy makes sense. While they question whether he has not left it too late they agree that the DanCall acquisition must have saved several years of basic research. Would he be following the same strategy today if his attempt to take the company private last year had been successful? 'No. The contraction I had in mind was the safest approach for Amstrad. One that could not go wrong. That is not good enough for shareholders. There is no guarantee of success in the route we are following now but it is the only way to try to find a stream of profits.'</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Pastoral sympathy persists NEARLY ONE in three people would like to move to the countryside, rejecting city life as dirty and stressful. The possibility of a migration into rural Britain is highlighted in a Mintel survey examining social and economic differences across regional divides. It says 17 per cent of those under 35 in the top socio-economic groups (ABC1) plan to move to rural areas in the next five years. Greater London and south-east England experienced a net loss of 83,000 people in 1989 while Wales, south-west England and Scotland registered net gains of 41,000. Net losses of more than 500,000 are forecast for London and the south-east by the turn of the century. Mintel questioned 1,000 adults on a range of socio-economic issues. The survey's other findings include: Northerners are the most avid bargain-hunters, searching for sales and special offers. They are less likely to shop at a single supermarket, whereas southerners prefer one-stop shopping. Do-it-yourself enthusiasts are most common in Yorkshire and north-east England. Non-package overseas holidays, independently booked, are most popular with southerners. Yorkshire and north-east holidaymakers are more likely to return to familiar spots. Regional Lifestyles, 1992.

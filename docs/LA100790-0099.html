"Some things they took away from us allowed  Cale to step in and really do a nice job."  </P> <P> The Sooners, faced with fourth and nine at their 48, had started trotting to  the locker room, but were called back onto the field when Oklahoma State called  a timeout with three seconds left.  </P> <P> Gundy, whose brother, Mike, played for Oklahoma State and now is an assistant  coach with the Dallas Cowboys, lofted a pass to the 6-foot 6-inch Cooper, who  outjumped defenders near the goal line.  </P> <P> Oklahoma State took a 17-14 lead on a 39-yard field goal by Cary Blanchard less  than a minute into the third quarter.  </P> <P> Oklahoma took the lead for good, 21-17, on Gundy's one-yard run in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Gundy completed six of 10 passes for 119 yards.  </P></p>

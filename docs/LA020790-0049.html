			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MONTE VISTA MAKES THINGS PERFECTLY AWFUL FOR MT. MIGUEL  </P> <P> Mt. Miguel needed the perfect game.  </P> <P> It would take nothing less for the Matadors to defeat a Monte Vista team in the  midst of playing its best basketball of the season. Mt.  </P> <P> Miguel was already without point guard Domingo Rivera, who suffered a deep  bruise to his right thigh to end his season, and now the Matadors were facing a  team that featured one of the top big men in the county.  </P> <P> And the game was perfect for Mt. Miguel (12-8, 2-4). Perfectly awful.  </P> <P> Monte Vista outscored Mt. Miguel, 20-4, to start the game and rolled to an  81-60 Grossmont 3-A League victory at Mt. Miguel. The victory assured Monte  Vista (14-6, 6-0) of at least a tie for its second consecutive league title.  </P> <P> Monte Vista center Joe McNaull, who has already signed a letter of intent to  play at San Diego State next year, scored the Monarchs' first two baskets.  Shannon LeFever, who finished with 31 points, answered with a scoring drive  inside to make the score 4-2.  </P> <P> But Monte Vista went on a 16-2 run and led, 20-4, with just five minutes gone  in the first quarter.  </P> <P> McNaull got two fouls in the first half and played just 10 1/2 minutes. But the  6-foot-10 center still scored nine points, had seven rebounds and three blocked  shots during that span.  </P> <P> Monte Vista led, 41-29, at halftime behind 21 points from Jeff Polinsky. The  league's leading scorer finished with 34 points. McNaull had 20, points, 20  rebounds and three blocks. RICK HAZELTINE  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Yugoslavia announced it will lift a dusk-to-dawn curfew but maintain a ban on  gatherings in Kosovo province, eight weeks after 24 people were killed in  ethnic rioting. A government official in Belgrade said the decision proves that  the situation in the southeastern province -- where about 1.8 million ethnic  Albanians outnumber about 200,000 Serbs -- "is gradually getting back to  normal." However, Yugoslav troops and tanks, along with federal police forces,  sent to Kosovo late in February, have remained in the province.  </P></p>

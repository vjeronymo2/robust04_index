			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Triple drive to create private sector jobs The Clinton administration's theme, which runs through its 1995 budget, was written by President George Bush on his ill-fated mission to Japan in 1992: 'Jobs, jobs, jobs.' Budget items which won increases were those believed most efficient in creating private sector jobs. About half of the nearly 2m US jobs created last year were in high-paying managerial and professional occupations. To increase that rate, the administration has proposed a three-pronged workforce investment strategy. To help young job-seekers, it is requesting Dollars 300m (Pounds 202m) for an expansion of a model school-to-work system, designed to provide students with work experience integrated with classroom training. The administration also proposes spending Dollars 1.2bn in 1995 on the jobs corps, a comprehensive residential training and education programme for impoverished youth. It has also requested Dollars 100.5m to launch six new centres, increasing capacity to 62,500, and Dollars 30m to repair existing centres. A new Dollars 1.5bn jobs investment initiative would help the unemployed retrain and find new work at a network of up-graded, one-stop career centres, costing Dollars 250m. The current worker adjustment programmes are 'rigid and ineffective', the budget says. The administration will consolidate, expand and improve these schemes in a Workforce Security programme, projected to serve 1.3m unemployed people per year. The administration stresses jobs related to exports, which earn an average 20 per cent more than other jobs - hence its emphasis on trade and trade finance. The US Export-Import Bank will get Dollars 134m less next year for direct loans, but its budget for new loan guarantees rises from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 12.25bn. The Small Business Administration is expected to guarantee up to Dollars 7bn in credits to compensate for cuts in lending by the commercial banks. Despite recent criticism that the administration is creating an industrial policy by subsidising research and development, the Commerce Department's budget for advanced technology grants and manufacturing extension centres is more than doubling to Dollars 451m. There is Dollars 3.2bn (a 6 per cent increase) for science and engineering research, Dollars 67m for new technology investment, Dollars 451m (a 4 per cent increase) for health research, and Dollars 2.1bn for the redesigned space station. Nine agencies this year propose to spend over Dollars 2bn for research and development in manufacturing technologies, a Dollars 159m (9 per cent) increase over last year. The High Performance Computing and Communications project, which funds programmes for more powerful computers, networks and software, will get Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

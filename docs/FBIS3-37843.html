			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report: "Diplomatic Exposure"] </F>   [Text] Accusing anyone of spying for a power with which "a  strategic partnership" has just been announced is a serious  step. Clearly, the political effects of such actions tend to be  carefully weighed, there cannot be any coincidences here. The  first striking thing is that Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS], and Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev are out of Moscow, and we do not have an  ambassador in Washington.    There is another thing, however, that matters much more. The  exposure of a spy has coincided with Boris Yeltsin's new Bosnian  initiative. Some two days ago he proposed that the United  States, Britain, France, and Germany hold a summit in a European  capital to sign a peace settlement plan for Bosnia. Holding  such a summit at Russia's request and, moreover, signing a peace  plan would be inconvenient for Western leaders at this stage.  The scandal over Ames' arrest removes the Russian initiative  from the agenda and brings its publicity effect to naught.    The incident with the shooting on a Swedish UN convoy  outside  the Muslim enclave of Vitez, after which the command of the UN  forces in Bosnia immediately asked NATO for air protection,  speaks in favor of this theory. A provocation? Maybe. But no  one will bother to find out the truth.    Moscow itself is to blame to some extent for such a turn of  events: Too loudly has it celebrated its diplomatic success.  Meanwhile, the success is far from evident. Bringing Sarajevo  under UN control means that the Muslims must be disarmed to a  level corresponding to that of the Serbs. The Russian partners  have so far not coped with the task.    The spy scandal can also mark an end to the discussion on  tightening Russia's foreign policy doctrine. The arrest of an  agent is an irrefutable argument for the Americans. Not to  speak of the huge fees paid to Ames, which would knock out on  the spot any advocate of extensive assistance to Russia. As  soon as the FBI starts estimating the damage done to America by  Ames, the old outcry -- "the Russians cannot be trusted" -- will  be revived to a new intensity.    But what has actually happened? Intelligence services all  over the world operate against each other, and this does not  harm bilateral relations in any way. For instance, the exposure  of an Israeli spy, Pollard, has not affected the  American-Israeli partnership.    What appears to be a somewhat promising sign is the fact  that  the Russian intelligence service, although it would not comment  on the Ames case, does not pretend it has nothing to do with  him, as has often been the case previously. We do not know  whether an American spy is presently serving a sentence in  Russia. If one is, the matter could be straightened out to the  full satisfaction of both sides by carrying out a classical  exchange. To do so, however, we will have to wait for a trial  to establish Ames' guilt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basel (Special)--Bank of Korea governor Kim  Myong-ho told international financiers Monday that Korea will  further ease rules restricting foreign financial institutions  business activities in order to promote fair competition.    Speaking before a special meeting of the Bank for  International Settlements (BIS) at Basel, Switzerland, in which  major European central bank heads are participating, Kim said,  "Entry barriers will be dismantled to promote competition among  financial institutions, apart from minimum established  conditions required to ensure the stability of the financial  system."    Kim said foreign banks will be able to "diversify their  presence in Korea, establishing joint-ventures or subsidiaries."    He cited two policy tasks which must be tackled successfully  in order for Korea to attain the status of a truly advanced  economy.    One is to promote the efficiency of the Korean economy,  especially the financial sector, by a heightened reliance on  market mechanisms rather than government initiatives. The other  is to participate ever more positively as a responsible member  in the concert of nations, he said.    "In the light of these realities, there is no viable option  for Korea but to press boldly ahead with financial  liberalization and the opening of its financial market," he  noted.    The BOK governor told the BIS special session that business  boundaries will be readjusted so as to enhance competition, and  increase benefits to clients as well as to mesh with the  worldwide trend toward universal banking.    He also said the ceiling on foreigners' portfolio investment  will be progressively raised and the criteria for the opening  branches by foreign securities companies will also be relaxed  this year.    In addition, Kim made it clear that the extent of foreign  exchange liberalization will be broadened in the near future.    "Restrictions on the foreign exchange position of banks and  the underlying documentation requirements for foreign exchange  transactions will be progressively relaxed," he said.    Touching upon capital account liberalization, Kim said Korea  will take a cautious and gradualistic approach to capital market  opening. But he added that Korea has now acquired sufficient  confidence to allow the process to move into high gear and it  will be further accelerated as the country plans to seek full  membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) by 1996.    Stressing the most crucial step in liberalizing is to  deregulate interest rates, he said the third stage of interest  rate deregulation, which will take place in 1996 and will  liberalize all deposit interest rates except those on demand  deposits, "may well be implemented ahead of schedule as long as  financial market and macroeconomic conditions permit."    Kim said policy-based loans, which have become an obstacle  to  indirect control of the money supply as well as to the  managerial autonomy of financial institutions, are being  progressively pared back.    He pointed out that stability is one of the most important  prerequisites for Korea's financial market liberalization.    "A stability-focused macroeconomic policy is an important  element favoring the success of financial liberalization.  Liberalization carried out in an unstable macroeconomic  environment may well worsen pre-existing instability."    In order to maintain macroeconomic stability under financial  deregulation, he said, the BOK will make utmost efforts to keep  the money supply at a proper level to ensure price stability.    In addition, he emphasized the importance of adequate  prudential regulations in accordance with the progress of  financial liberalization.    "It is important for the BOK to induce financial  institutions  to strengthened their risk management systems and to maintain  capital adequacy. In this respect, Korea will apply in full the  capital adequacy standards set by the Basel Accord from 1995,"  he said.    The BOK is in broad agreement with the new proposals of the  Basel Committee on banking supervision which take into account  market risks concerning derivatives transactions and interest  rate risks.</p>

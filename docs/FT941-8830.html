			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region volatile, mostly on downside as Nikkei firms A lull in the yen's ascent against the dollar prompted bargain hunting and the Nikkei 225 average gained moderate ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 index climbed above the 19,000 level again, ending with an advance of 77.51 at 19,052.11 after a day's high of 19,267.03 and low of 19,032.40 just before the close. Dealers led the way as participants bought to adjust their positions, and this pushed equities up in the morning session as the dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency. Continued dollar buying by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange market also encouraged some investors. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 3.76 to 1,559.10, although the Nikkei 300 capitalisation weighted index lost 0.05 at 287.65. Traders said reports of North Korea's decision to accept international inspection of its nuclear power sites also supported investor confidence. However, many investors, remaining wary of currency fluctuations due to lingering concern over US-Japan trade tensions, were still absent. Volume totalled 360m shares, against Tuesday's 389m. Rising issues outnumbered declines by 770 to 265, with 136 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.43 at 1,288.56. Speculative trading by indvidual investors led activity. Shindengen Electric, the leader in volume terms, closed a net Y30 off at Y1,140. The issue has been actively bought recently on rumours of purchases by speculative investors, and was higher in the morning session yesterday on reports of better than expected profits for the current year. Domestic investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y3,000 to Y898,000. East Japan Railway gained Y8,000 at Y492,000. Some export related stocks recovered, having lost ground previously on fears of lower profits due to the rise in the yen. Fujitsu moved ahead Y13 to Y991 and Hitachi firmed Y5 to Y875. However, Sony finally lost Y10 at Y5,860 in spite of initial strength, and NEC declined Y14 to Y971. Some financials were lower on profit-taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank shed Y10 to Y1,920 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y40 to Y2,110, while Tokio Marine and Fire, the non-life insurer, fell Y20 to Y1,280. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 190.02 to 21,215.83 in volume of 55.7m shares. Roundup There was widespread volatility in the region, with most of it on the downside. HONG KONG shelved UK-based recovery hopes after an early attempt to indulge them, the Hang Seng index tumbling 378.19, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,634.14 after an initial high of 11,119.51. Turnover remained modest, at HKDollars 6.14bn. Brokers blamed selling from the US, and by British business interests. Sellers talked of an expected rise in interest rates tomorrow as HSBC slid HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 115. Conglomerates led the retreat, however, Hutchison slipping HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 34.50, Jardine Matheson HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 72 and Swire 'A' HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 57.50. TAIWAN also reversed early gains, ending 2 per cent lower as late selling focused on the weak financial sector. The weighted index opened 100 points up, but closed 122.38 down at 5,862.63. Turnover was moderate at TDollars 58.3bn. Taiwan has its own trade talks with the US next week, and investors have also been worried about the central bank's interest rate policy. JAKARTA extended Tuesday's falls, the composite index ending 7.89, or 1.35 per cent, lower at 574.82. Bank International Indonesia dropped by 17.4 per cent to Rp7,025 in thin volume, dealers saying that restrictions on foreign ownership might be affecting the domestic market. BOMBAY weakened after a dull opening led funds and institutions into selling, the BSE index losing a further 92.71, or 2.3 per cent, at 3,807.42. Brokers said foreign institutional investors, who fuelled a bull run between November and January, have cut back on their purchases after facing problems over share deliveries. KARACHI saw early buying interest take flight after reports of possible unrest in the north west frontier province, the KSE 100 index surrendering 21.47 at 2,401.52. SEOUL said sentiment improved on North Korea's decision to accept international inspection of its nuclear sites. The composite index finished 18.62, or 2.1 per cent, ahead at 920.43. North Korea agreed on Tuesday to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to check seven declared nuclear plants in the hardline communist state. AUSTRALIA gained on the advances in the US and Japan, the All Ordinaries index closing 15.0 higher at 2,249.0. Resource issues improved, Western Mining climbing 19 cents to ADollars 7.61 on its partnership in a 'technically feasible' gas discovery. SINGAPORE saw revived interest in over-the-counter trading in Malaysian shares. Meanwhile, the Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.85 to 2,341.38, with Rothmans Industries up SDollars 1.15 at SDollars 9.30 on news of a special dividend.</p>

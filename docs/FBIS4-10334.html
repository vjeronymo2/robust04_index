			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Peronism  [Justicialist Party] has obtained its fifth [as received]  consecutive victory with an ample win in most of the country,  although its electoral percentage decreased in an election for  Constituent Assembly members. The elections also show the  resounding fall of the Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR],  the consolidation of MODIN [Movement for Independence and  Dignity], and the notable growth of the center-left coalition  Grand Front, which won in the Federal Capital and in Neuquen  Province.    The Peronists have thus been able to maintain their  supremacy, although they were not able to obtain a majority of  members in the Constituent Assembly in order to guarantee,  without any ups or downs, the reform that was agreed upon in the  Olivos Pact. They must now seek alliances with other parties.    For the anti-pact forces the election results proved to be  much better than estimated, with the absolute victory of Carlos  "Chacho" Alvares (Grand Front) in the federal capital, the  victory of the Liberal Autonomist Pact in Corrientes Province,  the excellent showing of the Popular Jujeno Movement in Jujuy  Province, the Democratic Party in Mendoza Province, and the  Grand Front's win in Neuquen Province, where it obtained a  surprise victory with the candidacy of Bishop Emeritus Jaime de  Nevares.    According to observers, the biggest winners in the elections  were Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde and Cordoba Governor  Eduardo Angeloz, who raised their stature with ample victories  over their rivals. In Angeloz' case the winner was his protege,  Ramon Mestre.    Duhalde is now placed in a strategic political position, and  Angeloz seems to have consolidated his aspirations to be the UCR  candidate in 1995.    The victories of Ruben Marin in La Pampa Province, Carlos  Reutemann in Santa Fe Province, Radical Horacio Massaccesi (Rio  Negro Province), and Radical Carlos Maestro (Chubut Province)  must also be highlighted.    The victory of General Antonio Domingo Bussi, retired, over  Governor Ramon "Palito" Ortega in Tucuman also came as a  surprise.    This time around information on the results of the elections  ran into a lot of problems, and official figures only began to  come in during the evening, although many of the candidates  acknowledged their defeats through the exit polls.    According to the most recent data the Justicialist Party  lost  some 5 percent when compared with the October 1993 elections,  and the UCR lost 10 percent, while the MODIN preserved its third  place at the national level.    In Buenos Aires Province the UCR suffered the worst results  of its history, and its fall in the federal capital was  catastrophic, as it came in third place with 15 percent of the  votes.

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> MEDICAL WASTE TIED TO DEFENSE DEPOT  </P> <P> Some of the medical equipment that washed up along a 12-mile stretch of San  Diego County shoreline was distributed by a Department of Defense supply depot  in Tracy in Central California, Navy officials said. But it is unclear which  military branch may have generated the waste and who dumped it.  </P> <P> The Tracy depot is the same facility identified as the source of medical debris  that washed up on beaches in Orange and San Diego counties in 1988. The waste  that recently drifted ashore included three injectors of atropine, used as an  antidote to nerve gas and considered a serious public hazard. Also found were  100 vials of penicillin and several hundred strips of anti-malaria pills.  Health officials warned beach-goers about the injectors, which immediately  inject atropine when placed against the skin. The drug elevates the heart rate  and can induce delirium.  </P></p>

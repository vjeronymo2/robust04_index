			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kaa Eneberg report: "Long Road to EU Defenses"] </F>   [Text] "The European Union [EU] can never force a member  of the Union to join in defense cooperation that the country's  political leadership does not have a mandate from the people to  join," outgoing Armed Forces Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson  said in an address to the Foreign Policy Institute in  Stockholm's Old Town yesterday.    However, within the defense forces a report is already being  prepared for presentation in the fall of what changes to the  Swedish defense forces will be needed in order to facilitate  increased international cooperation. The issue has been made  more urgent by the new cooperation arrangement, Partnership for  Peace [PFP].    Preparations are already taking place so that Sweden will  perhaps be able to take part in the first PFP exercise. The  supreme commander pointed out, however, that as yet no political  decision has been reached on the matter.    "The investigation being carried out at headquarters aims to  look at how Swedish forces can better engage in international  cooperation, not only with Finland's, Norway's, and Denmark's  defense forces, but also with the combat forces of the rest of  Europe," Bengt Gustafsson declared. He is expecting clearer  instructions from the government as to how the defense forces  are to plan possible future changes in preparation for the next  defense bill that will be agreed in 1997.    However, in general terms he predicted that the road to a  common European security system and possible common European  defenses will be a very long one and that the matter might only  find its way onto the agenda "at some distant point in time."  He also pointed to the alternative possibility that the issue  might never arise because of a trend toward fragmentation in the  Western world. At the same time he pointed to the clear efforts  by France and also Germany to create a defense force independent  of NATO.    Bengt Gustafsson, who is now leaving his post after eight  years, had drawn a full house, as might have been expected. A  little while ago he irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt by  raising the old question of a Nordic defense league. This time  he protected his back by not "saying a word" on the subject.    However, he did point to the joint Nordic military operation  in Macedonia and Bosnia as an extension of cooperation that goes  back a long way and as a political demonstration of solidarity  with Europe.    Bengt Gustafsson stressed that bearing in mind the increased  international involvement the future structure of the defense  forces must not lead to a situation in which Sweden has two  defense forces, one for Sweden itself and one to be lent out.  He wants to see a single defense force, but with a clear  delineation of roles. No one with a reason not to go abroad  should be forced to go, and anyone who wants to go abroad must  be given all the necessary support, said Bengt Gustafsson, who  also wants to see the personnel question clearly addressed in  the next defense bill.</p>

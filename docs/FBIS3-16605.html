			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- The Estonian parliament on  Wednesday [16 March] passed amendments to the law on the  privatization of housing.    The amendments say the privatization voucher issued to  Estonia's residents for their years of work may be transferred  as a gift to the holder's parents, spouse, relatives in the  descending line, sisters, brothers and their relatives, who are  Estonian citizens or permanent residents of the country.    The law also gives the municipal and local commune  governments the right to determine the houses that cannot be  privatized because of plans to pull them down, their  reconstruction, further use, or some other reason. The reason  for the refusal must be made public.    Non-occupied housing premises can be privatized by Estonian  residents of at least 18 years of age. The law says years of  service in the KGB shall not be accounted in calculation of the  length of employment in Estonia.    The parliament also approved an amendment to the tax  regulations law, giving the government the right to extinguish  debts of state companies going to privatization, or participate  in management of the debts.</p>

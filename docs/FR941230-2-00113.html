(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(g), respecting enhanced specialist participations, which entitle equity and index option specialists, when on parity, to receive an enhanced parity participation (or split) in select options classes. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The present proposal clarifies that the enhanced parity split is applicable in situations where orders of any controlled account <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  are on parity with the specialist, and not just orders of Registered Options Traders (``ROTS''). The proposal also serves to replace the specialist's ``two-for-one'' enhanced parity split in situations where there are only one or two controlled accounts on parity with the specialist. Pursuant to this proposal, where there is only one controlled account on parity with a specialist, the specialist would receive a 60% split and the controlled accounts on parity with a specialist, the specialist would receive a 40% split, while each controlled account would receive 30% of the contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Exchange also has a proposal pending with the Commission that would provide an enhanced parity participation for the 3D foreign currency option (``FCO'') specialist. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34814 (October 7, 1994), 59 FR 52337 (October 17, 1994) (notice for File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;42). The present proposal will not affect the proposal regarding the 3D FCO specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A controlled account is defined as ``any account controlled by or under common control with a member broker-dealer.'' See Phlx Rule 1014(g). Customer accounts are all accounts other than controlled accounts and specialist accounts. The Phlx represents that the rule will continue to prohibit the application of any such enhancement in instances which would lessen the pro rata participation of customer orders on parity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') B&hyph;6 (Priority of Options Orders for Equity Options and Index Options by Account Type), <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  is proposed to be amended to add the enhanced participation provisions, both existing and proposed, into Section C. Lastly, Rule 1014(g) is proposed to be renumbered, numbering the first paragraph as (g)(1), the general parity/priority provision for equity and index options, and the enhanced split provision currently in paragraph (g)(i) as (g)(ii); Commentary .17 is proposed to be deleted and renumbered as paragraph (g)(iii). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Advice B&hyph;6 is administered pursuant to Phlx Rule 970 and the Exchange's minor rule violation enforcement and reporting plan (``minor rule plan''); however, proposed Section C does not contain a fine schedule and would be included in the Floor Procedure Advice Handbook for informational purposes only. Thus, the Exchange believes, no amendment to the minor rule plan is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A minor corresponding amendment to Rule 509 (Enhanced Specialist Participation Review) is also proposed to change the reference from Rule 1014(g)(i) to Rule 1014(g)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

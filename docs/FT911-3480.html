			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection waiting on asset sale HOLMES Protection, the New York-based security company which has missed several payments on a Dollars 61m (Pounds 36m) loan note, hopes to hear within days whether a crucial asset sale has received backing from bankers. Mr John Flack, joint chief executive, said Alert Centre should inform Holmes within a few days if it has secured financing to buy the New Jersey security business for Dollars 18m. The proceeds of this sale would go some way to placating institutions which were due a total Dollars 24.6m loan repayment in January and March. Mr Flack was speaking in London, where the company is quoted, after reporting pre-tax profits of Dollars 4.02m for 1990, including a Dollars 5.05m profit on the sale of assets that was taken above the line, compared to a loss of Dollars 20.31m in 1989. Auditors have classified the Dollars 61m debt as a current obligation and have qualified the accounts subject to the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Earnings rose to 5 cents (losses of 30 cents) per share. The dividend is passed. Turnover fell to Dollars 68.70m (Dollars 76.05m) and interest charges jumped to Dollars 7.29m (Dollars 5.84m).</p>

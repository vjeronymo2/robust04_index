			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Italian confidence vote boosts markets THE Italian prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor, yesterday cleared the final procedural hurdle in the lengthy process of forming a new government by winning a vote of confidence in the senate. The financial markets reacted positively to the outcome, with the lira gaining modestly against the D-Mark and trading at L920. This compared with a parity of nearly L960 with the D-Mark when Mr Ciampi first set out to form his government. He received support similar to that provided by the parties in last week's vote in the lower house of parliament. This was based on the backing of the outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. However, this time Mr Ciampi had to fend off a potential protest vote by the Liberals and elements within the Christian Democrat party who wanted firmer commitments on aid to the south of Italy. But the protest vote never materialised and Mr Ciampi obtained 162 votes in favour of his programme - centred on early electoral reform and tight economic management. The main opposition parties chose to abstain or absented themselves, ensuring a majority. Abstentions totalled 50. In last Friday's vote in the lower house the same opposition parties abstained.</p>

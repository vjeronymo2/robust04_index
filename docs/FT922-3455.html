			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (3): The race to take advantage of cheaper credit - The Fixed Income Market AMID THE lowest domestic interest rates in almost 30 years, refunding has been the dominant financial trend in the US economy over the past year and a half. From a micro to a macro level, from individuals with their mortgages to local governments with their municipal bonds, the race has been on to take advantage of cheaper credit by replacing old, high interest-paying debt, with new, low-interest paying debt. In the corporate fixed-income market, refundings have run at unprecedented levels for more than a year. Although it is not possible to get exact statistics, industry analysts estimate that 20 per cent of all corporate debt issued in 1991 resulted from companies seeking funds at lower costs than their debt outstanding by calling in their bonds and issuing new, lower-yielding paper. And so far this year, at least 25 per cent of all bonds issued by US companies is estimated to be linked to debt refinancing. Analysts at the US Securities Industry Association (SIA), have looked at the figures from a broader perspective, by researching the use of proceeds from debt issues. They have calculated that as much as 35 per cent of the new debt issued last year was used to retire outstanding debt, which includes both bonds and other debt such as bank loans. When combined with issues of new debt, refundings have taken total bond issuance to record levels. In 1991 the total value of corporate bonds underwritten in the US broke through the Dollars  1/2 trillion barrier, reaching Dollars 507bn, a 74 per cent increase on 1990. The vast majority of corporate bonds (almost Dollars 300bn) were issued in the form of asset-backed securities (mostly mortgage- and credit card-backed securities), which allow deposit-taking institutions to remove liabilities from their balance sheets and lower their regulatory capital requirements. The value of the remaining 'pure' corporate bonds, meanwhile, reached a record Dollars 208bn, almost a third more than the previous record set in 1986. Although few thought it possible at the end of last year, 1991's record pace of growth is being surpassed. Total corporate debt issuance in the first quarter of 1992 jumped from last year's opening three-monthly record of Dollars 135.5bn to Dollars 190bn, a 40 per cent rise. Excluding asset-backed and junk debt, a total of Dollars 67bn in investment-grade debt was sold in the first quarter of this year. What set off this landslide of new issues was the Federal Reserve's most recent, and biggest, interest rate cut on December 20 last year. In one month - January 1992 - Dollars 35bn in new investment-grade debt was sold. The majority of new issues has been of investment-grade quality. According to Securities Data, approximately Dollars 132bn of the Dollars 165bn of corporate issues with a Standard &amp; Poor's rating sold last year came from companies with a A- rating or above. In the first five months of this year, just over Dollars 60bn of the Dollars 95bn in S&amp;P rated issues had a A- rating or better. That is not to say that non-investment grade, or junk debt, has languished entirely. Last year Dollars 10bn in new junk debt was issued; in the first quarter of this year alone almost Dollars 7bn has come to the market. Although these numbers are well below the Dollars 30bn that was issued at the height of the junk bond era in 1986, there has been a revival in interest among investors seeking higher yields. Other than the size of issues, the main difference in the junk market today compared to the mid-1980s is the type of company selling the paper, and the use the proceeds are being put to. Unlike the industrial giants of the Michael Milken era who leveraged balance sheets to finance acquisitions, today's issuers are smaller, fast-growth companies seeking capital for business expansion. In all respects, therefore, on both the buy and sell side, the junk market is a much more respectable place today than it was six years ago. The steepness of the yield curve (caused by interest rates falling faster at the short than the long end) has meant maturities on corporate debt have tended toward the medium and short end of the range. Last year, three-quarters of all new debt was dated between one and 10 years, and the spread of maturities has been much the same so far this year. With interest rates at the long end edging higher as economic activity picks up, this trend is likely to carry on for the rest of the year. In terms of the type of debt issued, innovation has been rare this past 18 months, primarily because with the financial climate so positive, and demand so strong, there has been no need for corporates to package their paper in fancy ways to get it sold. With the straight debt market offering the lowest yields, plain vanilla has been the flavour of choice. On the demand side, companies have been able to issue new bonds at record levels because the appetites of investors for corporate paper has been almost insatiable, especially in the first quarter of this year. According to the SIA, institutional net purchases of corporate bonds last year more than doubled to Dollars 1.96bn a day. In the opening three months of this year, daily purchases reached a staggering Dollars 3.6bn. In fact, so strong was the demand early this year from institutions and bond funds that the huge volume of new bonds was absorbed without spreads widening. The interest rate environment again favoured corporate issuers. Investors unhappy with the 3 to 4 per cent available in CDs, savings and money market accounts went in search of higher yields. For those which stayed away from equities and governments, corporate bonds were the obvious answer, with bond funds able to offer upwards of 8 per cent, depending on credit quality. While falling interest rates were a boon to debt-laden and expansion-minded companies, Wall Street's securities houses have had even more reason to rejoice. After almost half a decade of seeing its underwriting fees decline each year, Wall Street finally hit the jackpot in 1991. Although the bulk of the total Dollars 4.66bn of fees earned last year came from stock underwritings, the debt side of the business still brought in a healthy Dollars 1.3bn of fees, up 63 per cent on 1990. Of the securities houses that manage and underwrite corporate bond issues, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have been the biggest powers on Wall Street, along with Salomon Brothers, the bond giant which has been damaged by the fall-out from the Treasury auction scandal but which has benefited from its strong presence in the asset-backed securitisation business. The outlook for the corporate fixed-income market is rosy. Interest rates may rise, but it is unlikely (especially in an election year) that they will go much higher, so the growth of interest rate/refunding-driven issues should maintain a decent pace. The economic recovery, meanwhile, is picking up speed, which means more companies will need extra capital to fund expansion and meet increased demand.  ---------------------------------            JUNK BONDS  --------------------------------- Year     Issues       Value  --------------------------------- 1978      107     Dollars 2.03bn 1979       95     Dollars 2.77bn 1980      127     Dollars 4.29bn 1981      105     Dollars 3.34bn 1982      108     Dollars 4.5 bn 1983      184    Dollars 11.41bn 1984      172    Dollars 14.46bn 1985      279    Dollars 19.27bn 1986      415    Dollars 40.58bn 1987      305    Dollars 35.79bn 1988      190    Dollars 30.1 bn 1989      169    Dollars 27.72bn 1990       32    Dollars  3.01bn 1991       75    Dollars 13.44bn  --------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  ---------------------------------  -----------------------------------    INVESTMENT GRADE  CORPORATE DEBT ISSUES  EXCLUDING ASSET-BACKED  ----------------------------------- 1985   Dollars  81.36bn 1986   Dollars 177.85bn 1987   Dollars 171.44bn 1988   Dollars 191.38bn 1989   Dollars 223.56bn 1990   Dollars 249.58bn 1991   Dollars 459.2bn  ----------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  -----------------------------------</p>

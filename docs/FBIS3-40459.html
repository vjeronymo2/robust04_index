This opened the first Technology Industry-Academia  Cooperation Conference with leaders from academia and industry  held at a Tokyo hotel on May 31. With these words, Yotaro Iida,  chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, who chaired the  industry side, emphasized the great expectations on forming new  cooperative relationships between industry and academia. This  conference was organized as a forum to discuss ways for industry  and academia to cooperate. The participants were 15 of the best  people from representative technical industries and 12  engineering department heads from seven national universities in  Japan. Although the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) proposed and mediated the conference, both sides  demonstrated a strong interest. According to the Agency of  Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of MITI, in less than  one month after approaching the participants, the conference  became a reality.    Previous industry-academia cooperation was limited to the  range of individual research themes. In addition to having  problems in training, there was little opportunity to have a  dialogue on the structural and basic issues that stretched  between both sides. Therefore, Hiroyuki Yoshigawa, president of  the University of Tokyo and chair of the academic side, stressed  the meaning of this conference by stating, ``I was convinced  that the industrial world had no intention of changing its view  of universities. However, the economic environment is undergoing  major changes. Therefore, the time has come for industrial and  academic organizations to think about a new cooperation  mechanism.''    The motto shared by industry and academia is ``the nurturing  of creative people.'' The engineer's experience of a  high-powered growth period is a necessary condition for  developing high quality products and mastering mass production  technology. But, President Yoshigawa reasoned, ``From now on,  the people who will revive the new industry are important. That  is, the engineer of the industrial revolution is being sought.''  <H5>  Related Legislation Prepared </H5>   The report on the roundtable discussion sponsored by AIST,  which was held three days before this conference, concluded that  international joint research is an effective means for avoiding  trade friction and contributing internationally. Based on the  problem Japan faces with the criticisms of getting a free ride  in basic research and the excess import of technology, the  necessity for international cooperation in industrial research  is indicated.    For this reason, a government policy was also proposed that  begins by enlarging the budget for expanding national research  organizations and institutes at universities, and promoting  personnel exchanges. This policy crosses many areas, including  the provision of related legislation to improve the procedure  for the public and private use of patents. According to AIST,  these proposals will be ``implemented in the government policies  created next year.''  <H5>  The Antimonopoly Act Eyed </H5>   On April 20, the Fair Trade Commission announced guidelines  on antimonopoly laws related to joint research and development.  An environment that promotes joint R&amp;D was provided from the  perspective of the application of the Antimonopoly Act. The  contents included, for example:    (1) No problem exists when the market share of a  participating enterprise is less than 20%.    (2) When the market share exceeds 20%, a judgment is  made by  considering the research objective as a whole.    Hidekatsu Hirabayashi, regulation manager at the Fair Trade  Commission, explained the objective as the ``desire to further  promote fair joint research for industry by clarifying the  decision standards concerning the application of the  Antimonopoly Act.'' This kind of guidance has already been  provided in developed countries and planning for international  coordination is necessary.    In response, MITI feels constrained because ``the Fair Trade  Commission itself decides whether antimonopoly laws have been  broken. But, it is better, perhaps, if technological development  by industry is not shackled.'' There is concern in joint  research as well since competitive restraints that emphasize  preventative restrictions like merger regulations were  introduced.    However, there either hasn't yet been a case that had this  problem or the concern from important private industries is  slight.    From the perspective of industry, academia, and the  government, the opportunity to build an environment to promote  joint research should lead to a broader debate on competition  policies for joint research.</p>

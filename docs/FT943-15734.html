			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground again on currency worries - Market report Nervousness regarding progress at the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting increased yesterday and UK shares turned down smartly in mid-afternoon. Trading volume remained light, however, and equities closed above the day's lows. The second half of the session was dominated by the dollar and the US Federal bond markets, both of which turned lower as New York absorbed strongly worded comments from the German economics minister. Markets grew fearful that the Federal Reserve might either take no action on rates or lift them by  1/2 percentage point. Either course would threaten problems for currency and bond markets. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 down at 2,946.7. Around 4 points of the Footsie fall reflected the heavy setback in GEC, which was among the most actively traded shares after severely disappointing City analysts with virtually unchanged profits. A market now looking for growth of around 6 per cent overall in UK corporate earnings this year is no longer prepared to be forgiving of slow progress, even when accompanied by a cash mountain, as is the case with GEC. The reaction to GEC's figures helped to upset equities in early trading. However, news that UK manufacturing output had grown by 0.3 per cent in May, and industrial output by 0.1 per cent, was favourably received, as was the UK Treasury monthly report which said that economic indicators signal steady economic recovery. The market was also helped by a trading programme, said to be from NatWest Securities, investment arm of the UK investment bank. A second programme was later identified, with Smith New Court believed to be the house responsible. Weakness in sterling against the German D-Mark was a discouraging factor at first for UK blue chip exporting stocks, although domestic interest rate concerns remained more closely focused around the dollar's progress. The fall in the US currency as New York opened brought a rash of red on to trading screens in the London equity market. The earlier low point for the day was quickly lost as investors shied away, but nerves steadied as the dollar picked itself up off the floor. London traders went home to watch television for any move by the Federal Reserve. Once again, a contrary performance from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 2.4 firmer at 3,438.2, suggested determined bargain hunting across the broad range of the market. Seaq trading volume of 506.2m shares showed improvement against recent levels, although it remained well short of acceptably profitable levels. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 59 per cent of the day's total. Retail business, the more convincing valuation of investment activity in equities, remained disappointing as the big investors waited for the FOMC and G7 meetings to bring a guide to near term prospects. On Tuesday, retail business was worth only Pounds 968.8m, still well below the levels to which the stock market has become accustomed during its bull phase. The comments from Herr Rexrodt, the German economic minister, that the Bundesbank had not favoured the last round of dollar intervention further dispelled hopes for concerted action from the G7 meeting. They also served to focus attention on the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank policy council.</p>

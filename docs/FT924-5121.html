			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Hong Kong to start airport work HONG KONG'S legislators yesterday narrowly supported the government's proposals to go ahead with the site preparations for the controversial Chek Lap Kok airport. The vote by the Legislative Council's finance committee comes despite continued opposition from China. Beijing has yet to approve the financing package for the HKDollars 167bn (Pounds 14.3bn) airport. The vote raises concern over the level of support Governor Chris Patten can expect for his proposals on political development, which have met fierce opposition from China. The Hong Kong govern-ment was forced to make concessions to push the financing package through, cutting funding proposals by HKDollars 1.9bn to only HKDollars 6.7bn. This enabled it to win the support of the United Democratic Party, which holds 13 seats in the 60-seat council. The more conservative political group, the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC), voted against the motion, saying it was concerned with the divisive nature of the project. The proposals were passed by 27 votes to 25. China said in July it would approve the site formation contract. But the Hong Kong government turned this down claiming it would be wrong to take a piecemeal approach towards financing the project. The approval of the financing package comes just three days before the contract to the Nishimatsu consortium was due to expire. Failure to agree would have resulted in escalating costs as a new tender would have to be launched. The colony's stock market continued to shrug off political concerns yesterday, but the business community was bracing itself for an aggressive response from China over the inevitable implication that Hong Kong was pushing ahead with the airport on its own.</p>

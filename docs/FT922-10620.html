			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Southern Cross predicts loss SOUTHERN Cross Airlines Holdings, the probable purchaser of Australia's grounded Compass Airlines, yesterday said it expected to lose ADollars 7.5m (USDollars 5.68m) in its first year of ownership, but would make a profit of ADollars 11.3m in 1993-94. Mr Douglas Reid, deputy chairman, said Compass would be relaunched on July 1 if a ADollars 50m offer for the airline by Southern Cross was completed. He said Compass would offer fares up to 40 per cent below those of its main competitors, the government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation. Mr Reid added that the airline would cut prices by a further 15 per cent if necessary. However, he said, Southern Cross would aim for a market share of only 5 per cent, significantly less than that targeted by Compass before it went into liquidation in December. Mr Reid said Compass would be relaunched with five MD-82 aircraft providing services between Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Townsville and Cairns. Southern Cross intended to expand the network later by adding two extra aircraft to serve Perth and Coolangatta, on Queensland's Gold Coast. Southern Cross has a binding agreement with Mr Ian Ferrier, the liquidator, which guarantees it the right to purchase Compass if it can raise sufficient finance. Mr Reid said he was 'very confident' that a proposed share issue to raise ADollars 50m would be well supported. He added that some of the financial institutions which invested in the initial Compass flotation in 1990 have expressed interest in the flotation. A rival bid for Compass by the Republic of Nauru and Austfin, an Australian merchant bank, has been rejected by the liquidator but remains open.</p>

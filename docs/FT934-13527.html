			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate capital has adverse impact on Names Sir, In spite of my children and myself having lost a fortune at Lloyd's, we ignored the pleas of a number of action groups and submitted our proxies in favour of the chairman at yesterday's meeting (and therefore in support of the introduction of corporate capital). We did so on the basis of the many communications we have received assuring us that corporate capital is essential for the health and future of Lloyd's and that it will in no way adversely affect the interests of existing Names. Yesterday morning, I received by post from my underwriting agents a fuller explanation for the substantial, unexpected additional cash call they made last week, saying: 'The cash calls . . .stem from the decision of Lloyd's to discontinue cross lending by syndicates within the Lloyd's American Trust Fund. . . in anticipation of the arrival of corporate capital in 1994.' If asking me to pay yet more money now 'in anticipation of' corporate capital in 1994 is not being 'affected adversely', what would be? You may be sure that had Lloyd's made the choice plain, 'vote for corporate capital and it will cost you', we would have voted against. How do we get it across to those in power there is a limit to the money Names can find and that should be their first priority, not the shape in which Lloyd's will enter the 21st century?

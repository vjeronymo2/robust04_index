			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 64. Instead, as the Commission has done in the past with other new services, we will require local telephone companies that wish to offer video dialtone services to file petitions for waiver of our Part 69 rules prior to the establishment of a permanent video dialtone rate structure. The waiver process, as an interim solution, will afford all interested parties an opportunity to participate, and challenge or support the rate structure proposed by the local telephone company. The waiver process will also provide a forum for reviewing the cost allocation proposals of ROR and optional incentive plan carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Part 61_Price Cap Treatment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 65. We conclude that price cap local telephone companies should continue to be subject to the existing price cap rules for their provision of video dialtone services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 66. We also conclude that video dialtone service is a ``new service'' under our price cap rules. New services are services that ``add to the range of options already available to customers.'' In contrast to restructured services, which involve the rearrangement of existing services, video dialtone adds to the range of options for customers because multiple video programmers will have access to a basic common carrier platform for the first time. Video dialtone thus differs from a carriers's provision of channel service or other video transport services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 67. Local telephone companies will be required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test to establish initial video dialtone prices. As explained below, this test, as applied in established tariff review processes, provides an adequate vehicle for full consideration of the reasonableness of proposed video dialtone rates. We therefore find it unnecessary to initiate a rulemaking to develop new, video dialtone-specific tariffing requirements. We also conclude that, given our current dearth of experience with video dialtone tariffs, it would be both premature and counterproductive to attempt to promulgate such rules at this time. The first few tariff proceedings will provide a far more concrete and realistic factual context for future decision making than would be developed in a general rulemaking proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 68.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of the LEC Price Cap New Services Test. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We decline to amend the new services test specifically for video dialtone services. The Commission currently has generally applicable rules in place that specify the cost support that must be submitted with any new service tariff, including a video dialtone tariff. Pursuant to these rules, carriers must submit engineering studies, time and wage studies, or other cost accounting studies to identify the direct costs of video dialtone. LECs have proposed a number of different network architectures for video dialtone, and there are wide variations in the manner in which, and the degree to which, LECs are proposing to integrate their video dialtone systems with their telephone networks. This diversity and experimentation, which we view as beneficial to the development of a modern telecommunications infrastructure, precludes us from adopting a one-size-fits-all rule for the identification of video dialtone direct costs. The tariff review process, which includes the possibility of tariff investigations under Section 204(a), will allow close examination of each LEC proposal and enable us to require such cost information as may be necessary to evaluate each proposal. If the application of our existing rules has unintended consequences, or if the process reveals systematic problems, we will revisit our determination to rely on existing procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 69. We conclude, however, that it is important that we provide more specific guidance regarding the identification of direct costs in video dialtone tariffs than is ordinarily given. LECs may, over time, make large investments to upgrade their networks for video dialtone and other broadband services. The large amounts of investment involved, and the serious concerns about cross-subsidization expressed in the record of the instant proceeding, suggest that video dialtone rates will be subject to intense scrutiny. We conclude that the video dialtone tariff review process will proceed more smoothly, and LECs and interested parties will be able to participate more constructively, if they better understand our expectations in advance of tariff filings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 70. Because video dialtone is an essential component of a multichannel video service that will compete directly with cable television operators and other multichannel video programming providers, LECs may have an incentive to understate the direct costs of the service in order to set unreasonably low prices and engage in cross-subsidization. Therefore, as explained below, we will require the LECs to submit with their video dialtone tariffs a more detailed and complete identification of direct costs than we have generally required in other new services filings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 71. Under our established practice, direct costs include the costs and cost components associated with the primary plant investment that is used to provide the service. In the case of video dialtone, some of these plant costs will be incremental costs associated with plant dedicated to video dialtone service. The direct costs of video dialtone will also include any incremental costs that are associated with shared plant used to provide video dialtone and other services, that is, costs of shared plant that are caused by the carrier's decision to offer video dialtone service. In reviewing video dialtone tariffs, we will scrutinize the basis on which those costs are identified and included in the proposed charges for video dialtone services. We recognize and accept the challenges inherent in determining which costs are truly the consequences of a carrier's decision to provide video dialtone service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , are incremental costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 72. Moreover, we expect LECs to include in direct costs a reasonable allocation of other costs that are associated with shared plant used to provide video dialtone and other services. We will scrutinize the basis on which those costs are identified and included in the proposed charges. An LEC allocating an extremely low proportion of these other costs of shared plant to video dialtone will be expected to provide a strong justification for that approach, and we do not anticipate accepting a 0% allocation of the common costs of shared plant as reasonable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

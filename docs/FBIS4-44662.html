			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from the SAX Satellite Steering Committee to IL </F> SOLE-24 ORE: "But SAX Is Still Valid"]    [Text] We would like to reply to the letter from Professor  Ruffini published in IL SOLE-24 ORE on 12 January. Without  entering into details concerning the statements made by  Professor Ruffini we will limit ourselves to expounding some  essential points regarding the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite]  program.  <H5>  1 -- The Scientific Profile of the Mission </H5>   The qualifying characteristics of SAX are its ability to  make  simultaneous observations of celestial X-sources over an  extremely wide energy band covering three decades from 0.2 keV  (kilo electronvolt) to 200 keV, a bandwidth that has never been  simultaneously explored before. One of the preeminent aspects  of the sky seen in X-rays, as appears from the observed  panorama, is its extreme variability with respect to time. The  key factor in obtaining a consistent picture of the processes  occurring in the sources, based on the possibility of effecting  simultaneous spectral measurements over the widest range of  bands obtainable, is obtained by SAX by using a scientific  package made up of a well-balanced group of sensors, that  together give unquestionable superiority and the possibility of  contextual reconstruction of the energy spectrum over all the  bandwidth.  <H5>  2 -- The Scientific Instruments On Board SAX </H5>   The scientific package of SAX includes a set of innovative  elements, based on leading-edge techniques: grazing incidence  X-optics obtained by using a nickel electroplating process.  This technique, which was developed in Italy for SAX, has been  successively used for the Jet-X telescopes in the Russian  mission Spectrum X-Gamma and in the mission ESA-XMM [X-ray  Multiple Mirror].    Spectrometers with image sensors based on scintillating gas  proportional meters, with a sensitivity that is comparable to  that of CCD [charge coupled device] sensors.    A high-pressure scintillating gas proportional meter that  operates with characteristics of energy sensitivity and  resolution that have never been achieved before.    A high-performance photodischarge (PDS) crystal sensor.    Wide range X-observation cameras, that are the most  sophisticated type of blackout camera developed to the present  day.  <H5>  3 -- Comparison With the Satellites for X-Astronomy That Are </H5> Currently Operational or At the Planning Stage    When SAX is considered in comparison with the two  X-astronomy  missions currently in orbit (the German Rosat [Roentgen  Satellite] and the Japanese ASCA), its scientific profile is  competitive and largely complementary.    As far as future missions are concerned, NASA's XTE mission  is limited to energies above 2 keV.    The ESA's XMM and NASA's AXAF [Advanced X-ray Astrophysical  Facility] are planned to go into orbit four or five years after  SAX. As missions of the observation type belong to the next  generation, they will present a substantial advance with respect  to previous X-astronomy missions.    Anyway SAX will continue to be unique in terms of the width  of the band covered, this simply cannot be attained by any other  mission underway or currently being planned.  <H5>  4 -- Considerations on the Launching Date </H5>   The program for the realization of SAX is now well-defined  and the details have been settled. The nominal launching date,  using an Atlas Centaur from the Cape Canaveral base, is set for  22 December 1995. Negative comments about delays to the program  over the years are often made by the critics of the SAX program,  delays that would deteriorate the scientific validity of the  mission and would be characteristic only of SAX and not of other  missions.    As far as the presumed "aging" of SAX is concerned, the  argument is an excuse. As far as the time delays are concerned,  it is illustrative to look at the reference dates of some of the  most well-known satellites, as shown in the table.

Launch to use                                                               Atlas Centaur.    (Sources:  NASA-ESA)    <H5>  5 -- Consideration on Costs </H5>   SAX is a sophisticated satellite with high-profile  technological instrumentation. Its cost, when compared with  similar European projects, is completely in line with them and  is not at all excessive or abnormal.    Some "critical" voices of SAX present the evolution of the  cost of the mission, from the amount that was originally  estimated in 1981 to that of today, in a deliberately confused  way.    A correct evaluation must take account of:    a) The initial cost that was estimated at 100 billion lire  in  1981 and that would correspond to about 300 billion lire in 1994;    b) Following the Challenger disaster in 1986 the SAX mission  had to be radically replanned and reoriented to be launched  using an expendable Atlas-Centaur carrier (that currently costs  over 100 billion lire) instead of using the NASA spacecraft (at  zero cost to the program);    c) The current cost goes back to the contractual stage  negotiated in 1989 and has not changed much since that date.  <H5>  6 -- Participation of the Scientific Community </H5>   From the hardware point of view (scientific  instrumentation),  six research institutes are participating in the program, four  of these are in Italy and two are abroad, all together about 30  technicians and researchers are involved, an analogous number of  researchers are dealing with the software part (data analysis  and preparation of observation programs). We are therefore  dealing with a group of highly qualified scientists, that is  anything but small for this preparatory stage of the mission.  The community that is interested in the observation data  obtained from the satellite when it is in orbit will naturally  be much vaster. Johan A.M.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA interview with Foreign Affairs </F> Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze: "The Geopolitical Position Is  Unchanging.... A Talk With the Foreign Affairs Minister of the  Republic of Georgia"; place and date not given]    [Text]  A state delegation headed by Foreign Affairs Minister  Batoni [a term of respect in reference to or addressing a male]  Aleksandre Chikvaidze returned to Tbilisi from Tehran on 19  February. In addition to the official visit to Iran, the  Georgian delegation paid a working visit to the capital of  Azerbaijan.    These days, when almost every basic priority of  Georgia's foreign policy is developing dynamically, the official  visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran was especially meaningful  and important in many respects.    [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, your trip to Tehran and  Baku is the first as Foreign Minister since Boris Yeltsin's  official visit to Georgia. Why Baku and Tehran? Does it carry  some specific import?    [Chikvaidze] Indeed it does. Boris Yeltsin's recent visit  closed the regional circle of Georgia's foreign policy, in a  sense--that is, it gives final balance to our relations with  neighboring countries. Defining relationships has put many  hitherto unsolved problems and puzzles with the Russian  Federation in their logical place and made it much easier to  establish contacts with other states in our region on a calmer  and more reasoned basis. Hence, our official visit to Iran and  our working visit to Azerbaijan are in keeping with this  specific context. It begins an important stage of improved  relations and deeper cooperation. A vigorous regional policy is  a top priority of Georgia's foreign policy, because we remain a  regional-scale country which can get organically involved in  "big politics" only by implementing an intensive regional policy.    [Correspondent] Batono Minister, before Tehran you went to  Baku. What prompted the visit, and what was there of interest in  it?    [Chikvaidze] Our delegation had the chance to pay a one-day  working visit to the capital of Azerbaijan. The fact is that  Georgia and Azerbaijan face almost identical problems at this  point in history. So we have a lot to talk about and share. One  might say that the Georgian delegation's stay in Baku went  beyond the bounds of an ordinary working visit. We had a  lengthy, meaningful, and fruitful talk with Azerbaijan's Foreign  Minister Hasan Hasanov (incidentally, he grew up in Tbilisi and  speaks excellent Georgian). His wife is Georgian too. We  discussed a broad range of international and regional problems.  We talked about the extreme escalation of armed conflicts in  Transcaucasia. We agreed to step up joint efforts with respect  to collective security in the framework of the CIS.    Most important, I met with Azerbaijan's President Heydar  Aliyev. We talked about the quadrilateral meeting initiated by  Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze to settle the conflicts in  Transcaucasia, with Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia  taking part. As was to be expected, Heydar Aliyev met the  Georgian Head of State's initiative with enthusiasm. We agreed  that implementing the idea would be a big step toward  normalizing the situation in the region. At the end of our talk,  I conveyed to Batoni Aliyev Eduard Shevardnadze's official  invitation to visit Georgia, and he accepted it with pleasure.    [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, was our delegation's  official visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran prompted by any  specific factors, and if so what can you tell us about them?    [Chikvaidze] I told you when we started talking, and I will  repeat it now, that a qualitatively new stage has begun in  Georgia's foreign policy, or, rather, the implementation of its  priorities. The present system of international relations is a  reality for the whole world; it began to take shape after World  War II and has been undergoing very important transformations  before our very eyes. Time has also brought it about that  Georgia also has a place in this world order. Clearly and  specifically determining this place and purpose constitutes the  chief task of Georgia's recent foreign policy, the basic  direction of our efforts and analysis.    Our single point of departure is this: Georgia's  geopolitical  position remains unchanging; it cannot be affected in any way by  any change in the system of international relations. Georgia has  always been and still remains on the border between West and  East, which is a very important factor despite the fact that the  traditional anxiety of that confrontation has been somewhat  alleviated these days. The logical conclusion, then, is that the  influence of our big neighbors' short-term and long-term  interests on little Georgia's domestic and foreign policy is a  clearly marked and permanent political process. This is an  indisputable fact, and so I think that our foreign policy's  prime characteristic has to be balance and, as far as possible,  take account of the set of interacting factors which define our  actual geopolitical position. I took this brief theoretical  excursion in order to emphasize the elementary truth that  Georgia's permanent, unflagging interest toward Iran is what you  have called the factors that prompted our official visit. These  factors will always exist, just as the objective necessity of  bilateral relations between Iran and Georgia will always exist.  Add to that the realities that have taken shape through the  centuries and you get a picture of the extreme necessity of an  impeccable regional policy. It is in our future interest to have  close relations with Iran--political, economic, cultural, and  general. This is why relations between the Republic of Georgia  and the Islamic Republic of Iran have been characterized by  special intensity since November 1991.    [Correspondent] Batono Minister, what can you tell us  specifically about your visit?    [Chikvaidze] Iran's Foreign Minister, Batoni Ali Akbar  Velayeti [transliterated], visited Tbilisi last spring. So now I  paid a return official visit to Tehran, and the visit had an  objective of specific import.    The Iranians welcomed us with a very intensive, packed  program. We visited Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayeti  the first day. We spent almost two hours talking about a broad  range of current political problems. We talked about many urgent  issues of Iranian-Georgian bilateral relations and explored many  pleasant prospects. Naturally, our focus was on major problems  of regional security and normalization of the situation in  Transcaucasia. It is a pleasure to report that Iran's top  political leaders have complete and objective information about  our problems, and, what's more, Iran's Islamic Mejlis  [Parliament] has a functioning Friends of Georgia group.    On 16 February I met with Iran's President, His Excellency  Hashemi Rafsanjani. I presented him with a personal letter from  Georgia's Head of State. We had a very interesting talk, and the  President gratefully accepted Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's  official invitation to Georgia.    I mentioned above that our program was a packed one. We met  with all the ministers in the field of economics and the Vice  Speaker of the Islamic Mejlis. Very soon, many prospects will  become a reality. We agreed to create a joint economic  commission in the first half of 1994. We can say, then, that the  visit was a success.    [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, at the beginning of our  interview you said that the visit to Tehran is in keeping with  the specific context of regional policy, and you linked that to  Boris Yeltsin's visit. Could you give us more details?    [Chikvaidze] During our talk with Iran's President it became  very clear that creating the legal base for relations with  Russia was truly an urgent necessity for us. Rafsanjani stated  directly that he welcomed the improvement of Georgian-Russian  bilateral relations. What's more, Iran will encourage further  development of relations with Russia. The President believes  that tension between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Georgia has a direct and negative influence on the situation in  the region, and Iran can't help being concerned.    [Correspondent] Batono Minister, there has been a lot of  talk  about Iran's possible support in supplying natural gas. Was  there any discussion of that during your visit?    [Chikvaidze] I spoke about that to the Foreign Minister and  the President in the name of our Head of State. We reached an  agreement by which we will be supplied with one billion cubic  meters of gas from Iran; this is to be done on the basis of a  long-term and very favorable agreement. The Iranians' support is  due to Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige. "We will give  maximum support to Shevardnadze's Georgia," President Rafsanjani  stated at the end of our talk.</p>

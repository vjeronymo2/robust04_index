			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Europe's long term outlook gloomy but. . . Nearly half the respondents in a survey of European business leaders published today think China and south-east Asia are likely to outstrip North America and Europe in economic power by early next century. Europe's leading industrialists are increasingly confident about the short-term business outlook, but around one-third say they will continue to cut back their workforces. They show considerable pessimism about the continent's long-term ability to stand up to international competition, particularly from Asia. The survey was carried out among 1,500 companies in Germany, France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium by Harris Research for US-based United Parcel Service. Executives overwhelmingly favour more flexible labour laws to improve Europe's poor job prospects. Support for more flexibility in employment legislation is particularly strong in Germany, which has one of Europe's most regulated labour markets. Seventy per cent of companies say Europe is not investing enough in research, while 56 per cent say investment in training is inadequate. Some 28 per cent of European companies believe western Europe offers the worst potential for manufacturing investment among the world's main economic regions during the next 15 years, while 75 per cent say south-east Asia and China will be the best area for investment. China topped the list by a wide margin of eastern and south-east Asian countries favoured as investment locations, with 64 per cent of respondents naming it as the country with the greatest potential for investment. The next most favoured country, South Korea, was cited by only 7 per cent of companies, while only 1 per cent named Japan as the country with the greatest potential. Some 45 per cent of respondents think south-east Asia and China will be the world's most economically powerful region in 10 to 15 years. While 41 per cent of companies believe North America will have the strongest economy by 2010, only 11 per cent believe western Europe will. Business leaders are lukewarm about the European Union's capacity to help them improve competitive performance. A total of 45 per cent say the EU makes no difference to their ability to compete, with 42 per cent saying the EU is helpful and 12 per cent it is a hindrance. German companies have the most positive view on the EU's support for competitiveness, with British, Italian and French businesses the most negative. Asked about recipes for improving Europe's poor jobs outlook, 69 per cent of companies argue for more labour market flexibility. Support is highest in Germany (91 per cent), the UK (77 per cent), Netherlands (69 per cent) and Spain (68 per cent). Only 12 per cent of companies want government intervention to create jobs, but 17 per cent back the levying of duties on countries with low labour and environmental standards - a view supported by 45 per cent of French companies. The survey offers widespread support for the idea of varying degrees of integration among EU states. Some 58 per cent see a 'two-speed Europe' as acceptable in the short term, with 22 per cent favouring this in the long term too. Only 19 per cent - above all, respondents in Spain and Italy - rule out the idea. Establishing a common European currency is seen as the main priority for the European Commission by only 11 per cent of business leaders. Asked what they think should be the main objective of Mr Jacques Santer, the Commission's president-designate, 17 per cent favour bringing down unemployment, while 10 per cent say they support closer European political ties.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE AND THE WORLD: THE VIEW FROM THE BOARDROOM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The fourth UPS survey is based on 1,509 interviews carried out by Harris   among EU business leaders between September 5 and October 17, 1994.

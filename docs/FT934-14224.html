			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Former 3i chief for Tring ahead of SE flotation MR ALAN Wheatley, former chairman of the 3i venture capital group, is to become chairman of Tring International, the privately-owned publisher and distributor of cut-price compact discs and cassettes, ahead of a planned Stock Exchange listing. Tring expects to sell about Pounds 20m-worth of new and existing shares probably through a placing within the next few months, although UBS, the sponsor to the listing, said the details were still under discussion. The company wants a listing to help it expand in the UK and overseas. The flotation is likely to capitalise Tring at more than Pounds 45m, UBS said. Mr Wheatley is currently a non-executive director of British Steel, Forte, Legal &amp; General, and NM Rothschild. Tring was set up in 1990 by Mr Mark Frey and Mr Philip Robinson, the joint chief executives who each own about 20 per cent of the company, and by Mr Mark Levinson. It currently has a catalogue of more than 800 classical, jazz and pop titles. For the year to March it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m on sales of Pounds 16.6m. Mr Philip Keane, finance director, said the pathfinder prospectus would be available in the middle of November.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Dolorosa vita in the public sector: Italy's budget concentrates on spending cuts rather than increased taxes As governor of the Bank of Italy for 13 years, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi took successive governments to task for inadequate budgets and lax control of public spending. The 72-year-old former central banker has now had a chance to practise what he has been preaching in his first budget. This was presented in detail last Friday, and will shortly be debated in parliament. Steering the budget through parliament could be the last act of what is a transitional government, preparing for early elections under new laws probably next spring. Reactions so far have been subdued but parliament is likely to give Prime Minister Ciampi a rough ride. 'The first we knew of the details was from the newspapers,' commented one senior Christian Democrat politician. For the first time, the budget was drawn up on economic and technical criteria rather than overtly political considerations. The politicians in the notional four-party coalition which provides Mr Ciampi's parliamentary majority, were given little say. The proposed shake-up in the public administration and cuts in civil service privileges - the focal point of Mr Ciampi's axe - will face strong resistance because they aim to cut away at a network of politically controlled client relationships established over the past 45 years. As with the current year's budget introduced by the Amato government, the choices have been dictated by circumstances. To recoup international credibility and bring Italy's finances more in line with those elsewhere in the EC, the public sector deficit has to be brought down well below 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Ciampi and his team of three economics ministers have had to balance the clear need for continued austerity against the fear of sending the economy into an even deeper recession. Thus, on the one hand, if public spending had gone unchecked, the deficit next year would have risen to more than 11 per cent of GDP. This was even after the 1993 budget raised an unprecedented L93,000bn (Pounds 2.94bn) through extra taxes and spending cuts. On the other hand, domestic demand has contracted sharply in the first half of this year - demand for consumer durables and capital goods dropped 10 per cent - and the number of jobless has risen to more than 10.5 per cent of the active population. The recession, which began in mid-1992, has yet to bottom out. Only on the most optimistic scenarios will the recovery start in the first quarter of 1994, and yesterday Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor of the Bank of Italy, warned that any pick-up in employment would lag behind the first signs of recovery. Within these parameters, the government has decided to hold the public sector deficit down to L144,000bn - equivalent to 8.7 per cent of GDP - compared with this year's L155,000bn. To do this, the government will be raising some L32,000bn. 'The big difference is that this year we have put nearly all our emphasis on raising money through spending cuts rather than increasing taxes - the level of taxation should actually drop 1 per cent,' said one official involved in formulating the budget. Traditionally, Italian budgets have raised money through one-off measures or increasing taxes (and so encouraging greater tax evasion). The Amato government relied heavily for the 1993 budget on new taxes, including the introduction of a highly unpopular 'minimum tax' designed to catch the large number of self-employed in the tax net by fixing minimal assessments for specific jobs. Rather than raise taxes, this budget concentrates on the cost-cutting side. This is being done both in the form of across-the-board ministerial spending cuts; and more importantly through structural changes. Government departments are to be rationalised and given performance targets. A series of inter-ministerial committees and other quangos are being abolished; some 100,000 civil servants are being told to switch jobs or leave, and there is a freeze on employment. Bureaucrats can no longer assume they have jobs for life or opt for the early retirement of 20 years' work on a full pension. In future, those who leave before 35 years' work will lose their pension rights on a progressive scale. The education ministry, controlling 1.1m persons in the form of teachers and bureaucrats, a third of all state employers, will have individual budgets and the number of teachers will be cut to reflect the country's static population (Italy has the lowest student-teacher ratio in Europe because teachers have been hired annually on a quota basis regardless of trends in school population). Unlike the previous two budgets, which have contained unrealistic estimates of privatisation revenues, such asset disposals will go towards debt reduction and not be counted as a budget receipt. Ministers estimate that the combined effect of these administrative reforms could save L4,000bn; but, they add, the figure could go as high as L10,000bn, or more than a third of all the cuts being sought. Mr Ciampi pointedly said last week: 'We are spreading the burden of sacrifice equally, above all on those in stable employment.' The public sector has been pampered for too long, and as if to underline the point there will only be L1,000bn for wage increases next year. This is under half the projected 3.7 per cent annual rate of inflation for 1994. Economists, as well as Mr Ciampi's former colleagues in the Bank of Italy, have focused less on the 1994 budget and more on the three-year outline strategy behind it. According to Professor Mario Monti, a leading Italian economist, the three-year macroeconomic plan is too modest in reducing both the public sector deficit and the overall size of the debt mountain. For instance, by 1996 the public sector deficit is still expected to be 5.8 per cent of GDP. As for the overall size of Italy's debt, a third of all the EC's, this is forecast to go on rising from 110 per cent to 123 per cent of GDP by 1996, before dropping. The continued need to borrow heavily and the cost of debt service - about L180,000bn a year - explains the government's determination to emphasise the primary balance in the 1994 budget - nearly 2 per cent of GDP. In other words, strip out the cost of debt service and Italy's public finances already show an improvement. The debt service is costly. But each percentage point drop in interest rates permits an annual saving of nearly L15,000bn. Compared with this time last year, when Europe's currency crisis forced the Bank of Italy to defend the lira with a discount rate of 15 per cent, the rate is now just over half at 8.5 per cent - the lowest since 1976. Italy still has a real interest rate of nearly 5 per cent, high in relation to its main EC partners. But this is an inevitable consequence of having to provide attractive rates for investors to buy Italian debt. Attracting buyers of Italian debt in turn makes it difficult for the Bank of Italy to encourage the further fall in interest rates, which industrialists are clamouring for to ease them through the remainder of the recession. The industrialists nevertheless are benefiting from a deceleration in the wages bill. On average, private sector wages have increased this year at just over 4 per cent, below the level of inflation; while public sector pay rises have been even more restricted. In July the employers, unions and government signed a historic tripartite agreement which removed the traditional linkage between inflation and wages. The pact laid down that for the next four years wages could not exceed inflation and increases had to be linked to productivity. This removed the worry of any wage-fed inflation as the unions place job security above pay, providing the agreement is honoured. Modest wage demands, combined with last September's devaluation and float of the lira outside the ERM, have had a dramatic impact on exports, which have grown this year by 11 per cent to the EC. The surge in exports, despite recession in Germany and France, Italy's main markets, has helped offset the decline in domestic demand and sustain jobs. The success of Italy's exports has underlined the value of its competitive devaluation. But it has also raised questions about how and when Italy can rejoin the ERM. The floating lira is too convenient to discard for the time being. Parliament has until December 30 to approve the budget but this deadline could slip as in the past. If Mr Ciampi wants quick assent he will have to resort to confidence motions, and this will show the weakness of the government coalition and underline that only a newly elected parliament can tackle in depth Italy's public finances.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Italy: budget's balancing act  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual % change                    1993     1994     1995     1996  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP                                -0.3      1.7      2.7      3.0 Exports                             7.6      7.4      7.7      7.5 Consumer prices                     4.4      3.7      3.2      2.4 Rise/decrease in employment        -1.2      0.2      1.1      1.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Confindustira  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

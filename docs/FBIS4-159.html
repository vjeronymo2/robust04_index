			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- Eskom [Electricity  Supply Commission] has cancelled a sales transaction involving  1,000 semi-automatic weapons with an arms dealer who claimed  they were for export but, the company believes, were actually  intended for the kwaZulu Police. An Eskom statement said chief  executive Mr Allen Morgan on Friday [1 April] informed the  Goldstone Commission and the South African Police [SAP] about  the matter. "The deal was cancelled before delivery took place,  when it was discovered that the dealer intended to sell the  weapons within South Africa," said the statement.    The transaction, it said, was to have taken place in terms  of  an export permit issued by the SAP according to the arms and  ammunition act. "The transaction was cancelled by senior  management when it became clear that the weapons were destined  for a customer within South Africa, in this case the kwaZulu  Police."    The statement said the weapons were originally acquired by  Eskom in terms of its obligations under the national key points  act. "The act has subsequently been relaxed and surplus weapons  were being disposed of," he said. Eskom added that an internal  investigation would be conducted into the circumstances  surrounding the transaction, in collaboration with the Goldstone  Commission and the SAP. Assisting them will be forensic  auditors from the firm, KPMG-Aitken and Peat.    "Members of the Eskom protection services involved in the  transaction have requested to be relieved of their duties  pending further investigations."    Eskom added that an audit at its main armoury at Megawatt  Park showed all automatic rifles had been accounted for, and  that country-wide audits were continuing.</p>

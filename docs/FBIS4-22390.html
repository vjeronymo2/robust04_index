			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasiliy Alekseyevich Tsyuroy, first deputy </F> chief of Vinytsya Oblast State Administration and head of oblast  department of agriculture and food, by Nikolay Baras; date and  place not given: "Does a Nation Have a Future When Its Rural  Communities Are in the Throes of Agony?"]    [Text] The answer seems obvious. Can we expect  Ukraine to have a future without serious changes in its rural  communities? Can we move ahead in the market reforms and abandon  these communities to be torn apart by central and local  bureaucrats and to be destroyed by their own inner conflicts?    Some kind of inner framework is still preventing the  total ruin of the agrarian sector. Is it possible that the  safety margin has not been depleted?    My conversation with Vasiliy Tsyuroy, first deputy  chief of the Vinytsya Oblast State Administration and head of  the oblast department of agriculture and food, began with these  questions.    "All of that is true," Vasiliy Alekseyevich said. "Although  the rural communities are on their last legs, they are still  pulling the wobbly cart of our economy. No one else is pulling  it--not the coal miners, the power engineers, or the machine  builders, who are accustomed to treating even minor problems as  absolute disasters. The rural communities are pulling the cart,  and they are doing it in silence, possibly because they are  aware of their duty and responsibility to the state....    "Do you remember all of the recent cases of the overt and  covert deception of the rural communities? In response, they  produced a harvest that broke almost all previous records! The  farmers in the oblast produced, for example, 2.9 million tonnes  of grain (the third highest yield in oblast history), more than  530,000 tonnes of sugar, more sunflowers, vegetables, and fruit  than in recent years, and much more meat, dairy products, and  various canned goods.    "What did the peasants get in return? Not money, or  equipment, or fertilizer, or gasoline or diesel fuel. Once  again, they got nothing. But we are depleting their safety  margin. When the long-suffering peasants' patience runs out,  this will break the last cord that is keeping our rickety  economy afloat."    [Baras] Vasiliy Alekseyevich, Vinytsya Oblast has a special  agrarian status in the republic. People have good reason to call  it the "great granary" and the "sugar Donbass" of Ukraine. It is  no secret that the oblast annually produces 14-15 percent of  Ukraine's sugar, which is an extremely valuable, almost  strategic product for our state. It accounts for an equally  substantial share of the whole Ukrainian harvest and the output  of meat, milk, fruit.... Is this not a strong argument for the  government, the legislators, and the financiers?...    [Tsyuroy] You know, this is one of those cases in which they  are sawing off the branch on which they are seated. It does not  take much of a brain to realize that you have to invest money if  you want to develop production and get a bigger yield, but they  are telling us that the state is too poor to invest in the rural  community. At this time, you see, it cannot extend any credit to  the agrarian sector either, because this would escalate  inflationary processes. But can it at least pay for the work  that has already been done? Apparently, it cannot do this either.    Then what can the peasant rely on, if the state will not  keep  its promises, fulfill its obligations and agreements, or abide  by its laws? Sugar refineries are now paying kolkhozes and motor  vehicle enterprises in sugar, but the prices are set in Kiev.  But why? Why should the Cabinet of Ministers, "Ukrsakhar,"  "Ukrmyaso," and other such bureaucratic superstructures, which  essentially have not even lifted a finger to give the agrarian  sector in the oblast a sense of state priorities, have total  control over the results of peasant labor? Yes, we realize that  these are state requisitions and that they have to be used to  pay for petroleum products and other such resources, but who  said that we have to give them to the state for free? How can  there be any arguments about priorities when the state has  treated and is still treating the rural communities so  unscrupulously?!    Tomorrow it will be time to go back into the fields. How  will  each peasant feel when he gets to the grain or beet field?! How  can we explain to the machine operator that the state does not  give a damn, to put it bluntly, whether or not the equipment is  ready for the spring season?! I could talk about many things  that are hindering the development of the agrarian sector and  the whole oblast economy. They include the high percentage of  farming products in the structure of the gross agricultural  product, which requires higher material and labor expenditures.  They also include the excessive plowing of the land (the ratio  of plowed fields to all agricultural land is 17 percent above  the republic average), which leads to erosion and to ecological  and social problems. They also include the aging of our  equipment, which is becoming increasingly difficult to replace  or repair.... All of these things are naturally being discussed  by the peasants today, and all of them create problems for us,  but no one is listening to us....    [Baras] Nevertheless, even after political battles have  caused many statesmen to lose their senses, life in the rural  community goes on. In fact, it was able to enter a new phase of  economic and agrarian reform during this difficult time. As far  as I know, various forms of ownership are being established in  the oblast, stock and shares are being issued in agricultural  enterprises, some are being incorporated.... Many people,  however, are worried about the future of the rural community.  Will the prevailing form of ownership be collective or private?    [Tsyuroy] Judging by all indications, collective farms will  still be prevalent in the agrarian sector in the next few years.  This is not a result of the conservative thinking of the farm  chairmen, who supposedly do not want change. The fact is that  kolkhozes and sovkhozes, with their infrastructure,  microclimate, and production and consumer relations, represent  the whole rural world, and their sudden elimination would be  impossible and dangerous.    People sometimes tell us that we conservative peasants are  impeding reform. But why would they say that? We now have 677  kolkhozes, 85 interfarm enterprises, 114 sovkhozes, and 723  family farms in the oblast. I think the last figure could be  several times greater if all of the declarative statements of  legislators in reference to family farms could have been backed  up by some material content. Even then, however, their  contribution to the gross agricultural product would be  negligible.    On the other hand, the reform of the agrarian sector  presupposes not only the development of the family farm, but  also the conversion of collective farms. The administrators of  these farms are using several different methods: Some are  issuing stock in the farms, some are dividing the property and  the land into shares, and the kolkhoz in Lipovka in  Tomashpolskiy Rayon, which is headed by Ukrainian People's  Deputy Nikolay Melnik, has been turned into a corporation. What  all of these methods have in common is that the peasant has  become the owner of part of the property and land of the kolkhoz  and earns dividends for their use and a regular wage for his  work. Meanwhile, all of the peasants on a single farm are still  the collective owners of the property, which has allowed them to  retain their customary way of life.    What will happen in the future? If current processes  continue  in a non-coercive manner, the private and collective principles  eventually will converge in the rural community. What I mean is  that the interests of the peasant owner will be manifested more  and more clearly on the collective farms, and the wish to unite  in associations, unions, or firms performing specific services  for farms on the basis of mutual interest and advantage will  grow stronger on the family farms. This, incidentally, does not  exclude the possibility of the coexistence of kolkhozes and  family farms in their pure form.    The processor of agricultural products works hand in hand  with the producer. On the one hand, the oblast has 1,600 farms  producing grain, sugar beets, and animal husbandry products, and  on the other it has a food industry and processing industry  constituting almost half of the oblast industrial sector. We  could ask who makes a bigger contribution to the final  output--the producer or the processor? Specialists have  calculated that the labor of the rural producer represents from  70 to 90 percent of the value of the final product, but it is  usually the processor who comes out ahead in mutual settlements.  Not by his own design, of course, but through the good graces of  "Ukrsakhar," "Ukrmyaso," and other such organizations and with  the blessing of the Cabinet of Ministers and the legislators. In  other words, the state is still imposing its own rules of play  and deliberately putting partners in unequal positions. What  kind of market relations are these? It is just another way of  fleecing the rural community!    [Baras] Yes, the rural community is in the throes of agony,  along with the rest of our economy, but tomorrow it will be time  to go back into the fields, and the grain farmer will not give  up even in the face of futility. Will he really have to use the  last bit of his strength to prove that Ukraine cannot survive  without grain? Is there really no other method of keeping the  rural community alive?    [Tsyuroy] Reform. That is the only solution--the development  of different forms of ownership, competition between them,  purposeful state investments, the establishment of a balanced  processing structure, and the institution of genuine market  relations, and not relations controlled by Kiev--these are the  means of rural recovery.    On the other hand, we can rely on reform, but we also have  to  do our part. The peasant has to begin by giving up the  expectation that the rural community will get equipment, spare  parts, and petroleum products from central supplies. Otherwise,  we will have no hope of emerging from this quandary.    We are trying not to tempt fate. In the last two years the  oblast assumed almost all of the responsibility for supplying  the agrarian sector with spare parts, fertilizer, herbicides,  and petroleum products. We will continue to do this. Equipment  is a bigger problem because it has to come from Russia or  Belarus. We managed to find a solution to this as well, however:  Several dozen different types of machines and mechanisms,  including silage harvesters, beet harvesters, and universal  reels, and different accessories and spare parts will be  produced here--at oblast enterprises, including those that  worked for the military establishment of the former union.    We have no other alternative at this time.</p>

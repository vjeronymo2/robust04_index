			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Luis Camilo Osorio, Colombian national civil </F> registrar, by Chelo Garcia from the National Civil Registrar's  Office in Bogota -- live]    [Text] [Garcia] Of the total of the countries votes, 95.6  percent have been tallied. Ernesto Samper Pizano received  2,551,029 votes, which represent 45.1 percent; Andres Pastrana  Arango, 2,538,580 votes, which represent 44.9 percent; Antonio  Navarro received 215,186 votes; Regina Betancourt, 64,610;  Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, 54,731; and Alberto Mendoza  Morales, 30,393. Mr. Registrar, now that the eighth bulletin has  been released, everything indicates that a runoff election will  have to be held on 19 June to elect the new President of the  Republic. Is all set at the National Registrar's Office to meet  this new challenge?    [Osorio] Yes. We had said that, because of the short time,  we should suspend preparations for the runoff elections in case  it proved unnecessary. But we will continue to work along the  same lines, making preparations for the runoff election.    [Garcia] Is this the first time this has happened in  Colombia?    [Osorio] Well, it is the first time there is an election by  qualified vote. Consequently, a runoff election will be held.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Still A Paltry Sum"] </F>   [Text] "We want cooperation that is real and not just  symbolic," Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated Wednesday [30  March] during a Kremlin reception for U.S. Secretary of Commerce  Ronald Brown who is visiting Moscow. The day before, Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin urged his U.S. partners "not to be  afraid but to approach the Russian market more boldly." Has  there been a real response to these appeals or has nothing been  done about them? The three days that the U.S. business  delegation headed by Brown spent in Moscow do not seem to have  completely clarified this question.    On the one hand, four intergovernmental agreements were  signed between the two countries Wednesday, including statutes  on the Committee for the Development of Business Cooperation  between Russia and America and on the creation of U.S. business  centers in Russia. The joint statement adopted by Russia and  the United States made special mention of the question of access  to the U.S. market for Russian goods and to the Russian market  for U.S. goods. Summing up the results of the U.S. delegation's  three-day visit to Moscow at the end of the day on Wednesday,  Brown made a special note of the successes of the delegation's  representatives from the U.S. private sector and in particular  the agreements signed with Russian partners by such U.S.  corporations as McDermott International Inc., (shipbuilding),  the Halliburton Company of Texas (gas and oil industry), Allen  and Associates (the pharmaceutical industry), the Westinghouse  Electric Corporation (modernization and construction of nuclear  power power stations), and others.    At the same time, as the secretary himself acknowledged,  U.S.  private capital investments in Russia, which have almost doubled  in the past year, are still only $1 billion, which is a paltry  sum by U.S. standards (by comparison, U.S. companies have  invested $239 billion in West Europe). During the visit Brown  predicted that U.S. investments in Russia could easily rise to  $45-$50 billion if the right conditions are created. He cited  the lowering of Russia's customs tariffs and the easing of tax  legislation among those conditions.</p>

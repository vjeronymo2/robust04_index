			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 7 April, TASS -- Russian troops  can be withdrawn from Moldova's breakaway Dniester region only  after appropriate political and international peace guarantees  are provided to this region, according to Aleksandr Lebed,  commander of the 14th Russian Army deployed in Moldova.  Otherwise, "local residents scared by the 1992 war will simply  not let the Army out, regarding it as a guarantor of peace and  stability in the Dniester region", he noted, commenting on the  progress of Russian-Moldovan talks on withdrawal of the 14th  Army from the former Soviet Republic.    According to General Lebed, a sort of military and political  balance has spontaneously developed in this region of Moldova.  If Russian troops are pulled out before the crisis is settled,  it may upset the fragile balance and revive the conflict. The  commander believes that even after peace guarantees are  furnished, "the Army should stay in the region for some time to  make sure that political decisions are being properly  implemented". However, "no steps have been taken so far to  settle the conflict between Kishinev and Tiraspol," Lebed  pointed out.    The Russian commander said "the situation in the republic  has  radically changed following Moldova's parliamentary elections  and plebiscite on independence. Dniester authorities were taken  unawares by these events and are presently searching for new  decisions. I will judge about Tiraspol's position by whom  President Igor Smirnov will name to head the negotiating team.  If these are the same leaders -- Vasiliy Yakovlev or Anna  Volkova -- there will be no serious dialogue," General Lebed  stressed.    The 14th Army commander believes that Russia's peacekeeping  role in settling conflicts on CIS borders has good prospects.  "Russian officers in the Dniester region managed to iron out  the differences, which could have never been smoothed by  peacekeepers from third countries. This is just a matter of  psychology: People who once served in the same Army know one  another quite well. Very often, they drop official attitudes  and solve their problems in terms of human relations. This  proves extremely helpful," he emphasised.    General Lebed expressed concern over the current ambiguous  status of the 14th Russian Army. He said favourable economic  conditions should be cretaed for the Army's withdrawal. "We  should offer something to people coming to a new place instead  of withdrawing them to the open country, as it was in 1988-89,"  the commander pointed out.    In today's interview with the Kishinev newspaper  "MAKLER-TELEGRAF," Lebed denied any involvement into political  activities in the Dniester region. He said he had stepped down  as a deputy of the Dniester supreme legislature after Dniester  militants were sent to Moscow to defend the dissolved Russian  Parliament. Speaking of last October's events in Moscow, the  commander confirmed that he had been invited to take part but  rejected the proposal. Lebed dismissed allegations about his  unofficial relations with former Vice- President Aleksandr  Rutskoy and said he had no intention "to play his part in  Russian politics."</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Knock-about classicism - Ballet The Royal Ballet's new triple bill has an awkward air. At its heart is Balanchine's Symphony in C, choreography that so perfectly responds to its score that a ballet-goer can surely never hear Bizet's early symphony without recalling the dazzle and grace of Balanchine's movement, and sense the bubbles sparkling in this champagne of the dance. On Thursday night the fizz was distinctly non-vintage, and in a couple of interpretations as flat as can be, but the patterns and the divine mechanics of the piece were there to see - perhaps to inspire its cast to do better next time. On either side of Balanchine and Bizet were ranged Ashley Page with his realisation of John Adams' Fearful Symmetries - a mechanistic score that traps Page's movement in its cogs - and William Forsythe with his favoured musical thuggery from Thom Willems in Herman Schmerman, replacement for the lost Michael Clark creation. The contrast is disquieting. The Royal Ballet looks o'erparted by Balanchine, yet at ease in the physical blare, the deformations, of Page and Forsythe. In a season when the company has shown itself incapable of dancing its ancestral treasure Symphonic Variations - a performance last week was crude enough to make angels weep - it is no praise to say that the Page and Forsythe pieces were well done. Forsythe's knock-about classicism was made bearable on Thursday by the presence of Sylvie Guillem and Adam Cooper in the second-half duet. The dance slithers through their bodies, twisting and forcing them into aggressive, competitive behaviour. Mlle Guillem dances perfectly, with an insouciant bravura and exactness in shaping wild curlicues of movement. Cooper everywhere matches and challenges her. The duet is vulgar, redeemed by its performers' no-surrender passion, but it is deleterious stuff, because anarchic about classicism. Fearful Symmetries is a case of activity leading to further activity, with little of it purposeful. Dancers rampage, rush, look busy. Anthony McDonald's scenery has an exasperating vivacity, forever playing oh-such-clever tricks by changing colour, or manifesting acrid-toned shapes, or erupting with neon lighting. It is hyper-active, and a bore, and adds to the febrile air of the piece. Irek Mukhamedov roars with a tremendous combination of speed and dense muscular power over the stage. What he does is amazing, and oddly pointless. The rest of the cast knock themselves out in Page's garrulities, though there are hints of drama half-glimpsed in the penumbra of the set. But the piece is caught in John Adams's unrelenting musical wheels, and is dragged too far before it can call a halt. At Covent Garden on December 6, 7, 10, 14.</p>

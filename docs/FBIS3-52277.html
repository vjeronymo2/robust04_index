			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Shlomi Eldar] </F>   [Excerpts] Fatah members are continuing celebrations  marking the anniversary of the organization's establishment,  which falls on Saturday [1 January]. The Fatah Hawks held a  procession in the al-Shati' refugee camp and fired weapons in  the air. Earlier, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] issued  its own congratulations to Fatah.    [Begin recording] [Eldar] For the first time since the  establishment of Fatah in the Gaza Strip 29 years ago, the  organization's anniversary celebrations are designed to prove  its strength and size. This is the first time that the  organization is celebrating as a future establishment body and  not as an underground movement. Nevertheless, the festivities  are taking place under the shadow of a crisis. Fatah is finding  it difficult to make the transformation from an underground  terrorist organization to a body that is recognized as the  legitimate authority in the Palestinian autonomy. The struggles  at the top are greatly undermining Fatah's activity in the  Palestinian street. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head  of the Palestinian delegation, who is considered an opponent of  the Declaration of Principles, said that anyone wanting to  celebrate today, still had some waiting to do. [passage omitted]    Isma'il Haniyah, a returned Hamas deportee, was among the  well wishers in the crowd. He came to congratulate Fatah on  behalf of Hamas and to express solidarity. Fatah, Haniyah said,  was the first to fire the guns of the struggle. People in the  audience noted that Haniyah's participation was an indication of  the desire by Hamas to be integrated in the autonomy's founding  institutions.    Tomorrow afternoon, Gaza city will host the main rally, in  which approximately 20,000 people are expected to take part.  This will hopefully prove that the Fatah is still in control of  the Gaza Strip. [end recording]</p>

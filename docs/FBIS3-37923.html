Dear Suvorov and Nakhimov students, dear cadets! Dear  veterans, servicemen of the Russian Army and teachers! Dear  friends!    You have chosen for your profession serving Russia,  protecting Russia's people and its peaceful life. Please accept  my warm congratulations on the Day of Defenders of the  Motherland. From all my heart I wish you good health and  happiness, as well as success in your noble career.    The military profession, the profession which defends the  motherland has been respected and honored in Russia since  ancient times. It has been the destiny of the Russian people to  have to fight for its freedom and independence for centuries.    The valiant defenders of our native soil were always the  first to rise up in the path of the foe. Their heroic battle  deeds have forever become part of Russian history and have left  a deep imprint on the whole of our culture. Many events of  epoch-making importance for Russia resound with their glory.    Today we pay a tribute of respect to our veterans and to  everyone who with their blood and by their heroism and  incredible exertions gained victory and earned peace and our  enormous gratitude.    The other day we marked the fifth anniversary of the  withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan. That war remains  forever in our history, which, however much one might try,  cannot be rewritten afresh. In one way or another that war  affected each of our hearts, and the pain still remains painful  and the bitterness still remains bitter.    One should cast no doubts upon the true valor and heroism,  and loyalty to the military oath and to their homeland which our  soldiers and officers displayed during that undeclared war.    The state is indebted to these people. And we will do  everything possible for the social protection of the Afghantsi,  the families of the deceased, those who are missing, and the  disabled.    There is no purpose in speaking about the past, about the  great victories and accomplishments, about defeats and setbacks,  without a firm belief in the future.    In its most difficult periods three things have helped  Russia  to stand the tests and to take heart in its great,  indestructible foundations: spiritual might and the creative  genius of the people, immense natural resources and the valor of  its defenders.    Our generation has enormous responsibility to treat with  care  the legacy we have inherited and, no matter how difficult it  might be, to multiply it and to pass the baton with dignity to  future generations.    The defenders of Russia always had only one goal -- to  protect the country and to establish the people's sacred rights  without which a peace and stable development of civic life is  not possible.    Soon, you, who bear the honorable name of Suvorov and  Nakhimov cadets, will have to fulfill the honorary goal.    You are successors to the best combat traditions in the  Russian army and fleet. You, future officers, are to carry and  multiply the glory of Russian armor.    Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov used to say that a good name  of  a man lies in the glory and well-being of his Fatherland.    May those voluminous words -- duty, honor and the Fatherland  -- be your motto in life. Such is the sacred precept of many  generations of defenders of the Russian state. So long as this  behest is alive, so will the state remain, so will the people  live.    Profound changes are taking place today in the army and  throughout the country. It would be simply impossible  otherwise. Our army has not been renewed throughout two decades.  It hardly needs saying what this means to the state's defense  capability, and to you, the people of the military.    That is why the country's armed forces have been given the  task to step up the military reforms. They began in 1992, but,  clearly, what has been done so far is insufficient. There is  now an opportunity to act more resolutely and consistently.    The new Russian Constitution has been adopted. The legal  basis of the work of the armed forces has been sealed in the  recently adopted military doctrine.    I would like to stress that this doctrine is of a defensive  nature. In other words, Russia does not wittingly treat any one  state as its enemy.    Of course, the main points of the doctrine are not dogma.  They will be amplified as the situation unfolds. But the  country has designated clear objectives in the sphere of  security and the means to achieve them. And the armed forces  have received clear guidelines for their development. They are,  as follows:    -- flexible organization;    -- compactness;    -- mobility;    -- being equipped with the latest technology and weaponry;    -- being staffed with highly professional personnel.    Of course, it will take time and a lot of effort to achieve  these guidelines. It is even more so since the country received  an extremely deranged military legacy.    Russia bears on its shoulders the heavy burden of providing  accommodation and amenities for the formations and units that  are being withdrawn from abroad. There are problems with  financing the troops' vital activities and their supplies. The  social protection of servicemen, the providing of accommodation  for them, etc. are becoming very acute issues.    More important is the role of a meticulous and lucid Russian  defense policy.    As one knows, with the withdrawal of troops from East  European countries, the first defense echelon of the former  Soviet Union has disappeared. The troops of the second echelon  have now come under the jurisdiction of Ukraine and Belarus.  Their withdrawal from the Baltics is under way.    As a result, the Moscow, Leningrad and North Caucasian  military districts, which were previously internal ones, have  now become border military districts. The Urals and Volga  military districts are becoming a base for the preparation of  mobilization resources and the basis for the creation of a new  operational strategic formation.    To all intents and purposes, the groupings of conventional  armed forces in the territory of the Russian Federation will  have been created afresh before 1995. The overall number of  groupings and formations is to be sharply reduced. At the same  time they will be provided with the most up-to-date and  efficient armaments and military equipment. The military will  have reliable weapons in their possession.    The groupings being created will be capable of rebuffing  aggression in local and regional wars and military conflicts.    If a large-scale war is unleashed, they will ensure the  strategic deployment of the armed forces.    In line with this, a whole defense infrastructure on Russian  territory will be essentially changed (and to a considerable  degree created anew).    It is particularly important to resolutely renounce the  residual principle with regard to the officers' corps and all  the personnel which has already become a tradition.    The armed forces are experiencing a chronic lack of  attention  from the state and the entire society to its needs. This is an  unwholesome practice. It demoralizes people and makes them  doubt the importance of their military service to the state.    Therefore, the vital goals of the reform's present stage  include the following:    -- creating and consolidating legally a system of social  guarantees for the servicemen, members of their families,  servicemen transferred to the reserve and retired military  (including those who took early retirement);    -- switching over to a combined system of enlistment for the  Army and Navy;    -- introducing alternative forms of service.    One of the priority tasks for the coming year is to create  mobile forces, capable of rapid deployment, redeployment, and  carrying out combat operations in any areas and regions where a  threat to Russia's military security may arise.    It was necessary to transfer the battalion to the area of  Sarajevo, and in accordance with the Minister's order, after  negotiating six passes in 24 hours, it was at the appointed spot  and carried out a crucial task which the whole of the world is  applauding.    Today many of our soldiers have to serve outside Russia --  in  the border states and in Yugoslavia, where the flames are raging  of an interethnic, fratricidal war. The mission of these  Russian sub-units is a noble and peacekeeping one: to stop the  bloodshed and restore peace and stability in these regions.  They are serving Russia, and its security is being guarded on  its distant approaches. There our soldiers are having a more  difficult time of it than inside Russia where no fires of  interethnic conflict are blazing.    Speaking of which, I cannot help mentioning the event which  in the past few days became especially important for the world  community. I mean the Bosnian crisis.    It has tested the strength of our course by demonstrating to  the world the true potential of the Russian foreign policy.  First of all, our ability to firmly defend the national and  state interests of the country.    Russia, as member of the UN Security Council and an equal  member of the democratic world community, demonstrated its right  to participate in adoption of the key world policy decisions,  especially, if these involve its legitimate interests and  international obligations.    And the world listened to our voice. The mechanism of  partnership with the West has been tested. It did work, albeit  not immediately, and with some interruptions. The fundamental  principle of the Russian foreign policy -- dialogue and  cooperation with the leading states -- has proved right.    The Sarajevo crisis also revealed that our course aimed at  the strengthening of the United Nations in every possible way as  the principal international organization for maintaining peace  was right.    The result of these efforts is a cease-fire in Sarajevo  without a new escalation of the military conflict in Bosnia.    The events around Sarajevo is a call for common sense to all  those involved in the conflict. The logic of peace should, at  long last, gain victory over nationalist emotions which have led  the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the limit of human  suffering.    I hope all the parties in the conflict will fulfill their  obligations to the United Nations, ensure a reliable cease-fire  and not allow provocations against the international peacemaking  forces, inter alia against the Russian contingent currently  deployed in the Sarajevo.    We shall increase the peaceful attack in close cooperation  with the United Nation and our partners. The aim is to make the  cease-fire in Sarajevo a turning point to peace in the whole  Bosnia.    The power of the army is in its high moral spirit which is  based on the continuous ties with the society, the strict  discipline, and the subordination to the law, the high battle  training, and the psychological readiness.    This is a well-known fact to the elderly people, our  veterans, who all their lives served their country and their  people faithfully and truly.    Let us bow low to them for this. The new generation of  defenders of the homeland has an example to follow.    You, the young servicemen, are the hope of the Russian Army  and Navy. Be worthy of your forebears' glory, study well,  prepare yourselves morally and physically to defend our  Motherland. You have good conditions for all this, though I  agree that you need some help now and then -- all the more so  that your school will soon celebrate its 50th anniversary.    I congratulate everyone present on today's holiday -- the  Day  of Defenders of the Motherland. I wish good health, happiness  and success to all of you, your teachers and your families!</p>

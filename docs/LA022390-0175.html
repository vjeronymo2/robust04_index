			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROONEY'S '60 MINUTES' SUSPENSION MAY END SOONER THAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> Andy Rooney is expected to return to "60 Minutes" shortly, perhaps as early as  next week, sources say.  </P> <P> Talks involving Rooney, David Burke, president of CBS News, and those close to  the suspended commentator were held during the last 48 hours. By Thursday  night, however, no decision had been reached about when Rooney might be  reinstated.  </P> <P> Sources cautioned that CBS management was still weighing how, and when, to lift  the suspension.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Burke called Rooney and asked for a meeting. Both men met at  the CBS News Broadcast Center Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> In a phone interview late Thursday, Rooney said, "We had a very pleasant  conversation and he conceded that there was nothing personal. I like him fine."  </P> <P> Rooney added that "it would not be inaccurate" to say that a return is  imminent. He also said, "I honestly don't know" when the suspension would be  lifted. Burke did not return phone calls.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Rooney, in anticipation of an early return, has prepared a piece  for this Sunday's edition of "60 Minutes." But it now appears viewers may have  to wait until at least March 4 to see it.  </P> <P> Burke suspended Rooney Feb. 8 for three months, for racist remarks he was  quoted as making in The Advocate, a gay magazine based in Los Angeles. Rooney  denied making the remarks, but Burke enforced the suspension anyway. Rooney was  not expected to return to the air until May.  </P> <P> Now CBS brass is rethinking its position. In the three weeks following the  suspension, Burke and CBS News have come under enormous pressure from viewers  calling for Rooney's reinstatement. Pressure has also come from within CBS  News. Don Hewitt, executive producer of "60 Minutes," would like to see the  popular commentator back on the show soon.  </P> <P> There may be another reason for lifting the suspension, sources say. By getting  back Rooney, CBS hopes to bolster the show's ratings, which have declined  slightly since Rooney has been off the air.  </P></p>

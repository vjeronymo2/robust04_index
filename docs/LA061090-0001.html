			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH FIRST!  </P> <P> Sometimes our government seems to be unable to recognize the moral side of an  argument even when it is delivered from a burning bush. The FBI has been on the  wrong side of too many major American causes -- from the labor movement to  protecting the country's environment.  </P> <P> The agency is too often an overpaid goon squad for big business and corrupt  government. A primary FBI responsibility seems to be the protection of the  financial interests of the nation's powerful and rich. It has a long history of  wasting its resources on attacks on social dissidents such as Carl Sandburg,  John Steinbeck, Vietnam War protesters, Lenny Bruce, civil rights workers,  Martin Luther King, Amnesty International, Paul Newman, South American refugee  shelters, and environmental groups and representatives, including Dave Foreman.  This kind of activity is an embarrassment and an insult to the nation and to  the competent and dedicated FBI employees who risk their lives fighting  organized crime, terrorism, sophisticated white-collar crime and government  corruption. I wish a few of those heroes were in the FBI's upper management.  </P> <P> THOMAS W. DAY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

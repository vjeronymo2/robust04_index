			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Industry chiefs warn Major on poll doubts SENIOR industrialists have warned the prime minister that political uncertainty about the timing and outcome of the election is seriously hampering the economy's recovery. The message that consumers and home buyers are prolonging the recession by putting off decisions until after the election, was forcibly delivered at a dinner Mr John Major held with industrialists last week. The same message has been driven home at meetings ministers have been holding with businessmen in an effort to repair the Conservative party's relations with industry. Senior ministers last week cited industrialists' concern that the recession was being prolonged by uncertainty as a reason for calling the election sooner, for April 9, rather than holding out until the summer. Many industrialists believe strong consumer demand is being held back by concerns that a Labour win might lead to higher tax rates, according to interviews with more than a score of chairmen and chief executives of manufacturing companies conducted by the FT in the past week. Most believe that further delay in calling the election will only prolong a recession which has proved to be deeper and longer than most companies were expecting last year. They fear the uncertainty created by a hung parliament could have serious consequences, damping demand for much of the rest of the year until it was clear whether there would be a second poll. The election comes at a critical time for many manufacturing companies. Most did not expect the recession to last more than 12 months. The best have come through by cutting employment and non-essential investments. They are now facing the question of whether to make cuts in spending on training, research, product development and new machinery. Such cuts could inflict long-term damage on their businesses. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, engineering group, said: 'The general unease among consumers, about issues such as the effects of tax plans, is quite harmful. There is a danger that if the government waits for confidence to pick up before calling an election it will just compound the unease and delay the recovery.' Mr Tom O'Connor, deputy chairman of Elta plastics, agreed: 'Consumer markets need something to create a degree of confidence. Nothing will do that before the election and a hung parliament could be very serious because that would mean another election in 12 months' time.' Mr Tony Firth, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, Midlands engineering group, said consumers were financially able to buy but they were not ready to because of political uncertainties. Mr Stuart Moberly, finance director at McKechnie, the engineering combine, said: 'Everything is being clouded by the election. We need to get that uncertainty out of the way or there could be long-term problems.' Mr John Marley, chairman and chief executive of Avdel, the fastener maker, said the position was so grave that 'any uncertainty which is capable of being removed should be removed.' Mr Ian Kyd, UK financial controller of Hoover, the washing machine manufacturer, said: 'Two things will get the economy moving in the short term, greater confidence and some short-term spending power in people's pockets. 'The election will make a difference in these areas but it will not be a dramatic difference because the recession is so deep.'</p>

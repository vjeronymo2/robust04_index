The aims is to make it a pillar of the regional economy by  the turn of the century.    The money will be used to start more petrochemical  businesses  and launch six major petrochemical production centers in the  region during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95) and the  Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).    According to Li Fulin, director of the Petrochemical  Industrial Bureau of Inner Mongolia, during the Eighth Five-Year  Plan period, the petrochemical industry of the region is  expected to grow at an average annual rate of 17.5 percent.    By the year 2000, total output value of the petrochemical  industry is expected to hit 8.844 billion yuan.    The petrochemical industry has been developing rapidly over  the past years in the autonomous region, known for its vast  grassland and well developed animal husbandry.    In 1993, the petrochemical industry in the autonomous region  generated 2.335 billion yuan in output value.    As one of China's leading pastoral areas, Inner Mongolia  also  abounds in petrochemical resources, with reserves of major raw  chemical industrial materials of coal, petroleum, natural gas,  trona, salt and mirabilite.    The autonomous region has 13 large natural gas fields and  its  verified oil reserves are estimated at 21 billion bbl [barrels]  and natural gas, 150 billion cu m [cubic meters].    The rich petrochemical industrial resources and the  implementation of various reform measures have given rise to the  quick development of petrochemical industry in this north China  autonomous region, said local officials.    At present, Inner Mongolia, which used to rely heavily just  on animal husbandry, has now 132 enterprises engaged in  petrochemical industrial production, turning out 28 categories  of products, such as basic chemical raw materials, organic  chemicals, synthetic materials, and chemicals for agricultural  use.</p>

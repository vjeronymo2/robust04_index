			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Highlands join EC's poorest: James Buxton and Ian Hamilton Fazey report on the granting of special aid to parts of Britain 'I SUPPOSE you could say it's a bit ironic in public relations terms,' an official at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body, confessed yesterday. 'One minute we're telling people how well our economy is doing, the next minute we're getting special EC aid as one of the poorest areas in Europe.' The EC council of ministers was expected last night to pave the way for the Highlands and Islands, along with Merseyside, to be granted Objective 1 status of eligibility for EC structural funds or aid - putting these areas in the same category as Corsica, parts of Greece, Spain, Portugal, southern Italy and Northern Ireland. Visitors to the Highlands who sit in traffic jams in Inverness, one of the fastest growing towns in Scotland, or see the trim, double-glazed croft houses along the west coast, will wonder whether the Highlands merit this category. The population of the Highlands, in decline for more than 150 years, is growing again, partly because people have moved in from England and other parts of Scotland, attracted by the quality of life and the greatly improved roads and telecommunications. Several parts of the Highlands - the Shetland and Orkney islands, Caithness and the Inverness area, do not qualify for UK regional assistance. 'The figures speak for themselves,' said HIE, explaining why the area should receive Pounds 250m a year from Brussels over the next six years compared with the annual Pounds 73m from the European regional development fund between 1988 and 1991. The figures, preparation of which involved 'some clever manipulation' according to a consultant involved in the process, show that gross domestic product per head in the Highlands was just over 75 per cent of the EC average, the threshold for Objective 1 status. Away from the more prosperous areas are places such as the Western Isles, where the population is still falling and morale is low. The Moray Firth area is suffering because of the rundown of two big oil platform construction yards. In Caithness the Dounreay nuclear plant is shedding jobs as it heads towards shutdown. The EC cash would be spent on further upgrading single track roads, building harbours and ferry terminals, establishing new inter-island ferry services, building advance factories and improving training. As for Merseyside, which could gain Pounds 1bn over six years, its GDP per head was 79 per cent of the EC average for 1988-90, but was falling at a rate of 2 percentage points a year, and was already at 77 per cent at the beginning of 1991. One in four men is jobless. Projects are expected to include an extension of Wavertree Technology Park and a spur from the M57 and M62 motorways to Speke, near Liverpool Airport - an area with derelict sites suitable for manufacturing industries, if it can be serviced and developed.</p>

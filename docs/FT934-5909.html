			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Glittering prizes if he gets it right: Short-term pain for long-term gain could be the theme of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget On Tuesday all eyes will be on Mr Kenneth Clarke as the chancellor delivers the most bally-hooed Budget in recent years. The first modern Budget to combine spending and taxation decisions will be vital for the survival of Mr John Major's battered government. It will give the British public and foreign investors a first real insight into the economic policies and philosophy of the man who became chancellor six months ago. It could be crucial to the UK's ability to withstand increasingly powerful competition from east Asia and survive as a leading industrial power in the 1990s. Above all, the Budget must be a success for Mr Clarke if he is still to be regarded as Mr Major's natural successor. The chancellor is condemned to take risks. Although the economy is recovering steadily from recession, business and consumer confidence is at a low ebb. If Mr Clarke is serious about tackling the UK's large Pounds 50bn budget deficit with the aim of securing sustained non-inflationary growth, now is the time to act. The electoral cycle means that he can ill afford to delay unpleasant medicine. The trick that he must master is to serve it up in a palatable way. The chancellor has some advantages. Barring unforeseen developments, he will have surprise on his side when he opens William Gladstone's scruffy red and gold budget box in the Commons. True, his big day has been preceded by a cacophony of speculation, fostered in part by Mr Clarke's decision to abolish pre-Budget purdah for himself and Treasury ministers, and fueled by intensive lobbying from all possible interest groups. But the muffled howling of spending departments that always accompanies their annual negotiations on public spending with the Treasury, and the ventilation of every conceivable tax wheeze, has simply left the nation confused. The Treasury, Whitehall's Praetorian guard, has maintained its discipline thoroughout the past four and a half months of Budget preparation and allowed no clearly defined leaks. While it is possible to make reasonably well-informed guesses about the Budget, all but a very small group of Treasury ministers and senior officials are in the dark about the chancellor's plans. We do know quite a lot about Mr Clarke, his politics and his preferences. In his first important public speech after moving into number 11 Downing Street, the self-styled son of the industrial Midlands said he wanted to be remembered 'as a chancellor under whom the British businessman and woman and their workforce were able to earn a better living'. He has since laid great stress on the need for greater saving and investment in the UK economy. He wants to reduce the amount the government spends as a proportion of gross domestic product from more than 45 per cent to less than 40 per cent. However, unlike some Tories, he believes government can do some good through public spending and is not prepared to cut it below an acceptable minimum. Since his first lengthy interview with the Financial Times in June, the chancellor has consistently said that the projected 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn, or 8 per cent of GDP, is too high. He has been equally consistent in not ruling out higher taxes to reduce the deficit in addition to the Pounds 6.72bn for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 decided by Mr Norman Lamont in his final March Budget. Would the economy be able to bear additional tax increases? The good news for Mr Clarke is that it has performed better than expected in the past six months. Although there is a widespread belief that Britain is still in recession, and some sectors such as construction are still very depressed, the country has been in recovery since the second quarter of last year. Seasonally adjusted unemployment has fallen by 137,000 from its January peak of 2.99m. GDP in the third quarter was 1.9 per cent higher than the year before. The economy should grow by about 1 3/4 per cent this year against the March Budget forecast of 1 1/4 per cent. Moreover, there are indications that economic activity is being under-recorded. The Bank of England has suggested that the price measures used to calculate volume growth of industrial production and exports may be causing government statisticians to underestimate real activity. Recent figures showing falling unemployment, slow growth in manu-facturing output and rising productivity are inconsistent with each other. In September, Mr Clarke told the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund that he was aiming for a recovery that would be 'sustained over the rest of the decade and beyond', and which would be 'driven by investment and exports not consumption, by the private sector not the state'. What is clear, however, is that consumer demand, rather than exports or investment, has become the main engine of economic growth in Britain. As the chart shows, private consumption as a percentage of UK GDP has risen to record levels in real terms and is higher than in most advanced economies. This is a mixed blessing. It is doubtful whether Britain can sustain such high levels of private consumption in an increasingly competitive world. An ominous sign has been the persistent large current account deficit throughout the recession. If Mr Clarke is serious about encouraging business and investment, he should now be thinking of refocusing the economy. This would also fit with his determination to have the economy correctly trimmed to achieve a Conservative victory in the general election to be fought by late spring of 1997. The coming financial year is about the last in which it will be politically prudent to inflict financial pain on voters, while hoping to be able to compensate them by the time the nation next elects its MPs. Cutting public spending would be one way of rebalancing the economy. But, as we have seen, the chancellor sees political and practical limits to such an exercise. The off-stage noises emanating from the negotiations between the Treasury and spending departments to keep the pre-set control totals for public spending within their respective ceilings of Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96 have done nothing to dispel the impression that this year's public expenditure round has been very difficult. Mr Clarke will in any case have to signal politically difficult cuts in important public services on Tuesday. Invalidity benefit, unemployment pay, the roads programme, housing, and military expenditure are all likely to be trimmed, if pre-Budget reports are to be believed. So taxation offers Mr Clarke his only realistic option to wring success out of a difficult Budget. Britain's tax system is so complex that a deft politician can always conjure up acts of generosity to catch the public imagination even when vigorously raising taxes. However, the chancellor will be constrained by the high tax increases already announced in March as well as by the government's 1992 election manifesto. Mortgage interest relief, for example, has long been a target of Treasury tax reformers and is due to be restricted to the 20 per cent tax band from April. But it looks likely to survive in some form because of the still fragile recovery in the housing market and the manifesto pledge that it should be 'maintained'. In recent weeks there has been much speculation that Mr Clarke would attack the privileges of pension funds. But this has looked less likely since the chancellor's recent CBI conference speech which disclosed that Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, would carry out a long-term work programme 'looking at the impact of tax and other government policies on savings and the flow of funds through the economy'. In his IMF speech, Mr Clarke expressed a clear preference 'wherever possible' for indirect taxation. 'When we tax consumers,' he said, 'we should target their spending rather than their savings or incomes.' However, it is doubtful whether he will be able to live up to his principles next week. Although Britain's 17.5 per cent standard rate of value-added tax is low compared with others in Europe and covers only about 54 per cent of consumers' expenditure, the furore over VAT on domestic fuel and power exposed the political limitations of widening its net to zero-rated items such as food. Furthermore, the government's inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments militates against radical action because VAT increases are reflected in inflation figures. Nevertheless, there may be some limited moves on VAT and there is an outside chance of a new lower VAT rate to cover zero and exempt items. Excise duties on motor fuels are already destined to rise by more than inflation and tobacco and alcohol taxes could follow suit. But, as has so often been the case, income tax looks the best vehicle for increasing taxation. Most pundits expect the chancellor to restrict tax allowances. He could, for example, raise about Pounds 4bn by the simple expedient of abolishing the married couple's allowance, or Pounds 6bn by restricting all personal allowances to the 20 per cent lower tax band. Such moves could be defended as contributing to fairness and give ample scope for widening the 20 per cent tax band well beyond the Pounds 3,000 limit due to enter force in April. The Tories' natural supporters in the middle- and upper-income brackets would suffer, of course. But Mr Clarke might calculate that they would return to the fold by the next general election, especially if they are provided with cuts in income tax rates before going to the polls. The final package will hinge on the chancellor's assessment of how much he must cut the deficit. The figures for the first seven months of this financial year have provided no encouragement that it will be less than Pounds 50bn. The latest City consensus is for a fiscal tightening of about Pounds 2bn in 1994-95 on top of Mr Lamont's pre-programmed tax rises. The belief, quietly promoted by the Bank of England, that the economy is in better fettle than it appears could encourage Mr Clarke to be even tougher. If Mr Clarke wants to achieve his aim of making Britain more internationally competitive in the 1990s, his best bet next Tuesday could well be to prescribe short-term pain for the consumer in the hope that it will yield long-term gain for the nation and his party.</p>

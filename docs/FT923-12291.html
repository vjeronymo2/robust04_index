			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Economics: Signals from Germany set to steer UK interest rate debate A RAFT of UK economic statistics will provide ammunition for all camps in the ongoing debate over the course of British economic policy. But the most important signals for the future course of British and European interest rates will come from Germany. Today's monetary data are likely to provide grist to the mill of the government's monetarist critics. Broad money growth in June is not expected to show signs of accelerating, year on year, from sluggish levels. The government's favoured indicator - M0 - is expected to slow slightly to an annual growth rate of 1.8 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in May. Market operators will also be watching Wednesday's trade figures to see whether a further upward lurch in the visible trade deficit will adversely affect sterling's weak position within the European exchange rate mechanism. The June trade deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 1bn, up Pounds 0.15m from May. Government officials and managers, anxious for evidence that the economic recovery is under way, will have much material to pick over, including today's distributive trades survey and the June retail sales figures - expected to be just above May's disappointing level. The best indicator of UK businesses' expectations will be the quarterly survey of the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday. Yet the week's most important news will come from Germany, where the gloom aroused by the continued rapid growth of broad money may be compounded by high producer and cost of living inflation. The Bundesbank will need to see signs of moderation on all these fronts before the risk of higher German, and therefore European, interest rates can be discounted. Elsewhere in Europe, analysts are expecting a French trade surplus of FFr2.5bn in June, FFr2bn down on May but continuing this year's trend of small surpluses after years of deficits. The two US presidential candidates will be more interested in domestic news. A batch of economic data, particularly durable goods orders and auto sales, will provide clues as to whether Mr Bush can expect a pre-election recovery. The following highlights of this week's releases of economic data include the median of forecasts in brackets provided by financial information group MMS International.

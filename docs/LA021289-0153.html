			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'POLICE OFFICER NOT CHARGED IN SHOOTING'  </P> <P> Re "Newport Beach Police Officer Not Charged in Shooting":  </P> <P> I, too, was saddened over the news of the Sept. 4 shooting of Sundaga Bryant on  the Balboa Beach by Police Officer Derek Duncan. I remember that hot,  emotionally charged night and I prayed for Sundaga after that. I am grateful to  God that his wounds were not greater and that he will recover.  </P> <P> I feel, however, that I must protest his statement, "What gave this man the  motive to come out there with a shotgun and blow me away," because I know that  Officer Duncan did not shoot him intentionally. Having met and known Derek  personally through the Neighborhood Watch Program, I can tell you that he is  sensitive, shy and very committed to doing his job and helping people. So I  pray for him also, that he will recover from the mental anguish of an  accidental shooting.  </P> <P> And, I hope that both these young men will get on with their lives, wiser for  the sad experience, but better equipped to help others with their growth  because of it.  </P> <P> DAYNA PETTIT  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

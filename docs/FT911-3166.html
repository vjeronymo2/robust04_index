			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (2): Steering a new course - Industry THE 9,300-ton cargo ship Crystal Star is this week lying at one of the berths in Falmouth docks after a fire crippled her as she was passing Land's End. With her 28 crew membersairlifted to safety the vessel was brought into Falmouth while her owners sought tenders for the necessary repairs to be done. One of those tendering will be Falmouth docks itself. The docks, a member of the A &amp; P Appledore group, is part of traditional Cornish industry - not perhaps as famous as mining but every bit as traditional. Small boat building and an associated repair sector is to be found at many ports around the long coastline; Falmouth docks differs only in that it is large. It has been larger. Today the company employs just over 550 people, a number that rises to nearer 800 when casuals - workers taken on for perhaps a week or two at a time to supplement the permanent staff - are included. Together with the other tenant companies on the docks, such as Falmouth Oil Services and Pendennis Ship Yard, more than 1,000 are employed within the yard which is the most important single contributor to the economy of the town. Once, it was not only bigger but much bigger. Mr Tom Duncan, Appledore's chief executive in Falmouth, was not there at the time but he recalls that the ship repair side alone once employed more than 2,000 men. He also recalls that British Shipbuilders, who owned it in the early 1980s, ran down the number to about 75 and wanted to close a port that is a major harbour on the shipping lanes. Since his arrival in 1985 he has built the operation back to the point where it has a turnover of about Pounds 20m. a year. Even more traditional than dockyards within the Cornish industrial sector, though, is mining. Tin is as linked with Cornwall as whisky with Scotland or shipbuilding with Tyneside. Most of the great tin names such as Wheal Jane have now disappeared although some processing continues at South Crofty, near Redruth. It is at St Austell, though, that the mining industry continues to exist in strength and profitability. There, the end product is china clay, or kaolin as it is known overseas. Mr Graham Lovering, managing director of the company's mineral operations, heads the most important single employer in the county with some 4,000 workers. ECC produces some 3m tons of clay a year and is meeting demand rising by 2-3 per cent a year. Like Appledore, though, ECC has had to come to terms with changing market conditions which have seen the workforce reduced by about 3,000 over the past 20 years. Only last year ECC announced 750 job losses and in August it will move its head office out of the duchy to Theale, in Reading. That switch will not involve more than 30 staff but is an erosion of decision making out of the county, a trend that has occurred in other parts of Britain. At least the restructuring of ECC and Appledore has produced viable companies. Elsewhere in the county there has been a distressing catalogue of closures, especially in engineering. Companies such as Case, Strategic Alloys and Bryants Electrical have shut down or moved out of the county turning the Redruth-Camborne area in particular into an economic black spot. However, bodies such as the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which is the county's inward-investment arm under its director Mr Ivor Simpson, and the Devon and Cornwall Development Company, which co-ordinates the private and public sectors under Mr John Caff, have been instrumental along with the Cornwall Economic Development Office, a county council-led body under Mr John Rees-Evans, in switching the emphasis towards lighter, more high-technology industry. This switch compensates for Cornwall's distance from markets since the end-products of the incomers are not nearly as sensitive to transport costs. A survey undertaken by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte for Mr Simpson's Bureau has forecast the electronics sector to grow strongly over the next three years. Mr Ivor Simpson says that major investment is highly likely to be undertaken in the region with two companies 'planning to invest more than Pounds 20m and four planning to invest more than Pounds 5m. 'The evidence contained in the survey should have a galvanising effect on companies looking to set up European operations to take advantage of the single European market after 1992.' The larger part of the growth of electronics has taken place in Devon but companies such as BT International and Fitzgerald Light and the Goonhilly telecommunications station on the Lizard peninsula have shown it is possible to create a high-tech industry in the county. A further development has been the growth of food processing, led by people such as Ginsters, which now operates a national distribution chain from its headquarters at Callington, near Liskeard, and Rodda, the ice-cream producer, at Scorrier, between Redruth and Truro. Food and drink as a sector provided work last year for 4,180 people according to figures produced for Mr Mike Jordan and Mr Peter Fitzgerald of Cornwall TAB - almost double the number three years earlier. Mr Caff believes that 'what is still needed is a broader and realistic public consensus of what can be done and what needs to be done'. Given that consensus he sees no need to be anything other than optimistic about the county's industrial future.</p>

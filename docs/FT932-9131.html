			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / 'Portugal will not always follow Spain' EXCHANGE markets are wrong to think that the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo are irrevocably linked, and the escudo will not necessarily follow another devaluation of the peseta, according to Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank. He was speaking to the Financial Times yesterday after Portugal followed Spain's 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta with a 6.5 per cent devaluation of the escudo on Thursday. 'Our economies are naturally very closely linked in trade and finance. However those links do not imply that we need to follow Spanish devaluations, particularly by the same amount,' he said. He said that of Spain's last three devaluations Portugal had only followed two, and only one by the same amount. Mr Beleza's denial of an inevitable link between the two currencies comes in the the context of political instability in Spain, where analysts predict a stable government may not emerge for some months after the general election on June 6. The governor made it clear that Portugal would follow political developments in Spain closely, particularly after the election. But he believed there was no reason for the perception in the exchange markets that the escudo would follow the peseta if it was devalued again during a period of political instability. 'Thursday's (Portuguese) devaluation was neither desirable or necessary,' he said. 'We believe there were no fundamental competitive economic reasons for the escudo to devalue. However, given the circumstances, all alternatives, including doing nothing, were worse.' He said in the absence of the move by the Spanish authorities, Portugal would not have acted. 'We would have preferred that none of this happened.' He said the Portuguese economy was much healthier than Spain's in regard to the external balance and unemployment. Portugal would also close its inflation gap with Spain rapidly. Portugal's year-on-year inflation figure for April is expected to be just over 6 per cent, compared to 4.6 per cent in Spain. Despite Spain's economic difficulties, Mr Beleza appeared generally surprised by the Spanish devaluation and noted that Madrid had unusually decided to act while the markets were still open. The escudo traded at Es95.8-Es96.3 to the D-Mark in Lisbon yesterday. It was quoted at Es97.5 after the central bank suspended support on Thursday. Short-term interbank interest rates fell from 18 to 15 per cent.</p>

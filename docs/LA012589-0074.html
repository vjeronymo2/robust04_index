			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINTER WHEAT PLANTING UP 12% OVER LAST YEAR  </P> <P> Farmers have planted about 54.5 million acres of winter wheat for harvest this  year, up 12% from 1988, the Agriculture Department says.  </P> <P> Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following year. It  accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat output.  </P> <P> Production was reduced last year by drought, and brisk export demand has helped  reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices have risen substantially the  past year.  </P> <P> Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10% of their wheat base acres for  1989 to qualify for government price supports, compared to 27.5% previously.  </P> <P> The 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for 1989 is the largest acreage  since 57.8 million acres were planted for the 1985 harvest, according to USDA  records.  </P></p>

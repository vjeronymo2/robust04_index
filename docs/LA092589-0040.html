			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> China's Communist Party Central Committee will meet next month to ratify a  detailed economic policy that will chart the country's course for the next two  years, the New York Times reported in today's editions. The meeting will also  decide the fate of ousted Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang,  Chinese officials told the newspaper. Most people in the central party  apparatus believe that Zhao, who was sympathetic to pro-democracy student  demonstrators whose protest movement was crushed, will be vigorously denounced  but will not face a criminal trial, the newspaper reported.  </P></p>

The amendment would permit Millstone Unit No. 3 to remain in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4 while the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink is greater than 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F for a 24 hour period for the months of August and September 1994. Exigent action is justified in order to permit the licensee to continue operations in the above mentioned Modes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed temporary change to the Action Statement of LCO 3.7.5 of the Millstone Unit No. 3 Technical Specifications will increase the time the plant may be in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink greater than 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F from 6 hours to 24 hours. The proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously analyzed. The probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased by a short term increase in the ultimate heat sink average water temperature. The probability of Condition IV accidents, as described in Chapter 15 of the FSAR, occurring in conjunction with the short duration increase in ultimate heat sink average water temperature above 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F is low enough such that they are not risk significant. Further, an evaluation has been performed that safe shutdown will be achieved and maintained for a loss of offsite power and a steam generator tube rupture event with the additional consideration of a single failure with ultimate heat sink average water temperatures as high as 77 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. There has been no significant increase in the consequences of these previously evaluated events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed temporary technical specification change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously analyzed. The change increases the amount of time that is allowed for the plant to be in hot standby should the ultimate heat sink average water temperature increase above 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F from 6 to 24 hours. This extension of the time allowed for the plant to be in hot standby does not change the plant configuration. As such, the change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

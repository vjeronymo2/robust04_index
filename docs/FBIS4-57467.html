			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Violeta Chamorro to the nation at the </F> National Unity Room of the Presidential House in Managua -- live]    [Text] Dear Nicaraguans: On 25 April 1990, when I was  sworn in as president of the country, I addressed all of you  from the National Stadium and I said that the four pillars of a  democratic republic for all to be free and equal before the law,  are:    First: the exercise of democratic liberties;    Second: the utmost promotion of economic production;    Third: the reduction of social inequity;    Fourth: to work with a spirit of peace, unity, and national  reconciliation.    During these past four years we have been working toward the  objectives I mentioned that first day. In the government  program I outlined for the people, I established the commitment  that the Armed Forces would have a professional nature and would  not belong to any political party. However, on that day also, I  committed myself to putting an end to the war and to  consolidating peace; to reducing the Army; and to placing the  Armed Forces under the civilian authority of the president.    Ever since that April morning we have been working on these  objectives. We have been able to reduce the size of the Army  from 84,000 men and women to only 14,000, thus turning it into  the smallest army in Central America. As a result of this  reduction in military expenditures, we have been able to  increase investments for repairing and building schools and  health centers.    Today I am very happy to send to the National Assembly the  Bill on Military [word indistinct] and Organization,  Jurisdiction, [words indistinct], popularly known as the  Military Law. This bill contains three essential military  points: It establishes guidelines that ensure compliance with  the functions of the Armed Forces, their professionalism, and  their nonpolitical nature.    The most important aspect of this bill is that once it is  promulgated, Nicaragua will have, for the first time in its  history, an army clearly subordinated to civilian power,  committed to the Constitution, and it will not belong or submit  itself to the interests of any political party or social class.  Behind us now are the years of armies that belonged to groups  or parties and that made the birth of democracy in Nicaragua so  laborious. Today we are opening the doors to an Army of all the  Nicaraguans. It will be done so that we never lose the  democracy that has been won.    It was difficult and hard to bring about the agreement with  the Army. Never before in the history of Nicaragua had the  civilian and military leaders of the country worked to draft  laws that would guarantee civilian supremacy over the military.  The work was hard and the road the government and the Army had  to walk to reach this point was lengthy, but the commitment that  both institutions have with a democratic and unified Nicaragua,  conquered distrust and [word indistinct].    We have also agreed on appointing the new commander in chief  of our nation's Army before the end of the year, just as I have  announced on several occasions. This appointment will be made  on 21 December of this year. This means that following the  conclusion of the two-month transition established in Article 9  of this code, the new commander will be sworn in on 21 February  1995, the centennial anniversary year of the birth of General  Augusto Cesar Sandino, and on that day General Humberto Ortega  will retire.    Dear Nicaraguans, on that 25 April I told you that Nicaragua  was inviting us to bury not its children who die in fraticidal  wars, but to bury, forever, weapons, so that the muzzles of  cannons roar no more, as our National Anthem demands. The  divided, poor, and conflict-ridden Nicaragua we received on that  day, is being left behind forever. Thank you.</p>

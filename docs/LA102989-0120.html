			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAMARILLO AND AGOURA CONTINUE RUN ON TITLES  </P> <P> Little has changed since the Camarillo High boys' cross-country team and Agoura  High girls' team won titles in the Ventura County championships in 1987.  </P> <P> Both teams repeated last year, and both won a third consecutive title in the  meet held Saturday at Moorpark College.  </P> <P> There were other constants too. Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin, both of  Agoura, mirrored their performances of the past two years in winning individual  titles.  </P> <P> Camarillo placed all five of its scorers among the top 12 to total 35 points,  well ahead of runner-up Agoura (73) and third-place Westlake (132).  </P> <P> "Agoura High School looked sensational," Camarillo Coach Mike Smith said. "They  were right in our uniforms."  </P> <P> Dameworth recorded a personal best on the three-mile course of 14 minutes, 56  seconds to win by 220 meters over Ventura's Roman Morales (15:39).  </P> <P> Drossin (18:00) pulled away from Jeanine Rothman of Westlake at the 1 3/4-mile  mark to claim her championship by 120 meters. Rothman clocked 18:27 for second  place.  </P> <P> In the girls' team race Agoura, the state's top-ranked team, held on to edge  Buena, 46-54.  </P> <P> The Chargers placed three runners among the top 15, including three in the top  10. Buena, ranked second in the Southern Section 4-A Division, placed its five  scorers among the top 16.  </P> <P> "I knew it would be close," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "At the Fountain  Valley (Invitational) two weeks ago, I figured them into our race and us into  their race and we beat them by four points (on paper)."  </P> <P> Dameworth had said that he was pleased with the way he ran the third mile last  week in the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, which he won in  14:41.8. Despite struggling slightly through the wind and the final mile  Saturday, the Charger senior still managed to eclipse his best on the Moorpark  course by 16 seconds.  </P> <P> "I think I lost it in the last mile," he said. I was just sort of doggin' it. I  didn't feel like fighting the wind."  </P> <P> Drossin, however, decided that a slower start would be more advantageous than  pushing an early pace.  </P> <P> "At Mt. SAC last weekend, I went out way too fast," the junior said. "I was  really trying to keep my pace slow that first half (mile)."  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated at Pounds 8.9m for nine months PREMIER Consolidated Oil-fields reported net profits of Pounds 8.9m for the nine months to December 31, the company's new reporting date, against Pounds 11.2m for the previous year. The figure for the comparable period was Pounds 8.4m. Nine-month turnover rose from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 32m. Earnings per share increased slightly to 1.72p (1.61p). Premier has adjusted its accounting policies to write off abortive exploration efforts in the US and Papua New Guinea which reduced last year's amortisation charge by Pounds 1.3m. During the period production increased from 9,290 barrels of oil a day to 11,000 b/d. Production has since risen to 15,000 b/d with the start-up of the Angus field in the North Sea. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was looking at some promising ventures in the North Sea as well as high-risk exploration in Burma and Cambodia. Mr Shaw will visit Daghestan in the Commonwealth of Independent States on Tuesday to negotiate an oil production-sharing contract. The company said it had decided not to pay a dividend while oil shares and prices remain so low nor would it make its usual 1-for-10 scrip. Mr Shaw said that the fall in its market price had bottomed and would slowly recover. The shares closed down 2p at 20p on Thursday.</p>

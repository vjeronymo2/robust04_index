			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Russia's third city leads the way in state property sales TURNING Russian state into private property began in an organised fashion yesterday in Russia's third city of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly Gorky, 400 miles west of Moscow. In terms of volume, this was a small event. It lasted less than two hours and only a few thousand dollars changed hands. Yet Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, came down from Moscow and afterwards described it as 'a turning point' and 'a breakthrough'. Why should Nizhny Novgorod be seen in this way, rather than Moscow or St Petersburg? The International Finance Corporation, the project finance arm of the World Bank which has underpinned this exercise, points to the city's lack of corruption. It also cites a strong political will in favour of the market shown by the mayor and the governor of the region. Nizhny's Saturday auction was held in a Palace of Culture in the old part of the town. The building was solidly picketed by some 300 people, mainly women from some of the 2,000 retail businesses in Nizhny, all of which are due to be privatised by the end of the year. They held signs with slogans like 'where are you leading us' and 'Don't make us poor again'. The auction was conducted by Mr Arseny Labanov, a former jockey who now has his own TV show. The IFC had worked on Mr Labanov, taking him to Prague to learn from a Czechoslovak auctioneer. Each of the 22 shops on the list had a starting price, which represented the book value of the assets: the first, for example, was a food shop which had a starting price of Rbs9,300 and which was bid up quickly to sell at Rbs630,000: the highest price was for a crystal shop which sold for Rbs10m. At the end, 21 of the shops were sold, one being withdrawn because only one buyer had registered for it. Among the buyers in Saturday's auction was Mr Swergei Shirokov, manager of an electrical goods shop. He had bid for the shop on behalf of the staff - all 57 of whom had chipped in to raise the Rbs2m for which it was sold. The sale was thought to have gone well. Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor, and Mr Dmitri Bednyakov, the mayor, are pressing the IFC to privatise more - especially the 8,000-strong lorry fleet in the region. Already, the mayors of other cities are beating a path to the IFC's door, asking for help (which their resources will not allow). But beyond the pleasant enough shopping streets are the vast factories which define Nizhny Novgorod and so many other cities: only the first scratchings on the surface have begun.</p>

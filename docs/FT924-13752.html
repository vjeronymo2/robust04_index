			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey highlights consumer caution CONSUMERS have become much less keen over the past four months to make large purchases, according to a survey of retail buying trends, Peter Marsh writes. Verdict Research, a consultancy specialising in retailing, says its index of purchasing trends stood at 107 in September, the lowest since it started the survey in June. The consultancy says the numbers of people keen to buy houses and cars are 'particularly depressed'. It adds that 'short-term prospects of a consumer-led economic recovery are very slim indeed'. Verdict organises its survey by asking 2,000 people every month whether they are 'seriously considering' buying one or more of a number of consumer items  -including houses, cars, furniture, clothing worth at least Pounds 100 and decorating goods, such as paint sufficient for a room. The latest survey covers the first week of September and so was not affected by withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. Retail Verdict. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS. Annual subscription Pounds 295.</p>

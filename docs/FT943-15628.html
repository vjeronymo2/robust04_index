			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / IoD reports slight fall in directors' confidence Directors are slightly less optimistic about their companies' prospects and about the economy than they were in the spring, a survey from the Institute of Directors has found. Only 44 per cent of 300 directors surveyed last month were more optimistic about the economy than they were six months ago, compared with 51 per cent in April. Political uncertainty and government mismanagement were the factors cited by those who were more pessimistic. Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, said it believed there was no case for either a cut or an increase in interest rates. He added: 'Business confidence, which is essential to sustain economic recovery, could be restored by a firm commitment by the chancellor to return public finances to order by means of a significant reduction in government spending.' The proportion of directors more optimistic about their companies' prospects fell slightly to 61 per cent, from 63 per cent in April. However 47 per cent expect to take on more employees in the next six months, compared with 44 per cent in April. Seventy per cent said the volume of business had increased, the same as in April, and 62 per cent said that profits had risen, against 59 per cent in April. Overall, 79 per cent said their companies were performing well or very well, the same as in April. Economic recovery in the west Midlands has reached a plateau and confidence about immediate prospects for corporate profitability has faltered, a survey of business performance has found, Paul Cheeseright writes. But the proportion of companies recruiting more staff has increased and, for the services sector, there have been increasing difficulties in finding skilled manual labour. The west Midlands regional group of Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey shows that the rise in domestic orders in the first quarter of the year was not repeated in the second. Last month 42 per cent of manufacturing companies reported home orders higher than three months before, compared with 46 per cent in March. The proportion reporting higher export orders rose to 36 per cent from 34 per cent.</p>

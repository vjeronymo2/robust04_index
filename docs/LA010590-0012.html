			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA BUILDERS ASK FOR PROJECTS TO BE SPARED  </P> <P> A long line of builders, faced with the prospect of seeing their developments  killed or scaled back, tried to persuade Los Angeles County planners Thursday  to ease stringent growth restrictions proposed for the Santa Clarita Valley  over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Officials from the city of Santa Clarita, meanwhile, praised the proposal,  saying it makes good sense to limit development until sufficient roads, schools  and other services can be built to serve the area.  </P> <P> The proposal would revise the valley's general plan, which acts as a broad  guide for development. The county Regional Planning Commission held the first  of several hearings on the document Thursday.  </P> <P> The new general plan would uphold a county policy, being challenged by  developers, that allows the valley's population, now about 150,000, to reach  270,000 by 2010.  </P> <P> The plan would allow developers to build 10,100 new houses, condominiums and  apartments.  </P> <P> But sitting in county files are plans to build at least 38,000 dwelling units  on unincorporated land surrounding the 2-year-old city of Santa Clarita. In  order to stay under the population ceiling, county planners say the county will  have to reject plans for close to 28,000 units.  </P> <P> During a 3 1/2-hour hearing, 18 developers asked commissioners to include their  projects in the final plan or ease restrictions that would scale back some  projects.  </P> <P> For some developers, the stakes are high.  </P> <P> The Dale Poe Development Corp., for example, wants to build 4,632 units on land  zoned for 891 units.  </P> <P> The project is located west of the Golden State Freeway and a few miles south  of Magic Mountain.  </P> <P> A project that size could not be built under the proposed general plan, which  retains the limit of 891 units.  </P> <P> David Breier, an attorney for Dale Poe, asked commissioners to support the  project, saying it would benefit the Santa Clarita Valley with new roads,  school sites and parks.  </P> <P> Other developers also touted their projects, saying they would bring jobs,  roads and affordable housing to the valley.  </P> <P> One developer, David Doremus, said the commissioners should not restrict growth  at all. "We have lots and lots of land that should be utilized," he said.  Large-scale growth is feasible, he said, as long as planners make sure there  are public services for the surging population.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita officials praised the general plan overall but questioned the  proposed distribution of the 10,100 units that would be allowed before 2010.  </P> <P> About 75% of those units would be built in unincorporated areas and the  remainder inside Santa Clarita. Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said the  ratio should be reversed, with Santa Clarita overseeing the majority of growth  in the valley.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said the pace of growth should be tied to the  adequacy of public facilities in the valley.  </P> <P> A recent county report estimated the valley will need at least $912 million in  capital improvements -- from parks to schools to libraries -- to serve the  region by 2010.  </P> <P> The commission will hear more testimony on the issue Feb. 6.  </P> <P> The final general plan eventually must be approved by the county Board of  Supervisors.  </P></p>

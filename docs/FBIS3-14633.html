			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in </F> Tunis, by Nidal Qabalan, in London on 29 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Qabalan] 'Arafat told us that there were two  possibilities behind the attack in which six Palestinians were  killed yesterday in Jabalyah Camp.    ['Arafat] Either, and I wonder about this, it is that Rabin  knows what is going on but is turning a blind eye, or that these  acts are being committed by Israeli army units without Rabin's  knowledge. In either case, it is a terrible situation that will  have a grave effect on the entire peace process.    There are formations within the Israeli Army... [pauses] We  are facing the same experience as our brothers the Algerians in  Evian [Algerian pre-independence talks with the French] when an  organization named OAS, or the Secret Army Organization, was  formed from French Army personnel and French settlers. Now we  are facing the same [type of] secret organization.    [Qabalan] In your opinion, what is the fate of  Palestinian-Israeli talks in view of repeated Israeli massacres  of the Palestinian people and PLO activists?    ['Arafat] There have been no... [pauses] There are no  negotiations. What is happening is simply this: When they  [Israeli officials] came here, they said: We will give you the  final answer after going back to Rabin. We will convey the  answer during the donors meeting. The donors meeting was held  in Cairo last Thursday [24 March], but nothing happened. They  postponed the answer till today, Tuesday.    [Qabalan] And, today?    ['Arafat] Today, before they gave the answer, the crime took  place, the second massacre took place. Therefore, these are  premeditated acts, no more and no less. I lay the  responsibility at the doorstep of the co-sponsors of the [peace]  conference.    [Qabalan] What, then, is the Israeli delegation doing in  Cairo now?    ['Arafat] This delegation is not a delegation; it is an  individual who will give an answer to us and to the Egyptian  brothers.    [Qabalan] Thank you, President.</p>

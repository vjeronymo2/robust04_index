The denial notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36793). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investigation files show that the workers do not produce an article within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Trade Act and this issue was fully addressed in the Department's negative determination. The workers performed wholesale and retail services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only in very limited instances are service workers certified for TAA, namely, the worker separations must be caused by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling firm whose workers produce an article and whose workers are currently under a certification for TAA. These conditions were not met for the subject workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other considerations which the union makes, i.e., declining net earnings and opening more stores to carry imported food, are moot because the workers do not produce an article and as such are outside the scope of the Trade Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like or directly competitive articles (not services) which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production and employment at the workers' firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, D.C., this 15th day of September 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Victor J.

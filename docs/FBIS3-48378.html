The article notes:    What is most important in abolishing the old international  order and establishing a new fair one is to set up a new  international political order.    What is important here is to make the international  community  democratic and totally reject the policy of strength. To this  end, it is particularly important for all countries to respect  each other's sovereignty.    To force one's idea and system upon others is an undisguised  violation of sovereignty and a wanton interference in internal  affairs. All the countries and nations must never allow such  attempt to maintain the order of domination and subordination.    Today the policy of strength finds its manifestation in the  fact that arms buildup is stepped up behind the screen of  "detente" and "disarmament" and military intervention openly  committed in other countries under the pretext of "settlement of  disputes". Highhanded and arbitrary practices should be stopped  in the international arena and, to this end, it is imperative to  observe the principle of equality, justice and fairness in  dealing with international matters.    In order to abolish the old international order and  establish  a new one, it is necessary to build a new order in the economic  sector.    What is important in establishing a new international  economic order is to reshape the irrational international  financial and monetary system, the unequal trading relations  including non-equivalent exchange and the system of one- sided  international division of labour and rationally settle the  problem of foreign debt so as to create favourable circumstances  for the development and progress of the developing countries.  To this end the North-South dialogue should be realized and  further promoted and developed and, at the same time, the  developed countries should adopt a position to fairly resolve  pending international economic matters on the principle of  mutual benefit and equality.    In order to establish a new international order, all the  countries interested in it should strengthen unity and  cooperation.    It is a consistent stand of the government of our Republic  to  struggle for the abolition of the old international order and  the establishment of a new fair one. The government of the  Republic will as ever wage an active struggle to remove all  manner of unequal relations in the international area and  establish a new fair international order.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Oil groups jump into deep water: A report on the development of new fields Oil companies are keen followers of fashion. As soon as one makes a significant discovery in a promising new area, others pile in. At least that was the hope of the UK government, which earlier this week gave the go-ahead for the development of Foinaven, the UK's first oil field in the deep waters west of the Shetland Islands. British Petroleum has estimated total reserves at Foinaven of 250m-500m barrels of oil, placing it in the upper range of recent North Sea discoveries. But the field is much smaller than the multi-billion barrel fields such as Forties and Brent discovered in the early stages of North Sea exploration. For the UK, however, Foinaven promises to open up a new frontier oil province of perhaps 3.5bn-4bn barrels of oil, placing it in the 'world class' category. It would also be sufficient, according to Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, to extend the UK's status as a major international oil producer well into the next century. But Foinaven's significance extends beyond the UK. It is further evidence that oil companies are increasingly confident that they can find and produce oil in water depths and conditions which just a few years ago would have been judged too risky and beyond their technical competence. 'Five years ago if I told you that we would be producing oil in 3,000 ft of water, as the Brazilians are doing, you'd have said I was nuts,' says Mr Robert Esser, who monitors oil development projects for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Massachusetts-based consultancy. The speed with which deep water developments are taking place is mainly due to technological advances. New seismic techniques enable geologists to 'see' potential fields better. Advanced drilling methods allow wells to have lengthy horizontal sections within the actual reservoir, so more oil can be recovered and fewer wells need to be drilled, a big factor when individual wells can cost Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m (Pounds 9m). BP expects first oil from Foinaven only three and a half years after its discovery, compared with five to 10 years for most projects. Growing deep water experience promises further big gains in efficiency and cost savings. US oil companies have joined together in the Deep Star programme to develop deep water technology. Other savings are being realised through design improvements, such as Shell's floating platform at its new Auger field in 2,860 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico which contains 39,000 tons of steel. Refinements mean that the nearby Mars platform being installed in 2,933 ft of water will contain 8,000 fewer tons of steel. Mars' planned output of 100,000 b/d will be double that Auger, but it will cost Dollars 200m less. Such savings have helped to slash finding and development costs per barrel, which in Foinaven's case is down to Dollars 4-Dollars 5. That makes such developments economically feasible even when crude oil prices are at low levels, such as the current Dollars 15-Dollars 18 a barrel range. Given the prospect that costs for new projects will fall even further, the enthusiasm for deep water projects is likely to grow. Some of the most promising deep water oil regions, such as the west of Shetlands and the Gulf of Mexico, are close to offshore oil provinces that are already producing. Companies have ready and cheap access to shore terminals and undersea pipelines which can often be easily extended to the frontier areas. But could the deep water projects influence world crude oil prices in coming years? Some analysts think they will. They note that apart from the UK and US, many of the most exciting deep water prospects are in Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, Angola and Namibia. With the exception of Nigeria, they are outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and therefore not subject to Opec production quotas. Other analysts note that even relatively small changes in oil output in key countries such as the US or the UK can have a far-reaching effect on prices. This is because of the central price-setting role performed by benchmark crudes such as Brent Blend. The sharp rise in non-Opec production, and particularly North Sea output over the past year has clearly confounded current Opec attempts to boost prices. Mr Mehdi Varzi of London brokers Kleinwort Benson says there is a possibility that oil markets and Opec will continue to underestimate non-Opec production over the next few years. That view is echoed by Mr John Toalster of London brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. 'The North Sea is the current bete noire of Opec,' he says. There is now a possibility that Foinaven and the other fields west of Shetlands could assume that mantle in future.</p>

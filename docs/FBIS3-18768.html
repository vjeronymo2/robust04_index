But they added that progress was slower in another dispute  threatening to block membership for Austria, Finland and Sweden  as well as Norway -- over how their entry would affect the  delicate balance of power in the EU.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he was "cautiously  optimistic" that the EU would reach an accord with Norway later  Tuesday over a Spanish demand for increased access to Norwegian  cod.    He was speaking as the EU ministers were considering a new  Norwegian offer to break the deadlock which has delayed  agreement for Norway to join the 12-nation union along with the  three other applicants on January 1.    Kinkel told journalists: "If we should succeed in getting a  positive solution for Norway, I cannot imagine that the entire  enlargement process will be blocked (by the balance of power  dispute)."    Spain and Portugal are claiming the right to take about  25,000 tonnes of cod a year out of Norwegian waters in return  for accepting Norway into the EU -- a condition which Oslo has  refused.    But a Norwegian diplomat said the EU had been offered a new  and complicated fish catch formula which might satisfy Spain  and "contains almost all the elements of an agreement."

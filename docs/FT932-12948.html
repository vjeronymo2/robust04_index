			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Observer: Clashing shades Meanwhile any supposition of a deep change in Lady Thatcher's philosophy is an exaggeration. However outraged she may be by the plight of Bosnia's Moslems, she was back in classic form during her visit to Warsaw, whose citizens must be feeling peculiarly blessed by the presence of retired British politicians of conservative hue. In town to open her foundation's office as well as Forte's new hotel, the former prime minister drummed home to her audiences that they must never, never succumb to the allure of Marxist and Leninist ideology. All would be well in the world, she boomed, as long as the frontiers of socialism were being turned back. What may lead the local citizenry to feel not just blessed but somewhat confused is that in Thatcher's wake there arrived her ex-deputy Lord Howe of Aberavon, whose views on the matter differed in more ways than being voiced in less strident tones. Besides wondering aloud whether the situation in the erstwhile Soviet Union would not take a turn for the worse, he admitted the west was now less confident about the future than it had been three years ago when the Berlin wall came down. There was another contrast too. President Lech Walesa, for reasons best known to himself, gave Lady Thatcher a wide berth. But Lord Howe - attending the opening of a Centre for English Legal Studies at Warsaw University, financed by the UK Know How Fund - did get to renew acquaintanceships with Solidarity chiefs he met when he was foreign minister and they were opposition leaders on a visit to Warsaw eight years ago.</p>

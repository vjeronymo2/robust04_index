			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading EARLY selling by independent traders coupled with the early weakness in the fixed interest markets caused stock index futures to fall to a post-general election low in a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo. The FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened strongly at 2,592. This proved to be the high of the day as independent traders holding long overnight positions began selling the contract, sending September into retreat. The weakness in gilts, ahead of the gilts auction, also hurt sentiment, but its successful completion was among factors that caused a small rally in the September contract. However, sellers then emerged to send the contract to the day's low of 2,566 early in the afternoon, before the firm opening on Wall Street helped to produce a bounce before the close. September finished at 2,582, down 9 from the previous session but around 17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover reached 7,130 contracts. Volume in the traded options market was again high, totalling 46,028 lots, boosted by yesterday's expiry of the June stock options. The FT-SE option traded 12,152. Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,768 contracts dealt, followed by British Steel on 3,610 lots transacted.</p>

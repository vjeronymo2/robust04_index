			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation of Muslim heads of local councils and  clergymen left for Jordan today. Officially, the purpose of  their visit is to attend the ceremony marking the end of the  renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, but knowledgeable  sources say this is yet another attempt to court Israel's Arabs.  Our correspondent Yo'el Dar has more details:    For many years, all Arab countries ignored their brethren  living in Israel, especially the Muslims. Israel's Arabs were  barred from visiting the Arab countries, making the pilgrimage  to Mecca, and studying at Cairo's al-Azhar University. The Arab  League, too, refused to recognize Israel's Arabs and treated  them as agents and collaborators of the Zionists and the State  of Israel.    Recently, however, earnest efforts have been made to court  representatives of the Israeli Arab community. The PLO-Tunis  embraced its secular circles, particularly HADASH [Democratic  Front for Peace and Equality]; Egypt found its way to the heart  of heads of local councils and activists in Darawshah's party;  while Jordan and Saudi Arabia took clergymen and conservative  circles under their wings.    A large group of heads of local councils and qadis left for  Jordan today. The official purpose of their visit is to attend  the celebrations marking the end of the renovation of al-Aqsa  Mosque in Jerusalem. However, a look at the composition of the  delegation shows that its members were not chosen at random and  that the fact that it headed by a representative of the Islamic  Movement is no mere coincidence.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Sir Humphreys chafe at 'disarray' FOR Whitehall's senior mandarins, the current disarray in the government means frustration and inactivity - and it is something they don't like. This may seem strange to devotees of the BBC-TV series Yes Minister, in which Sir Humphrey Appleby, the permanent secretary in charge of the mythical Department of Administrative Affairs, perennially runs rings round his minister, Jim Hacker. The wily Sir Humphrey would undoubtedly use the current crisis to seize control of the reins and get on with running the department. But the reality is rather different. 'Officials are most effective when they get clear and confident decisions from ministers,' says one high-flying civil servant at grade 3 (under-secretary) level. 'This sort of disarray is never pleasant because it becomes very difficult to get ministers to make decisions.' The hiatus can be dispiriting for civil servants involved in policy-making, says a deputy secretary at the top of a large spending department. 'They may have spent months working up policy options only to see them shelved because of loss of political nerve.' Such indecision may be even more damaging in economic policy-making, where the need for radical solutions to the burgeoning public spending bill are urgently needed. And an uncertain parliamentary majority makes ministers less willing to stand behind their decisions, according to a senior civil servant managing a high-profile public service. 'When their backbenchers raise objections to the consequences of policy decisions, they look for ways of meeting the objections.' 'We are already seeing a revisiting of decisions,' says another who has had to cope with a change of minister. 'People often forget that a reshuffle can be at least as disruptive as a change of government. With a new government, we generally know what the policy will be - that isn't always clear with a new minister from the same party.' There is hope in the Treasury, however, that the long-expected reshuffle may improve the relationship between No 10 and No 11 Downing Street, so necessary for smooth running of the government machine. 'The connecting door between the two seems to have been little used in recent months,' says one close observer. 'It had begun to feel like the Thatcher/Lawson days when the prime minister and the chancellor communicated by public announcement.' There is general satisfaction in Whitehall at the way Mr Lamont used his resignation statement to exonerate officials from blame for policy failures. By firmly pinning responsibility on the politicians, Mr Lamont dealt a blow to those on the right who have been seeking to attribute recent policy disasters to civil servants.</p>

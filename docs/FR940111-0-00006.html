The Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee) met July 15, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action. This rule is expected to help the Texas citrus industry successfully market the 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit crop.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  February 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Charles L.

This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 15 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas, and about 750 producers of oranges and grapefruit in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee, which administers the order locally, meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations, information submitted by the committee and other information, to determine whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulation is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule was issued on October 18, 1993, with an effective date of October 25, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 54925, October 25, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 24, 1993, and no comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4) of &sect;906.365 by temporarily relaxing the minimum size requirement to permit shipment of grapefruit measuring at least 35/16 inches in diameter (pack size 112) for the entire 1993&hyph;94 season ending July 31, 1994, provided such grapefruit grade at least U.S. No. 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This relaxation is expected to help the Texas citrus industry successfully market its 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit crop and have a positive effect on producer returns. Permitting shipment of pack size 112 grapefruit grading at least U.S. No. 1 for the entire 1993&hyph;94 season will enable Texas grapefruit handlers to meet market needs and compete with similar sized grapefruit expected to be shipped from Florida. This action is based on the current and prospective crop and market conditions for Texas grapefruit. Fresh Texas grapefruit shipments began in mid-September this season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: Cheeky The Ottoman Sultans must be whirling in their graves. Seventy years after the end of the Turkish Empire, it seems that American pop singer Michael Jackson is scheming to assume their long vacant, 400-year-old throne in the Topkap Palace. Worse still for the imperial dignity, if Jackson sits down as planned on the seat of Suleyman the Magnificent and Selim the Sot on Saturday, he will be brandishing a profane Pepsi-Cola bottle. The Turkish public is still mulling over the idea which, needless to say, was dreamed up by a pr company as part of Jackson's concert tour of Turkey. Officialdom, in particular, is believed to be sharply split in its attitudes. On the one hand are those taking a dim view of the whole thing. On the other are those who think that a film clip of Jackson on the Ottoman throne amid dancers and sax players, would be an unmissable opportunity to introduce Turkey's culture to the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: What's in a name? I am the sole director and majority shareholder of United Chemicals Ltd, which is now dormant. There are no debts except to myself (director's loan account). The company has a tax loss of Pounds 12,000. Does the company have a sale value in respect of the tax loss and the name? Since the disappearance of the Business Names Registry, Companies House in Cardiff (tel: 0222-380 801) issues a free booklet giving details of the procedure for registering company names. There could well be a value in the name of United Chemicals Ltd but the market place will determine that. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

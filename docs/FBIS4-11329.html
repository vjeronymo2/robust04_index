			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Today, the Cuban-Mexican  Business Committee concluded four working days of advanced  negotiations in many areas, particularly textiles, perfumes,  cosmetics, and the food and marble industries.    This afternoon, Emilio Carrero and Marcos Dorantes, heads of  the Cuban and Mexican delegations respectively, signed a joint  communique on the understandings reached during the talks.    The delegation of businessmen was made up of representatives  from 40 Mexican companies, of which the most important include  the Mac'ma Group, a leading manufacturer of cookies and pastas;  Del Valle fruit juices, a major company in this sector of the  food industry; Bancomer; Xacur Group; Mexicana de Aviacion  Airlines; Doal Paints; and International Business de Mexico.    Carlos Tello Macias, Mexican ambassador to Cuba, and  Porfirio  Mederos, vice president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce,  expressed their satisfaction with the progress made during the  meetings, and stressed their mutual interest in increasing trade  between the two nations.    PRENSA LATINA interviewed some participants who expressed  their interest in being represented not only as suppliers to the  Cuban tourist sector, but also as prospective partners in joint  production projects in areas like textiles and the production of  juices, cookies, and pastas for local and foreign consumers.    According to a joint communique signed today, the meeting  focused on topics such as NAFTA (Mexico-United States-Canada)  and its effects on bilateral relations and new business  opportunities in Cuba and its legislation.    The document mentions industries dealing with metal working,  food, livestock, health, construction materials, and light and  basic industry as good business opportunities. Topics such as  maritime transportation, Cuban customs regulations, tariffs, and  transactions delays were also discussed. A total of 100  bilateral meetings were held.    According to the communique, progress was made regarding  Cuban export operations of marble, medicines, cellulose and  resins, steel, and papaya seeds. Meanwhile, the Mexican  delegation expressed their interest in working in areas such as  tourism, perfumes and cosmetics, and textiles. According to  Mexican sources, Mexican-Cuban trade amounts to $131 million  annually, of which, however, Cuba is at a disadvantage by $117  million.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Visions of Europe: A pressing case for protection Hamstrung in its actions in the former Yugoslavia, enfeebled by the rising tide of unemployment, Europe is suffering a breakdown. The temptation for national go-it-alone solutions is sweeping all before it. Maastricht has become synonymous with defeat. We have lurched from Euroscepticism to Europessimism. Eurocollapse stares us in the face. This depression could wash away our sole barrier against decline. To stand firm, the Community needs a new strategy suited to a new era. We need a common defence against the apathy and stagnation all around. We must sound the bell of alarm. Menace is on the march. The danger is no longer military, orchestrated by the Kremlin. Instead, it is insidious, economic in nature, and on a world scale. Faced with the task of seeking salvation, the 12 need to find a new method of defending themselves - the jobs, living standards and social systems in which we take pride. We need a 'New Deal' for Europe. We are not, thank God, starting from nothing. The single European market forged by the zealous bureaucratic machine of Brussels has taken 36 years to get off the ground. Decisions are made at a distance from the electorate, and the functionaries of the European Commission have felt the people's anger. But at last the Common Market really exists. The Maastricht treaty, though caught in the doldrums, is still afloat. The Danes have swallowed their previous rejection; John Major hopes British ratification is in the bag. Would-be members are jostling at the gates. The fever of nationalism has run high, yet the Maastricht treaty - tattered, vilified, ill-loved - has survived. The 12 have always advanced in crab fashion; now is not the time to bury ourselves in the sand. The ragged army of Europe will not again march in step unless it finds fresh objectives. To do this, I suggest we abandon the absolutism of free trade. This was the doctrine established in our most glorious period of economic growth, when the coolies of Asia were restricted to pulling rickshaws. These times have passed; the coolies now sit at computer screens. I must make one point clear. I do not want to turn our backs on competition and free trade. I want simply to limit our continent's vulnerability. Protectionism on a national level is evidently condemned to end in catastrophe. By contrast, a Europe-wide system of economic defence would have every chance of success. A common market with 350m inhabitants is large enough to guarantee competition and innovation at its heart. We can all see the drawbacks of globalisation of commerce. It brutally concentrates the production of rich countries in the least labour intensive industries. It ruins employment. And it destroys small and medium-sized businesses, submerged by countries which offer their workforces no social protection and pay them wages 20 or 30 times lower than our levels. There is an inexorable move to whittle down all the advantages enjoyed by developed countries - high wages, social protection, reasonable working hours. The tendency is exacerbated by rapid growth of under-employed populations in the third world. My conclusion is, therefore, that the 12 extend to other sectors the system of Community preference already in place in agriculture. If the effectiveness of tariff measures is threatened by exchange rate manipulations, we should not fear to bring in quotas on a selective and temporary basis, following the line of Japan and the US. This does not correspond to the vision of the British. But, as far as Europe is concerned, Britain does not lead - it follows. France and Germany, putting all complexes aside, should continue to show the way - as a means of saving Europe, and of saving themselves.

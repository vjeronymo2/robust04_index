			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rebel blamed for sharp downturn at Etonbrook ETONBROOK, the property developer, has blamed a sharp fall in pre-tax profits on the costs incurred fighting a rebel bid for a 30 per cent stake in the company. After exceptional charges of Pounds 120,000, the former BES company announced a profit of Pounds 74,000 in the six months to the end of September 1992, compared with Pounds 300,000 in 1991. Profits were further undermined by rental income lost on an east London warehouse which the company sold. Rental income fell from Pounds 317,000 to Pounds 191,000. Mr Keith Moss, managing director, said the results would have been healthier if the company had not faced attempts by rebel shareholder Mr Andrew Perloff to increase his 19.13 per cent stake. Mr Perloff blamed the decline on poor management and questioned a Pounds 6,000 increase in administrative expenses to Pounds 103,000. The company has consistently urged shareholders to reject Mr Perloff's overtures, which include a 13.4 per cent tender offer and calls for board changes. He failed to win a seat on the board at an extraordinary meeting last August, but was successful in thwarting plans to repay Pounds 1.19m in preference shares. 'The costs of the EGM and fighting Mr Perloff has meant everyone has lost out and shareholders will not get a dividend,' Mr Moss said. The share price fell 3p yesterday to close at 73p.</p>

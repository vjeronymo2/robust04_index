			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["China Focus" column by Eugene Yang, managing director of </F> Standard Chartered Securities: "Amendments Will Ease Concerns  Over New Tax"]    [Text] According to a senior official from the Chinese Tax  Bureau, details of the controversial capital gains tax on  property will be off1cially announced in the near future. The  capital gains tax was first introduced in the middle of December  last year as a part of China's tax reform package and was  expected to become effective on January 1. However, it met with  strong opposition from both local and Hong Kong property  developers as the new tax will substantially erode profitability  on property developments. After a few months of lobbying from  Hong Kong developers, the State Council is believed to have made  the following improvements to the original proposal:    -- Projects signed before January 1 with 20 per cent of  total  investments already put in will be exempted from the capital  gains tax.    -- All projects (commercial or residential) with less than  20  per cent appreciation in value will be exempted. To encourage  the construction of low-cost residential units for domestic end  users, low-cost mass residential projects which appreciate in  value by less than 40 per cent will also be exempted.    -- Sales of existing residential property and the  acquisition  of new property for the purpose of upgrading accommodation  conditions will be exempted or entitled to a refund.    The above amendments to the initial capital gains tax should  ease concerns about the erosion of profits for major property  counters in the mainland market. In addition, companies that  have postponed the completion of their property projects while  waiting for the official announcement of the new tax law will  speed up the completion of these projects.    Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Real Estate, a major  developer  of commercial and residential property in prime locations in  Shenzhen, is trading at 7.6 times 1994 earnings and is at a 40  per cent discount to its net asset value. Gintian, a  conglomerate with substantial property interests, is trading at  an extremely attractive 4.1 forward price-earnings ratio, while  Vanke, which focuses on construction of low-cost mass  residential property, is only trading on a prospective earnings  multiple of 8.4.</p>

Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said afterward that they discussed several  important issues, including the Middle East peace process, the  Libyan-Western problem, Bosnia, and the Euro-Arab dialogue. He  added that they exchanged views on promoting ties between France  and Arab countries and discussed cooperation among the  Mediterranean basin countries in light of France's relations  with European and Arab countries and with the Mediterranean  countries in general.    He said he explained the Arab view on the Lockerbie issue  and  expressed his appreciation of Egyptian and Tunisian efforts in  this regard. He called for not escalating the situation and for  treating Libya in a manner that will preserve its rights.    On Middle East peace, he said they discussed France's  support  for the peace process. The French side, he added, asserted its  concern that the timetable agreed by the Israeli and Palestinian  sides should be respected and that peace should be comprehensive  and just.    As for Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said he and the French  minister exchanged views on it. He affirmed that the Arab  League wants to ensure Iraq's unity and territorial integrity  and the need for Iraq to respect Security Council resolutions  and Kuwait's sovereignty as an independent state.    Asked about the crisis in Yemen, the Arab League secretary  general said: We are in touch with the brothers in Yemen and  the dialogue committee will pursue its task. He noted all the  Yemeni parties' interest in unity as a primary principle and in  finding a solution within the general framework of the agreement  between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim  al-Bid. He said he would not hesitate if he were given the  chance to go to Yemen to participate in the reconciliation  efforts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev under general </F> headline: "Russia And Ukraine Have Divided the Ships. Now They  Are Only Left To Decide on How To Position Them"]    [Text] On Wednesday Boris Oleynik, chief of the Ukrainian  parliamentary delegation at the negotiations with the Crimean  Supreme Council delegation, at a news conference voiced his  satisfaction with the results of the meeting with delegates from  the peninsula. As is known, a decision was made to recommend to  the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils that they set up a  joint working group. The Ukrainian delegation asked the Crimean  Supreme Council within three days to consider the question of  suspending the legislative acts adopted on 20 May for the entire  period that the joint working group will be in session.    Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council,  stated that Crimea has no intention of seceding from Ukraine:  "This can be suggested only by those who are not familiar with  the content of Crimean laws." True, he failed to respond to the  question about how his words correlate with the program  provision of the Crimean Republican Party, of which he is a  member, about the peninsula's joining Russia.</p>

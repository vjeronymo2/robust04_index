			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: JVC suspends paying dividend as sales slip VICTOR COMPANY of Japan (JVC), the consumer electronics company specialising in audio and video equipment, yesterday reported a Y13.5bn (Dollars 109m) parent company pre-tax loss in the half year to September and suspended its interim dividend pay-ment. JVC, which holds rights to the industry standard VHS video format, has been especially hard hit because of its excessive dependence on video equipment, which last year accounted for nearly half of all sales. This year, sales of video equipment have been hurt by the weakness of consumer spending as well as a natural slowdown in sales as the market matures. JVC, however, has failed to respond to the changing market by diversifying product lines. JVC's total sales fell by 20 per cent to Y273.5bn, while receipts from video equipment alone were down by 31 per cent to Y105.4bn. While JVC has more or less kept pace with its competitors in the domestic market, it has been badly mauled overseas. Export sales were down by 30 per cent to Y132.8bn, mainly because of poor sales in Europe. Only part of the decline can be explained by currency fluctuations. JVC is not expecting improvement in the second half of the year. The company believes it will lose Y21bn pre-tax, and expects to pay no dividend. On a consolidated basis, the pre-tax profits forecast has been lowered from Y3bn to a loss of Y28bn. The parent company net loss for the interim period came to Y15.9bn.</p>

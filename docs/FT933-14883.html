			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Observer: Team effort Meanwhile, even if the New York Post is bound for the breakers, perhaps Murdoch could at least prevent the Big Apple's favourite baseball club from transferring its flag to another city. That is the fate being threatened for the New York Yankees by their tempestuous owner George Steinbrenner. And though he has mouthed menaces before, this time he seems deadly serious. The Yankees' successes haven't stopped attendances from falling by more than a third these past five years, which Steinbrenner blames partly on the rundown stadium, nicknamed the Bronx zoo after its site in one of the poorest districts around. Put bluntly, his ultimatum is that either New York helps to rebuild the stadium, or the team will leave for financially friendlier climes. Understandably, being desperate to revive the impoverished South Bronx, New York's governor Mario Cuomo wants the Yankees to stay put. But if Steinbrenner insists on moving when his lease expires, then Cuomo would like to set up the club up on a 30-acre site west of midtown Manhattan. In which case, it is hoped, Murdoch might be tempted to finance the building of a new home for the Yankees as part of a huge new entertainment complex. After all, while the plan sounds mightily expensive, it is of a scale to match his far from under-developed ego, not to mention those of Cuomo and Steinbrenner to boot. The three of them have already had a preliminary discussion, Observer hears.</p>

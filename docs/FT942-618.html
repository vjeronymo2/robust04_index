			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: US executives in Tatra boardroom battle A boardroom battle at Tatra, the Czech truck maker, could come to a head today at a shareholders' meeting at which three US executives are expected to come under fire. The executives, who were offered 15 per cent in the truck maker last year in return for help in bringing Tatra back to profit, face criticism about their management style and commitment to the company by some of its Czech directors. Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-president of Chrysler, the US carmaker, and two former executives of International Harvester, Mr David Shelby and Mr Jack Rutherford, were hired by the Czech government amid considerable fanfare early last year to implement a rescue package at the company, which has seen its workforce cut from 16,000 to 12,000. Some of the Czech management expressed doubts about the US executives' commitment to Tatra, and accused the three of absenteeism and 'management by fax', a charge they reject. Analysts in Prague said the men were likely to get the continued backing of Tatra's shareholders and that the company had little option but to continue restructuring. Since their arrival in May last year stocks have been cut and Tatra has been able to raise short-term capital after restructuring its debt, estimated at Kcs3.7bn (Dollars 132m). Tatra lost Kcs439m in 1992 and a further Kcs947m in the first nine months last year, compared with a profit of Kcs729m in 1991. The administrator of Banka Bohemia, the Czech bank closed by the banking authorities after issuing Dollars 600m of fraudulent prime bank guarantees, said last night 'a majority' of the securities had been recovered. Mr Miloslav Dudek, the administrator appointed by the Czech National Bank, said the Swiss authorities still had not located a block of the guarantees with a face value of Dollars 25m. Banka Bohemia issued the guarantees in March but the US Securities and Exchange Commission warned that investors who bought them might not be able to recover their money. The CNB was forced to close Banka Bohemia in April after panic-stricken depositors began withdrawing funds, creating a liquidity crisis. A senior official of the bank is being sought by Interpol.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL WANTS VALLEY TO GET NEXT RAIL  LINE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to request that the  San Fernando Valley get priority over two competing areas -- in Pasadena and  the Los Angeles International Airport vicinity -- for construction of the next  mass transit rail line.  </P> <P> However, the 12-3 vote may have little impact because the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission appears bent on approving a plan by its staff under  which the Valley line -- an extension to Van Nuys of the downtown-to-North  Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- would be built after the other two.  </P> <P> The first to be constructed under the staff's plan would be a 2.5-mile spur  from the western terminus of the Century Freeway light-rail line to LAX, and  the second would be a 13.5-mile light-rail line from downtown to Pasadena.  </P> <P> The plan assumes that California voters on June 5 will approve ballot  propositions to pay for mass transit.  </P></p>

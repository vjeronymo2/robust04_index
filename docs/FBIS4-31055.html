			<p>BFN     [Text] Instead of the announced peace negotiations in  Geneva, unofficial talks were held this afternoon between  Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serbian Republic, and Yasushi  Akashi, envoy to the UN secretary general. Let us listen to  Dragan Bozanic reporting from Geneva:    [Begin Bozanic recording] The result of the two-hour  unofficial meeting between Yasushi Akashi and his closest  military associates, Generals de Lapresle and Rose, with Radovan  Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, Vice President  Nikola Koljevic, and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha could solve  the dilemma over whether the negotiations on the cessation of  hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina will resume or not.    After the Serbian delegation and the Croatian one, headed by  Kresimir Zubak, had already arrived here in Geneva, the Muslims  said they would not attend the talks until the Gorazde 3-km  exclusion zone was allegedly entirely respected.    After the UN forces in Gorazde investigate these claims this  evening, it will be known whether the meeting on the cessation  of hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is to be held at  all. However, we have learned from unofficial sources in the  Palais des Nations that the problem of withdrawing a small  number of armed Serbian civilians from three villages near  Gorazde can be successfully solved and that the representatives  of all three warring sides will, after all, sit at the  negotiating table tomorrow. This would mean that the  international mediators' plans could be fulfilled: Making all  three armies, above all the Muslim one, accept the cessation of  hostilities; then one could also resume the consultations on a  general solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina in  the French town of Talloires near Geneva, most probably on 6  June.

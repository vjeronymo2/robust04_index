			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Technology: Mix and match for PC users - The growth of component software Nearly 50 years after the tin can was invented someone came up with the idea of a can opener. By that timescale, it has taken the personal computer industry a comparatively short 10 years to work out how to unlock software applications so that they become easier to use and integrate. Several leading US software companies are developing technology that will allow software applications such as word processors or graphics packages to be broken up into smaller software 'components' that users can recombine in different ways, according to their needs. Proponents of component software say this will make working on a PC easier and more efficient because users will no longer be saddled with large, complex applications with superfluous features. Instead of having to switch between a word processor, a spreadsheet and a graphics program to create a report with text, charts and illustrations, the PC user will be able to combine features of all three programs to create a set of software tools specifically designed for the job. However, the development of component software largely depends on establishing standards that define how software components work together. This could lead to yet another battle over software standards in the computer industry. Already, there are two competing approaches to component software. The first, led by Microsoft, is called Object Linking and Embedding. OLE is a set of programming standards that enable features of one program to be incorporated in other programs. Microsoft's dominant role in the software industry has given OLE broad support from other software developers. An alternative approach, called OpenDoc, is favoured by a consortium led by Apple Computer, IBM and WordPerfect. Other members include Novell, Sun Microsystems, Xerox and Taligent, the systems software joint venture funded by IBM, Apple and Hewlett-Packard. The consortium claims its technology will be easier to use and require less computing horsepower. OpenDoc is also promising software that will work on a variety of computer systems, whereas Microsoft's OLE is currently geared to the company's Windows PC operating system. While OLE is already available, however, the OpenDoc group will not complete the first versions of its software until the end of the year. A San Francisco-based organisation set up by the founding members of OpenDoc, called Component Integration Laboratories, will publish the specifications so that other software developers and corporate users will be able to design their own components. The OpenDoc consortium claims wide support but few applications developers have so far publicly endorsed OpenDoc. WordPerfect, which Novell is acquiring, is the only member of the OpenDoc consortium that is primarily an applications vendor. Moreover, the critical test of component software will be whether PC users embrace the concept. Whether it will be cheaper, or more expensive, to buy software in the form of mix-and-match components has yet to be seen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The Russian side assesses the round of talks on the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet held in Kiev on Wednesday,  Thursday and Friday as "undoubtedly positive", the chief Russian  negotiator, Yuriy Dubinin, told Interfax on Friday.    According to him, the agreements and understandings reached  at the Russian-Ukrainian summit held on April 15 and at the  subsequent talks between the two countries' premiers on April  23-25 were developed in the course of the Kiev round. "Our task  was to ensure practical implementation for the draft agreement  on the first phase of the efforts to resolve the Black Sea Fleet  problem. We succeeded in opening many brackets in this area.  The present round ensured a step forward on the road toward  resolving these problems," Dubinin noted.    The talks will be continued on Russian soil, he said. "The  Ukrainian delegation has been invited accordingly. A concrete  date for the next round will be fixed in the near future through  diplomatic channels," Interfax's interviewee pointed out.    Pleading an agreement reached with the Ukrainian side,  Dubinin refrained from revealing the essence of issues agreed  upon in Kiev.</p>

Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Notwithstanding the provisions of &sect;22.949(a)(2), mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random selection process, following which the selected application may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase II.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market.

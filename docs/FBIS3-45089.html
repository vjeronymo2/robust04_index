Those at the  meeting heard briefings on construction preparations and on the  resettlement of residents in the affected areas, and discussed  matters concerning the project.    Premier Li Peng, who had just returned to Beijing from an  inspection tour of the Three Gorges project, presided over the  meeting.    Lu Youmei, general manager of the China Changjiang Three  Gorges Project Development Corporation, briefed the attendees on  the progress of preparations made for the construction of the  project. According to the briefing, since the Three Gorges  Project Construction Committee under the State Council approved  the initial design of the project last July, preparations have  been made for the construction of the project rather smoothly.  Several objectives set at the beginning of the year were  basically achieved. The year 1994 will be a year during which  preparatory work for the construction of the projects will be  done in an all-round way although the tasks will be very  arduous. For this reason, all relevant departments should make  concerted efforts to fulfill the annual plans in order to make  full preparations for the construction of the project.    With the approval of the State Council, the Three Gorges  Project Construction Committee will call a meeting on the  resettlement of residents in the affected areas within the next  few days to solve major problems in this regard. The meeting  will also be aimed at mobilizing people's governments at various  levels and large numbers of cadres and people in the areas along  the planned reservoir to carry forward the spirit of  self-reliance and hard struggle, and at mobilizing people in  various parts of the country and departments of the State  Council to support the resettlement of residents in the areas  affected by the Three Gorges project, and to promote economic  development in the areas along the Three Gorges. Tang Zhangjin,  director of the Resettlement and Development Bureau of the Three  Gorges Project Construction Committee under the State Council,  gave a special briefing on preparations made for the forthcoming  meeting.    While speaking at the meeting, leading comrades from Hubei  and Sichuan provinces and from relevant departments of the State  Council said that efforts should be made to do a good job in  resettling residents of the affected areas and to support the  construction of the Three Gorges project.    After hearing speeches by attendees, Premier Li Peng said:  Organized by the Changjiang Three Gorges Project Development  Corporation and through the concerted efforts of workers,  tremendous progress has been made over the past year in  preparing for the construction of the Three Gorges project. He  once again stressed: The Three Gorges project will be a  trans-century project, and its construction will have great  significance for our country's economy -- it will benefit people  not only of the present age but of centuries from now. Relevant  localities and departments must work together, support one  another, and, with a strong sense of responsibility to the  people, successfully carry out this great project which will  benefit future generations.    In his speech, Li Peng also emphasized that ministries and  commissions of the State Council should set an example in  supporting the project and take practical action in supporting  construction in the areas along the Three Gorges.    On the resettlement of residents of the affected areas, Li  Peng pointed out: The success or failure of the Three Gorges  project depends on the resettlement of residents of the affected  areas, and the key to doing a good job in this regard lies in  leaders at various levels. It is imperative to uphold the  principle of resettlement and development. Residents in the  affected areas should be resettled according to the "Regulations  Governing the Resettlement of People Due to the Construction of  the Three Gorges Projects on Chang Jiang" and the special  characteristics of the resettlement areas. In the excellent  situation of reform and opening up, and with the support of  people across the country, we must do a good job in resettling  those people.    Other speakers at the meeting included Zou Jiahua, vice  premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice chairman  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference and adviser to the State Council's Three  Gorges Project Construction Committee, who expressed their views  on matters concerning the construction of the project.</p>

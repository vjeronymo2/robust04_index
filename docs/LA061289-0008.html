			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Concord man was run over and killed on Interstate 80 just after being kicked  off a bus for rowdy behavior and left in the custody of two Roseville police  officers, police said. Police Chief Gregory Cowart said that an investigation  is being conducted to determine why the officers let Ronald Shuster, 34, walk  away from the shoulder of the busy freeway. Shuster, paroled from state prison  in Susanville on Thursday, was reportedly on his way to Concord when he  reportedly walked onto the freeway traffic lanes and was struck by two  vehicles. Cowart said he needs to find out why Shuster was not driven to a  safer location and police are also seeking the driver of a pickup truck that  hit Shuster and left the scene.  </P></p>

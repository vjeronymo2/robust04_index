			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / China and Taiwan membership drive tests Gatt loyalties A GAME of Chinese chequers is being played out at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) over the membership of China and Taiwan. Negotiations on China's 1986 request to rejoin the 103-member world trade body, stalled for more than two years, finally started to move again last week when a Gatt working party began discussing a draft protocol of accession. The talks were suspended in mid-1989 after Beijing's suppression of the pro-democracy movement and a slowdown in economic reform. The US and EC want further clarification of China's present and future trade regime before they are prepared to begin drafting membership terms - China is to answer written questions within the next few weeks. But Beijing's renewed push for Gatt entry has been supported by developing countries such as India and Mexico. Trade officials in Geneva see a link between these developments and Taiwan's membership bid. Taiwan applied to join in January 1990 as a 'separate customs territory' - the same formula used for Hong Kong and Macao, which are already Gatt members. Beijing has dropped its outright opposition to Taiwanese membership but insists the island cannot join before China does. Washington, which is lobbying for Taipei's Gatt application to be admitted, says there can be no link between the two sets of negotiations. Taiwan's candidacy is supported by Gatt's industrialised members. But developing nations have been reluctant to give their backing without Beijing's sanction. The most likely outcome of behind-the-scenes discussions now under way in Gatt is an understanding with Beijing that, while there can be no formal linkage, negotiations on Chinese membership will be intensified. If all goes according to plan, Gatt's governing council will decide next month to establish a working party on Taiwan's membership application. Since Taiwan is a market economy that has already taken steps to liberalise trade, drafting its accession protocol could in theory be completed within a year. This scarcely looks feasible for China, which will need special rules written into its terms of entry to take account of its planned economy. The next meeting of the China working party is likely to be held this spring.</p>

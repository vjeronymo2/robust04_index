			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Music at the Almeida NOW that the greatly loved Almeida Festival has become an Almeida (new) Opera season, non-operatic music is a receding factor: not abandoned, but distinctly marginalised. Three concerts on Sunday, however, made their marks, some of them black. First there was the Argentinian pianist Alma Petchersky, billed to play the complete Goyescas of Granados - with its bright pendant 'El Pelele', which the composer wanted always to be included even if other movements were dropped. As we learned upon arriving at the Almeida, Miss Petchersky had decided to omit it, and the big opening 'Requiebros' and the Fandango; in fact she offered a bit more than half of the music, just four movements for patrons who had paid Pounds 6 or Pounds 8 to hear the whole cycle. I thought that rather disgraceful, but I judged prematurely. In the event, it was so dispiriting to hear her pick her way through the chosen movements - slowly and carefully, eyes glued to the score - that it would have been quite dreadful if she had played them all. For that relief, much thanks. By sight-reading standards she was neither unmusical nor especially inaccurate; but these appealing, diffuse, self-quoting pieces need a flair, a variety of touch and an instinctive long breath which are unavailable to a pianist who is still learning the notes. That recital, billed absurdly as 'Goyescas I', was followed by a 'Goyescas II' from a more efficient pianist, a young Belgian who likes to be known as 'Luk''. His grab-bag programme consisted of old Krenek's Sonata no. 7 (defiantly academic-'serial', but quite lucid and mellow), pieces by the Almeida opera-composers Nils Vigeland and Nigel Osborne (essentially neo-romantic), and curious stuff by three composers of whom the programme-book told us nothing except that one Spaniard was the pupil of the other. Emiliano del Cerro's Imagen Contrapuesta was skeletal, rebarbative and silly, and his teacher Luis de Pablo's Retratos y Transcripciones echoed well-tried experiments from 20 years back. The excuse for the recital-title came from a new Goyescas by the Flemish Boudewijn Buckinx: 13 vignettes after Goya, almost innocent of compositional technique but fluently pianistic, and often poignant in their backward-looking, tonally disjointed way. Later, the Almeida Cello Ensemble offered more grown-up stuff. If the rock-oriented Ostinato by Ferrero and Takayuki Rai's slick Recursive Figuration sounded like professional exercises, Henze's lovely 1962 cantata Being Beauteous and Rupert Bawden's new Morike Lieder made bigger waves. Both of those enlisted Skaila Kanga's high-definition harp and Sarah Leonard's beautifully assured soprano, to irresistible effect: the first work conducted by David Parry, the other by its composer. Bawden's idiom here manages somehow to combine the ripe musical language of Berg's Lyric Suite with the unmistakable tone of pre-war English pastoral. It bypasses Britten (who nearly went to Vienna for lessons with Berg, and was thwarted at the last moment), but its harmonic diction remembers the Vaughan Williams of Wenlock Edge and the 'Tallis' Fantasia, and therefore Brahms. I predict a late, self-critical maturity for Bawden which should generate serious rewards. Almeida Opera until July 19. Goyescas I &amp; II was sponsored by The Elephant Trust</p>

Young people's social-conflict potential  and the basic spheres of conflict development    It shouldn't be necessary these days to argue how urgent the  problem of social conflicts is. You don't need to be a sociology  expert; all you have to do is live in this society to sense a  growing mass dissatisfaction, irritation and fatigue, an erosion  of values and loss of faith in the future. For at least a year  we have felt a foreboding of social disasters and catastrophes,  which makes it essential to study and forecast the development  of conflicts in society.    Of course, our research (the Scientific-Research Institute  of  Youth Problems Sociology Laboratory, in a representative  republic-wide sample, surveyed 1,475 respondents age 15 to 29 in  10 regions of Ukraine) cannot pretend to solve all the problems  of social conflicts, especially considering the almost complete  lack of conflictological traditions in the old Soviet  sociological literature. The authors' goal was not just to  analyze the conflict potential of young people, who are the most  active social group, and explore the basic spheres of future  conflict, but also to ascertain the extent to which the  conflicts that are typical of our society are similar to or  different from those of civilized democratic societies. This is  important in establishing our own national conflictological  theory.    Our society's crisis is reflected in young people's  dissatisfaction with nearly everything--their status in society,  material security, and life in general; these are reliable  indicators of social conflict. Some young people have adjusted  to the situation, but they are not very numerous. Only 27.3  percent are happy with their living conditions, 24.3 percent are  happy with the food situation, 13.2 percent are happy with  available clothing, 15.9 percent are happy with working  conditions, 12.5 percent are happy with recreation facilities,  9.8 percent are happy with medical services, 5.8 percent are  happy about the ecology, and 12.3 percent are happy about their  security. Only 9.8 percent are happy overall with living  conditions, while almost half--44.5 percent--are unhappy (the  remainder didn't have an unequivocal answer).    Another serious indicator of society's conflict potential is  the public's subjective "foreboding" of conflicts. One third of  our young respondents thought them possible in the near future,  another 12.5 percent think social disturbances could erupt in  Ukraine in a year, 13 percent think it could happen in two or  three years, 17.1 percent relegate that prospect to the far  future, and only 22.2 percent maintain that in principle it is  impossible here. Hence, there is a definite syndrome of  expectation of conflict in society.    Analyzing the concerns of today's youth and the problems  that  worry them most in the present crisis [Table 1], we conclude  that the main sphere of potential conflicts will be the economy,  the sphere of material concerns.    Problems of human rights, also the ecology, are quite  important. The "forcible Ukrainianization" that has been used  here and there to scare people, especially in traditionally  Russian-speaking areas, does not especially worry young people,  any more than a return to the communist past, which is obviously  unrealistic.    2. Subjects of conflicts and youth's readiness to take  part in protests    Who is the "face of the enemy," who personifies the main  cause of our troubles, and how strongly is it imprinted in the  mass consciousness? The mass media seem to have done everything  they can to shape that image. At first, right after the collapse  of the Soviet Union, it was the party apparatchik; then, after  the restoration of the Ukrainian state, it was the Russian (or  disguised local) chauvinist; now the national radicals are named  most often.    It is a rather specific factor that prompts the search for  "the enemy"--namely, the level of material security. It is those  who belong to the lowest level of prosperity and have limited  food who tend to blame certain social forces, in particular  those of a nationalist bent. National radicals are seen as the  enemy by 14.9 percent of those who have limited food and 14.9  percent of those who barely make it from payday to payday, but  only 4.7 percent of those who can afford anything they want.  Great-power chauvinists are blamed by 15.7 percent of persons in  the lowest material stratum but only by 6.3 percent of those in  the highest. Incompetent careerists in the government are blamed  by 37.2 percent in the lowest group and by 26.6 percent in the  highest. This is natural, because those who have adjusted to the  present difficult economic situation and have pulled themselves  up by their bootstraps tend more to rely on themselves, their  own efforts, and pay less attention those who are in power or  striving for it.    Still, representatives of all social, professional, and  property groups think that the main cause of potential conflicts  is not the schemes of enemies but difficult living conditions,  which are also the main cause of social tensions.    Young people's social dissatisfaction is reflected directly  in their assessment of all links of state  authority--legislative, executive, and judicial. The performance  of the presidential branch is assessed somewhat more positively.  Although representatives of the President were rated positively  by only 6.7 percent (versus negatively by 39.9 percent), the  President himself was rated positively by 14.5 percent and  negatively by 38.8 percent.    Hence, the basic subjects of present-day social conflict are  the public, on the one hand (in this case, young people), and  structures of authority, on the other.    Could mass dissatisfaction with the authorities, forebodings  of conflict, and a relatively high conflict potential really  turn into civil disobedience and political disturbances? The  well-known thesis of the particular radicalism of young people  and their readiness to engage in open conflict has not been  confirmed. It was found, in fact, that young people are even  less inclined than other age groups to engage in conflicts.  [Table 2]    3. Forecasting conflicts and problems of solving  them    Young people do not accept but rather condemn violent,  extremist forms of protest; they prefer lawful and moderate  means [Table 3]. We may predict that the chief kind of struggle  will take the form of economic strikes.    A greater tendency to use lawful forms of social protest was  shown by young people in Kiev, the Republic of Crimea, and the  Lvov and Transcarpathia regions, while violent methods are  favored by the young people of the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa,  and Kirovograd regions. Strikes are preferred primarily by those  in the worker professions, while more radical methods are  favored by younger persons who are not working or in  college--that is, today's older highschool students; among  social groups it is workers of various kinds, and owners.    Respondents were asked directly what factors might prompt  them to take part in active forms of protest. More than half of  them--54.4 percent--are not willing to do so under any  conditions. The scenarios were designed to be extreme ones--the  disappearance of basic food staples from store shelves,  inflation, poverty, rampant crime, and so on. Hence, along with  sharp deterioration of the situation in society we find a  substantial gap between expectations of conflict and  dissatisfaction with various aspects of social and economic life  today, on the one hand, and young people's readiness to protest  actively against these things, on the other.    For young people who can still conceive of factors that  might  prompt them to take part in acts of protest, the main one is the  impossibility of earning a decent living.    The best way to prevent youth's conflict potential from  turning into active forms of protest, in particular, is to carry  out economic reforms that will give young people the chance to  solve their most urgent problems--basically, material problems.  In our opinion, it is not social protection in the form of  miserly social assistance that ought to be the core of youth  policy, but instead, prompt reforms toward a market economy in  which young people, thanks to their greater mobility, energy,  and their ability to upgrade their skills and adjust to new  conditions, have a good chance of solving their problems on  their own.    A major role in averting social conflicts is played by young  people's enthusiasm (especially the younger set) for modern  arts, in particular movies and music. Unsound policies toward  mass culture can only worsen and stimulate social conflict.    One important element of a civilized mechanism of resolving  conflicts in developed democratic countries is a multi-party  system, where parties serve as intermediaries between the public  and the state authorities and express the interests of various  social groups and strata. The parties are the basic mechanism  for institutionalizing conflicts, moving them out of the sphere  of possible direct clashes and into parliament. Moreover,  parties enable groups to reconcile their interests with those of  society's, otherwise a party cannot win in general elections.    But besides the fact that our society has yet to form a real  multi-party system, this is hindered by young people's political  apathy (a trend that has been observed in recent years) and  their loss of faith in political parties. Only 3.5 percent of  young people now are members of youth associations, and only 1.6  percent belong to political parties. Moreover, 1.1 percent of  the respondents reported taking part in events put on in 1993 by  Ukraine's youth organizations, and another 2.7 percent took part  in a few.    We can see, then, that the existence of supposedly numerous  youth associations (both political and non-political--for  example, the MZhK [unidentified]), for all their apparent vigor,  actually involves a rather narrow segment of young people,  primarily the leadership apparatus of the organizations. They do  not enjoy much support from young people and do not arouse much  enthusiasm. Young people still prefer student organizations as  well as sport, tourist, and ecological groups. Political youth  associations rank in last place on this list, their members  numbering only 15.8 percent, and are outranked by religious  associations, which 24.1 percent of the respondents called  worthwhile. So in the event of conflict relations with the  authorities, today's youth associations are hardly likely to be  effective advocates of young people's interests.    As for the political parties, if the elections had been held  last year, only three political forces would have won over 5  percent--Rukh (5.2 percent), the Democratic Party of Ukraine  (5.8 percent), and the Greens (6.2 percent). Most of the young  people--74.3 percent--could not name their favorite party; 37.7  percent answered that they didn't know which party to vote for;  18.2 percent stated they would not vote for any of the parties,  on principle; and another 16.4 percent said they would vote for  the candidate, not the party.    This can bring it about that if it comes to a conflict, it  will not take place in institutionalized forms, where group  interests are represented by parties, trade unions, and civic  organizations, but in the form of disorderly actions enabling  political forces whose interests do not really coincide with  those of young people, to use them.    But if market reforms are carried out, conflict in society  will come more and more to resemble the classic form prevailing  in the developed Western countries, namely between rich and  poor. Yet it will not be in the nature of inter-class conflict;  rather, it will be manifested in pressure on the government by  the poorest segments of society to redistribute the social  product. A major problem of the conversion to the market will be  unemployment, which will be condemned by almost all social  groups except the owners. Unlike older groups, young people will  not be willing to live on social assistance or be content with  low-paying employment.</p>

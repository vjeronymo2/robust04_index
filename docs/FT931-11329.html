			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / A line in the marsh: A cautionary tale of Europe's future From where he stood, leaning against the cornice of the bay window, the prime minister could just read some of the banners as the parade passed up Whitehall: 'Stop fascism now'; 'Hands off Listonia'; 'Today Listonia, tomorrow London'. Wearily he turned to face the room where his colleagues were awaiting a decision they knew only he could take. Foreign policy was, after all, Douglas Hurd's acknowledged forte. It was the reputation he had built up as foreign secretary, steering British interests through the rocks and whirlpools of the 'new disorder', that had made him the obvious choice to lead the national government formed after the UK economy collapsed in 1994. It quickly became clear that Hurd was the only Tory prime minister Labour would serve under, and no one objected to his keeping the foreign office as well. His success in dissuading the Clinton administration from blundering into Bosnia in its first year was generally admired, not least in the British and US armed forces, who believed he had saved them from a Vietnam-like quagmire. And now, Douglas knew as he looked round the anxious faces at the cabinet table, they were relying on him to do it again. The Listonian crisis was getting out of hand. Those TV pictures of villages laid waste by Cossack 'irregulars', who everyone knew were operating from bases in Russian territory, had brought in massive postbags for every MP. Why was that, Douglas wondered, refilling his cup of Earl Grey tea to give himself a moment's more thinking time. After all, destroyed villages in eastern Europe were a pretty familiar sight. Even back in 1993 he had told the Royal Institute of International Affairs that 'there is nothing new in mass rape, in the shooting of civilians, in war crimes, ethnic cleansing, in the burning of towns and villages'. At that time such things still had a certain power to shock when they happened in Europe and were shown on TV, but surely we were past that by now. Perhaps it was the swastikas daubed on the walls, or the fact that the male inhabitants of all ages had been mutilated? Or was it the way the tabloid press - so much of it now German-owned or influenced - was playing up the story? Probably a bit of both, but in his view it was the truculent tone of the new Russian regime that had done most to unsettle public opinion. Not only had it stopped pretending it was not involved in the events in Caucasia and the Baltic; it had warned ominously that similar events would happen in Ukraine if authorities there did not show more 'respect' for the Russian population. Slowly Douglas realised that someone in the room was speaking. It was Ashdown, the secretary of state for defence - a man whose presence in the cabinet Hurd regarded as the downside of coalition government. Putting him at defence had been a clever move, of course. It meant he could rush around visiting the troops, but was obliged to face the fact that there were simply not enough of them to right all the world's wrongs. All the same, Ashdown had been getting troublesome of late. He had a knack of making speeches which, without actually contradicting government policy, seemed to fan rather than soothe the mood of militant indignation that was sweeping the country. Even Lady Thatcher was said to except him, privately, from her constant excoriation of 'this spineless government'. And what was he saying now? Something about having warned all along that the rot would spread if it wasn't stopped in Yugoslavia. Douglas adjourned the meeting for an hour and put through a call to Washington. Not to the president: he had learnt quite early on that he could not be sure of getting him on the line. It was more effective, in any case, to work through Warren Christopher, a man who shared, to a large extent, his own cautious and sceptical world view. Yes, Warren confirmed, pressure was building up there too - on the Hill, especially - for some kind of intervention. Something was needed to head it off. A joint statement, perhaps, by the P3 - the three western permanent members of the Security Council - to 'draw a line in the marshes'. Fax machines whined in Downing Street, in Foggy Bottom and in the Elysee Palace. President Chirac amended successive drafts to make it clear (i) that Nato was not involved, (ii) that no military action was contemplated, and (iii) that if military action was taken France would be present 'au premier rang'. But by midnight Douglas was able to reconvene the cabinet and present them with an agreed text, the careful phrasing of which gave him once again that comforting glow of pride in British draftsmanship. It deplored atrocities 'by all sides', and warned that 'the international community would react with the utmost energy to any extension of the fighting, particularly across state borders'. When he had finished reading, colleagues pressed forward to shake Douglas's hand. Now at last they had something concrete to offer at their weekend surgeries. He waved away their congratulations, with the merest hint of impatience, but allowed himself to accept a double whisky from Snodgrass, the Downing Street butler. Just as he raised the glass to his lips, the mahogany telephone on the slightly worn green leather desk began to ring. It was Charles Buffett-Brown, his private secretary in the Foreign Office. 'Sorry to bother you so late, prime minister, but I thought you'd want to know. Russian troops have crossed the Polish frontier.' The column is a response to a short story by Douglas Hurd in a Sunday newspaper</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Ups and downs of bond market FOR EC governments and central banks battling with foreign exchange market turbulence, the increased integration of international capital markets is both good and bad news. The positive aspect of the lowering of barriers between different markets is that governments have been turning to foreign investors to fund soaring budget deficits. The bad news is that the greatly expanded size of foreign bond market holdings has been a significant factor behind currency unrest during the past year. The potential disruptiveness of capital flows on the Dollars 1,000bn a day global foreign exchange market helps explain the sporadic calls for capital controls since the July/August crisis in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, on Wednesday appeared to raise the possibility of partially re-introducing controls. Since the EC liberalised capital movements in 1990, much-expanded cross-border investment purchases have increased the share of foreign holdings in many countries' debt markets from 20 to 30 per cent. However, these funds can move out as well as in. An important reason behind upsets in the ERM has been international investors' off-loading weaker currencies in order to cover their positions in these countries' bond markets. Many of these holdings represent relatively short-term speculative investments, which can be quickly switched between different currencies. Introducing controls on access to these markets could have a counter-productive effect by spurring international investors to shun currencies sealed off by capital barriers. General scepticism about the wisdom of such proposals was yesterday summed up by an official at the Danish National Bank. Denmark has put up with considerable speculative attacks against the krone during the past 12 months. But the official said: 'Because capital markets are so integrated, our view is that capital controls are neither possible nor desirable.' Even after the forced widening of ERM fluctuation bands last month, worries about the volatility of these holdings continue to cast a shadow over EC monetary policies. Fears that non-resident investors will dump bonds have been one of the reasons preventing weaker currency countries from making rapid cuts in interest rates. France, Belgium and Denmark have all moved only cautiously to ease monetary policy since the end of July. They have avoided using the extra leeway to drift down against the D-Mark within the wider bands. Another reason for prudence is the need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves depleted in July's unsuccessful defence of ERM parities. France, which spent an estimated FFr330bn (Dollars 59bn) to defend the franc, still has negative net currency reserves, according to figures published yesterday by the Bank of France. They show that the net deficit, which peaked at FFr176bn on August 5, was FFr90bn on September 9, an improvement from FFr104bn the previous week. Competition among EC countries to attract international savings into their bond markets has so far benefited above all Germany. According to Bundesbank figures, non-residents channelled a record net DM257bn into German domestic bonds in the 12 months to end-June, of which DM171bn went into public sector bonds. The Bundesbank's desire to maintain the D-Mark's international attractiveness has been a prime reason for its refusal to make faster cuts in short-term interest rates. This strategy appears to have paid off. Massive foreign inflows, financing a large proportion of the public sector deficit, have helped bring German bond market yields down to near post-war lows. Foreigners held 26 per cent of total outstanding German public sector debt of DM1,350bn at the end of last year, against 21 per cent of the DM1,050bn debt total at end-1990. In France, foreign investors have also considerably stepped up their debt holdings. According to estimates in Paris, non-resident holdings of French government bonds of more than seven years maturity rose to FFr305bn (27 per cent of total outstanding debt) in April this year from FFr137bn (17 per cent) at end-1990. Foreign holdings of short-term French debt of five year maturity or less also rose strongly to FFr213bn (43 per cent of total) from FFr118bn (29 per cent) at end-1990. On the Belgian bond market, rattled by speculative assaults on the Belgian franc, foreign investors are now interested mainly in selling short-term and medium-term bonds, according to Brussels dealers. Some, however, are reinvesting in longer-term debt instruments. Latest Belgian central bank figures show foreign holdings of medium- and long-term bonds in May 1993 totalled BFr301bn (Dollars 8.8bn), 11 per cent of the total, compared with BFr250bn, 17 per cent, in June 1992. Some dealers believe foreigners' share of the market may now be below 10 per cent. There have been similar stories of large foreign involvement in other countries' bond markets. In Denmark, foreign holdings accounted for 14 per cent of outstanding debt at the end of last year, against 8 per cent at end-1990. In some recent government bond issues in the Netherlands, foreign investors have accounted for up to 90 per cent of sales - particularly for long-dated 30-year paper. Overall, foreign investors accounted for 24 per cent of the Netherlands' total outstanding debt at the end of 1992, up from 16 per cent in 1987 and 23 per cent in 1990. In the UK, which has attracted substantial inflows since the brightening of Britain's economic prospects earlier this year, dealers estimate that foreign investors have taken 20-40 per cent of government debt issues in recent months. The overall foreign-held component of outstanding UK government debt is now around 17 per cent. The British monetary authorities, like their EC counterparts, know that foreign inflows may appear like a symbol of strength - but they can also be a source of vulnerability.

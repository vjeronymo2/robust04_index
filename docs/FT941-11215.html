			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Men in the News: Taking the rough with the smooth - Common ground and contrasts between the BAe and BMW chiefs / Evans and Pischetsrieder Dick Evans, a rough and tough Lancastrian, and Bernd Pischetsrieder, a poised and polished Bavarian, appear to have more cause for mutual congratulation than they have in common. But that perception may change. The chief executive of British Aerospace and the chairman of BMW found some common ground a week ago when they struck the deal which surrendered control of the UK's Rover Group to Germany. Evans found a safe and rich home for Rover. Pischetsrieder found an 'almost ideal' add-on partner to expand BMW outside its high-performance niche. As a result, both saw their reputations soar. Pischetsrieder was hailed as an entrepreneurial hero while Evans was lauded for seizing an opportunity of a lifetime. There, the common ground appears to run out. Evans has been a controversial figure since he got the BAe job four years ago. Since last May, when Pischetsrieder inherited the top post - but not the title of 'Mr BMW' - from Eberhard von Kuenheim, he has received only flattery. The BAe chief's supporters in the defence industry see him as a hero: a man who knows the business inside out and who, in the group's darkest hour last year, sold Pounds 4bn-worth of Tornados to Saudi Arabia. His detractors see matters differently. They argue that this salesman with scant experience of general management survived the disastrous Pounds 432m rights issue two years ago only because he was kingpin in the darkling world of Saudi Arabian deal-making. That image is changing. Last Monday's announcement has won him more friends in the City. 'We are now seeing a slightly different Dick Evans,' says one observer. 'This week he looks the smart boy.' Evans, who presented the deal alongside Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance director, and Rover boss George Simpson, acquitted himself well. There was no trace of the plain-talker who used to unleash his temper at meetings intended to massage investor relations. Communication has never been Evans's strongest suit. One investor comments: 'I have rarely met a powerful chairman or chief executive with so little sheen or gloss.' He concedes, however, that Evans has grown more comfortable in the job; smoother and more diplomatic. The Ministry of Defence view is mixed. Lord Younger, former defence secretary, has named Evans as the British businessman he most admired, citing his role in turning round BAe. On the other hand, Alan Clark, ex-defence minister, describes his most appealing characteristic as being 'a true Englander. I found this very sympathetic. It allowed me to tolerate some of his other attributes.' On a brief encounter it is not easy to get the measure of Evans. Bespectacled and stout, wearing shirtsleeves, he talks a great deal though it is hard to know what he is really thinking. One thing is clear. He is a practical man, dedicated to the job. 'I have a tremendous capacity for hard work,' he says. This week he has been existing on a diet of claret and apples. He starts work most days by 6.30am, rarely getting home before 11.30pm. He works two weekends out of four, and is hanging on the phone for most of the others. A routine of 'very little sleep' is punctuated frequently by naps on long-haul flights. Evans is not boastful. Indeed, he does not seem happy talking about himself. He emphasises he is one of a team: a team runs the company, a team clinched the Saudi deal, a team sold Rover. He is allergic to the cult of personality, and has no desire to delve into his Blackpool background. He likes to play golf, usually with customers, but whenever he comes home he is 'brought down to earth by three daughters firing from the hip, reminding you who's king'. As for selling aircraft to Saudi Arabia and car companies to Germans, he puts it all down to flair. 'It's a matter of getting the right chemistry working. It isn't an art you can develop, but something you either have or don't have.' But he is ready to dispute that he is better at selling than managing. He argues that people say that only because the salesman's achievements are more apparent. In any case, the ability to sell is paramount. 'We can have the most efficient organisation on earth. But if we have no business coming in through the front door, whatever lies behind the door is not worth a row of beans,' he snorts. More than a salesman, he sees himself as a strategic thinker. The new-look BAe, in which cars no longer have a part, is his design, not one brought in with the new chairman. 'I wanted John (Cahill) to understand that upfront, he must sign up and take ownership of that strategy - which he did,' he adds. Which is what happened - in reverse - at BMW, where the hitherto unknown Pischetsrieder inherited the strategy of von Kuenheim, retiring after 23 years at the top of BMW. In fact, the 45-year-old is an integral part of a long-term strategy established by 'the Old Man', as von Kuenheim styled himself. The prickly Prussian prepared his succession and his strategy carefully. It was his plan to extend BMW's product range and market reach. It was his plan to replace BMW's autocratic leadership - himself - with an Evans-style team. Pischetsrieder is firmly flanked ('walled-in' as some say) by two power-sharing colleagues. On one side sits Horst Teltschik, a former adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and now known as BMW's 'foreign minister'. On the other sits Wolfgang Reitzle, an old college chum of the chairman, who presides over a 'mega-ministry' which gives him effective control over most aspects of development, purchasing and production and some 7,000 staff. Nor is von Kuenheim out of the picture. Now chairman of the group supervisory board, he has taken an office one floor below the management, from where he massages and maintains crucial links with the rich and secretive Quandt family, which owns anything up to 75 per cent of the business. While such a structure makes it tempting to doubt Pischetsrieder's al-lies' claims that the Rover coup was all his own work, the speed and calm efficiency of the move matched his reputation perfectly. As one industry insider said last year: 'He is a placid man, decisive, hard, fast and footsure.' His handling of British unions' angst this week demonstrated successful application of his belief that 'leadership is to do with communication and conversation'. As one competitor noted: 'He is probably the most-trusted manager - at all levels - in the business.' It was Pischetsrieder, previously production director, who gave BMW a head start in Germany's current race for improved productivity. A plain speaker like BAe's Evans, he made no bones about the implications. 'Simultaneous engineering with our suppliers means nothing more and nothing less than asking our employees to give up their jobs,' he said. His directness is not limited to the shop floor. Asked in an interview about his relationship with von Kuenheim, he was almost blase. He had no problems, he said, because they both understood the duties of a supervisory board. One element was supervision, the other was to provide advice - when it was asked for. In common with Evans, but for different reasons, he shuns the limelight. In a community where capitalism's captains are still terrorist targets, he guards his privacy. He limits his risk-taking to the business arena and increasingly rare outings on his snowboard. On the job, while the practical Evans attributes his successes to flair and 'getting the chemistry working', Pischetsrieder, the trained engineer, also shows himself to be more open in his thinking about management than is common in Germany. Unfortunately, the processes which led to successful products were not always logical, he said in an interview last year. They therefore could not be planned down to the last detail. He was 'almost frightened' to say so, but gut feelings and chance had to be allowed a role in management. Gabriele Hoffmann, one of Germany's leading astrologers, had no such fears when casting his horoscope around the same time. The Aquarian Pischetsrieder was a 'super type', she said, with a good instinct for what is important. 'From November BMW will have a possibility to take a share in a foreign company,' she predicted. Whether he was following his gut feelings or Hoffmann, Pischetsrieder made his first unsolicited approach to BAe last October. He and Evans took their chances last weekend. The Evans persona, as has been noted, is already becoming smoother and smarter. Chances are that a spell in the hurly-burly of life beyond BMW's exclusive niche will roughen and toughen Pischetsrieder sufficiently to earn him the title 'Mr BMW', which for the moment still belongs to the Old Man.</p>

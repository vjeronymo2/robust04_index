			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 1 (AFP) -- The head of the French  army called Sunday [1 May] for a tougher line on a NATO air  strike threat, amid increasing ceasefire violations and  harassment of UN forces in Bosnia over the past two days.  Admiral Jacques Lanxade, referring to a NATO ultimatum over  attacks against UN-designated safe areas, said that if it was  violated in any way: "France would recommend strikes." The most  serious harassment in the last two days was a direct Bosnian  Serb attack on UN tanks in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] spokesman commander Eric Chaperon said.    He said UN Nordic battalion tanks reinforcing an observation  post near the UN-designated safe area of Tuzla responded with 72  tank rounds when attacked by Serbs. Chaperon said the Serbs  fired four wire-guided anti-tank missiles which landed close to  the tanks, porovoking the tanks to respond with 72 rounds, the  most massive UNPROFOR retaliation so far. "The rockets were  fired to hit. These are not toys. They did not miss their  targets deliberately," he said.    No exact figures for Serb casualties in the incident were  available, Chaperon said, but added that Serb military  commanders had reported a number of dead and injured, as well as  damage to equipment. In Sarajevo, "the usual ceasefire  violations" had been reported, Chaperon said, indicating these  were mostly exchanges of small arms fire. A French Puma  helicopter was hit by small arms fire while approaching the  airport Saturday. Meanwhile in Vitez, also a UN-designated area  in central Bosnia, a rocket-propelled grenade landed 50 metres  from the entrance to the base of the British UN batallion  Saturday.    In Gorazde, small arms fire had continued despite the  stand-off with NATO last week, and two Bosnian army mortar  shells fell on Serb positions, Chaperon said. Sources in the  region have indicated that about 100 armed Serbs were deployed  in the region to protect the Serb population on the right bank  of the river Drina.    "They are Serb militia, not soldiers. We do not have exact  figures" for the number involved, Chaperon said. Meanwhile  Admiral Lanxade, who arrived here Saturday, stressed that Paris  backed strict adherence to the threat of air strikes for  violations of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs.    Talking to journalists at Sarajevo airport, Lanxade stressed  that it was "absolutely clear that if the terms of the ultimatum  are violated, France would recommend strikes." Informed sources  said Lanxade discussed the issue with UNPROFOR commander General  Sir Michael Rose when he met him here Sunday morning. A member  of Lanxade's staff said the meeting was to "clear up any  misunderstandings." He said there was a "need for mutual  explanation. "The staff member said Rose's views "should be  made more precise," because "he gives the impression of being so  against strikes that he is removing their credibility entirely."    The French general stressed however that "the UN has not  backed off, nor has there been a difference opinion with  France... we must negotiate on the ground, and maintain the  NATO pressure. Success on the ground depends on the combination  of these two actions," he said, stressing that the West did not  plan to "strike for striking's sake, but to lead to a  resolution" of the conflict. Lanxade later left Sarajevo by  helicopter bound for the Croatian port of Split, from where he  will return to Paris.</p>

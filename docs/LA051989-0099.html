			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUDIOCASSETTE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE ODD CHARACTERS OF 'CADILLAC JACK'  </P> <P> **** "Cadillac Jack" by Larry McMurtry. Read by Wolfram Kandinsky. Unabridged  on 10 cassettes. Books on Tape.  </P> <P> Larry McMurtry, author of "Lonesome Dove" and several other novels, is also an  antiquarian book collector and dealer. The first person narrator of "Cadillac  Jack" is a scout who makes a (good) living looking into flea markets, auctions  and obscure shops from one end of the U.S. to the other, buying beautiful  things for resale to dealers and collectors. He also collects women with rather  more mixed results. The book is wonderfully satirical about Washington (where  McMurtry now lives) and Texas (where he hails from) and all points in between.  "Cadillac Jack" is rich in oddball characters, funny in its dissection of  relationships, quite touching in the passionate detailing of the scout's love  of objects rare, beautiful and bizarre, or all three. Kandinsky, who has read  all of McMurtry's work for the label, has a laconic voice and a subtle command  of American regional accents that fits the material like a caressing glove.

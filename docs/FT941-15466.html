			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Citicorp advance surprises market Citicorp surprised the stock market with fourth-quarter earnings ahead of expectations, even after one-off charges of Dollars 297m which included restructuring costs and a write-down in the value of its Quotron subsidiary. Although the US's largest bank will not unveil full details of its 1993 figures until next Tuesday, it chose yesterday to pre-announce that net income for the fourth quarter would be 'about Dollars 575m,' or Dollars 1.06 a share, giving it record earnings for the year as a whole of Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 4.11. The news drove Citicorp's share price up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 . The bank gave no further break-down of the results, though it detailed several one-off items. These included pre-tax charges of Dollars 425m to cover restructuring and Dollars 179m to reflect a write-down in the value of Quotron, its information services business, part of which is being sold to Reuters. These costs were partly offset by gains of Dollars 107m from the sale of Brazilian past-due interest bonds and Dollars 200m of deferred tax benefits. Without the one-off items, earnings per share for the last quarter would have reached around Dollars 1.25, estimated Ms Diane Glossman, a senior analyst at Salomon Brothers. Citicorp's earnings rebound in previous quarters had been fuelled by a rapid improvement in credit quality, which had reduced its bad-debt costs. The latest jump led to expectations that Citicorp would next week report a stronger than expected improvement in revenues, with retail banking in the US and around the world driving the growth. Mr John Reed, chairman, said the results were 'broad-based, proving the value of Citicorp's unique global franchise'. He said the bank was continuing to invest in high-growth businesses, particularly in the developing world, and that the restructuring charges would pay for themselves by 1995.</p>

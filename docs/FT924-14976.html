			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford drops Sierra for Mondeo FORD, the US carmaker, said yesterday that it had decided to drop the name Sierra for its crucial large family car range in Europe. The replacement, which is to be launched early next year at the Geneva motor show, will be named Mondeo. The new range is vital to the immediate recovery prospects for Ford's European operations, which have plunged back into loss after making a modest profit in the first six months this year. The Mondeo will replace the Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in the US. It marks a big gamble for Ford, which for the first time has developed in Europe a common model for the European and North American markets. Mr Allan Gilmour, president of the Ford automotive group, said the Mondeo range of large family cars would include saloon, hatchback and estate variants and would be produced in both Europe - at the Genk, Belgium plant - and in North America. Ford said yesterday that it had opened a components office in Beijing as part of its drive to source more parts from lower-cost countries.</p>

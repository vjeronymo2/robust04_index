			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Workers and trade  union members in Pyongyang held a meeting at the Pyongyang  textile machine factory on April 20 to pledge their loyalty on  the lapse of 33 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  left undying footprints at the factory.    In the spring of 1961, the dear leader stayed at the  Pyongyang textile machine factory for nearly 20 days, working  with workers as an operator of lathe No. 26 and rousing them to  implement the three revolutions, ideological, technical and  cultural, and set a noble example of equipment management and  kindled the first torch of the model machine movement.    The speakers at the meeting said this opened up a new  history  of the communistic mass movement for loving and managing  machines in Korea.    For its great vitality the "loyal model machine movement for  emulating lathe No. 26" has been rapidly expanded and developed  in all domains and units of the national economy, gripping the  hearts of the masses, they said. They called for glorifying the  exploits performed by the dear leader in the management of  equipment.    A resolution was adopted at the meeting.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Sacked women win leaflet ruling WOMEN who were sacked from a mushroom farm after refusing new contracts, which they claimed cut their pay, were given permission yesterday by the Court of Appeal to carry out a leaflet campaign to persuade shoppers not to buy the farm's produce. Three judges allowed an appeal by the TGWU general union, which represented 89 women sacked by Middlebrook Mushrooms, a subsidiary of food group Booker. They lifted an injunction which had blocked the campaign.</p>

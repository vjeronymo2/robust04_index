			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Sotheby's chairman to sell 8m shares MR Alfred Taubman, chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, is to sell 8m of his shares in the auction house. The sale is expected to raise Dollars 100m (Pounds 55m). Mr Max M. Fisher, vice chairman, and the Martinique Hotel Inc, are to offer between them another 2m shares. Mr Taubman will retain around 14m shares in Sotheby's and voting control. There was no trading in Sotheby's shares in New York yesterday but on Wednesday they closed at Dollars 12 3/4 . It is expected that when the offer goes out at the end of the month the price will be around this figure. Two million of the Class A shares, which have limited voting rights, will be offered outside the US and Canada. Mr Taubman, who paid Pounds 80m for Sotheby's in 1983, sold around 2.6m shares in 1988 at Dollars 18 a share, raising Dollars 47m. He has written to Sotheby's employees saying that his commitment to, and confidence in, Sotheby's remains unimpaired and that he expects to continue as chairman for some time. Sotheby's is currently recuperating from the recession in the art market. In the first quarter of 1992, it incurred a loss of Dollars 5.2m, but this is always its weakest time of the year. In 1991 it made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 21.5m, against Dollars 154.5m in the previous year, but it believes that the worst is now over. It has long been rumoured that Mr Taubman, a Detroit property developer with a large interest in shopping centres, was wearying of his investment in Sotheby's. He helped to widen the demand for art, particularly for Impressionist and modern pictures, which experienced a dramatic rise, and fall, in values. He also enjoyed the social prestige which came from owning the world's largest auction house. But the collapse of the Impressionist market in 1989 badly affected Sotheby's turnover and profits. It is now concentrating on connoisseur markets, such as Old Master pictures, furniture, and silver, rather than on speculative modern art. Mr Taubman has also been affected by the fall in property values in the US. One of his achievements was to obtain planning permission to build apartments above Sotheby's auction rooms in Manhattan's York Avenue. These plans have been postponed.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Italy's 10-day protest begins A nationwide strike by Italian transport workers yesterday heralded the start of 10 days of serious labour protests by the country's air, maritime and rail workers, writes Robert Graham. The protests will culminate in a four-hour general strike scheduled for October 28. Like the strike called by the three main trade union confederations, the protests in the transport sector are directed against the government's 1994 austerity budget and the growing threat of unemployment.</p>

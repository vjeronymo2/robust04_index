			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Trying to be all things to all music creators Sir, The report by Alice Rawsthorn of the pending Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the Performing Rights Society ('MMC to probe Performing Rights Society', December 1), while inevitably stronger on accusation than our response, neatly illuminated a collecting society's fundamental problem. The top stratum of performing rights earners - and U2 was extensively quoted  -whose proportional contributions to administration costs really make the work of the PRS possible, wants more income, more quickly, for lower administration deductions. Huge concerts, major world tours and continual networked broadcast of their compositions gives them the right to demand this, they believe. Yet the composers of what the Office of Fair Trading referred to as 'less popular forms of music' want something for any and every performance of their works - no matter where, no matter how small the licence income for the performance may have been, and no matter how great the administrative cost may be. Small concerts, no world tours and rare or non-existent broadcasts give them the right to demand this, they believe. Because the UK has no other national performing right society, PRS is a de facto monopoly, and understandably will attract the attention of the OFT and the MMC from time to time. We have spent 80 years trying to be all things to all music creators, and we are tackling head-on the levels of administration cost engendered by that aim. It is not in the interests of some of our critics to admit that their demands are already being pragmatically met, but we are confident that the MMC inquiry will show that our policies and practices are in the best interests of our membership as a whole. The complex nature of our job is highlighted by the fact that even the FT totally misunderstood part of the issue. You reported that PRS now only collects 'royalties' on live performances at 550 'big venues'. PRS total 1994 income from all sources will be more than Pounds 160m. Our live performance licence income in 1994 totals about Pounds 13m of that. We license and collect fees from some 40,000 venues where live music is played. We distribute royalties partly on the basis of programme information from a sample of big, medium and small venues. Of the Pounds 13m referred to, only Pounds 750,000 came from classical performances. I wonder how many of the companies featured in the FT's pages have shown - as PRS has - income growth well in excess of inflation, and steadily falling costs, for five years, during and emerging from a period of deep recession.

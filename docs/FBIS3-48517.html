			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To protect and serve the nation"] </F>   [Text] The Union Solidarity and Development Association  [USDA] was formed and registered as a social organization with  the ministry of home affairs on 15 September 1993.    It emerged to serve the needs of the times. If we are to  prepare both the young and the old alike for their future tasks  once the democratic system starts functioning full swing, we  will have to prepare them for it. With that in mind, the  leadership launched this social organization with the noble aims  of working for the non- disintegration of the union,  non-disintegration of national unity, perpetuation of  sovereignty, promotion and vitalization of national pride, and  emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern union.    These lofty aims are worthy of being upheld and transformed  into reality for they concern our wellbeing and our future. The  youth in any nation are gregarious, sociable, and outgoing. To  nurture them, to harness their positive traits, they must be  given the benefit of some form of guidance. From young, they  get parental guidance and also at school. However, they must be  able to join organizations with extra-curricular activities,  taught trades useful to themselves and to others.    In the aftermath of the chaos and anarchy of the late '80s,  the social organizations could not absorb the bulk of youths  enthusiastic to join. Hence the need for one that would cater  to their desires. That the authorities had devised a way for  them to identify themselves with a distinctive organization came  as a boon and at an opportune moment.    The State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], which  has been making preparations for retransfer of power to the  rightful people, took the necessary measure to see to the  emergence of the kind of organization they very much need.  Members who are 10 and above, regardless of sex, class, creed  or faith, will be able to get together for a common cause --  that of protecting and serving the motherland.    Both minors designated as junior members and adults  designated as senior members, will be involved in  nation-building tasks. All members are to swear their  allegiance to the nation under the Four Oaths, observe an  11-point Code of Conduct, and live up to 14 Duties and  Responsibilities, which means they will be able to prove  themselves worthy of identity with the union.    The mammoth rally that was held at Aung San Stadium  yesterday  was one of a kind, for it brought together a merry mix of  students, teachers, and people from other walks of life.    More rallies are coming up. They will endorse the USDA and  help strengthen the nation's chances of seeing peace and  progress.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: L170bn sale ends Pirelli disposal programme PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, has completed its wide-ranging asset disposal programme with the L170bn (Dollars 115m) sale of its power transmission unit to Mark IV Industries of the US. Pirelli started selling the seven business units in its diversified products division in early 1992, after its aborted takeover of Continental, its bigger German rival, left it facing heavy losses. Pirelli said the disposals would realise about L1,000bn - a target it claims has been exceeded. The latest sale, which involves operations in Italy, the US and Spain, as well as marketing offices in four other countries, will produce an extraordinary gain of L10bn. The power transmission division produces rubber belts for a variety of industrial uses. Sales last year amounted to L260bn and the operation has 1,550 employees. A final price for the deal will depend on audits under way. However, the L170bn estimate includes L70bn in debt. Pirelli expects to complete the transaction by the end of next month. La Rinascente, the Italian retailing group controlled by Fiat, raised consolidated sales by 13.5 per cent to L1,617bn in the year to April 29. Adjusted for closures, the increase amounted to 14.8 per cent, it said. The group denied negotiations on its sale were under way, in spite of expressions of interest from other retailers after Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, said Rinascente was no longer a 'strategic' asset.</p>

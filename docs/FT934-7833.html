			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Electrolux recovers strongly ELECTROLUX, the largest European white goods manufacturer, has swung into a SKr198m (Pounds 16.5m) profit in the third quarter, after financial items, from a SKr22m loss a year earlier. The better-than-expected performance lifted the group's shares SKr18, or 6.3 per cent, to SKr305 yesterday. It took profits for the first nine months to SKr961m, up 31 per cent. Sales for the third quarter climbed 35.5 per cent to SKr24.6bn, while operating income increased to SKr646m from SKr370m. The figures reflected the benefits of a weaker krona, restructuring, and the development of new product ranges. They also demonstrated that problems in the North American and Spanish markets, which cost SKr500m during the first six months, were largely over. Analysts said the third quarter performance reflected strong growth in operating income in outdoor products and industrial products. The outdoor business, which saw sales climb 66.6 per cent to SKr2.55bn, was boosted by krona weakness with its orientation towards the US. The picture within domestic appliances, the group's biggest division, was mixed, even though sales rose 32.1 per cent to SKr14.7bn. Bright spots were an increase in operating income in the group's US white goods operation and a bottoming out of the sharp downturn in the Nordic and Spanish markets. However, demand fell in Germany after growing throughout the first half, and Italy was one of a number of other countries to show weaker growth. Only the UK showed improvement. Currency factors helped group sales rise 26 per cent in the first nine months to SKr74.2bn, as volumes rose 4 per cent. Operating income climbed 20 per cent to SKr2.26bn. Mr Staffan Ostlin, an analyst at Carnegie in Stockholm, said: 'Electrolux is through the worst but it is still looking at a tough market. European appliance sales could fall by 1 per cent next year.' Carnegie expects the group to record a full-year profit of around SKr1.4bn, compared with SKr1bn. World Stock Markets, Page 47</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Tokyo extends an icy hand to Russia: The Kuriles dispute will dominate Yeltsin's visit RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin can expect an icily polite reception when he arrives in Tokyo this evening for a three-day official visit. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will no doubt be relieved that Mr Yeltsin has at last made good his promise to make a visit, postponed twice already to the irritation and bewilderment of his hosts. But once the welcoming handshakes are out of the way, Mr Hosokawa promises to get down to the prickly business of pushing for progress in the dispute over the four Kurile islands seized by Soviet troops in the final days of the second world war. He will also express regret over the recent bloodshed in Moscow - which prompted opposition calls for the visit to be cancelled. Although vastly strengthened after suppressing his conservative enemies' armed uprising in Moscow, Mr Yeltsin is unlikely to be ready, this time round, for concessions on the islands which Japan wants returned to it. 'It is difficult to expect a breakthrough in this direction,' says Dr Vyacheslav Amirov of Moscow's Centre for Japanese and Pacific Research. Seeing Moscow as an opportunistic aggressor in seizing the islands, Japan has yet to sign a peace treaty with Russia formally ending wartime hostilities. Although the Japanese see their 'northern territories' as the main item on the agenda, a Russian Foreign Ministry official on Friday blamed the media for 'suggesting that the importance of this visit is based solely on this issue'. Admittedly, Japanese officials do not expect great progress on the islands during a visit which Mr Hosokawa last week described as more of a chance 'to take Russo-Japanese relations to a new level'. In a desire to improve relations, it hopes to conclude 15 co-operation accords ranging from space technology to improving safety at Russian nuclear power plants and helping to dismantle Russian nuclear weapons. The most Tokyo hopes for on the territorial front is to name the four islands - Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Hobbemai - in a joint communique at the end of the visit. Japan would take this as Russian acknowledgment of its claims to all four and a step forward from a 1956 communique - since nullified by Moscow - in which the Soviet Union offered to return two of them. Even this is likely to be too much for Mr Yeltsin. Like Britain's Falklands, these islands inspire a sense of national importance on both sides, out of scale with their economic value. If any improvements are achieved during the visit, it will be thanks to the change of guard in Tokyo. Mr Yeltsin can be thankful that he is meeting the courteous Mr Hosokawa and not a prime minister from the LDP, the governing party for 38 years until it lost power this summer. Despite his more conciliatory tone, Mr Hosokawa is under even more political pressure than his predecessors to get redress from Moscow for wartime wrongs. Many people, especially in the LDP, were shocked by his recent apologies for Japan's wartime aggression and see Mr Yeltsin's visit as an opportunity to restore the balance. Japan has been careful not to spell out its offer in return for territorial concessions, beyond sticking to its policy that it will offer no large-scale economic aid until the issue is resolved. In practice, that stance has become increasingly hard to maintain. Japan is now Russia's third largest aid donor, with pledges of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) - of which only 10 per cent has been disbursed so far.</p>

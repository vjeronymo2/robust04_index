			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Success comes from behind a smokescreen - JEM CLIFF RICHARD, the Clash and the Dutch fire brigade do not have much in common, but they all share a need for one vital ingredient: smoke without fire. From its Lincolnshire headquarters, JEM Smoke Machine Company has a solution. About 60 per cent of JEM's business comes from the entertainment world, supplying machines which churn out smoke for artists, pop groups, television companies, theatres and nightclubs. A recent contract for the Cure rock group demanded that the band be completely submerged in smoke during its performance. Other clients with strange and taxing requests have included the Rolling Stones, the London Hippodrome and Disneyworld. JEM can provide a few seconds to an hour of smoke, with depths of 10mm to more than 2m. Another 40 per cent of the company's turnover comes from projects such as fire emergency training for the London Fire Brigade, the Swedish and British navies and Boeing aircraft flight simulators. Emergency evacuation procedures used to create smoke by setting light to a bundle of hay, but the smoke was toxic, and the simulations could become as dangerous as real fires, since smoke inhalation normally causes more injuries and deaths than flame burns. The Royal Aerospace Establishment in Farnborough uses JEM smoke in its wind tunnels; Shell tests for leaks in pipelines with the smoke; and a recent contract for Belgian market gardens uses the smoke to keep fruit warm and protect it from frost. Mr Nigel Morris started the company in 1981 after becoming joint director of a sound and lighting equipment company, but without any equity stake. 'I was at a dead end,' he says. 'There wasn't any further I could go, so I decided to set up on my own.' He began importing and exporting lighting and special effects, particularly those for smoke generation. By late 1984, he was ready to launch a machine of his own on to the market. 'The marketplace was open. Margins were getting smaller and smaller in our business. But no one had ever designed a custom-made smoke machine,' he says. Conventional smoke machines use 'dry ice' which has to be stored at extremely cold temperatures and then added to boiling water. It dissipates quickly and can cause severe frostbite if not handled properly. 'It's very old fashioned,' says Mr Morris. JEM has developed 20 types of fluid, storable at room temperature, which use highly refined polyglycols mixed with de-ionised water. When the fluid is passed through a heat exchanger in the machine, it turns into safe, non-toxic smoke. The machines retail for between Pounds 250 and Pounds 6,000. The company employs 40 staff, and manufactures about 1,000 machines a month. It also employs a part-time chemist, who is developing a product ready for launch in the next few weeks: a pryotechnic machine, which will create firework effects and coloured smoke. JEM has spent Pounds 180,000 developing the device and has a number of patents pending. 'We take the most difficult and complicated things we can do, which makes us insulated from competition and the machines difficult to copy,' says Mr Morris. JEM's turnover was Pounds 2m last year, and the company expects that to rise to Pounds 3.5m this year. It is one of the largest companies in its industry with only a handful of competitors. Exports - which account for nearly 80 per cent of turnover - have been built up through a worldwide distribution network of theatrical agents and exporting companies. JEM now only tends to handle the larger orders itself. 'We're not geared up to the Pounds 200 per product market,' says Mr Morris. 'But we handle the artists, who are invariably extremely temperamental.'</p>

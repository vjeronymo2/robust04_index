			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer on base rate hopes A SUDDEN advance in the short sterling contract revived speculation in the UK stock market late yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor of the exchequer, may yet prove accommodating to calls for a further reduction in domestic base rates. Helped also by a firm opening on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 Index gained ground late in the day to finish 8.5 ahead at 2,849.2. However, trading volume left much to be desired as the market returned sluggishly from the three-day weekend break in London, New York and on most European bourses. With Wall Street down on Friday, international stocks opened lower in London, leaving the field to the first dealings in the newly demerged ICI and Zeneca. The market was 7 Footsie points off at midsession, rallying rapidly as interest rate hopes grew and as Wall Street opened with a 14-point gain on the Dow following a favourable performance by the US Purchasing Managers Index in May. Hopes for a base rate cut were not taken too seriously in a stock market featured by one of the lowest daily trading volumes this year. At 401.9m shares, Seaq turnover compared with 577.3m shares on Friday, when retail, or customer, business slipped to a value of only Pounds 1.1bn. Trading in non-Footsie shares made up only 57 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, while Zeneca shares alone represented nearly 6 per cent of turnover in Footsie-listed stocks. In general, traders referred to 'an uninspiring session'. Yesterday's rate cut hints were at odds with opinions expressed by many market strategists. NatWest Capital Markets commented that Mr Clarke will find it 'easier to resist' pressure to reduce rates. Kleinwort Benson Securities, noting that Mr Clarke's arrival may improve presentation but is unlikely to change Treasury policies, stressed that the objective remains to put together a package of spending cuts and tax increases to bring the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement under control. The opening of trading in the new ICI and Zeneca issues was regarded as satisfactory but not excitingly so. A sharp rise in the ICI share price, against a modest dip in Zeneca, bore out the market's view that investors, particularly from the US, appear unhappy with the pharmaceuticals outlook, and prefer to buy ICI shares. Investors are nervous over possible developments in the healthcare policies of President Clinton's administration. The late upturn in the Footsie was also buttressed by a sharp rally in stock index futures. The big securities houses have already begun to close trading books on the extended three-week equity trading account, which closes on Friday. Several stocks moved sharply yesterday on relatively modest turnover, reflecting changes in stance by City analysts. But overall, the market remains in the middle of its identified trading range, with confidence in the economic recovery in the UK still uncertain in spite of the disclosure yesterday of a favourable monthly report on UK manufacturing activity from UK purchasing managers. The purchasing managers index gained ground in May, for the fourth successive month, indicating continued economic expansion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Valerio </F> Pellizzari in Belgrade; date not given: "I, The War-And-Death  Lord"]    [Text] Belgrade --Ratko Mladic is the true warlord in  Bosnia. His artillery has shelled Knin, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and all  the other towns with Muslim majorities -- without making any  distinction between civil and military targets. This general  has become Greater Serbia's protector, the symbol of ethnic  cleansing in Bosnia. The appointment was on Belgrade's hills,  far from the din of war.    [Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN  safe area?    [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for  15  days. They were firing on our positions in an attempt to link  up with the other safe areas which are under their control --  not to defend themselves, but in order to spread the war in  Serbia and Montenegro.    [Pellizzari] The snipers were targeting children too, and  the  shells were falling on hospitals.    [Mladic] You should have asked Izetbegovic these same  questions two years ago, when they attacked our military  hospital. Or in 1991, when the Croats were beheading women and  children on the banks of the Korana river, or when they blew up  Serbian homes with people still inside them, and then sang  "Thank You, Germany" in German.    [Pellizzari] Near Tuzla, late at night, you also fired on UN  Blue Helmets.    [Mladic] The report you saw is completely false. The clash  took place in the night of 29 April. The Blue Helmets fired 72  shells, killing nine people and wounding others. They attacked  because they want to transform Tuzla into a NATO airfield. In  the past, they could move very freely in that area, and they did  not fulfill their commitment to station Russian officers there.    [Pellizzari] Why do you always prefer Russian Blue Helmets?  Do they favor you?    [Mladic] No, they are neutral. But a great country must  intervene in this war in which all foreign countries are  intervening.    [Pellizzari] Tito, however, did not believe all that much in  Slav brotherhood and in Russia's disinterested involvement in  this area.    [Mladic] This is a political question, and I do not wish to  answer political questions, ever. However, I will make an  exception. Without Tito and his drunken followers, this war  would have never taken place. In any case, it was not us who  started it.    [Pellizzari] Any agreement or compromise reached with you  becomes fragile, uncertain. You were supposed to move away six  tanks, under UN supervision, but instead you did things your own  way.    [Mladic] It is a small episode.    [Pellizzari] Yes, but a significant one.    [Mladic] This is my country, and my country is sovereign  within its borders. I am the one who decides where to locate  troops and military equipment. Just as you decide at Aviano or  Falconara [Italian air bases].    [Pellizzari] Is there any difference between a war fought  between armies and a war fought against unarmed civilians?    [Mladic] I have studied Hannibal, Alexander the Great, the  Crusades, and World War I and II. This is the most difficult  and the strangest war ever to have been fought on earth. It is  a different conflict because our enemies were citizens in our  own state. And it is a low-intensity war, as military experts  say -- one decided abroad, by Europeans, by the Americans, by  the Turks.    [Pellizzari] You see things in a very black-and-white  fashion, with all the blame on one side.    [Mladic] Listen, to quarrel there must always be two sides,  and to make peace you need two sides too. But the greatest  blame must go to those who attacked us. We are defending our  people and our land, and here we can see the international  community's double-dealing. Instead of being neutral, the  United Nations, too, has provided the Muslims with fuel and arms  which were sent together with the humanitarian aid.    [Pellizzari] There is one village that you have always  refrained from attacking.    [Mladic] Yes, Suni, where the Ustashas killed my father  during World War II. I never found my father's grave. The  majority of the population there are Muslims, but I never  attacked those people. I would have been accused of wanting to  take revenge for family reasons.    [Pellizzari] Sum up your biography in a few sentences.    [Mladic] I was born in Bosnia and I am like many other Serbs  who were born there. I attended all the various military  schools, and went through all the various ranks. But I have a  tragic fate. Toward the end of the 20th century, I must use  weapons to react against the extermination of my people.    [Pellizzari] You have a very bad reputation in the Western  press. You are the symbol of ethnic cleansing.    [Mladic] I am aware of it. I am a general and I am more  aware than others that war is a very dirty business. This word  ought not even exist in human speech. Weapons are a terrible  invention. I believe that even toy weapons ought to be  forbidden throughout the world, from north to south.    [Pellizzari] If some day politicians decide that this war  must end, that the embargo must be lifted, and that Mladic must  step aside, what will you do then?    [Mladic] Politicians start wars, and generals carry them out  -- it is like this everywhere. Again, it is politicians who  decide when the moment has come to put an end to war. But this  war's true warlords are to be found in the West. The Serbian  people are awaiting their decisions. The fewer aircraft take  off from UN bases, the easier will it become to achieve peace in  this region. The key to the war lies in NATO's command. NATO is  an alliance to defend its member countries, but no one here has  ever threatened any of its member countries.    [Pellizzari] You place the Serbian nation above all other  considerations.    [Mladic] There are two sacrosanct things in life: my country  and my women. The soil and women bear life. In fact, only a  few among them have any say in the battles waged between armies.  Mrs. Thatcher wants to do so. She is helping the Croats and  Muslims, this is why they are losing. After mothers, wives, and  daughters, it is soldiers who most loathe war.    [Pellizzari] The conflict in Bosnia looks like a religious  conflict.    [Mladic] Perhaps we Serbs are no better than others, but we  are not any worse either. Nor are we a tennis ball that can be  struck in all directions. Nor do we want to become like an  Amazonian tribe on its way to extinction, or like a rare species  confined to a reserve. Islam wants to penetrate into Europe,  and the West will see it grow like a mushroom. However, I have  always showed myself humane toward enemy soldiers. I may add  that I have prevented the conflict from spreading.    [Pellizzari] How do you mean?    [Mladic] When shells start flying, they can fly in all  directions, even very far from here. Toward the Pyrenees,  toward Siberia. Let me remind you of the attempt in Sarajevo,  in 1914.    [Pellizzari] Why do you prevail in battle?    [Mladic] I have a mind of my own, but I want no publicity.  Ultimately, publicity does not allow you to live. Contrary to  what is being said and written, I am not waging a war against  the Croatian or the Muslim people. I am waging a war against  their leaders, and against those instigating them from abroad.  I respect my enemies, but I do not hate them. This is why I  win.</p>

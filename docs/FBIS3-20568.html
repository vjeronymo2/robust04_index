			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bian Yongguo (0593 3057 0948): "Private </F> Enterprises: Get Out of Your `Zone of Errors' and You Will Be in  Heaven"]    [Text] Private enterprises are admired by state-run and  collective enterprises for their flexible mechanism. After the  14th CPC National Congress established their legitimate  position, private enterprises achieved unprecedented  development. While the public-owned enterprises made every  endeavor to adopt the strong points of the private enterprises,  energetically transformed their operational mechanism, and set  up modern enterprise systems, the operational mechanism of a  considerable portion of the private enterprises became in  certain respects imperceptibly influenced by the old mechanism  of the public enterprises, came to show some of the shortcomings  of these public enterprises, and also came to show tendencies of  alienation. It must be realized that the reason why these  enterprises had become privately operated enterprises, and why  they can go on to prosper and develop, is that they have certain  strong points which the public-owned enterprises do not have. If  private enterprises would want to have an even better future and  experience further healthy development, it is now most important  for them to put a stop to the process of emulating the old  mechanism of the public-owned enterprises and to get out as  quickly as possible from their "zones of errors."    Having No [Domineering] "Mother-in-Law" and Wanting One,  Discarding the "Grey Hat" for a "Red Hat"    Private enterprises have gradually evolved under the system  of planned economy; they have grown out of public-owned  enterprises, and then again grown up and developed among  public-owned enterprises. It was, therefore, only natural that  the old managerial patterns of the public-owned enterprises were  filtering into the private enterprises. Under the influence of  such infiltration, a peculiar phenomenon has appeared: On the  one hand, state-run and collective enterprises, furiously angry  with their [domineering] "mothers-in-law," had thrown off their  [domineering] "mothers-in-law," while, on the other hand,  private enterprises are looking for "mothers-in-law" and seeking  someone to act as "patron." Some private enterprise executives,  including some industrialists of certain stature, are actually  clamoring for and demanding that governments of every rank  establish organs for the administrative control of private  enterprises, and that they deputize one senior administrative  official to be particularly in charge of private enterprises,  thereby changing the present situation where no such forceful  administrative control exists. At the same time, some private  enterprises are one after another discarding their "grey hats"  in exchange for "red hats," or are linking up with collectives,  or set up spurious collectives, or outwardly proclaim themselves  to be enterprises on the shareholding and cooperative systems,  or are hanging up the shop signs of partnership businesses. It  must be admitted though, that these private enterprises acting  in this way thereby indicate, first of all, that their  environment is not yet sufficiently unrestrained to allow for  their free existence and development, so that they are in many  respects worse off than the state-run and collective  enterprises, and that they are therefore compelled to take  countermeasures. It also indicates that the private enterprises  themselves lack the spirit of self-assertion and self-reliance,  the spirit of breaking new ground and forging ahead, and that  they are therefore inclined to seek succor under a "red label"  or "red hat" to benefit their own advancement. This is a zone of  much erroneous understanding. Judging by the spirit of the Third  Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the things that the  private enterprises are now hoping to get are precisely what was  to be gotten rid of in the reform. Many "mothers-in-law" can,  of course, be helpful, but practice has proven that the  disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and that they will in the  end hamper progress. The "red hat" may for a time still make  one's head impervious to wind and rain, but following the  suppression of the "theory of the economic ingredients" [i.e.  residual ingredients of other systems being maintained in the  dominating economic system] this attitude may lose its  effectiveness in the not too far away future. One has to get out  from this "zone or error."  <H3>  Continuing the Unreasonable Distribution System, Being Free  of Them and Yet Seeking the Restraints of Conventions </H3>   A considerable number of private enterprise executives will  either not dare to do anything unconventional and unorthodox  because of their narrow mode of thinking; or will, on the other  hand, under the residual influence of the old distribution  pattern of the public-owned enterprises--some of these persons  having only recently changed over from a public-owned enterprise  "feeding trough"--continue, consciously or unconsciously, the  lump sum gross payroll distribution method that has been used  all along by the state-run and collective enterprises. They will  not dare take even half a step beyond what they assume as safe  territory. Although these private enterprises are not at all  unaware of the fact that they are now closely emulating the  distribution system of the public-owned enterprises, they will  still, wrongheadedly and erroneously, claim that they are giving  a brilliant show of a law-abiding, rule-obeying attitude in  their business operations, and that they are the modern type of  private enterprises. In actual fact it is precisely this  distribution system, now continued in docile conformity with  conventions, that obliterates the flexibility in distribution in  the private enterprises and weakens the most significant  advantage of private enterprises. At present, all public  enterprises strenuously endeavor in their reform efforts to  break out from the constraints of their former conventions,  widen the grading in distributions, gain the ability to raise or  lower, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of all cadre, staff,  and workers. The private enterprises, on the other hand, move in  the opposite direction, is that not sad. For all these reasons,  the private enterprises are urged to stop assimilating with the  public enterprises in these respects and are urged to go their  own way, which they really ought to go.  <H5>  With Loud Booms and Bangs, a Craving for Hollow Reputation </H5>   Recently, some private enterprises of quite some proportions  underwent a change in that they abandoned their former spirit of  frugality and turned away from their arduous and thrifty ways of  trading and marketing. Now, their invitations to symposia went  out to all over the world, just as the large public-run and  collective enterprises used to do. On the occasion of its fifth  anniversary, one private enterprise did not shrink from spending  a million yuan to hire a plane for highly placed personalities  to come from Beijing and other places for the celebration,  arranged an order-placing meeting, and was seeking to gain a  hollow reputation rather than achievements of substance. These  acts result to a large extent from the old mode of business  operations and marketing practiced by the public enterprises. At  present all state-run and collective enterprises are eager to  adopt the strong points of the private enterprises; they are  continuously improving themselves. If the private enterprises  are so very much bent on emulating the old ways of the public  enterprises of doing business and marketing, what "strong  points" will there be left in them? Only by getting out of that  "zone or errors" will they be able to regain their vitality.</p>

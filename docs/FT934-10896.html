			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti asks banks for further Pounds 7m funds FERRANTI, the troubled defence electronics group, has asked its banks to provide an additional Pounds 7m in funds while it seeks to persuade shareholders to accept GEC's 1p-a-share bid. Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, said yesterday he was optimistic that the banks would respond positively to Ferranti's request 'by the end of this week.' The group made a presentation to the banks on Monday. He added that the need to seek additional bank funds highlighted the seriousness of Ferranti's position and reiterated that the only alternative to GEC's bid, however unpopular, was receivership. Nevertheless, Mr Anderson acknowledged that the recommended GEC offer faced a number of significant 'hurdles,' not least the opposition of some individual shareholders. About 10 per cent of Ferranti's outstanding equity is held by some 40,000 investors. Many individual shareholders have reacted angrily to the token offer by GEC which promises them just Pounds 10m while at least Pounds 110m will go to the banks. They have commissioned Katz Associates, a City investment consultancy, to explore alternatives to the GEC bid. GEC has made it clear that it is seeking the acceptance of at least 90 per cent of all classes of shareholders for the bid. Ferranti has a particularly complicated share structure, and this requirement is acknowledged to be a significant obstacle by Ferranti. But one Mr Anderson maintains must nevertheless be overcome. Mr John Katz, who heads Katz Associates, met Mr Anderson on Monday to convey shareholders' concerns about the terms of the bid. Mr Anderson in turn emphasised that there was no alternative bidder for the group, and that the GEC offer was 'better than nothing.' Mr Katz said after the meeting that he had not been 'pacified.' However, Mr Anderson said Ferranti planned to try and persuade shareholders to back the GEC bid through a communications offensive, which would probably be launched over the weekend.</p>

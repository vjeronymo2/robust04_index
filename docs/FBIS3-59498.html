Faced with Enormous  Hurdles, Numerous Developers Have to Give Up"]    [Text] The site of the wrongdoing is Goettingen.  Unbeknownst to the innovative-shy management, engineers for  Fischer and Porter, manufacturers of measuring instruments, are  accomplishing things independently of any bureaucratic process  of authorization and without arousing any suspicion. For weeks,  the highly motivated tinkerers have been pursuing a product  idea. They have been clandestinely siphoning off funds from  other development projects, building a prototype and testing it  on their annual leave time.    After six months now, the conspirators are presenting to a  nonplused management the first measured-dose device that will  control the operation of bottling plants for foodstuffs and  medicines with milliliter precision. Department head Frank Otto  gushes gleefully: "The system currently ranks among our  promising future products with annual growth rates of up to 30  percent."    The case of the Goetting developers is symptomatic of the  research climate in Germany. In the land of the philosophers,  fresh ideas are not raised. For fear of financial risks,  innovations are, in fact, often nipped in the bud or else they  get hung up in the tangle of management wrangles, petty  departmental rivalries or support guidelines. And if, despite  this, they do get launched, there is a shortage of capital or  management quite simply stifles their transformation into  successful products. In order to skirt such obstructionism, the  few really creative German researchers currently tinker  furtively 10-20 percent of their time. This is the alarming  conclusion reached in an empirical study by Peter Augsdoerfer, a  doctoral candidate at the University of Sussex in Brighton,  England.    Creative individuals fare similarly. In the Federal  Republic,  geniuses, those bursts of color in the day-to-day dullness of  research, are hardly welcomed any longer. Their work is  routinely frustrated.    The debate on the position of the research and development  sectors continues to intensify. This is because the country that  went on to become one of the world's major economic powers  through trailblazing inventions like the automobile, turbine,  plastic, aspirin, chemical dyes, machine tools and countless  anti-pollution systems, is running out of creative steam.  According to Martin Benkenstein, professor of innovation  management in Rostock, that means an "installment-plan death  sentence" for Germany.    It cannot be attributed to insufficient support for  research.  There is hardly any other country that pumps so much money into  this sector. Last year, industry alone made nearly DM47.5  billion available. In turn, organized creativity in major  research, universities and research institutes costs the  Federation and the states DM33 billion. Representing a 2.58  percent share of the gross domestic product, only Japan (3.04  percent) and the U.S. (2.78 percent) are on a comparable level.  But Hartmut Weule, managing director for research at  Daimler-Benz AG, adjusts the ratios: fewer than DM5 billion  (interview page 112) go for future projects.    That may be one of many reasons why, compared with Japanese  and American success stories, the output of innovative products  is alarmingly scant or at least drags on for too long. As a  study surveying over 2,000 research projects from 164 companies,  by the Duesseldorf corporate consultancy firm of Kienbaum and  partners reveals, on average, it takes almost 10 years in  Germany to reach the threshold of profitability.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Reduced Status                                                              |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number (as percentage) of German firms that allocate 0, up to 5, 5-10 and o-|  |ver 10 percent of their turnover for research                               |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Research  |          |0         |up to 5   |5-10      |over 10   |No data   |  |allocatio-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |ns as per-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |centage o-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |f turnover|          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All firms |1990      |52        |19        |12        |8         |9         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |48        |19        |16        |9         |8         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry  |1990      |44        |24        |15        |10        |7         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |42        |23        |18        |10        |7         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commerce  |1990      |65        |13        |10        |8         |4         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |60        |18        |10        |8         |4         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Services  |1990      |61        |11        |8         |8         |12        |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |55        |11        |16        |11        |7         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Firms wit-|1990      |54        |22        |14        |6         |4         |  |h a turno-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |ver of up |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |to DM5 mi-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |llion     |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |50        |18        |18        |8         |6         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DM5-10 mi-|1990      |58        |15        |19        |8         |0         |  |llion     |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |54        |15        |19        |12        |0         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Over DM10 |1990      |47        |23        |11        |9         |10        |  |million   |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1993      |44        |24        |17        |8         |7         |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: F-|          |          |          |          |          |WIRTSCHAF-|  |ORSA      |          |          |          |          |          |TSWOCHE   |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------      No wonder corporate and industrial researchers are  increasingly worried about their competitiveness. In full page  advertisements, BASF director Juergen Strube sees the  "propitious climate for innovation" jeopardized. Hans-Juergen  Warnecke, president of the Fraunhofer Society, is already  alluding to a "crisis in innovation." Most German firms share  this alarming assessment. Commissioned by WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, the  Dortmund Forsa Institute discovered that only 34 percent of  surveyed firms find the current research climate stimulating.  Nearly 38 percent feel it is rather inhibiting. An additional 28  percent found themselves unable to render a verdict. Another  result is also upsetting: almost 50 percent of those surveyed  blithely declared that they did not have a single penny left  over for research.    Paul Krueger must have sensed the disaster. In order to  salvage what is still salvageable, the federal minister of  research and technology hurriedly latched onto an idea of his  predecessor, Matthias Wissmann and in late September he set up  the "research and technology panel" to steer Germany out of its  innovation lethargy. Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler Benz, and  Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the board at Siemens AG, are  also members of the illustrious panel that has seven top  representatives each from the business and academic worlds and  one trade union member.    The research policy seminar will have to probe deeply into  the subject. This is because the reasons for the technological  deficiencies are to found not so much in the oft lamented long  and drawn out authorization process, a society that is hostile  to technology or too little support for research. Only one of  ever two entrepreneurs bewails these things (see page 103). The  fundamental trouble is the fear of risk taking. In the harshly  worded judgment of Fraunhofer's director Warnecke: "Companies  have grown lethargic. Decision making is delegated because no  one has the courage to take a risk."    Worse yet, with increasing frequency, whether at  universities, research institutes, or the companies' own R&amp;D  divisions, fainthearted doubters and a gargantuan bureaucratic  Moloch are quashing the creativity of nimble-minded  trailblazers. This is a fatal strategy, since, the Kienbaum  study indicates, on average, a single successful innovation  requires 68 individual ideas. And more than 80 percent of these  derive from a tiny group of highly talented researchers who,  according to Rolf Berth, the study's author, "are, in fact,  almost compulsively unable to leave anything just as it is."    Such employees are commonly brushed aside as oddballs and  tolerated at best. As a consequence, most geniuses are  meanwhile, in Berth's words, "frustrated outsiders." As  summarized by the Kienbaum author: the "organized obstruction"  of their ideas is "the chief culprit for Germany's waning  innovativeness."    Wolfgang Ehrfeld is a prime example of a researcher who was  foiled this way. Originally, the physicist, with the approval of  his superiors, wanted to develop a cost-effective process for  enriching uranium. In the mid-seventies he proposed to the  Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center [KfK] a micro-engineering  production process for a so-called thermal diffusion nozzle. But  after the development of another technique, the  ultra-centrifuge, it turned out that the nozzle would not bring  in any return. Still, the physicist was unwilling to see the  Liga process, as he called it, simply die off. "With it we can  establish an entirely new generation of engineering, apart from  nuclear engineering," he rhapsodized to the KfK management.    But Ehrfeld's persistence was reciprocated with little  enthusiasm. KfK bigwigs were interested exclusively in nuclear  engineering. Since Ehrfeld refused to have the notion squelched,  the holder of over 30 patents essentially got involved in  starting up the Microparts company to commercialize the process.    He needed official support to do so. He submitted one  application after another. But the bureaucracy kept demanding  more paperwork. When the file was virtually overflowing the  government banged shut with ruthless arbitrariness, alleging  that no one could any longer peruse it. The researcher was  brusquely turned down and not much more remained of the  previously promised injection of financing from the North  Rhine-Westphalian ministry of science.    Only on the third attempt 20 years after his idea, is  Ehrfeld  now able fully to settle down in his field. Supported by the  Rhineland-Palatinate's science minister, Rainer Bruederle, the  entrepreneurial minded scientist, over the past two years, has  founded the Institute for Micro-Engineering [IMM] GmbH in Mainz.  Since then, with over 100 employees, it ranks as one of the  pillars of German micro-engineering research.    For Hans Dietmar Sauer, chairman of the board of the  Baden-Wuerttemberg regional credit bank, Ehrfeld's running the  gauntlet of official channel is systemic. Just the application  procedures, he stews, are "tangled and protracted." The  documentation required to justify an application is "just  overdone." Above all, absent the assistance of professional  subsidy advisers, it is hardly possible to fill out the forms of  the research bureaucracy in Brussels. "Only large companies can  afford their own specialists for EC research programs,"  complains Sauer.    Yet, on the other hand, there is scarcely any funding  available if it entails the development and introduction of new  products which is always laden with risk. Although there are in  Germany 90 companies that claim to shore up founders of  companies with risk capital, most are subsidiaries of large  banks and dread risk as much as their parent banks. This leaves  a handful of courageous professional venture-capital companies  that so far, however, have invested only DM500 million in  revolutionary ideas and products.    Other methods of obtaining capital too are virtually off  limits for domestic innovators. For example, the hurdles for  access to Germany's stock markets are practically insuperable  for fledgling high-tech firms. Banks play no part in the  placement for the same reasons they adduce for their restrictive  awarding of credit. And telephone contact, the only market open  to high-tech firms lacking bank assistance is insufficiently  liquid with turnovers of, at most, a couple hundred shares per  day.    Worse yet, there happen to fledgling firms in the new  federal  states that often cannot even offer the banks property or  production resources as collateral. That is what the energy  department of Matech GmbH in Ostritz, west of Goerlitz in den  Ruin, did. It primarily wanted to build wind-power systems and  small hydroelectric and wood burning power plants. But start-up  costs were too high. "There is a market out there for that."  Johannes Schaefer, who was in charge of marketing, is absolutely  sure of it.    The same problem confronted Peter Klein, marketing expert  for  image processing systems. He started up Tom Tech GmbH in Eching  bei Munich and within three years, using ultra-sound technology,  he developed a new system of medical technology that aroused the  enthusiasm of physicians. It provides three-dimensional images  of the inside of the human body with no impact on patients'  health. Such images facilitate diagnosis, especially of heart  diseases.    At first, everything went as planned. After the patent  application, Atlas Venture GmbH joined in, willing to take on  risk. According to Klein: "Even government research support was  nearly clinched."    The first rude awakening occurred when Tom Tech's founder  could contemplate gaining a market. Klein complains: "All at  once we fell into a deep financing hole." Tom Tech still needs  nearly DM10 million to develop the market through advertising,  creation of a sales force and the manufacture of demonstration  equipment. But the banks that were approached turned a cold  shoulder.    As a result, the company is going abroad. In June, the first  of a total 24 employees moved into the new headquarters in  Chicago. Right now, over there, investors are waiting in line.  The reason is that in the U.S., not only can venture capital be  marshaled more quickly, but even stock market access is easier.  In addition to the New York and American Stock Exchanges, the  National Association of Security Dealers and Quotations [NASDAQ]  is, above all, a bubbling source of financing. Several thousand  high-tech firms are registered with it. With such financial  assistance, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Lotus grew into  large firms.    But companies themselves could do something to expedite  innovations. They would first save on costs and, second, reap  earlier profits. Simultaneous engineering is one of the tools  that can be used to achieve this objective. It entails experts  with different specializations working simultaneously on partial  solutions for an innovative product. Constant and intensive  communication is a prerequirement for success. According to the  Kienbaum study, a mere four percent of German companies  routinely make use of methods originating in Japan for  expediting research projects. Even more disgraceful is that 70  percent of the surveyed companies are not even aware of the  concept.    Reis GmbH and Co. Maschinenfabrik, a manufacturer of robots,  was among the first to have pulled off an astoundingly  successful simultaneous engineering project. The prototype of a  highly sophisticated forging manipulator was completed in the  record time of only nine months. Development costs that normally  would have amounted to DM1.6 million, were cut to DM1 million.  The service outlay for the prototypes was halved. The  Obernburgers even met the most ambitious of all objectives.  Managing director Walter Reis recalls: "We wanted to lower the  price by 40 percent, and we did it."    In early 1992 he had summoned to the conference table all  the  employees who would ever be involved with the projected robot:  service and sales personnel, suppliers, control experts,  mechanical engineers and designers. In this way, from the  outset, the company avoided partial solutions that would have  entailed high production costs. The maintenance engineers, in  turn, lodged their veto opportunely, when the equipment's design  threatened to impact on ease of servicing. Reis promises: "We  will henceforth design new models using only this method."    In the tiny Black Forest hamlet of Schramberg, Junghans  Uhren  GmbH managed a similar feat of prestidigitation. Three small  development teams there, including Oskar Flaig, who is even yet  an accomplished horologist, together with marketing and  designers, every year are turning out a product that is the  first of kind in the world in the clock radio sector. The fourth  group, according to Wolfgang Ganter, director of the R&amp;D  division, is "responsible for visions that allow us to progress  in the development of timepieces."    The latest vision is a new model that should finally win  Junghans an international market. It will be controlled not by  earthbound transmitters, as is presently the case, but by  satellites that will calibrate every point on earth. Currently  used time signals transmitted by ground stations in Europe, the  U.S. and Japan, each have a range of only 1,500 kilometers.  <H5>  Penalized Courage </H5>   Normally, at least, economic success is based on dazzling  engineering that also is environmentally friendly and on  entrepreneurial courage. For Munich's Technocell AG, however,  this combination led to disaster. Bavarian Zellstoff GmbH, a  subsidiary in which the new engineering was performed, collapsed  under the burden of DM490 million in obligations.    The formerly successful paper manufacturer had developed a  new process for obtaining high quality cellulose. It financed  this on its own, with no contributions from the federal minister  for research and development's sponsorship fund. In their  original factory in the Pasing section of the city, the valiant  group from Munich built the pilot plant and optimized the  process until it was appropriate for serial application. The  cellulose activities were combined in a joint venture,  Organocell Thyssen GmbH, in which Technocell and Duesseldorf''s  Thyssen Handelsunion AG each held a 50 percent share.    But at present, however, managing director Gerhard Dahlmann  is purely preoccupied with still rescuing his company and its  technical know-how. No further financial resources can be  expected from Technocell and Thyssen seems to have lost its  enjoyment in the enterprise.    The self-styled Organocell process yields an especially  tear-proof cellulose that can be processed into high quality  paper. Unlike the conventional technique that environmental  considerations precluded from Germany, the new process does not  pollute the air or have polluted effluent. Large quantities of  cellulose of this quality are imported exclusively from abroad,  mostly from Scandinavia and Canada. The Organocell process  afforded the German paper industry an opportunity to free itself  of this dependency. It also offered the possibility of using  domestic conifer woods that otherwise have scarcely any economic  potential, for the production of paper.    Technocell (1989 turnover: nearly DM350 million) therefore  confidently freed up a cool DM530 million to reengineer the  run-down cellulose factory in Kelheim an der Donau into one of  the most modern and environmentally friendly plants in the  world. At the time, critics warned about the technical problems  that surface in directly transitioning from a small pilot plant  to a large engineering application. But these could be mostly  solved. Finally and inauspiciously, there were the financing  costs. On top of this, the new process is not economical at the  current extremely low prices for cellulose.    The last alternative for rescue would be a potential  purchaser. But there is none in sight anywhere around. No  wonder, for as long as cellulose is allowed to be produced  abroad cheaply and with damage to the environment, there is no  prospect for the better, albeit more expensive, alternative.</p>

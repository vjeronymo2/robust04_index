			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A SUSBSTANTIAL PORTION OF AMERICANA AT MARY'S LAMB  </P> <P> Cute. That's the word for the new, larger Mary's Lamb, which has moved up  Ventura Boulevard to 10820 in Studio City. (The phone number is (818)  505-6120.) It's wholesome, all-American look -- stenciled floor, walls covered  with quilts and creamers that look like cows -- goes perfectly with its  wholesome, all-American food.  </P> <P> Even at lunchtime, there's jam on the table -- to slather on top of the  biscuits that are sitting in the breadbasket. Lunch offerings include a large  </P> <P> chopped salad filled with large chunks of chicken, avocado, bacon and cheese.  There are good sandwiches (the cheese and grilled-onion topped meatloaf is  memorable), various pastas and a fritata or two. Dinner offerings are along the  same lines, but more substantial. If you like, you can also eat food from the  take-out section (including fine fried chicken) while sitting at your table.  And don't forget the all-American desserts: the banana-walnut cake is straight  off the farm. RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Observer: Buying the BIS Private investors in the Bank for International Settlements will be watching carefully the change of guard when Andrew Crockett, international director of the Bank of England, takes over as general manager. Investors? Yes, strange to tell, some 16 per cent of the stock in the secretive central bankers' central bank can be bought and sold in a European stock exchange. When the institution was created in 1930 to recycle German reparations after the first world war, the equity was divided up between member central banks. But the US declined to take up its share allocation, and part of the French and Belgian tranches were also released, all to be traded publicly, though without voting rights. Last Friday, in the 'over-the-counter' section of the Basle stock exchange, one BIS share, from the most liquid, American quota, was trading at SFr9400 (Pounds 4,335). The share, which by virtue of the bank's vast gold reserves is one of the safest and cheapest gold-related securities around, can currently be bought at a 31 per cent discount to net asset value. When the precious metal is really hot, the shares have historically commanded a small premium. The intriguing part for the true optimist is, that, if the bank's hidden assets, including tracts of valuable land around Basle, are included, brokers actually calculate the shares to be worth nearer Dollars 18,000 each. As a prudent central banker, Crockett will no doubt be wise to the sirens who whisper that the over-capitalised bank ought one day return some of its enormous wealth to shareholders via a special dividend.</p>

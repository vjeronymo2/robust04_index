			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the republic  of Kosova, sent a letter to the governments of NATO member  countries, in which he supports the ultimatum of this alliance  on withdrawal of artillery from Sarajevo. This ultimatum is a  brave step, Dr. Bukoshi states, to be distinguished from the  previous threats of the West, which were not realized. Those  threats only made the aggressor brave and diminished the  credibility of international powers.    Peace in the Balkans is not possible without resolving the  Kosova crisis, Prime Minister Bukoshi stresses further on in the  letter. Kosova once again asks the United States to intensify  pressures against the Belgrade regime so as to interrupt the  systematic oppression against the Albanian people in Kosova,  Bukoshi underlines.    In this letter, Prime Minister Bukoshi asks the West to  influence the return democratic institutions and international  observers to Kosova, as well as to respect the elementary rights  of 2 million Albanians in Kosova. If an immediate preventive  action is taken, there is still time for the international  community to enable a peaceful solution to the question of  Kosova before its citizens face the tragedy and horror that can  be of greater proportions than what is happening in Bosnia,  prime minister of the republic of Kosova writes among other  things in his letter addressed to the governments of NATO member  countries.</p>

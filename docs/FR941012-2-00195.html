This document will be re-published annually with any changes or additions specifically highlighted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice also provides the grant applicant with a single Signature Page, allowing the grant applicant and its attorney to certify compliance with all of the certifications and assurances pertinent to any and all grants for which the grant applicant wishes to apply in fiscal year 1995, (see Appendix B.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, FTA has introduced two new electronic programs for applicants. The On-Line Grantee Program is offered to applicants through the Grant Management Information System (GMIS). This is a computerized system designed to assist the grantee with the management of grant projects and budgets. All grant applicants are encouraged to participate in the On-Line Grantee Program, which includes the opportunity to electronically certify compliance for all certifications and assurances as shown in Appendix A. The Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative (EGMM) is a new pilot program currently offered to selected grantees who will be able to actually apply for a grant electronically. Both programs are designed to aid FTA grant applicants by reducing time and paper. Applicants are asked to contact their Regional Office shown above for more information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the past, applicants for FTA grants have submitted a variety of certifications and assurances with each application. Subsequently, an applicant was required to reaffirm compliance with the earlier certifications and assurances with a Statement of Continued Validity submitted with each application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the publication of this Notice, certifications and assurances for Federal mass transportation assistance grants will for the first time be contained in one document. This marks the beginning of an effort to assist grant applicants in reducing time and paper work in certifying compliance with various Federal laws and regulations. It coincides with the pilot program for the Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative and the On-Line Grantee Program described above, which will further reduce the time required to process a grant application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to keep an applicant well informed of its responsibility to meet the requirements of Federal transit laws, and aware of changes, deletions or additions to those requirements, this compilation will be published annually in conjunction with the publication of the agency's annual apportionment Notice, which allocates funds in accordance with the latest annual appropriations act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This publication of certifications and assurances therefore supersedes the requirements of FTA Circular 9100.1B, dated July 1, 1988, ``Standard Assurances for Urban Mass Transportation Administration Applications,'' which is being rescinded. Other affected Circulars will be revised accordingly. This publication also supersedes the requirement to submit the Statement of Continued Validity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Commander Esteban, and Commander Franklin [Israel Galeano  Cornejo] met with Monsignor Juan Abelardo Mata Guevara, the  bishop of Esteli, on 20 January in Los Arados community, El  Jicaro jurisdiction, Nueva Segovia. The commanders told the  monsignor that changes in government policies and in the  National Assembly and the more subdued tone and policies of  General Humberto Ortega have motivated the 3-80 Northern Front  [FN 3-80] to change its strategy and renew its dialogue with the  government.    Msgr. Juan Abelardo Mata and a number of priests from Esteli  Diocese, members of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo's  Verification Committee, members of the Pro-Human Rights  Association, El Jicaro Deputy Mayor Alba Iris Rivera Rivera, and  Commanders Esteban and Franklin analyzed the sociopolitical  situation and the changes in government policies. They decided  to continue talks with the government and proposed new  discussion points, among them a cease-fire and relocation of  members of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] and the FN 3-80.    Another point proposed by the group led by El Chacal [Jose  Angel Talavera] is the incorporation of FN 3-80 members into the  police force in areas where the front has a strong social base  and the creation of programs and projects for remaining members  to help reincorporate them into civilian life.    Other points proposed by the FN 3-80 high command include  the  discussion of a demobilization calendar. Demobilization will be  proportionate to government compliance with its social programs.  The FN 3-80 also seeks guarantees for the security of its  demobilized men and their reincorporation into civilian life so  they can continue their struggle in a civic manner through the  Nicaraguan Resistance Party.    During the meeting between the FN 3-80 and His Eminence  Msgr.  Juan Abelardo Mata, the FN 3-80 said the two men described by  the EPS as 3-80 Northern Front deserters are mere criminals.    Msgr. Abelardo Mata will take the agreed upon proposals  before the government. The parties agreed to hold another  meeting, but neither a date nor a place has been specified. The  good faith of the members of the FN 3-80 guarantees, however,  that they will not continue their armed struggle in the  country's northern mountains.</p>

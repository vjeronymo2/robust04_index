			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> DEDICATION FOR OVERDUE EXHIBIT HALL  </P> <P> Tonight Anaheim officials and community residents will dedicate the newest  addition to the Anaheim Convention Center.  </P> <P> In opening ceremonies for Hall D, Mayor Fred Hunter will pitch the first ball  from the mound of a temporary baseball diamond constructed inside the new space  to illustrate the roominess of the 150,000-square-foot exhibit area.  </P> <P> But amid the festivities there is bound to be grumbling about the Taylor  Woodrow Construction Co., whom the city claims was just over six months late in  completing the $30-million expansion.  </P> <P> "It's hurt us," said Hunter, citing both lost revenue and damage to the  center's reputation.  </P> <P> The exhibit hall, a parking structure of the same size and an additional  adjacent parking structure have been under construction since May, 1988. The  additions were scheduled to be finished on Feb. 27.  </P> <P> According to Taylor Woodrow Vice President William Ostfield, the hall "has been  usable for its intended purpose since June 4, 1990."  </P> <P> However, the city maintains that the hall was not ready for use until the  middle of this month.  </P> <P> "It could've been built in 20 months. . . . It's just been a battle throughout  the whole thing," said Gary Binger, Taylor Woodrow project manager. "There have  been numerous problems relating to subcontractors, architects and the owners.  There's also our own problems. . . . We don't claim to be totally innocent, but  we don't feel totally responsible."  </P> <P> Taylor-Woodrow's contract with the city holds the company liable for damages of  $5,000 for each day past the Feb. 27 deadline that construction was incomplete.  Taylor Woodrow has declined to specify reasons for the delay but plans to file  claims with the city explaining the problems in coming weeks.  </P> <P> A few dozen trade shows were counting on the new hall to house their  attractions, and the city has lost still untabulated revenues from these shows.  The convention center generates about $1 billion in revenues annually.  </P> <P> One tenant, International Tile Exposition, filed a $20-million suit against the  city in May and sought a temporary injunction to use the facility.  </P> <P> That injunction was denied, but the suit still stands, charging the city with  misrepresentation and breach of contract. The city claims that it is not liable  under the contract.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow, which has been under fire for its construction delays at John  Wayne Airport, notified the city last November that the convention center  project would not be finished until May, 1990.

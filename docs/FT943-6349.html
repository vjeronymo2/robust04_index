			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Technology: What's the object? - The answer to making tailored software in record time is close at hand Technology that could solve one of the biggest problems facing computer users - the length of time that it takes to develop application programs tailored to the specific requirements of a business - is on the horizon. Recently, Taligent, a joint venture between IBM, Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard, unveiled the results of a six-year effort to develop 'object technology' that could revolutionise the way software programs are created. Taligent is one of a handful of companies pursuing the goal of creating a set of rules that will enable software developers to create unique programs through the use of software components known as objects. Software objects will work together in much the same way that off-the-shelf semiconductor chips can be used to build a desktop personal computer or a multi-billion dollar supercomputer. Object technology could have an enormous impact if it fulfils its promise of faster applications development. A survey of Fortune 1,000 companies by Taligent in 1993 found that, in many cases, the time taken to develop a custom application can eclipse the business opportunity it is designed to support. 'One large company told me that during the 12 months it would take to rewrite the software for their billing systems, they would lose more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in revenues,' says Bud Tribble, vice-president of SunSoft, Sun Microsystems' software subsidiary. The contribution of object technology would be seen as having made a 'profound change in our industry'. However, the development of object technology - in which software code is reused as much as possible by creating self-contained programs (objects) for specific tasks - has not been easy. The concepts were pioneered at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre. Xerox researchers developed SmallTalk, the first object-based software language, in the 1970s. The first company to offer a commercial object operating system was Next Computer, founded in 1985 by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Next is currently the market leader with its NextStep software used by customers in financial markets such as Chrysler Financial, the credit arm of US car manufacturer Chrysler, and in healthcare markets by companies such as Abbott Labs. Apple began work on its object software system, code-named Pink, in the late 1980s. It then formed Taligent with IBM in March 1992 to finish the project. Hewlett-Packard joined Taligent in early 1994 with the purchase of a 15 per cent stake. Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, has also been working on developing object-based software for the past three years with its object linking and embedding technology. It plans to introduce an object-based operating system (code-named Cairo) in 1996, giving its popular Windows system software the ability to support object software applications. 'We believe that object technology represents the industrial revolution of software development and that it will be essential for business application development,' says Paul Flessner, senior product manager for enterprise computing at Microsoft. Many US computer companies plan to offer object-based software development systems believing that it will help sell hardware. Tim Bailey, strategic program manager for objects at Hewlett-Packard, says: 'There is a tremendous demand for objects among our customers. The potential benefits to organisations from object technology are impressive.' Jobs, for example, claims that an 18-month software development project could be cut down to two months or less with NextStep. While there are many supporters of object-based software development, not everyone is convinced about the dramatically faster application development claims. 'It's a standard salesman's pitch,' says William Zachmann, president of Canopus Research. 'Companies have been making such claims since the 1960s and 1970s. The fact is that developing these custom applications is very difficult. There are numerous layers of complexity that have to be dealt with. There is no guarantee that object technology will make this job easier.' In order for object-based software to become more widely used, several issues have to be settled. These include the definition of industry standards. The main standards effort is being led by the Object Management Group (OMG), an organisation with more than 420 member companies, and its Common Object Request Broker Architecture (Corba) standard. But there is no guarantee that the Corba standard will be followed by everyone. Microsoft, for example, is a member of the OMG and says it will support industry standards, but it is nevertheless developing its own specifications which are different from Corba. Next is also hoping that its NextStep software will become an industry standard. Uncertainty over which object technologies will succeed has led some companies to back several at once. Hewlett-Packard intends to offer object-based systems from Taligent, Microsoft and Next. 'We have an open object strategy,' explains Bailey. 'Different markets are using different tools. Finance companies, for example, are using NextStep while communications companies are using C++ (an object computer language). We are following our customers.' Digital Equipment Corporation, the US computer maker, is pursuing a similar strategy. It has agreed to offer NextStep on its computers but it also plans to support Microsoft's object-based software. Sun Microsystems has chosen to stick with one company and has made a Dollars 10m investment in Next. It will combine NextStep with its own object technology called Distributed Objects Environment. Education is another issue that must be considered. 'Training and mentoring services are very important to ensure that customers succeed with object technology,' says Richard Dym, vice president of marketing at ParcPlace Systems, the developer of SmallTalk-based application development tools. Training is important because object-based software development represents a radical departure from the way most programmers have been taught to write applications. 'Some programmers just aren't open to change and they don't want to be retrained,' says Flessner. To undertake a serious object-based software development effort, companies would need to retrain some of their programmers and then spend a year or more planning and developing the first object applications. Even then, the cost/benefits of using object technology might not be seen until well into the second or third year.</p>

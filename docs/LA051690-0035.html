			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMEDY  </P> <P> Unfunny Returns for Comedy Benefit: The organizers of a Monday night benefit  for homeless children at several area comedy clubs are not happy with the  results.  </P> <P> Despite appearences by Sam Kinison, Bobcat Goldthwait and Richard Belzer, the  Comedy for Harmony shows only raised $5,000, about one-fourth of the expected  total. "This is a huge disappointment," said Carla Chadwick, founder of the  Harmony Project. "The public just did not come out and support us." Among the  10 clubs hosting the shows were the Improvisation in West Hollywood, the Ice  House in Pasadena and L.A. Cabaret in Encino.GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic by </F> Jose Ramiro Villapadierna in Zagreb; date not given]    [Text] Zagreb -- He has been working 18 hours per day  since he took office. He insists that he is not a politician  but a businessman, insists on his being allowed to work, and  insists that "I never grant interviews," because the economy or  the war "are very important matters to be summarized and then  interpreted well." He has governed under the pressure from the  lobby of the Croats of Herzegovina, and, despite his successes,  he wants everything to be over soon so that he can return to the  world of business.    [Villapadierna] Does the communist system still weigh  heavily, with the streets full of people at 1100?    [Valentic] People are not only on the streets instead of  working; we also have the highest percentage of pensioners in  Europe. The change with respect to communism is that we make  sure of our resources before spending them; previously, they  used to spend and then look for somebody to pay. In situations  of severe inflation of around 10,000 percent per year, everybody  can be businessmen, but the burden falls on the people who are  increasingly poor. It is always easier to make the currency  rise artificially on the black market and thereby meet your  losses than dismiss 20 percent of the workers, buy new  technology, and be competitive. This process will take around  10 years; bear in mind that Germany has been investing in its  eastern part for four years, and they have not resolved more  than 20 percent [sentence as published].    [Villapadierna] How much are you spending on arms and on  receiving refugees?    [Valentic] We have 600,000 refugees -- that is, 15 percent  of our population -- in the free part of Croatia, since the  other 25 percent remains occupied; even this part has also been  largely ruined. Tourism, which was our economic mainstay  (between 3 billion and 4 billion [currency unspecified]), has  also been destroyed, as has the energy system. We have had to  raise 6 billion German marks [DM] in foreign debt, because  Belgrade took all the Yugoslav reserves. I will not conceal the  expenditure from you, although it is before parliament. Out of  a budget of DM5.2 billion, around 35 percent is for defense,  which is not excessive for being at war, and 20 percent is taken  up by caring for the hundreds of thousands of refugees. Just  imagine: If these resources were earmarked for restructuring  the economy, Croatia would be reborn in two years.    [Villapadierna] When can the former Yugoslavia's property  held by Belgrade be shared out?    [Valentic] Some far-off day; Yugoslavia will not join the  normal economic systems, and Serbia, for its part, will do all  that it can to delay settlements. Slovenia, Macedonia, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina are involved, and some day Serbia will have  to give in. We know very well each republic's share of the  social product; Croatia's was 27 percent. The problem is that  the Serbs will spend everything; they are spending even the part  which is frozen.    [Villapadierna] With the Bosnian federation, have you not  handed the plan's destruction to Karadzic on a platter? It is  sufficient for the Serbs to say that they accept, only for the  Croats then to withdraw, and it will all be over.    [Valentic] You are right to say that the Serbs have the  decisive say. A federation with them or without them will not  be the same thing. To be honest, the problem of Bosnia and  Herzegovina is the most complex and crucial of the present-day  world, but, indisputably, there is always a solution in  politics; normally, it is the least bad.    [Villapadierna] Will Bosnia be divided?    [Valentic] This war is drawing to a close. At last, four  forces -- the United States, Russia, the Islamic world, and the  European Union -- are coming together for this to end. To be  specific, there are two options: One is for the Serbs to agree  to join the Bosnian federation; the other is for them to say  "no," and in that event the Muslims and Croats would federate in  order then to confederate with Croatia. There are many nuances,  but there is only one thing clear: We will effect no kind of  integration reminiscent of the former Yugoslavia, nor does any  of the powers believe so now.    [Villapadierna] When will Croatia join the Council of  Europe?    [Valentic] There are some terms which Croatia has had to  fulfill: I believe that we have done so and that some criticisms  are unfair; a country which is emerging from communism and at  the same time is at war cannot resolve everything in two years.  Despite the war, I believe that we have made considerable  progress in the freedom of the press, as in other areas of the  law; we have all the attributes for joining the Council of  Europe.    [Villapadierna] Your monetary policy has ended the  depreciation and inflation, but everybody believes that it is an  artificial situation.    [Valentic] Monetary policy is conducted by the Bank of  Croatia, although this forms part of a whole economic strategy.  Over the past few months we have had a zero inflation rate.  There is a coherent combination of wages, financial policy, and  the restructuring of the entire communist economy. We have  eliminated the price disparities inherited from communism and  introduced the tax system which is standard in the West; this  has increased the state budget by around 50 percent, and the  latter has seen its deficit fall by DM1 billion. We have  launched the restructuring of the economy, privatization has  been accelerated, small stockholders have begun to receive their  dividends, taxes have been cut, the average wage has risen from  DM100-200 to around DM400 at present... When I opted for free  convertibility, everybody deemed me a madman, but I knew the  makeup of our exports and opted for opening up.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Heavy offerings in the final week of the 1993/94 selling season in Australia made little difference to price levels. The market indicator finished at 624 cents a kg., only 3 cents down on the week. Competition at auctions was good, with China prominent, which is always seen as a strengthening factor. The season also ended in New Zealand with prices firm. The British wool selling season opened this week and firmer prices were correctly anticipated by the trade, though increases only amounted to one or two per cent and are not universal. Holidays are already an important factor keeping trade quit and their influence will increase and persist for the next two months. The UK wool-processing industry is busy but would be a lot happier if higher wool prices were accepted and passed on by retailers who continue to resist them.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Monks slams 'puppet' Horton The government's role in the signal workers' dispute was attacked as 'intolerable and dishonest' yesterday by Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary. He said ministers had 'intervened but wanted to appear innocent'. The TUC debate on the rail dispute came as Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for administering the system, claimed that as much as 57 per cent of the network would be open to services today during the latest 24-hour stoppage. Delegates at the TUC congress voted unanimously for a motion backing the signal workers in their 13-week-old action. The motion condemned what it described as 'the intimidatory tactics deployed by Railtrack'. The motion went on to criticise the government's 'hypocritical stance', which it said had 'been exposed by their own pay guidelines on MPs' salaries'. The motion also called on the TUC general council to make 'urgent arrangements for a national demonstration in London' in support of the signal workers. Summing up a short and highly charged debate, Mr Monks said that Railtrack was no longer directly involved in resolving the conflict. He said its strategy was being decided by a cabinet committee chaired by Mr David Hunt which did not have anybody from Railtrack on it and was briefed by a committee of officials chaired by Mr Nicholas Montagu, the transport department's deputy secretary. 'The solution to this dispute lies in the government ceasing to play Mr Horton's puppet master and in Mr Horton asserting himself as his own man,' said Mr Monks. 'At the moment the only fair assessment the British people can make is that the government doesn't care about the railways.' Mr Wilf Proudfoot, the RMT's deputy general secretary, won a three-minute standing ovation after moving the motion. 'We want a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. We are not asking for the world,' he said. Swans song, Page 9</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cluff lapses into losses CLUFF RESOURCES, the minerals, oil and gas exploration company, swung from profits of Pounds 2.25m to losses of Pounds 225,000 pre-tax for the year to end-December after taking account of an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.64m. Losses per share emerged at 2.38p (earnings 1.37p) and the dividend is passed in order to conserve cash - 1p was paid previously. The exceptional charge comprised a complete write-down of the gold mining assets in Spain. Other factors affecting the result included a lower sterling gold price and a substantial rise in interest rates in Zimbabwe. The shares dipped 1p to 11 1/2 p. The company has changed its accounting policy with regard to oil and gas exploration expenditure. The 1991 comparative figures have been restated accordingly.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE SHOOTS FOR 4TH WIN WITH WINLESS MASTER'S ON DECK  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge baseball team is off to a 3-0 start and with winless  Master's College visiting Matador Field for a nonconference game at 2:30 this  afternoon, the streak is likely to continue.  </P> <P> Northridge Coach Bill Kernen is pleased with a pitching staff that has  surrendered just one earned run in 27 innings.  </P> <P> "That's very good pitching, but it's not surprising," Kernen said. "We've  played two games away from home in places where balls do not carry very well."  </P> <P> The Matadors will get their sternest test of the season Friday when they travel  to Cal State Long Beach to play the Division I 49ers, who won their first eight  games this season under former Loyola Marymount and Valley College Coach Dave  Snow.  </P> <P> Master's disasters: Master's, which is 0-4-1 overall and 0-2 in NAIA District 3  play, has been tied or in the lead entering the ninth inning in four of its  five games.  </P> <P> "We've had a problem in the ninth throwing the ground ball for the final out,"  Master's Coach Pat Harrison said. "We've played some pretty good teams, so in  one sense it's good to know that we were within one out of winning in four of  those games."  </P> <P> Mirror, mirror on the ball: Jeff Preston, who plays first base for Master's,  has hit three home runs in the Mustangs' first five games, and the redshirt  sophomore from Placerville, Calif., says that he's doing it with mirrors.  </P> <P> "I've worked a lot on my swing over the fall," said Preston, who is batting  .357 after missing last season because of a shoulder injury. "We had a lot of  time inside and a lot of time to swing in front of mirrors and stuff like  that."  </P> <P> Walk this way: To Occidental College pitchers, the strike zone must appear to  be just a shade larger than a postage stamp.  </P> <P> In their first two games -- both losses -- Tiger pitchers allowed 23 runs and  21 walks.  </P> <P> At Cal Lutheran, it is the fielders who have failed to get a grip.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen have committed 16 errors in losing three of their first five  games.  </P> <P> No spring chickens: Coach Chuck Ferrero likes to call it Super Bowl Fever.  That's the ailment that strikes the handful of out-of-shape and over-the-hill  hopefuls who show up every spring expecting to take part in spring football  workouts at Valley College.  </P> <P> Ferrero turns them away before they step on the field.  </P> <P> "If I have never seen them or heard about them, I turn them away," Ferrero  said. "They usually don't last more than a day and a half."  </P> <P> Playoff scramble: Regional basketball playoff tournaments for California junior  colleges will begin Feb. 25, and Valley and Glendale are still in the running  for a berth.  </P> <P> Under this year's format, four Western State Conference teams will receive  automatic bids.  </P> <P> Santa Monica, the top-ranked team in the state, is in first place in the WSC  followed by Ventura, Oxnard, Glendale and Valley.  </P> <P> Representatives from the WSC, Southern California, South Coast, Orange Empire,  Foothill and Pacific Coast conferences will take part in the 26-team,  three-round Southern regional. The top four teams will advance to the state  finals March 9-11 in Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Anticlimactic: They might as well do away with the junior college state  baseball playoffs.  </P> <P> After all, odds are that the winner of this week's annual Casey Stengel  tournament at Rancho Santiago and Cerritos colleges will be the eventual state  champion.  </P> <P> In 1985, Cerritos won the Stengel tournament and went on to win the state  title. College of the Canyons did the same in 1986 and Cerritos did it again in  1987. Last season, Rancho Santiago won the tournament and finished second in  the state behind Sacramento.  </P> <P> Canyons (2-2) opens play in the eight-team tournament today against Pima  (Ariz.) at 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Hostile hosts: Cal State Northridge was not a friendly place for the University  of Manitoba (Canada) volleyball team Monday night.  </P> <P> First, Northridge staved off defeat by coming back twice in the fourth game  before going on to win the five-game match.  </P> <P> Then, after several Manitoba players retired to the locker room, they were  forced to stay there for 45 minutes after someone mistakenly locked them  inside.  </P> <P> "They finally got someone to open the door and it was like, 'Nice hospitality,'  " Northridge Coach John Price said.  </P> <P> Northridge improved to 3-4 with the victory, but the Matadors are still without  a win (0-4) in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. Northridge travels  to UC Santa Barbara tonight and Stanford on Saturday for WIVA matches.  </P> <P> The Matadors will be bolstered by the return of outside hitter Bob Samuelson  who was reinstated to the team after being suspended last week for disciplinary  reasons. Samuelson sat out Stanford's sweep over Northridge last Friday.  </P> <P> "The bottom line was miscommunication," Price said. "We talked things out on  Monday. I think he understands what I need and want from him and he told me a  couple of things that will help both of us in terms of communication."  </P> <P> Staff writers Sam Farmer, Gary Klein, Mike Hiserman and Ralph Nichols  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

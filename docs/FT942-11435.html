			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (11): Habit proves catching - Privatisation programmes are proliferating in eastern Europe The recent dearth of acquisition work in the UK has sharpened the merchant bankers' appetite for overseas adventures. These days, the archetypal Mr Ivor Ffyne-Mandate, clad in regulation pin-stripe suit and Ferragamo tie, is more likely to be rushing round the globe hawking his investment bank's financial expertise in Paris, Rome or Buenos Aires than advising on the merger of two Midlands-based metal bashers. The wave of privatsations sweeping around the world is proving their chief temptation. The UK was one of the first countries to embark on an ambitious drive to privatise state-owned assets. But for debt-laden governments, the habit is proving infectious. Some estimates suggest the value of all privatisations in western Europe may rise to Dollars 150bn over the next five years. That is equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the European Union's total gross domestic product. Big privatisation programmes are proliferating in eastern Europe and the Far East. UK merchant banks, such as SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Schroders and Rothschilds, schooled in the domestic privatisation programme, are falling over themselves to cash in on the trend. But mighty US rivals which have also been active in the UK, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers, are aggressive competitors for privatisation work, too. Fat fees can be earned advising governments how to parcel up assets to sell them to the market. There are also rewards for valuing companies and distributing their shares across the globe. The banks are hopeful of developing longer-term relationships with foreign corporate clients after the first flush of privatisation work is complete. It helps that many of the privatised companies are in sensitive fields, such as telecommunications, utilities, energy, and finance, which require some regulatory disentanglement. UK banks which gained experience helping to sell British Telecommunications, British Gas, the electricity generators and water companies are well-placed to sell their knowledge abroad. But US banks can bring particular skills to bear. For example, Morgan Stanely, which helped restructure the US telecommunications sector in the early 1980s is hopeful of winning similar work in Europe. That could prove especially lucrative given that telecommunications stocks may account for up to 25 per cent of the value of all privatised assets. The French and Italian privatisation programmes are attracting the most attention. The Balladur government had an initial list of 21 companies it wanted to transfer to the private sector. The big privatisations it has conducted so far, including BNP, Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf Aquitaine have met with keen demand from both overseas and domestic investors. But the current turbulence in the world's equity markets is causing uncertainty and will make it tricky to price forthcoming privatisations, such as that of the French insurance group UAP. There is also a fear that the sheer volume of international offerings over the next few years will swamp demand. But some observers believe the quality of recently-privatised companies should stand them in good stead. Mr Francis Maude, the former Treasury minister who now works at US investment bank Morgan Stanley, says: 'Last year was a lovely market to make these offerings and the market this year does not look as accommodating. But if in difficult markets there is a flight to quality then privatised companies should do well.' At present, the international presence and financial muscle of the big UK and US banks puts them at a comparative advantage against local competitors. But although European privatisations will open the door to new clients, they will also help create future rivals. As Mr Maude explains it: 'For most companies in most countries the right combination of advisers is a local bank and a foreign bank. But as time goes by the domestic banks become more skilled and experienced. There is a technology transfer taking place all the time. We learn more about the local market but they learn more about our skills as well.' Other financial companies, too, are keen to muscle in on privatisation deals. The big accounting and consulting firms such as Coopers &amp; Lybrand and KPMG have been active in the privatisation market. Their expertise lies in producing the accounts preparing companies for the market but they are also keen to advise on restructuring and regulatory issues. Ms Vicky Pryce, the partner in charge of KPMG privatisation unit, says: 'We can do almost everything that the banks can do except distribute the shares.' Although that deficiency locks them out of the most prestigious lead work in western Europe, the consulting firms are rapidly developing a presence in privatisation work in eastern Europe and the Far East. Ms Pryce says KPMG has particular expertise at valuing companies, restructuring them and preparing prospectuses. 'We often work alongside merchant banks and are involved in the strategy of privatisation,' she says. For example, KPMG worked alongside Rothschilds to help restructure and privatise the Hungarian telecommunications company Matav prior to a Deutsche Telekom-led consortium taking a 30 per cent stake for Dollars 875m last year.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Italians add style to vibrant streets of London - Lucia van der Post finds that business is booming and that upmarket foreign companies are flocking to England The official news is confusing - retail spending down, interest rates rumoured to be rising, the stock market falling - but no-one seems to have told the shoppers on the choicer streets of London. They seem to be responding to an entirely different beat. There is an infectious sense of optimism about. New shops are opening all over town. In certain stores some of the winter lines have completely sold out and the end of September is only just in sight. So what exactly is going on? What seems to be happening is that there are pockets of great prosperity and success. Those who realised that there was more to the last recession than just the fact that many of us had less to spend, that there had been a sea-change in the way most of us viewed the world, and addressed that shift in perception seriously, are beginning to reap the rewards. The key to success in the 1990s seems to be value for money - the absolute price scarcely seems to matter. High price-tags can move as fast as low ones provided they are perceived to offer real value. All over town, restaurants that get the formula right (Joe Allen, The Ivy, Christopher's, Aubergine) are packed out, clothing lines that have a certain pizazz as well as attractive prices are sold out, everywhere the special, the out-of-the-way, the quality ranges are doing well. Get it wrong and you might as well send straight out for Cork Gully. Much of the newly buzzing atmosphere has to do with the fact that the big department stores are falling over themselves to tempt the customers in - revamped buildings, personal shopping suites, free coffee and newspapers for the gold card set, new lines, special offers, exclusive ranges. Harrods, Selfridges, Dickins &amp; Jones, Liberty, Harvey Nichols are engaged in a bitter struggle for our hearts and purses and there is nothing like competition for improving the quality of the end product. New deals are being struck, exotic designers wooed, adventurous services broached. And it is not just the department stores - all along Bond Street the builders are busy, the skips are full, once deadly Madame shops are being replaced by livelier, more contemporary, sharper names. The scene is also being enlivened by an influx of foreigners casting a concerted vote of confidence in London's importance as a sophisticated centre of shopping and bringing more than a touch of European brio to the scene. The last few weeks have seen a non-stop celebration of Italian style - from the haute sophistication of the menswear lines of Ermenegildo Zegna and the fastidiously refined stationery of Pineider to the eminently wearable ranges of Genny's womenswear and the streamlined artefacts of Bugatti. Some of the names will already be known to you, some have had a small presence in London for some time but now that they have tested the water are encouraged to plunge in deeper while others, such as Pineider and the new Bugatti range, are complete newcomers. Here, then, on this page is a taster of what some of them have to offer.</p>

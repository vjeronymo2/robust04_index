			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from </F> Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa: "Prime  Minister, Please Explain..."]    [Text] Dear Prime Minister, for the first time in Italy the  prime ministership -- the country's most senior government post  -- is held by the owner of a large economic group that is very  prominent in the mass communications field but also in many  other areas, from large-scale commercial distribution to  financial services, insurance, and so forth.    This raises a number of issues that must be broached  promptly  and with a constructive attitude.    The first issue, which has already been raised on various  sides, concerns the matter of the television networks and, more  generally, the information media that you own through the  Fininvest group. This constitutes a problem, as is confirmed by  the fact that, at your suggestion, the government has decided to  entrust three experts with the task of preparing by September a  possible supplement to existing regulations.    But if the problem exists, its solution cannot be entrusted  merely to the lengthy procedures of a study drawn up by a group  of experts, the formulation of a legislative document by the  government, and its subsequent examination by parliament. A  temporary solution must at least be provided -- pending possible  amendments to the law -- that will immediately ensure the  independence of television networks and other media from the  government.    This is all the more necessary inasmuch as a campaign is  under way for the election of the European Parliament on 12  June, in which there should be no repetition of the favorable  conditions that your political group was able to enjoy during  the recent general election campaign. I hope that in your  speech to the Senate today you will be able to announce  something specific in this regard.    There is also a second important issue. It concerns the need  to inform parliament and the public about the economic  activities of which you are in charge. In the absence of  accurate and exhaustive information in this regard, there would  inevitably be suspicions concerning the motivations of all  government decisions that could influence the course of any of  these activities.    For this reason I ask you to make a pledge in your speech to  publish soon all relevant data in this regard, some of which by  law have to be published in any case. I am referring in  particular to the following:    -- a statement of assets and liabilities for fiscal year  1993  of Fininvest Spa and the consolidated statement of accounts of  the group belonging to it, together with an auditor's  certification and, where necessary, accompanied by the  corresponding documents for 1992;    -- an analysis of the debts of the umbrella group and of the  group itself, with special reference to identifying the private  and public banks to which the group is indebted and the  specified terms of these loans. It is obviously necessary to  know this information, especially in the case of public banks;    -- any debts and credits on the part of the umbrella group  with respect to the companies that it controls;    -- the final balance of the umbrella group and the  consolidated accounts of the group, with an analysis of  capitalized costs and of any revaluations carried out during the  accounting period;    -- a detailed list setting out the composition of the stock  ownership of the Fininvest group, specifying which shares you  yourself own directly and which you own indirectly and through  which channels.    Last, I think it would be correct to provide a complete list  of electoral contributions whether in the form of money or in  the form of any services provided by the companies of your group  in support of the political movement that you lead.    I am sure that you will understand that these requests are  dictated not by an attitude of political contentiousness but,  rather, by the need for openness common to all  liberal-democratic societies -- a model that you yourself often  cite.    I take this opportunity to send you my best wishes for  success.    [signed] Giorgio La Malfa.</p>

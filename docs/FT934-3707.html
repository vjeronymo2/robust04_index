			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Low-key start to new order in S Africa White rule ended formally in South Africa yesterday when a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council took office in Cape Town, in a ceremony marking the end of decades of anti-apartheid struggle. Its first substantive act was to approve a government application to the International Monetary Fund for a loan of Dollars 850m (Pounds 570.4m) from its compensatory and contingency financing facility, to counteract balance-of-payments problems caused by last year's drought. It was the first time Pretoria had sought the sanction of black South Africans for its actions, and represents the first concrete step toward black rule. 'We have done it. We have achieved the seemingly impossible. Now for the miracle of a completely free and fair election,' Mr Joe Slovo, Communist party chairman and a former guerrilla leader who was for years Pretoria's most hated adversary, told the first meeting of the TEC. The ceremony, curiously muted, took place in the chamber of the Good Hope building, in the shadow of Table Mountain. It was marred by the absence of seven of the the 26 parties which originally took part in multi-party talks on a new constitution. Chief among these were the Inkatha Freedom party and the white-supremacist Conservative party, whose decision to boycott the TEC, and possibly next year's elections, threatens transition to democracy. On Monday night, talks between the right-wing parties, known as the Freedom Alliance, the African National Congress and the government broke down after the ANC issued an ultimatum: the Freedom Alliance must agree to take part in the TEC and other transitional bodies, and in the elections, before further talks can take place on constitutional amendments to meet the alliance's demands for stronger federal powers for regions. The government has released a proposed amendment on regional powers, making cosmetic changes to the constitution agreed last month. In a symbolic act of protest at the installation of the TEC, about 30 armed white rightists occupied Fort Schanskop outside Pretoria. The government and the ANC continued to dispute the actual extent of the TEC's powers, with Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, urging delegates to ensure it is not a 'toy telephone'.</p>

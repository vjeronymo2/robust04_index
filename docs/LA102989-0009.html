			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> After forcing myself to sit through "Roseanne," I know why Roseanne Barr didn't  receive an Emmy nomination. She didn't deserve one and never will unless they  put in a whining category. The entire cast needs basic acting lessons, which  still would do little to improve the show because it is written on the level of  6th-grade bathroom humor. I cannot believe "Roseanne" gets better ratings than  "The Cosby Show." I hold little hope for the future of TV.  </P> <P> Sharon Boudreau, Costa Mesa  </P></p>

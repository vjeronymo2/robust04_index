			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Hurd sees 20-member Community by 2000 BRITAIN is looking forward to an enlarged European Community of up to 20 members by the turn of the century, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary said yesterday. Mr Hurd, addressing the Cambridge University Conservative Association, said there was a consensus that the Community could not 'put up the shutters' on the nations in the other half of Europe. The first wave of enlargement was likely to come from the ranks of the European Free Trade Association. It would involve countries such as Austria and Sweden, who had already applied for membership and, in the longer run, probably Finland, Norway and Switzerland. Issues such as agriculture and neutrality would need careful negotiation with these countries, but it should be possible to welcome new members by 1995. That would be only the first step, however. The association agreements concluded by the Community with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia last December should be seen as a preparatory phase for full membership. 'There should be no doubt about our determination to welcome them as full members. I hope to see this achieved by the year 2,000 at the latest.' While it was not possible at the moment to predict how many members the Community could accommodate or in what timescale, it would be foolish to start ruling out membership of any European democracies when they were ready, including even the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union. Mr Hurd recognised, however, that the enlargement of the Community raised questions about the institutional structure of the Community. It had been designed originally for six member states and had been adapted to work for twelve. But it was much more doubtful whether it would be suitable for as many as 20 or 30 members. The foreign secretary rejected greater centralised powers for the Community's institutions as a way of dealing with wider membership.</p>

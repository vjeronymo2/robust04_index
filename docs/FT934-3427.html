			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Lessons of a year in Somalia: Noble intentions and political realities After a year of policy blunders and humiliating reversals by the United Nations, of cold-blooded killings and hostage trading, a more realistic, hard-nosed policy is taking shape towards Somalia. The lesson the UN has learned there is that noble intentions are not in themselves enough. The humanitarian objective of feeding starving Somalis was admirable: but starvation was a symptom of a deeper malaise. Civil war had destroyed society and its institutions, and if the country was to recover its capacity to manage itself and avert further disaster, international intervention required a military and political framework that was never fully appreciated. One year later the world is trying to extricate itself from a responsibility it decided it did not want. The UN has abandoned its peace-enforcing role and placed the responsibility of forging a political settlement firmly with Somalia's fractious clans vying for power in a society that has yet to rebuild its shattered institutions. The diplomatic initiative has also shifted from the corridors of the UN to Somalia's neighbours in the Horn of Africa, which have vested interests in ending the conflict, but with few resources to spare. 'The fighting could easily spread into our countries. The clan divisions in Somalia are reproduced in Ethiopia and Eritrea,' says an Eritrean diplomat. The omens from peace talks organised by President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia this week are not good. General Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi, Mogadishu's rival warlords, have so far refused to meet for face-to-face talks. The overwhelming feeling in the US and elsewhere is that the international community has already fulfilled its moral duty to Somalia by ending the famine. The consensus is that the UN's humanitarian intervention in Somalia began to unravel when it widened its mission to include the forceful disarmament of warring militias as a forerunner to a political settlement. Some observers however would argue that it is precisely the failure to achieve this that undermined the mission. Few could have predicted that the humanitarian mission to deliver food to starving millions would degenerate into an obsessive search-and-destroy operation against supporters of a single warlord. The UN was ill-prepared from the start of its first peace-enforcing operation. The multinational force was riven with national rivalries and deeply resentful of the predominant role played by US troops outside the UN structure of command. Orders were not obeyed. Military intelligence was abysmal. The disarmament of Mogadishu's warring factions was not conducted simultaneously, sowing suspicions among the Aideed camp that the UN aimed to eliminate them. On the political front, the UN's timetable to have functioning local councils and a government of national reconciliation in place within 18 months proved hopelessly optimistic. Somalia has had no government since 1991. Before that it had a civil war, and before that a dictator. Gen Aideed still denies he planned the ambush that killed 24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June - the event that triggered the escalation of violence in Mogadishu and culminated in the deaths of hundreds of Somalis and 18 US troops in a battle in October. The UN military, under orders from the Security Council to detain Gen Aideed for the June ambush, became caught up in the very chain of retaliation and revenge that fuels clan rivalry in Somalia. UN bombs compounded the damage of the civil war. Helicopters gunned down the civilians who had been saved from the famine. Caught in the blind hunt for Gen Aideed, the UN lost sight of its mandate, its impartiality and its authority to play a constructive role. The events in Somalia have infected all aspects of peacekeeping. Gen Aideed's defiance probably encouraged Haiti's military rulers to defy the UN's would-be peacekeepers there last month. It has made the Security Council more cautious about authorising new peacekeeping operations. Burundi has been the first victim. Despite appeals for protection, the UN has sent only an envoy to mediate between the government and paratroopers who killed Burundi's elected president in October. In Mogadishu, UN troops have abandoned all attempts at maintaining law and order; their main aim now is to avoid more casualties. Bandits and armed gunmen roam the streets with impunity. Recruitment for UN military missions has become harder since the US announced it would withdraw its troops from Somalia by March 1994. Many Somalis, including Ali Mahdi, the warlord who controls north Mogadishu, fear that Somalia will revert to bloodletting when the Americans leave. Few doubt the US pull-out will spell the effective end to the UN military operation in Somalia (Unosom). Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, rejects the notion of a complete UN withdrawal. 'The international community must not abandon Somalia in view of the incontrovertible desire of the Somali people for continued presence of Unosom in their country,' he argued recently. The reality, however, is that the world is disengaging and Somalia's travails are far from over.</p>

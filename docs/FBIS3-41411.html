			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] But today, the chief drug  addiction specialist of Latvia, Janis Strazdins, acquainted the  gathering with the situation at present in Latvia.    [Begin Strazdins recording] The situation in Latvia is  becoming alarming. In January of this year our criminal police  conducted the first cocaine inspection purchase. This means  that they checked the information--was it true, was there indeed  cocaine in Latvia? Yes, there is already cocaine in Latvia. It  is the most terrible narcotic substance that one is able at all  to imagine, which causes an exceedingly strong dependence.    The only, well, one must say, fortune of our poor people is  that it is very expensive. But it is here.    Whereas previously we had widespread drug addiction among  the  criminal element, then at present narcotics has become  especially widespread among the young people. We have such  endemic hotbeds where it is especially widespread. These is the  Latgale suburb of our city of Riga, the town of Olaine, to a  certain extent also the Kurzeme suburb [of Riga], there is  already a little in the Vidzeme suburb [of Riga]. At present,  drug addiction is beginning to spread in Jurmala, in Tukums, in  Rezekne, in Liepaja, and in Daugavpils. But, unfortunately, we  do not know the true extent of drug addiction in Latvia. I  would guess 6-10,000, which is a more or less objective data,  because this is our criminal police data. The young people will  be compelled to steal, to rob, and sooner or later they will be  caught, because it is not possible to buy such expensive  narcotic substances with one's wages.

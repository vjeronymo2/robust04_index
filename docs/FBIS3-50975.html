			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 15  December 1993 on page 13 reports that Reverend Bartolome  Matamoros, president of the Evangelical group Assemblies of God,  or Asambleas de Dios, has announced that his group is  withdrawing suppport from the National Justice Party, PJN.  Matamoros explained that the group is withdrawing support  because, while the Assemblies of God requested "a moral  commitment from the president of the PJN and other  executives...," the executive board of the PJN was promoting  "personal interests." In contrast, Matamoros said that Nicaragua  needs "open" and "honest" politicians. He also accused PJN  leaders of "failing to organize...the more remote areas of the  country" during the process to gain legal status.</p>

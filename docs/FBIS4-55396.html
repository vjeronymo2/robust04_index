			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlasta Hlusickova: "Army Does Not Demand Payment </F> of Debts"]    [Text] State property is being sold  without regard for law and government edicts. The Ministry of  Defense in not interested in 11 million korunas? The Supreme  Control Office will now take a good look at the sale of  arms.    The Supreme Control Office [NKU] found frequent breaches of  laws and government edicts in the way the Czech Republic Army  has been handling its surplus and unusable property in the  period 1990 to 1993. Irregularities were found in almost all of  the audited Army units as well as in the Ministry of Defense.    The greatest number of irregularities was found in the Army  Housing and Construction Administration (VUSS) Plzen, which, in  addition to selling the chateaux Struzna and Kanice, broke the  law on historical monuments by not first giving the state the  option of purchasing these cultural monuments. The same law was  broken by VUSS Tabor by its sale of the Neznasov chateau. The  Plzen VUSS further broke the Ministry of Finance regulation on  the management of national property by its transfer of the  Vysocany barracks, the Dobrany billets, the Plzen exhibition  grounds, and the barracks in Tachov and Rokycany. It transferred  the chateau Zelena Hora-Nepomuk, including the training grounds,  without a certificate from the Ministry of Finance approving the  free transfer.    The Army unit in Olomouc sold engineering material for more  than 3.5 million Czech korunas [Kc] without obtaining approval  from the government, and, subsequently, for more than Kc2  million without submitting it to public bidding. VUSS Brno sold  the building at its training center for Kc1.6 million without  being granted a special permit by the government.    The NKU also found shortcomings in the handling of the  government's claims. VUSS Plzen has not demanded the payment of  rent for the lease of the grounds of the Plzen-Bory airfield,  the Brno administration still has not been paid for the sale of  real estate in Bilovice in the amount of Kc15 million, and  neither was the Prague administration for the Aquacentrum  building for Kc60 million. The Ministry of Defense has  outstanding claims for the sale of movable assets amounting to  more than Kc42 million. The results of the audit show that, at  present, the Ministry of Defense is demanding the payment of  claims in the amount of roughly Kc31 million, but, at the time  of the audit, not of the remaining amount.    The Ministry of Defense used almost Kc10 million for the  purchase of equipment for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  unit. Moreover, all of the equipment that was purchased is still  to be found in the Czech Republic.    According to the deputy press spokesman of the Ministry of  Defense, J. Sila, the ministry has had the NKU report available  only since Monday, and the minister will be able to make a  statement about it only after 25 April. Sila further stated  that, after assuming his post, Minister A. Baudys was aware that  there have been irregularities in the sell-off of movable and  immovable assets, and he therefore asked for his own internal  audit of the sales. The report was turned over to the then  prosecutor general of the Army, who, according to Sila, did not  find any reason to institute criminal proceedings. At the same  time, the minister decided to put in place a new system for  selling movable and immovable assets, the rules of which would  be fully in accord with the existing legal code.    The NKU spokeswoman, J. Vavrova, told ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY that  the Ministry of Defense had the protocols concerning the results  of the audit available already in January. On the basis of the  present investigation, a further audit of management by the Army  is being planned, which this time will also include the use of  funds from the state budget and the sale of arms.</p>

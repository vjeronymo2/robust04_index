			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Sales of AZT fail to meet expectations Seven years ago AZT was launched into a world alarmed at the prospect of an Aids plague. Independent sales forecasts ranged up to Dollars 2.5bn a year. But in the first six months of Wellcome's current financial year, AZT brought in just Pounds 110m. It ranks 70th in the world's best-selling drugs list. Patients infected with HIV, but without Aids symptoms, are regarded as a more lucrative market for the simple, if unpalatable, reason that they live longer. Mr John Robb, Wellcome chairman and chief executive, insisted that the fortunes of AZT were vital for the company. 'It is our second biggest-selling product and is very important for the company,' he said. He said the company's strategy would remain unchanged: to pursue combination therapy - the use of the drug in combination with others. The company has just signed a deal with Glaxo, the UK's biggest drugs company, that gives it the option to use an experimental drug called 3TC that seems to work well with AZT in laboratory tests. The results of the trials nevertheless come at an awkward time. Last month Wellcome shares fell 8 per cent after it reported slower than expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it was dropping development of a new anti-herpes compound. The company also announced plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by about 350 during the next 12 months, with further cuts to come in the US. City analysts remain unconvinced both about the ultimate importance of the drug and its growth prospects. They say AZT is significant to Wellcome but argue that it is not central to the company's fortunes.  ----------------------------------------------------                 HIV DRUGS CABINET  ---------------------------------------------------- Drug                                Company  ---------------------------------------------------- Retrovir (AZT)                     Wellcome Hivid (DDC)                           Roche Videx (DDI)            Bristol-Myers Squibb  ---------------------------------------------------- 3TC                        Wellcome/Biochem Ro31-8959                             Roche Zerit (d4T)            Bristol-Myers Squibb GS 393                               Gilead U-87201E                             Upjohn EF13                                 Scotia DAB 389IL-2                         Seragen Vaccines                            Various  ---------------------------------------------------- First three drugs available, rest undergoing trials  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

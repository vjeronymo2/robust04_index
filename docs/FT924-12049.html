			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report BASE METALS continued to be underpinned by a short-term corrective reaction following recent hefty price declines on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. But the general fundamental picture of sluggish economies and high stocks suggests the downside will be revisited soon, dealers said. The markets are also pausing this week with many participants and traders side-lined for LME dinner week. London COCOA futures made strong advances, but ended with gains slightly pared. Dealers said the upward movement carried on from Tuesday's key chart reversal in New York, which had prompted an active short covering rally. In Chicago MAIZE continued to trade lower at midsession, with the market focusing on the large crop and ignoring rumours Ukraine has purchased 300,000 tonnes of corn, traders said. 'The modest rally yesterday on the Russian purchase (of 820,000 tonnes of US corn) proved this market is heading lower on the huge crop,' one trader said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

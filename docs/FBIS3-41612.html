			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Vesti'' newscast] </F>   [Text] The results have been summed up of two years' work  on a program for the comprehensive inspection of the water route  of the Moscow River within the city's boundaries. After  receiving the results of the analysis of the water and its  inhabitants, researchers have recognized the Moscow River to be  dangerous to life.    [Correspondent Yevgeniy Pogorelova, over video showing  Moscow River] What is the Moscow River? A port for five  seas on tourist postcards or a huge garbage dump with 18 million  cubic meters of toxic waste on its bottom?    [Video shows map of river] On this map of the  Moscow River, the sections marked in red and yellow are  dangerous or extremely dangerous zones where permissible norms  of contents of salts of heavy metals and toxic substances have  been exceeded by hundreds of times. Iron, lead, and arsenic  have been discovered in the silt on the bed of the river in the  area of the Kremlin, the Yauza estuary, Setun and Skhodnya. The  contents of mercury in the river downstream of ZIL [Moscow's  major motor works] exceeds all permissible norms by 250 times.    [Video shows samples of fish caught in the river]  This is fish that lives in the river -- monsters with  irreversible genetic changes, without fins and scales,  goggle-eyed, and with cancer tumors. According to  ichthyologists from the Moscow State University and the  Institute of Evolutionary Morphology of the Academy of Sciences,  the process of mutation takes several years with fish and  several decades with human beings. The laboratory assistants  who are conducting research into mutants' internal organs have  received grave poisoning. The latest research has shown  radioactive elements in the water in the area of Strogino. The  Moscow River is turning into a dead reservoir and everyone who  comes into contact with it is being subjected to the danger of  mutation and cancer.</p>

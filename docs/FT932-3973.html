			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Sheep invade the City - Lynn MacRitchie takes her time to follow the sculpture trail London is blossoming with sculpture in the sudden summer heat. With new permanent exhibits and temporary shows, from the Limehouse Link to Chelsea Harbour, residents and visitors alike have an opportunity to compare the City's established monuments with some sometimes startling newcomers. Perhaps the most imaginative exhibition is Art in the City, a sculpture trail, beginning and ending at the Barbican, initiated by independent curator Victoria Preston. The trail links 17 locations throughout the Square Mile where specially chosen sculptures are sited until late July. Those intending to follow it in full would be advised to do so in easy stages. Conducted walks are being taken from the Barbican, estimated to last about one and a half hours, but I found several attempts necessary to get the most out of the fascinating walk, since finding oneself lost in an historic alley way or hidden garden square is all part of the fun. The workers around Finsbury Circus already seem quite at home with the flock of sheep by Sophie Ryder now encamped there, looking thoughtfully towards the emerald expanse of the bowling green. Sheep were being used as sun shades and handy jacket pegs during my lunchtime visit, one young man absentmindedly stroking one of the flock's ears as he chatted with a friend. This is exactly the sort of response Victoria Preston welcomes, steering sponsors to a choice of work with ready appeal, whether through reputation - the well sited Henry Moore outside the Guildhall, a Nigel Hall looking as if it had been there forever in Devonshire Square - or accessibility, such as the splendid whispering girls by Andre Wallace outside Fenchurch Street Station, or (an organisational triumph this) a Barry Flanagan cricketing hare outside the Bank of England, which austere establishment informed Ms Preston on her first approach that it 'hadn't bought any sculpture since 1674 . . .' The trail also offers the opportunity to see three artists at work. Until the end of next week Paula Haughney is to be found by the main entrance to Liverpool Street Station, finishing off 'Small Passenger,' a carving in limestone - 'like St Paul's', she told me - of 'a woolly beast with a baby on her back.' The watchful beast has curving horns and would have fangs 'if her mouth was open.' The small human child sleeps peacefully, comfortably cradled on the beast's rough coat. It is a charming piece of work and the opportunity to see how it is done was being taken happily by a seated audience lunching outside McDonald's. The braver souls spoke to Paula and asked all those sorts of questions - what is it, how did you do it, how much does it cost - that everyone always wants to ask but normally cannot. For the artist, it provides a welcome break from studio isolation and a chance for some peer group praise - workers from nearby construction sites had been particularly appreciative of the skill and sheer hard work that stone carving entails. On the blighted expanse of Paternoster Square the duo Clark/MacGregor are constructing something very different. During the next week, a huge clay head and hand will rise from the patio, evoking all sorts of associations with the deserted surroundings. Is the figure sinking or rising up, newly destroyed or newly created, its hand raised in greeting or goodbye? Clark/MacGregor (two graduates of the Slade) worked together in video and performance before their present engagement with large scale outdoor sculpture. During a similar project in Greenwich, they were 'shocked' at the public reaction. Expecting the worst, I looked concerned. 'No, no,' they told me, 'people were really positive, they liked the work and thought it should be there permanently . . .' Reasons of size and cost mean that they confine themselves to cheap materials such as plaster and lathing, a tactic which enables them to work on the grand scale they desire and see their schemes realised, however briefly, without the endless negotiations siting such work permanently would entail. They welcomed the Art in the City initiative as an opportunity to explore ideas in conjunction with the audience they wish to address - the general public rather than the gallery circuit.

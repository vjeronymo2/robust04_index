			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World News in Brief: Opec deal to cut output by 1.4m barrels a day Ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said they had agreed to cut oil output by around 1.4m barrels of oil per day in an attempt to rescue weak petroleum prices. Current output is estimated near 25 million bpd. The deal, which came after four days of bargaining, also brought Kuwait back into the group's system of production quotas, from which the emirate had been exempt as it rebuilt from the 1991 Gulf War.

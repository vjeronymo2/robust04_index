The analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam group unhesitatingly made public a war plan  to invade the North which its predecessors had not dared to do,  not concealing its intention to unleash a war against the North.  This clearly indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group is a clan of  more dangerous and heinous warmaniacs than any other rulers of  South Korea.    By mapping out and making public the "new operation plan,"  the Kim Yong-sam group shows that it has neither will to have  dialogue with the North nor intention to resolve the  reunification question in a peaceful way and made it unequivocal  that it will not implement the North-South agreement and the  joint declaration of denuclearization    Now all the Armed Forces of the South Korean puppet Army  have  been "alerted" and many U.S. troops and sophisticated combat  equipment are being carried to South Korea. This reality  eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is attempting to  plunge the nation into a nuclear disaster under the manipulation  of the U.S. warmongers.    With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the warmaniacs  bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the nation, clean  indifferent [as received] to the destiny of the nation, the 70  million fellow countrymen can neither be safe nor can the peace  of Asia and the world be ensured. If our nation is to be saved  from a nuclear holocaust and the peace of Asia and the world be  defended, the Kim Yong-sam group dancing to the nuclear  drum-beating of the United States must be removed.    We will never remain an onlooker to the schemes of the U.S.  and South Korean war-thirsty elements to carry into practice the  criminal "new operation plan."    They must know clearly that we mean what we say.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> VICTIM AID PROGRAM GETS 7TH ADVOCATE  </P> <P> Ventura County will add a seventh victim advocate to its Victim/Witness  Assistance program under a plan approved this week by the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The new advocate will concentrate on assisting victims of domestic violence,  said Kathleen McGoldrick, the program's director.  </P> <P> She said the state will provide the $31,248 needed to hire the new staff  member.  </P> <P> In fiscal 1990-91, the county will provide $145,389 of the program's $310,389  budget, with some of the funding coming from fines criminals are ordered to  pay.  </P> <P> The board approved the position Tuesday although some supervisors expressed  displeasure with McGoldrick's warning that "to turn away victims at this point  is giving the cold shoulder" to targets of domestic and sexual abuse.  </P> <P> "I don't appreciate the political speech," Supervisor James R. Dougherty said  after McGoldrick told of several cases in which women and children had been  assaulted.  </P> <P> However, he joined his fellow supervisors in voting to continue the program.  </P> <P> McGoldrick said she feared that despite sharp increases in violent crime, the  program was in danger of being cut.  </P> <P> More than 11,000 crime victims and their families were assisted by the  Victim/Witness agency last year, McGoldrick said. Advocates provide services  such as counseling, crisis intervention and help in obtaining restraining  orders, she said. JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

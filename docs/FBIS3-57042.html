She was number two in the republic.    But her unexpected decision last November to leave the "New  Azerbaijan" party, whose chairman is Aliyev, and found her own,  liberal democratic, party, was a sure sign of the divergence of  positions among the president's inner circle. And this is the  result -- Gadzhiyeva is on her way to New York, while  parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliyev moves into second place in  the republic's political hierarchy.    Among the numerous contenders for the vacant post of  secretary of state people are mentioning the names of Gasan  Gasanov, the republic's current foreign minister, Ramiz Rizayev,  Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow, and Arif Ragimzad, adviser on  territorial administration. Most observers are inclined to  think that the president will settle on Gasanov as his choice  and that the new secretary of state's sphere of activity will be  limited to foreign policy.    The Azerbaijani president has set about forming his team in  earnest. "I did not have one when I returned to Baku," Aliyev  admitted to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. "The first appointments  were made merely with the aim of preventing a total collapse of  leadership at local level. My aim is to attract capable and  talented young people into governing the republic."</p>

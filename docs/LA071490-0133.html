			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY TAKES STEPS TO CONSERVE WATER  </P> <P> The county's Environmental Management Agency on Friday announced several new  conservation methods that the agency hopes will dramatically reduce water  consumption by county government.  </P> <P> Among other things, the agency wants to use reclaimed water for the irrigation  system at Laguna Niguel Regional Park.  </P> <P> The county anticipates that it will save nearly 90% of the potable water now  used there, according to Barbara Foster, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Harriett  M. Wieder.  </P> <P> Wieder's office, which has a record of calling for improved water management,  announced the conservation measures in a brief news release.  </P> <P> The Orange County Water Conservation Task Force, formed by Wieder, prompted the  proposals.  </P> <P> The EMA, the county's land-management agency, wants county parks officials to  reduce their irrigation needs by at least 10%.  </P> <P> Foster said that many parks already are watering less or watering in the  evening and early morning when evaporation is the least.  </P> <P> To provide the public more examples of how to landscape with drought-resistant  plants, the county has authorized a $5,000 grant from its Harbors, Beaches and  Parks Divisions for a study in Rossmoor.  </P> <P> The Rossmoor Community Services District, which has received a $31,000 state  grant, has been working for more than a year on two mini-parks which will  demonstrate the use of drought-resistant plants.  </P> <P> Community services district president Germaine Erskine said that playgrounds  and picnic areas will serve as models for visitors to see how the park's  designers can attractively arrange the plants.  </P> <P> Ground-breaking ceremonies for the mini-parks are scheduled for Monday morning.

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late fall knocks generators THE TWO main power generators fell in late trading as word reached the market that Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, was turning up the heat in its dispute with the companies over pool prices. Hints began to circulate following a private lunch at SG Warburg attended by a top Offer official and industry chiefs. The row over pool prices has been rumbling since privatisation 18 months ago. Last December, Offer found National Power and PowerGen had used their dominant position in the market to push up prices. The companies were rapped and the pool price system changed to halt the alleged abuses. However, this summer has seen the number of complaints from industrial users rise again prompting Offer's director general Prof Stephen Littlechild to write to the power companies demanding an explanation last month. Yesterday, the Offer official applied further pressure reportedly saying that the explanations were not sufficient and the generators risked yet another price inquiry if fuller disclosures were not forthcoming. Shares in PowerGen which had been at 261p, up 6 1/2 , immediately fell back to close at 253p, a net fall of 1 1/2 on the day. National Power ended at 232p, a fall of 2, after being 4 ahead at one stage. Tesco deal An attempt to sell a block of 13.7m shares in Tesco achieved only partial success, and a large chunk was left overhanging the market, sending the shares into retreat. Securities house Hoare Govett, acting on behalf of a large institution, was said to have brought the stock - around 0.7 per cent of Tesco's issued share capital - to the market at 230p early in the session. However, suggestions that a big seller was around had been worrying the share price for some days. The stock opened weaker, slipping from 234p to 230 1/2 p as the big share block showed itself in the market. Dealers reported that less than half the shares had been taken up because of the narrow discount to the market price. By the close, turnover in Tesco showed only 6.6m traded, including one trade of 4.2m at the Hoare offer price. Market sources indicated that the institution had withdrawn the rest of the stock on offer. One analyst commented: 'Having a big, dissatisfied seller in the market, waiting to sell, is bound to have a continuing unsettling effect on the shares.' They closed off 4 at 230p. Wellcome wanted Among pharmaceuticals, shares in Wellcome shot forward as the publicity shackles around the global share issue were removed and analysts who had been tied into the sale of some 290m shares were allowed to express their views. The stock opened firmly and held its gain all day to close 20 higher at 822 with 6.1m traded. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank heading the issue on behalf of governing charity Wellcome Trust, announced yesterday that the 'green shoe' share stabilisation operation had been lifted. Subsequently, US investment bank Lehman Brothers boosted its stance to buy from neutral and said it had only shaved its current year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 505m despite the impact on earnings of a weaker US dollar. Hoare Govett reinforced its buy stance arguing that the shares were set to outperform the sector now that the technical situation overhanging the stock had been removed. Meanwhile, Mr Robin Gilbert of agency broker James Capel said; 'Wellcome is the fastest growing health and household stocks in the UK and we regard it as one of the most attractive drug stocks in the world.' Yield attractions helped British Gas improve 7 1/2 to 244p with 13m shares yesterday ahead of the privatised utility company's second-quarter figures, due on Tuesday. At a time when dividends are being cut, Gas is seen as one of the safest yield stocks in the market and particularly attractive to income funds whose fingers have been burnt by the performance of stocks such as BP. Forecasts range from a loss of Pounds 20m to a profit of Pounds 75m but second-quarter figures are less significant than the winter numbers because of the seasonal nature of Gas earnings. Buyers of BP in the US were unable to match one large UK seller and the shares fell 3 to 190p on turnover of 13m. Water stocks finished a bright week with a flourish as the sector continued to attract buyers on its defensive qualities and yield considerations. Among the main movers were Severn Trent, ahead 13 at 419p, Southern 12 at 407p, South West 14 to 423p and Thames 12 to 426p. Similar qualities were being sought in the electricity utilities which, together with the forthcoming unbundling of the electricity package, sent shares forward. These included South West up 13 at 320p, Norweb 15 to 357p and Manweb 13 to 350p. Magazine publisher Reed International recovered from recent falls as SG Warburg Securities published a comprehensive note reiterating its buy recommendation on the stock. Warburg has cut its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 17m to Pounds 250m to reflect a slightly slower recovery than anticipated and currency weakness in the US where Reed generates around 40 per cent of operating profits. However, the house argues; 'Reed is both poised for early recovery and equally resilient if it arrives at glacial speed.' Reed shares rose 12 to 460p. Selling of Carlton Communications bonds was said to have affected attitudes to the shares which slid 7 to 579p. The media group raised Pounds 64.25m from a convertible bond issue a month ago to fund small acquisitions. Agency broker James Capel was said to be negative on English China Clays and the shares surrendered gains made earlier in the week on the back of a squeeze, ending 14 down at 485p. Hartstone continued to recover, gaining 11 to 150p. Vague talk, suggesting Tomkins was about to make a big acquisition caused the shares to give up 4 to 430p. Thorn EMI's lighting division was said to be in Tomkins' sights. Thorn shares rose 3 to 711p. Its security business has been mooted to be wanted by Williams Holdings, which firmed 7 to 250p in trade of 2.2m. Insurance broker Willis Corroon fell 14 to 156p with County NatWest slashing profit estimates by around Pounds 33m to Pounds 60m for this year and Pounds 61m for next. The house forecasts a halved dividend in 1993 and says the shares are a sell down to 125p. British Aerospace hardened 2 to 210p, with Henderson Crosthwaite the day's main buyer. Mr Brian Newman at the agency broker believes the stock is oversold and says the company has 'the highest sales to market capitalisation in the FT-SE'. He expects new orders, both civil and military to be announced soon. Inchcape continued to benefit from an SG Warburg buy recommendation earlier in the week and jumped 18 to 404p. A stock overhang weakened Siebe and the shares gave up 7 to 606p. A line of 250,000 BBA shares, reportedly on offer, weakened the stock 3 to 132p. There was a small agency cross carried out at 134 1/2 p. A squeeze boosted TI Group and the shares firmed 7 to 269p. Food group Booker retreated 8 to 378p following a Nomura downgrade.

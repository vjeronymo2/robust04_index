			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ericsson buoyed by strong quarter SHARES in Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, rose 9 per cent yesterday as it benefited from a better-than-expected 1992 result, a bright forecast for 1993 and news of a healthy order intake. The group's profit for the year fell to SKr1.30bn (Dollars 180m) from SKr1.60bn in 1991, but this disguised an exceptionally strong fourth-quarter performance when profits rose to SKr1.18bn from SKr97m. It disclosed a 19 per cent increase in orders to SKr55.4bn from SKr44.7bn and was distinctly upbeat on prospects. Ericsson held its 1992 dividend at SKr3.50, as earnings per share dipped to SKr3.18 from SKr3.69. Sales for 1992 rose 3 per cent to SKr47.0bn. Many analysts believe the fourth-quarter results mark the beginning of a strong recovery. The driving force behind the group's performance has been its strong order growth, as bookings have risen for five consecutive quarters. The strongest performer has been mobile telephone systems, where order bookings rose 56 per cent last year. Confirming the trend, the group yesterday announced a ADollars 200m (USDollars 135.1m) contract from Arena GSM to supply telecommunications equipment for Australia's third cellular telephone network. The company indicated that it was well placed to win new orders from China with a possible value of up to SKr7.4bn. Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it had signed a preliminary agreement to sell its Finnish daughter company, Wallac, to EG&amp;G, the big US technology group. Procordia said the disposal reflected its decision to concentrate on health care and branded consumer goods. Wallac manufactures analytical and immunodiagnostic systems.

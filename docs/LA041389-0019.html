			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: AMPLIFICATIONS  </P> <P> Liza Minnelli took exception Wednesday to wire service reports that she tried  to "smuggle" her dog into Sweden earlier this week. Spokesmen for the  actress-singer said Minnelli's shaggy Scottish terrier, Lilly, was sitting next  to her, plainly visible, on a car ferry from Denmark, and Minnelli had been  given wrong information about Sweden's quarantine laws for pets. As to reports  that she threatened to cancel her appearance with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis  Jr. after customs agents came to seize the dog at her hotel, Minnelli's  representative said, "She never threatened to cancel. She's too much a  professional to do that." Liza and Lilly will be reunited April 23 in Paris,  after the singer completes dates in Norway, Finland and London. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] It will be legally possible to confiscate assets  owned by drug traffickers. A Constitutional Court ruling has  given the green light to legislation that authorizes the  expropriation of property owned by persons charged with  illegally acquiring wealth.    By backing the Vienna Convention, the United Nation's  highest  treaty on drug trafficking, the Constitutional Court has  endorsed one of the leading mechanisms to fight this scourge in  Colombia. Authorities are convinced that with this endorsement  of the treaty it will be easier to confront drug traffickers.    [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] It is an  international instrument that is essential in the fight against  drug trafficking in all of its phases, such as money laundering,  taking drugs, and diverting chemicals used in processing  cocaine. [end recording]    The Court has ruled that, from now on and through a judicial  procedure, seizing goods that originated in drug trafficking or  goods that represent illegal acquisition of wealth can be  authorized.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] The Vienna Convention is  important  because other countries can imitate us. It will be possible to  establish regulations and agreements to complement the Vienna  Convention in order to freeze drug trafficking-originated goods.  It is also an essential instrument in breaking organized  crime's financial backbone. [end recording]    The nonextradition of Colombian citizens was also agreed  upon  during the revision of the Vienna Convention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Suzhou, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Suzhou State  High-Tech Development Zone in east China's Jiangsu Province has  achieved good success, attracting increasing numbers of  investors from at home and abroad.    It now has over 170 foreign-funded projects, with a total  investment of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars. The firms are mainly  engaged in electronics, biology, pharmaceuticals and other  technology-intensive industries.    China now has a total of 52 such state-level high-tech  zones,  which serve as major implementation bases of the "Torch  Program", a national high- and new-technology development  blueprint.    According to the State Science and Technology Commission,  fixed assets investment in these zones was 13 billion yuan  (about 140 million U.S. dollars) in 1993.    Their development areas total over 60 sq km and nearly six  million sq m [square meters] of floor space of buildings have  been completed and over 12 million sq m of buildings are under  construction.    The gross industrial and commercial income of the zones is  now 57 billion yuan (about 630 million U.S. dollars), six times  that of 1991.    Their export volume was over 700 million U.S. dollars last  year.    By the end of last year more than 10,700 high-tech  enterprises had been set up in the zones. Industries such as in  optical-fiber communications and electronic information have  become pillars of the zones.    Some zones have expanded from sole industrial development to  comprehensive communities, where a service system covering  finance, information, insurance, accounting, law, education,  transportation, commerce and trade has emerged.</p>

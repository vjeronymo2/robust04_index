			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei jumps 4.2 per cent in post-election celebration An advancing dollar, topping Y100 for the first time since October 13, helped to jack up the Nikkei 225 by 307.36 to close at the day's high of 19,305.66, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. After two consecutive days of losses, the benchmark index sailed out of the doldrums at the opening, leaving a day's low of 19,067.01 to finish the morning session at 19,207.44. Most of that gain occurred in the first 15 minutes of trading. There was little market movement through most of the day until a final, arbitrage-led rally at the close. Traders attributed the renewed strength of the market to futures-linked arbitrage buying, as dealers who had taken the short side in Chicago index futures markets on Friday bought shares in Tokyo to cut losses. The upturn was also supported by recent strength in US financial markets and the release of better than anticipated US employment figures on Friday. The market turned up in estimated volume of 211m shares. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 index rose 3.30 to 282.52 and the Topix index of all first-section stocks by 16.01 to 1,531.86. Winners topped losers by 837 to 187, with 169 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.57 to 1,272.07. Among computer game makers, Sega Industries extended its recovery to a seventh consecutive day, rising Y80 to Y5,210. Nintendo gained Y100 at Y5,800. Sony, which entered the video game business last Friday with its advanced PlayStation, added Y100 at Y5,520, while Matsushita Electric Industrial advanced Y40 to Y1,580. Other consumer electronics stocks also rose, JVC by Y30 to Y1360, Sanyo Electric by Y6 to Y582 and Sharp by Y30 to Y1710. Most integrated electricals did well. Mitsubishi Electric moved ahead Y10 to Y710 and Hitachi Y7 to Y985, while Toshiba climbed Y21 to Y731 in the day's third highest volume of 3.2m shares. NEC closed at Y1,190 for a Y30 advance, but Fujitsu stayed at Y1,020. Carmakers joined the upsurge. Mitsubishi Motors rose Y11 to Y983, Nissan by Y13 to Y834 and Isuzu closed at Y492, up Y6. Following recent losses, privatised stocks were mostly higher. Japan Tobacco appreciated Y5,000 to Y960,000 and NTT Y7,000 to Y837,000. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 160.11 at 21,275.3 in volume of 33.4m shares. Roundup Wall Street's strong performance on Friday provided inspiration for some regional markets. Bangkok was closed for a public holiday. TAIPEI jumped 4.2 per cent as investors celebrated a victory by the ruling Nationalist party in key elections for governor on Saturday. The weighted index ended 270.40 stronger at 6,750.22, off an opening high of 6,824.20. Turnover surged to a hectic TDollars 103.8bn from Friday's TDollars 54.76bn. Plastics shares led the rally on good fudamentals and recent product price increases, with China Petrochemical and Taiwan Polypropylene both advancing by a daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 39 and TDollars 76.50 respectively. Electronics also raced ahead on strong earnings growth, with United Microelectronics and Acer each limit up to TDollars 131.50 and TDollars 102.50. The financial sector, which opened 6.5 per cent ahead, gave up some of the rise to finish 4.1 per cent up. SYDNEY closed near its high for the day, the All Ordinaries index adding 17.4 or 0.9 per cent at 1,897.5, as a number of blue chip issues found support on the back of a better futures market. SEOUL ended higher after an early technical rebound in blue chips, while buying interest remained strong in selective smaller-capitalisation shares with good corporate earnings prospects. The composite index was ahead 11.00 at 1,065.03. Securities houses were also in demand, on unfounded rumours that the government would allow brokerage houses with abundant cash reserve ratios to raise capital freely. HONG KONG saw an early 1.0 per cent rally but was unable to make further headway in subsequent trade. The Hang Seng index, which dropped 5 per cent last week and was 34 per cent down from its January peak, moved up 80.96 to 8,302.53. Turnover dwindled to a preliminary HKDollars 2.7bn, compared with HKDollars 4.2bn on Friday. Brokers noted that rising US interest rates were making fixed interest investments increasingly attractive, contributing to redemptions of local stock investments. China-incorporated shares led the market higher, with Tsingtao Brewery up 25 cents to HKDollars 5.10 on buying after technical weakness. HSBC Holdings rose 75 cents to HKDollars 84.50, Hutchison Whampoa moved ahead 60 cents to HKDollars 30.10 and Consolidated Electric Power advanced 60 cents to HKDollars 15.50. SINGAPORE was unable to hold on to early gains and the Straits Times Industrial index finished 3.45 easier at 2,185.57, with sentiment bruised by faltering Malaysian shares traded over the counter. KUALA LUMPUR continued to fall, ending 1.4 per cent lower, as a fresh round of forced selling by clients unable to meet margin calls sent prices tumbling. The composite index shed 13.86 to 963.88. WELLINGTON sank to its low for the year in early afternoon trade amid gloom over the outlook for higher interest rates, before prices picked up towards the close. The NZSE-40 fell to 1,932.69 and then rallied to close 3.20 down on the day at 1,939.36. MANILA saw profit-taking after a firm opening before renewed, late buying by domestic and retail customers. The composite index finished 25.96 higher at 2,622.71. Petron led the gains, advancing 75 cents or 3.9 per cent to 20 pesos. BOMBAY encountered early retail selling before late demand for blue chips by domestic mutual funds reversed the slide. The BSE-30 index picked up from a low of 4,034.49 to finish 6.74 ahead at 4,084.23.</p>

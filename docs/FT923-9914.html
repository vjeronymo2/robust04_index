			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Newspaper strike suspended WORKERS at Politika, Yugoslavia's biggest newspaper publishers, have suspended a two-day strike after Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, demanded reconsideration of a controversial nationalisation law, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Politika's three daily newspapers appeared on newsstands yesterday, and the strike committee said its 15 periodicals would also resume work. The group's television and radio stations did not interrupt broadcasts. The strike began on Thursday when the Serbian parliament voted to nationalise the publishers. Opposition deputies accused the government of seeking complete control over the press and threatened to boycott elections scheduled for the end of the year if freedom of the media was not assured. Mr Milosevic asked parliament at the weekend to reconsider the law, saying experts believed that some of its clauses conflicted with the Serbian constitution.</p>

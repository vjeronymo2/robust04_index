			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Oblasts Decide To Overcome </F> Crisis Together"]    [Text] In a move to boldly confront the economic crisis on  their territory, oblast administration heads of the  Donetsk-Dniester region decided to conduct an experiment; but  not all of them. The project was initiated by residents of  Lugansk. A joint resolution "On Additional Measures To Increase  Mutual Supplies of Consumer Goods to Donetsk, Dniepropetrovsk,  Zaporozhye, and Lugansk Oblasts" was signed. Given the payment  crisis and lack of credits and funds for trade, the only viable  option remaining, officials believe, is to conclude direct  agreements among enterprises, which would quickly and  efficiently fill store shelves with goods. The agreement  specified terms of trade and economic cooperation and  established groups coordinating mutual efforts, ATN reported.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: CHALLENGING THE ACQUIESCENCE OF ULSTER;  </P> <P> LIES OF SILENCE BY BRIAN MOORE (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95; 200 PP.)  </P> <P> It is all there, perhaps too plainly there, in the title. Brian Moore has  written an angry political novel that is also a novel of suspense. The suspense  is intricately tangled in an impossible moral choice, faced by a Northern  Irishman who struggles to resign from his country's conflict, and cannot.  </P> <P> Impossibility is the curse of the politics that has made Ulster's history a  strangled gyre that grinds away, decade after decade, sinking but never sinking  through. And it is the focus of Moore's anger.  </P> <P> Moore is a prolific novelist who has written on a variety of themes since he  got out of his native Belfast, young, in 1948. Belfast -- Catholic Belfast,  specifically -- is not out of him, though. "Lies of Silence" is his phrase for  the mental and moral excusing and evading that allow the Irish Republican Army  to operate out of the Catholic community, even though Catholics will deplore  its violence, or at least, the seeming hopelessness of its violence.  </P> <P> Acquiescence in the face of evil is the charge Moore brings against the  minority population of the North. He barely mentions the Protestant majority,  and the British appear only in the form of a cool and barely glimpsed security  official. The author's quarrel is with the sentimentality that allows his  Catholics to wink at present atrocities in the name of past heroics. His target  is Mother Machree. She'll kill you, the message goes; and in "Lies of Silence,"  she does.  </P> <P> Michael Dillon is civilized and apolitical, the successful manager of a Belfast  hotel that is owned by an American chain. He hopes for promotion to one of the  chain's London hotels; he cannot wait to get out of the city he was born and  reared in.  </P> <P> London means a decent life and escape. Escape, also, because he will leave  Moira, his gloomy and sub-hysteric Belfast wife, and go live with uncomplicated  Andrea, a researcher for the BBC. Escape, finally, out Europe's last medieval  war, and into Europe of the Common Market and no-fault history.  </P> <P> Just as Michael is about to take off, his house is seized by an IRA gang. With  Moira as their hostage, and under threat of death, Michael must drive a  bomb-rigged car into his hotel parking lot -- as manager, he will not be  searched -- where a time-device is to detonate and kill a lot of people,  including an Ian Paisley-like Protestant extremist who is attending a lunch.  </P> <P> "Lies of Silence" is tightly, sometimes breathtakingly, constructed around the  dilemmas that ensue. If Michael warns the police, he threatens Moira's life. If  he does not, he risks the lives of dozens of others. (One of the ingenious  half-turns on this dilemma is that he cannot be sure if there is a dilemma. The  IRA itself may or may not have given a warning; his captors will not say.)  </P> <P> The painful but undoubtedly correct choice is to sacrifice one life -- perhaps  -- instead of many -- perhaps. Except that Moira's death would also be highly  convenient. And Michael twists in the arid scruples of choice and conscience of  a sort that Graham Greene wrote about more finely in "The Heart of the Matter"  and "The Power and the Glory."  </P> <P> It is Moore's skill to give a living answer to this moral puzzle. No normal  human being, much less a scrupulous one, could abide doing nothing, however  finely balanced the choices. The hotel is bombed; its guests are evacuated in  time.  </P> <P> A moral dilemma, however, now turns political as well. Moira, too gruesomely  whiny up to now to matter much, suddenly becomes real. She and Michael,  Catholics but uninvolved, must make new choices. He will go to London, the  longed-for escape now justified by police warnings that he is in danger.  </P> <P> Moira, on the other hand, refuses "to let them push me out." She will stay and  denounce the IRA on television. In the book's most effective confrontation, she  lets Michael know that if he was willing to see her die to stand up against the  terror, she is willing to lose him to another woman to do the same thing.  </P> <P> Even in London, though, Michael is not free. He had recognized one of the  gunmen; the police ask him to make the identification. A priest with IRA  connections comes over, ostensibly to plead mercy for the son of a parishioner.  "A lovely woman," he calls her. As for the youth: "You know what these lads are  like, they're just kids." As if mercy were all that was at stake, and the duty  of any Catholic, even a sophisticate, was to exercise it exclusively with other  Catholics.  </P> <P> But the priest brings an unspoken message as well: The IRA will kill Michael if  he talks. And he must decide finally whether he can escape the war and its  choices.  </P> <P> In a number of ways, "Lies of Silence" succeeds remarkably. On the level of  sheer suspense, for example. It is marvelously canny. And if there is  contrivance in using this suspense, and the dilemmas that nourish it, to open  up a larger political and moral dimension, it seems well justified.  </P> <P> Moore will be criticized for making his exclusive targets the IRA and the  failure of most Catholics to confront the kind of choice that Moira and Michael  are brought to. But he is not writing an overview of Northern Ireland; he has  chosen, as is his right, to focus upon one aspect of its tragedy. If the  chicken of majority oppression has laid the egg of minority violence -- which,  in turn, hatches a violent Protestant chicken, and so on -- why, Moore has  decided to tell an egg story. He tells it well.  </P> <P> On the other hand, he can be plodding in his prose. When Michael and Andrea  arrive in London and enjoy a few days of happiness, Moore writes: "They were  here. Everything had changed. Everything."  </P> <P> He can also be crude in his characters, manipulating actions and discourse to  make political points. The priest is oily and repulsive. Moore has cast a role  instead of writing a character.  </P> <P> It is all too convenient when Michael, driving the bomb-rigged car after the  night of terror in his hijacked home, passes the Catholic school where he was  taught to hate Protestants. It was "run by priests whose narrow sectarian views  perfectly propagated the divisive bitterness which led to the events of last  night."  </P> <P> As the protagonist, Michael has moments of real substance when he truly  embodies the dilemmas he is in. But he is given too much to do, to feel, to  think; the agony that is the heart of the book is a busy agony, and the  busy-ness weakens it.  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Ministers to renew battle on EU votes European foreign ministers will today try to break the stalemate over voting rights in the European Union, but there seems little prospect of a deal. Hopes rest on Britain and Spain offering 'a goodwill gesture' which would avoid a breakdown in negotiations and coax their 10 EU partners into reciprocal movement at the two-day meeting at Ioannioa, Greece. 'I don't think people are ready psychologically for a deal,' a senior EU official said yesterday. The best outcome was likely to be an informal understanding offering the prospect of a settlement before Easter, possibly at a fifth meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. Britain and Spain are insisting on maintaining voting rules allowing two large Union member states and one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The impasse risks delaying the admission of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the Union next year. The rotating Greek presidency of the EU, backed by Germany, remains adamant that the Anglo-Spanish axis must accept an increase in the so-called blocking minority to take account of the four new members. Hopes of a compromise rest on a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede that the blocking minority must rise from 23 to 27 votes. In return, countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes would obtain an automatic right to delay decisions for at least two months. Britain is pressing for a legally binding protocol allowing it to delay decisions on contentious matters such as social policy. But senior EU officials said a commitment was 'out of the question' because it would be rejected by the European Parliament, which must ratify the accession treaties. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, raised hopes of an eventual deal with an explicit declaration yesterday that he was prepared to reach a compromise on the issue. 'We are flexible. We are willing to accommodate. But others have to be so also,' he said. Mr Hurd said the UK cabinet had allowed him 'some flexibility' to strike a deal, but he was uncertain whether an agreement would be reached at the weekend talks. The voting rights row will dominate the two days of informal talks, with little time to address pressing matters such as instability in the Ukraine and Algeria and prospects for a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia.</p>

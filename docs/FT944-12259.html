			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis announces plan to 'restore fortunes' Jarvis, the lossmaking building, civil engineering and property group, yesterday announced a new senior management team, an acquisition, and a strategic plan which it hopes will help restore its fortunes. The group has been plagued with problems, especially in the construction sector, and has reported substantial losses in the past two years. The results for the six months to June 30, reported yesterday, showed pre-tax losses increasing from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 2.98m on turnover Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 35m. Losses per share were 8.2p (2.8p). Mr Harold Bard, the chairman, said the newly-appointed management team would shift the group's focus from large road contracts to specialist packages in the water, sewage and waste sectors, and university and health projects. The change in management is tied to the acquisition of the outstanding 50.1 per cent of Jarvis Projects, set-up in June as a joint venture between Jarvis and Mr Paris Moayedi, who will become chief executive of the combined company. Alongside this, 2.5m new shares will be bought by the new executives - Mr David Freeborn, Mr Robert Kendall, Mr Henry Lafferty, Mr Andrew Sutton and Mr Moayedi - at 10p. Yesterday's closing price was 10 3/4 p, up  3/4 p. Mr Roger Payton will become non-executive chairman in place of Mr Bard, who remains an executive director.</p>

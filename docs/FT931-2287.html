			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers: OFT acts - The Budget and You THE OFFICE of Fair Trading put its oar into the murky waters of life insurance this week with two reports containing proposed reforms in disclosure rules. The chancellor must now decide whether to accept them. One report, which could be implemented quickly, suggests amending four rules proposed by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Independent advisers' commission The OFT want IFAs to disclose their commission, in cash terms, before a sale. Own charges in illustrations At present, any projection in marketing literature assumes that a company has a set level of costs prescribed by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, even if these actually are much higher. Under the OFT's suggested rules, you would be able to see just how much more expensive they were. Surrender values late in a policy At present, projected surrender values for the first five years must be shown and, under SIB's proposals, these would have to be revealed in the context of the amount of premiums paid. Because the costs of administration and sales are deducted at the beginning of the policy, investors often make a loss at this stage. But surrender values later in the term are also much worse than maturity values, and the OFT wants to force companies to disclose them. Differential pricing for tied agents Life companies are not now allowed to charge different prices for selling through different tied agents, even though the costs vary from agent to agent. The OFT hopes that prices would fall if companies were allowed to make differential charges. In a second report, the OFT calls for each life company to announce how many of its policies are surrendered. It would also require life offices to send annual statements to policy-holders, like those given to unit trust investors.</p>

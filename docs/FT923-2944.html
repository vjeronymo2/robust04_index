			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Peru parades captured rebel leader FLABBY, middle-aged and bespectacled, wearing an identification tag like a common criminal, the leader of Peru's feared Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas has been paraded before the Peruvian people on television in a bid to destroy the aura that has built up around him during 13 years in hiding. President Alberto Fujimori personally presented the television images of Latin America's most wanted and feared insurgent. Mr Abimael Guzman Reynoso - alias 'Presidente Gonzalo' - had been captured in a counter-terrorist police raid on a Lima suburban house 24 hours earlier. His detention, along with several other high-ranking Sendero officials, is a big success for the Fujimori government, and one of the few bits of good news for Peru since the April 5 institutional coup when Mr Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution. Mr Guzman's capture allowed the Peruvian president to justify his tough and much-criticised counter-insurgency policy and to repeat his determination to defeat Peru's terrorist groups before 1995, when his term of office officially ends. Popular mythology had attributed Mr Guzman with almost magical powers to move around Peru unseen. A home-made video, shot more than three years ago, had provided the only previous dent in the guerrilla leader's image - it showed him inebriated, carousing with sycophantic followers and dancing to the music of Zorba the Greek. In Sunday's broadcast he appeared fumbling with his trouser buttons after being told to take off his shirt, apparently meekly obeying police instructions. 'This is not the revolutionary hero fabricated by myth,' scoffed Mr Fujimori in his Sunday night address. 'What we are seeing here is a monster.' He dubbed Mr Guzman 'sinister, malevolent. . . a diabolic genius. . . the henchman of the drugs trade'. The president accused Sendero of accumulating vast funds through the cocaine trade with which to finance 'Sendero ambassadors' in a number of European countries, including Britain, France, Belgium, Spain and Sweden. And he charged Mr Guzman with 'genocide', citing massacres in shanty-towns and rural communities. 'He is just as much a war criminal as the second world war fascists,' Mr Fujimori said. Sendero's leader, like other Peruvians now under arrest on charges of terrorism, will face summary trial by military tribunal. Modifications to the penal code in the wake of Sendero's car-bomb attacks in July mean terrorists are now considered 'traitors to the fatherland'. Although the death penalty for terrorism has wide popular support, it has not yet been enshrined in government policy. At a news conference yesterday, however, Mr Fujimori said: 'The law establishes at this time that the maximum penalty in this case is life imprisonment. But we must also listen to what the public demands.' When pressed, he said his personal opinion was that Mr Guzman deserved the death penalty and that he 'would study' its application. The capture of their leader, widely recognised as a brilliant military strategist, is a heavy blow for Sendero. But the organisation, according to Mr Enrique Bernales, former president of the Peruvian Senate commission on violence, is 'a Maoist, clandestine party with a quasi-military structure. They must already be activating contingency plans of tactical retreat and reconstruction'. The armed forces and police are braced for a violent response from the guerrillas. Security has been stepped up in the capital. An encouraging aspect of Mr Guzman's capture is that it seems, however briefly, to have created some desire for unity in a nation still deeply divided by racial, class and income differences. Some prominent politicians previously hostile to Mr Fujimori's de facto regime are now calling for 'national reconciliation'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, April 18 (KPL) -- Malaysian Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed on April 16 arrived  here on a three-day official visit to the Lao PDR [Lao People's  Democratic Republic] at the invitation of Lao Prime Minister  Khamtai Siphandon.    The visit was in response to the December 1992 visit of the  Lao prime minister to Malaysia, where three agreements were  signed between the two governments concerning investment  promotion and protection, economic, scientific and technical  cooperation and air transportation.    During the visit, the Malaysian prime minister called on Lao  President Nouhak Phoumsavan and met with Prime Minister Khamtai  Siphandon.    Talking with the Malaysian prime minister, President Nouhak  Phoumsavan said this visit was very significant in the history  of the Lao-Malaysian relations. He expressed hope that the  bilateral relations would further develop fruitfully in many  areas. In response, the Malaysian prime minister expressed  pleasure over a warm hospitality the Lao Government and people  gave to him and his party. He voiced support to the open-door  policy of the Lao Government on economic relations and  cooperation with foreign countries, and confirmed that he would  do all he could to develop the friendly relations and  cooperation between the two countries.    Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in his discussion with  his Malaysian counterpart also said that the visit was historic.  He considered it as implementing the three agreements signed  between the two governments in 1992.    On the same day afternoon, talks were held between the  government delegations of the two countries headed by their  respective prime ministers. At the talks, both sides discussed  a wide range of issues concerning their bilateral cooperation,  both public and private, in various fields.    The two prime ministers then witnessed the signing of an  agreement on banking settlement between the governors of the  central banks of the two countries.    In the evening, Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon hosted a  banquet in honour of his Malaysian counterpart.    The Malaysian prime minister was officially welcomed at the  airport by Lao Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon together with  Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Foreign Minister  Somsavat Lengsavat and other members of the Lao Government  officials. This three-day visit was the first ever made to the  country by the Malaysian prime minister following the Lao prime  minister's visit to Malaysia in December 1992.    The Malaysian delegation was accompanied by several  important  figures in the business circle of Malaysia.</p>

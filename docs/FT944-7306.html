			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Opposition Budgets focus on job creation The two main opposition parties yesterday unveiled alternative Budgets focusing on tax reform, job creation and investment in industry and education. Both shadow Budgets also called for the reversal of the government's plans for a second increase in the level of value added tax on domestic fuel, from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. However, the parties adopted starkly different approaches to taxation. Labour gave no figures, in line with the party's policy of leaving detailed decisions on tax rates and thresholds until close to the next general election. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats set out comprehensive tax proposals, including an increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in marginal taxation on incomes over Pounds 100,000. Tentative plans for higher taxes on incomes over Pounds 40,000 have been dropped for the time being, but Mr Malcolm Bruce, Treasury spokesman, said that such increases had not been ruled out of the manifesto for the next general election. Labour's Budget submission focused on plans to offer employers a six-month tax rebate of up to Pounds 75-a-week in return for hiring the long-term unemployed. The party said the rebate would cost up to Pounds 100m in the first year - but would 'more than pay for itself' the year after because of savings from benefits and lower unemployment. Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, said the proposals would help 1m people unemployed for more than one year and 300,000 of those out of work for more than two years. Labour also called for a review of corporate taxation, a Business Development Bank to raise funding for small and medium-sized businesses and a 'moratorium law' giving small companies in financial difficulty time to avoid bankruptcy. The party repeated earlier pledges to implement higher taxes on the profits of privatised utilities, and a special windfall levy on the Pounds 3.5bn profit that will accrue to the regional electricity companies when the National Grid is sold or transferred later this year. The Liberal Democrat Budget proposes a Pounds 1.8bn increase in education investment, as part of a Pounds 4.72bn increase in public spending which would also include a Pounds 900m back-to-work scheme and higher spending on health and the police. The party would also forego Pounds 950m of revenue by reducing National Insurance contributions for the lower paid, increasing the total cost of spending and tax reductions to Pounds 5.675bn.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling and dollar strength to be tested  -Currency Markets Activity on the money markets looks set to be fragmented this week, with attention focused fairly equally around the dollar, yen and D-Mark. With the fifth round of US-Japan trade framework talks due to begin in Tokyo this week, a key question will be the sensitive relationship between the dollar and yen. Last year the US government tried to talk down the dollar's rate against the yen to put pressure on Japan in trade negotiations. But a carefully timed interjection by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last week criticised the yen's recent slide. But though the US government now fears that a weak yen could harm US interests if it deepens the Japanese recession, Mr Bentsen's intervention is likely to be only partly successful. After weakening at the beginning of last week, the yen later rose on the back of worse-than-expected US unemployment data. But most dealers expect it to fall further this week, possibly touching the Y115 level. On the dollar side, the publication of a spate of US economic data this week, will intensify the debate about the pace of the US economic recovery. Although most dealers expect the dollar's recent bull run to be tempered, market sentiment remains mixed about the pace of the US recovery. Consequently the dollar seems set to remain within a small - albeit volatile  -band. The D-Mark will also be closely monitored this week after the Bundesbank attempted to dampen market speculation last Thursday that a rate cut will occur later this month. Although the D-Mark slightly strengthened after this, many dealers remain convinced that the ailing state of the German economy will force a cut soon. In the UK the publication of labour market data on Wednesday, and producer prices and industrial production data on Thursday, will fuel speculation about sterling's ability to break through the DM2.60 barrier. Last week the pound touched a six-month high, amid growing optimism about economic recovery. Meanwhile the mounting concern about the weak Spanish economy seems set to depress the peseta even further, while the Italian lira's recent rise is likely to be halted, with more twists in the Italian corruption scandal expected.</p>

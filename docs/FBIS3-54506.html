			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: A Step Toward Clearing the Arab Climate"] </F>   [Text] The visit by Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to  Saudi Arabia and his talks with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz  represent a positive step toward rebuilding the bridges between  the PLO and the Gulf states. This, after the deterioration in  Palestinian-Gulf relations in the aftermath of the second Gulf  war and the subsequent inter-Arab rifts as a whole.    Undoubtedly, any effort toward clearing the Arab climate and  restoring its harmony and serenity is now more necessary than  ever. If the Gulf war was a black cloud in the Arab nation's  history and a negative development in relations between  brothers, insistence on maintaining that dark and painful  chapter and keeping the wound of fraternal Arab relations  bleeding will benefit no one but the adversaries of this nation  and those who try to exploit differences and crises to achieve  gains and goals at the expense of all the Arabs.    The hope is that Palestinian-Saudi relations in particular,  and Palestinian-Gulf relations in general, will be elevated to  their well-known level, even if in stages. Those states were --  and it is hoped they will remain in the future -- supporters of  the Palestinian cause. It is a cause which the Arabs believed  was above Arab differences and disputes and a reason for unity  not discord, convergence not divergence.    The Palestinian people have proceeded on the road to peace  and are now passing through a difficult stage in the  negotiations for implementing the interim agreement. Many  foreign parties have declared their support for the Palestinian  people's efforts in building their entity, institutions, and  infrastructure. The Arab brothers everywhere are called upon to  play an active role in this sphere. Not only the Palestinians  but the entire world expects them to do so.    Certainly, the supreme Arab interest requires one to forget  the rancors, sensitivities, and pains and to develop a positive  pattern of relations between the various Arab states based on  cooperation and mutual respect. This is what the Palestinian  cause requires at these delicate circumstances through which it  is passing. Moreover, this will represent a great achievement  on the pan-Arab level following the collapse and decline  witnessed by the Arabs during the past years.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / People: Master of the Queen's quarries There are 30 working quarries on the Crown Estate - the 300,000 acres of land the Queen inherited when she became monarch - producing such things as sand, gravel, brick clay, stone, potash, rock salt, limestone and slate. The man who will in future advise the Commissioners who run the Crown Estate about these operations is Kenneth Bate who has been appointed Crown Mineral Agent. Bate is a partner in the Wardell Armstrong consultancy; the previous occupant of the post was Eric Hassall who retired from the partnership in July. In addition to the quarrying operations - revenue from which, like all Crown Estate revenue, goes to the UK Treasury - the Crown Estate has the ownership of all gold and silver wherever it might be found in the UK. The Estate says that at present proposals are being considered for two gold projects, one in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland, but will give no more details for the time being. As Crown Mineral Agent, Bate will advise on and negotiate leases and licences relating to land minerals. He will also advise the Commissioners on all aspects of minerals including identification of potential deposits, technical matters, valuation, mine safety and land re-instatement after quarrying. His qualifications for this include being a Chartered Minerals Surveyor and a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a Chartered Engineer, a Member of the Institution of Mining Engineers and a Fellow of the Geological Society of London. He has worked on projects in North and South America, Africa and the Far East as well as in the UK.</p>

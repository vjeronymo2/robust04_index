			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Veba chief warns of 14% fall in profits for full year VEBA, the big industrial conglomerate based in Dusseldorf, has warned that net profits for the full year will probably fall by 14 per cent. Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive, made no comment on the likely outcome for pre-tax profits, which fell by nearly 20 per cent in the first nine months to DM1.2bn (Dollars 753m). Net profit for the whole of last year was DM1.22bn, fractionally above the previous year's result. The dividend will be held at DM12 per share, Mr Piltz confirmed. Veba was one of the few big German companies to raise its dividend last year, and its decision to hold this year's pay-out may not be matched by other German chemical groups. Mr Piltz said Veba planned to cut 7,000 jobs by 1993, 5,000 of them from the chemicals sector, saving DM400m to DM500m a year.</p>

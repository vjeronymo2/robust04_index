			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NETWORK ADDS SAUDI WEATHER  </P> <P> To satisfy surging interest in Saudi Arabian weather among family and friends  of American soldiers, the Weather Channel cable network has added a focus  report on the region to its regular coverage, a network official said.  </P> <P> Reports on Persian Gulf weather will be given twice each hour.  </P> <P> "These are tense times, and there's a lack of hard news coming out of the  region. Providing a weather report obviously helps families and the nation as a  whole feel closer to the men and women serving overseas," said Stan Hunter,  vice president of programming. He said the reports will continue indefinitely.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Brussels sets EU vote deadline European Union member states must set up procedures to allow EU citizens to vote and stand in municipal elections in countries where they live and pay taxes by January 1, 1996, the European Commission said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber from Brussels. The move affects 5m EU citizens, among them 1.2m Italians and 840,000 Portuguese, who live in other EU states. Some EU countries may continue to ban foreigners from running for mayor or and immigration matters. Half of the 12 EU countries already give conditional voting rights to non-nationals.</p>

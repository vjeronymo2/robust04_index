			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE ENDORSES PLAN TO MAKE MX MISSILES MOBILE  </P> <P> The Senate today endorsed President Bush's plan for making MX nuclear missiles  mobile, rejecting a proposal to slash $502 million from the Administration's  $1.1-billion request for the weapons program.  </P> <P> On a 62-38 vote, the Senate turned aside an amendment that would have trimmed  the funds earmarked for placing the existing 50 MX missiles on railroad cars --  a budget-cutting step the House took last week.  </P> <P> "If we have that kind of unraveling over here, we go to conference with a  totally illogical, unsound program . . . and I believe that will be detrimental  to both our national security and our arms control," Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.),  chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said as the Senate resumed  consideration of its version of the $295-billion fiscal 1990 defense bill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stealth Program Criticized  </P> <P> The Senate also approved, 93 to 7, a non-binding resolution expressing the  sense of the chamber that "it is not presently prudent or possible to commit to  the procurement of an operational force" of B-2 Stealth bombers.  </P> <P> Lawmakers have criticized the plan to build 132 of the radar-evading planes at  a cost of $70 billion, or $530 million per plane.  </P> <P> The House last week voted to strictly limit the Stealth program in fiscal 1990,  pressing the Pentagon to come up with a cheaper program. But the Senate kept  the Administration's program relatively intact, making a modest cut of $300  million.  </P> <P> Voting against the B-2 resolution today were Sens. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Bob Dole  (R-Kan.), Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), James A. McClure (R-Ida.),  Don Nickels (R-Okla.) and Steve Symms (R-Ida.).  </P></p>

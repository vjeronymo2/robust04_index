			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 06/28/94--Russian  President's Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov arrived from Baku  to Yerevan yesterday, to continue negotiations on peaceful  resolution of the Karabakh problem.    Kazimirov met the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon  Ter-Petrosyan. Russian President's envoy declared after the  meeting that he is satisfied by working negotiations in Baku and  Yerevan, and feels that Armenians and Azeris are really  interested in establishing peace.    "Baku seriously wishes to facilitate the preparatory work on  signing a political agreement to stop the military conflict,"  said Kazimirov.    He stressed that opposing the CSCE and Russian projects  would  be erroneous, and several topics of the CSCE project were also  included in the Russian plan.    "We can find many similarities though there are some  differences," said Kazimirov. "If CSCE only offers a schedule  of measures, Russia is attempting to stipulate signing a legal  inter-state document on stopping the conflict. This is the  first difference, the second is that the Russian plan has better  developed mechanisms of cease fire, reducing the danger of  resumption of military operations to a minimum." In his opinion,  CSCE Minsk group's schedule doesn't stipulate such mechanisms.    Questioned whether CSCE may become an obstacle to  implementation of the Russian mediation efforts Kazimirov said,  he wouldn't like to believe this and hopes that Chairman of the  CSCE Minsk group Eliasson will continue to collaborate.    Answering the question on when the agreement will be signed,  Kazimirov said that they are ready to sign it tomorrow, but  readiness of the conflicting sides is also required. Paying  importance to Stepanakert's opinion Russian president's envoy  said he was unable to visit Karabakh this time due to  unfavorable weather conditions, but he hopes such a possibility  will be created in the nearest future.    Kazimirov will leave to Baku and from there to Ankara today,  to continue the negotiations. "I find the meetings in Teheran  and future meetings in Ankara very important, as these countries  are situated in the region and military operations are carried  up to the Iranian border zone," he said. At the same time  Kazimirov rejected the notion that a new form of regional  resolution of the Karabakh conflict has been created.    Presidential spokesman Levon Zurabyan said in turn,  commenting on Kazimirov's visit, it is still too early to speak  on signing any documents or a significant progress.  Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that lull, established at  the fronts, will be supported by a corresponding legal document.</p>

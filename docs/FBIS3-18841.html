In terms of form, however, the  escalation is quite significant. The heavy guns Washington is  bringing to bear against the foreign trade practices of Japan  and other states -- which are felt to be discriminating -- marks  a new round in the trade conflict between the two biggest  economies, a conflict that was predetermined by the failure of  the American-Japanese summit two weeks ago. While the yen, as  the most efficient correction instrument for disparities in  Japanese foreign trade, boomed as expected after the failure of  the summit, the United States is now voicing threats.    The President, represented by Trade Representative Kantor,  made it quite clear who the primary U.S. target is: Japan and,  still unexpressed, South Korea. Tokyo's first reaction was  almost one of relief. The stock exchange reacted with friendly  restraint, as the yen declined markedly, and the United States  will do nothing but complete their list of complaints against  Japan until 30 September. Although government and economic  spokesmen in Tokyo expressed concern and criticism about the  reactivation of Super 301, the certainty prevailed that a  compromise will be achieved before a trade war breaks out.    So far, Tokyo has not been irritated by the pressure  undoubtedly exerted by Super 301 and the ensuing deterioration  of the political climate that signal danger for world trade.  This will change. A petty, and probably embarrassing, list of  Japan's sins will follow, drawn up by a still inexperienced U.S.  Administration, and presented to a Japanese Government that  largely is worn out.    For the Hosokawa government the escalation with Washington  means another diplomatic failure, that will further undermine  the prime minister's authority. During the next few weeks, while  the United States is formulating its charge, composure in Tokyo  will give way to hectic research into where Japan can compromise  without losing face. In today's calm before the storm, Tokyo  hopes it will be able to report the beginning of an upswing in  12 months' time, which the United States -- quite mistakenly --  considers to be the precondition for reducing its deficit with  Japan.    But the economic shift is significantly influenced by the  external value of the yen. If, during the long procedure of  Super 301 or because of excessive U.S. demands, the trade  conflict is transferred back to the foreign exchange market,  Japan's upswing will be delayed and America's patience strained.  The scenario is so alarming that Washington and Tokyo are  wooing Europe for assistance, and Japan wants to mobilize Asian  neighbors as well. This opens up a position of mediator for  Europe, which, if successful, might improve its position in  Japan. But, if Japan's loneliness turns into isolation, it will  withdraw to Asia even more quickly than it is doing anyhow.</p>

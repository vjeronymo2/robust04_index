			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- A new society was founded  on Friday [8 April] in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei  Province, to study how to speed up economic growth in the Chang  Jiang River valley, one of the most developed areas in the  country.    Qian Zhengying, vice-chairman of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),  serves as the honorary president of the newly established  Yangtze [Chang Jiang] Society of Technological Economics. Guo  Shuyan, vice-minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, serves as the president.    The society has five academic committees specializing in the  study of developing energy resources, harnessing the Chang Jiang  River and its tributaries, improving shipping services,  promoting regional economic development and invigorating major  state-owned enterprises.    The society was founded jointly by the Hubei Provincial  Government, the Wuhan City Government, a subsidiary of the  Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and a subsidiary of the  Ministry of Communications.    The Chang Jiang River Valley, which produces 40 percent of  China's gross domestic product, currently has 17 new- and  high-tech development zones, a third of the nation's total.    The valley is expected to become China's economic center,  with the construction of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, at the  mouth of the Chang Jiang River, and the undertaking of the  gigantic Three Gorges project on the river's middle reaches.</p>

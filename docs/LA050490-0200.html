			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OURS IS THE ERA OF HESITATION CHIC;  </P> <P> PRESIDENCY: THE HECTORING CLASSES MAY DERIDE HIM FOR HIS LACK OF ACTION, BUT IT  IS GEORGE BUSH WHO PROSPERS.  </P> <P> The majority leader of the House of Representatives is a dinosaur. This is not  to say that he has enormous bulk, a tiny brain and lives on the Mesozoic Era's  equivalents of broccoli and endive. But he is a relic from a faraway time when  fantasticos roamed the political landscape. This is obvious from his policies,  which are all passe, and from the fact that when Majority Leader Richard  Gephardt wants a few laughs, he points to the White House's prudent responses  to unprecedented international events and derides President George Herbert  Walker Bush as "the hesitation President."  </P> <P> He laughs, and President Bush prospers. In an era when unforeseen upheaval  shakes Eastern Europe and the Soviet Empire, wariness is advised. If the Hon.  Mr. Gephardt would take leave of his partisan gambits to observe the leaders of  other developed countries, he would see that all are proceeding cautiously.  Ours is the era of Hesitation Chic.  </P> <P> And it works. The President is flourishing. His democratic aspirations for  Nicaragua have been realized. The tyrant Noriega is in irons. The economy is  sound. The nation is at peace. Some 70% of the American people applaud the  President. Washington commentators grumble that Washington is no longer the  center of "the action." Yet what is this "action"? The "action" seems to be the  transformation of one's country from socialism and totalitarianism into a  simulacrum of America. America is the ideal that the emerging democracies seek  to emulate.  </P> <P> In Washington the pundits and members of the loyal opposition such as the Hon.  Mr. Gephardt compose the hectoring classes. They are always bawling for their  President to take Action This Day, because they always thrive on presidential  pratfalls and the political hullabaloo that invariably follows a bold  presidential initiative. Yet some of the wisest students of history have noted  the colossal political benefits that accrue when Hesitation is Chic. In the  15th Century, that shrewd and sagacious Florentine statesman Francesco  Guicciardini marveled at King Ferdinand V's artful use of hesitation. According  to Guicciardini, when the "most powerful and prudent prince . . . wished to  embark on some new enterprise or take a decision of great importance, he often  proceeded in such a way that before his intentions were known, the whole court  and nation already desired it, and cried out -- the king should do this . . .  ."  </P> <P> Now that is precisely the procedure that is being followed by our own great  President. In Panama he obviously wanted to see Manuel Noriega toppled, but  proceeded cautiously. Soon "the whole court and nation" were urging military  action, even the Democrats. When the President sent in the troops, only Jesse  Jackson was around to carp. Similarly, in Lithuania, the President has acted  with the political timing that Guicciardini admired. Obviously President Bush  wants all the Baltic nations to be free and independent, but as Paul Gigot has  pointed out in the Wall Street Journal, the President's cautious approach "has  ensured that if he does ever impose sanctions and relations with Mr. Gorbachev  go sour he'll have plenty of accomplices." Democrats and Republicans alike are  urging action, and yet right now a compromise between Lithuania and the Soviets  seems to be in the air. Either way the President's hesitation will be  vindicated.  </P> <P> In domestic policy, too, Hesitation Chic as practiced by Bush has led to  enviable victories. When the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  heaved up a clean-air bill that would drag the economy back into the 17th  Century, the President quietly resisted the bill until the Democrats  compromised. He has followed the same tack with the minimum wage bill and with  child care.  </P> <P> The era of the great bellowing leaders is over. Hesitation is in, and we need  not reach back to the 15th Century in search of its philosophical defenses.  That incomparable American statesman and philosopher Calvin Coolidge  admonished: "Never go out to meet trouble. If you will just sit still," our  13th President explained, "nine cases out of 10 someone will intercept it  before it reaches you." Today, he who hesitates dominates.  </P></p>

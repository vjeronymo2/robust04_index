			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THAT'S TRENDY  </P> <P> Marlee Matlin, the hearing-impaired actress who won a best-actress Oscar for  "Children of a Lesser God" (1987), has taken a "small part" -- only two weeks  work -- in "The Linguini Incident." And producer Arnold Orgolini still seems  bowled over that he's landed Matlin -- and other name talent -- for his "under  $4-million" picture.  </P> <P> When "Linguini" begins filming shortly in downtown L.A., Matlin will join star  Rosanna Arquette and co-stars David Bowie, Kelly Lynch, Andre Gregory and  Shelley Winters.  </P> <P> Argolini credits "wonderful material" for attracting actors and crew willing to  work at "considerably less" than their usual rates.  </P> <P> The romantic comedy, written by Tamar Brott and director Richard Shephard, has  Arquette as a waitress in an ultra-trendy L.A. restaurant. Along with a  girlfriend (Lynch), she gets involved with a British bartender (Bowie)  desperately seeking a green card -- through marriage to a Yank.  </P> <P> Matlin plays a cashier in the boite. How trendy is it?  </P> <P> "So trendy," Orgolini says, "that she has her own interpreter." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Drawing across the phone line Researchers are now pouring cold water on the idea that the principal benefit of videophones - telephones equipped with screens and videocameras - is the ability to see the person at the other end of the line, writes Alan Cane. Much more important, they say, is the capacity to work together on the same task - a document, say, or a chart. In other words, the ability to share a workspace over the telephone line. Development engineers at Hewlett Packard, the US electronics group, are in the latter stages of developing a product which exploits this finding. Called the 'deskslate', it is essentially an interactive fax machine, enabling two people linked by a telephone line to examine, modify and annotate the same document. Each has to have their own deskslate. It consists of a flat tablet about the size of a desk ledger; most of the top surface is taken up with a high-definition liquid display screen. Prototypes at HP's Bristol UK research centre have large personal computers hidden under the desk, to drive them, but the aim of the development engineers is to shrink the electronics into the slate itself. An electronic stylus is provided to write on the screen and the slate is linked to a telephone handset. Documents, plans, memos and so on can be put into the slate by a variety of means - scanning or transmission from a conventional fax machine or personal computer.</p>

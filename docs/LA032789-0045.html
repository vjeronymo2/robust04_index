			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The National Security Agency and a research arm of the Commerce Department have  reached an agreement aimed at strengthening protection of sensitive information  handled by thousands of federal government computers. The memorandum of  understanding was signed late last week by the NSA's director, Vice Adm. W. O.  Studeman, and Raymond G. Kammer, acting director of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology. Kammer said the agreement "provides a structure for  discussions between NSA and us if there are issues that arise where there is a  conflict between a classified or national security issue and regular civilian  data issues." The effort has been spurred by concern over so-called computer  viruses, computer code that can be inserted into software programs to cause  computers to malfunction by clogging memory, destroying or altering data.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CS.N.L."-signed interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum </F> Chairman Lajos Fur; place and date not given: "Most of the  Issues Will Be Decided Between the Two Election Rounds"]    [Text] Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF], thinks that a cooperation of divided  national-commitment forces is impossible until the first round  of the upcoming elections. Lajos Fur thinks that most issues  will be decided between the two rounds of elections. He hopes  that the uncertain voters will eventually vote for the MDF.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people say today that the MDF remained  alone before the elections also because it deviated from the  spirit of Lakitelek. Do you think this is true?    [Fur] If we look at the Lakitelek documents, it transpires  that we have not deviated from any of the statements. It was  clear at the time too that we did not call for radical changes,  but we were for a gradual reform policy to avoid a radical  change.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Then why are these accusations repeatedly  coming up?    [Fur] There can be individual offense or unfulfilled  ambitions behind this, or even the fact that some people  imagined something else behind the concepts and not what they  really cover. I am convinced that the things formulated at  Lakitelek are being carried out. Naturally, the best ideas do  not appear crystal clear in everyday politics.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] People with a national commitment find it  difficult to accept that the political forces committed to  national values are so much divided that they almost lack a  chance. While their opponents created election alliances, the  forces that call themselves national forces are divided and  present everywhere, from the MDF and up to the tiny extremist  parties, on the political arena.    [Fur] Unfortunately, this is true, and it is very sad. The  situation is similar to the one prevailing in Poland, where the  national forces are scattered. I can only guess the reason  behind this. National feelings appear in many different ways in  the political thinking. Of course, the liberal and leftist  blocs are also split. In the case of nationally-commited  parties, individual groups emerged more spectacularly. This is  not a positive development, because if many people vote for  these small parties, the national forces will lose many votes.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Have you already made any attempts to create  unity?    [Fur] This is impossible until the first round of elections,  but one cannot tell what will happen between the two rounds,  because it is obvious that most of the issues will be decided  between the two rounds.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] According to some opinion polls, the  national and liberal parties, as well as the leftist parties,  enjoy one-third of the votes each. At the same time, the  trenches are very deep and an increasing number of people fear  that it will be difficult to form a government.    [Fur] If I look at those who already decided to vote and  also decided whom to vote for, these percentages generally  reflect the truth. We also enjoy the support of at least 3  million voters who have not yet decided even whether to go to  vote at all. If this 40 percent can be mobilized, this might  upset the forecasts and change the uncertain situation in our  favor.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is it not strange that the least  politically- informed people will decide on the elections  results?    [Fur] They are also citizens of this country, only that they  are not interested in the political life.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Political analysts often say that the fact  that you constantly warn the citizens of a leftist danger only  increases the socialists' popularity.    [Fur] I do not think that our warning awoke the citizens'  leftist attraction. The measurable sociological factors that  induce the fear of a possible leftist danger can also be  scientifically demonstrated. In my opinion, in such a  situation, we can defeat the leftist danger if we try to draw  the people's attention to this and win over the uncertain voters.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In that case, this is only a power that  lasts for one cycle. The fact that you are present on the  political arena signals that this is not a real danger.    [Fur] There are people who claim that this danger will only  last one year, because they will not be able to govern after  that. In my opinion, there is greater danger in such a turn,  because the economy and the political mood will improve in the  immediate future because they will not be able to spoil  completely everything we have done so far. But there is a  danger in the leftist method prone to administrative measures,  namely that they will rebuild their own power with such a  determination that it will not leave any scope for the other  forces. However, this is only a supposition.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With whom would you be willing to hold  coalition talks?    [Fur] This will be the most difficult thing. And not only  for us. Many people ask whether it is enough for the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] to form a coalition with [Workers Party  chairman] Thurmer to set up a socialist government. Will Horn's  left wing talk to the Workers Party at all? How will a  social-liberal coalition disintegrate the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ]? We have natural allies, the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Smallholders' Party. I  do not think that it is possible to hold coalition talks with  Torgyan's smallholders. With Csurka's party? I cannot envisage  this either. With Pozsgay? They call themselves both leftist  and national. Who is left?    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Federation of Young Democrats calls  itself a national liberal party.    [Fur] The big question is what results they will achieve in  the elections. It is good if they call themselves national and  exclude the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP. But their  chairman speaks lightly of the MDF and the government; if they  continue to do this, I do not know if there is any basis of  cooperation.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] A lot of concern has been formulated here in  the course of our discussion. Are you optimistic?    [Fur] Yes, I am. Stalemate is the worst thing in politics.  I hope that at least 1.5 million of the uncertain citizens will  go to vote. They are the quiet and balanced people in private  life and in the local public life who cannot give their votes to  anyone else but to a balanced and sober national center party.</p>

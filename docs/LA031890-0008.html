			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURE GORE  </P> <P> I suspected that Vidal, based on his behavior I've witnessed over the years via  television, was a bit pompous.  </P> <P> However, Harrison is the pretentious one, with her use of obscure words  (jejune, probity, prescient). My favorite sentence: "Surely his woulds have had  time to heal? They suppurate." I found Harrison's article revealing and  entertaining, yet I got tired of having to stop so often to consult my  dictionary.  </P> <P> CAROL CHASTANG, Reseda  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: Hair is wearing thin - First night This is the dying of the age of Aquarius. Sad to say, the old 1968 musical has failed the test of time. The revival of Hair at the Old Vic is a doleful occasion. True, not everyone will be entirely surprised. There were those of us who did not think too highly of it in the first place. This is the first time that I have seen it in England. At least in Germany at the end of the 1960s it seemed to catch a mood in a country that was just waking up. There had been student protests all over Europe. Vietnam was a potent word. In London there was the end of censorship: nudity on stage and more four letter words. All that now looks old hat. The hippies have aged. Nudity is a commonplace, swearing is a substitute for thought even the politics looks thin. The best that Hair can do for a swipe at John Kennedy is to have the president crossing the stage saying 'ask not what you can do for your country, but what Marilyn can do for you.' The production appears to think that it is shocking to use the word 'nigger'; actually it is (out of context), but today an audience is simply embarrassed. There is also a remarkably anachronistic view of Lyndon Johnson suppressing the blacks. References to earlier American history look puerile. None of that might matter if the rest of the show stood up. It does not. The nearest Hair comes to a joke is a girl saying 'why don't you call me?' to be met with 'because you don't have a telephone.' The plot doesn't stand up either because there isn't one. So what? you might say. It's a musical, not a drama. Well, listen to the songs and will find that they are not what you remember. The best remain the opening 'Aquarius' and the concluding 'Let the Sun Shine In', but between them nothing has dawned. Who now cares a hoot for the song called 'Manchester, England'? The truth is that Hair seemed a strong musical at the time because of the general mood. Even the apparently innocent worship of drugs has now faded, let alone the homage to indiscriminate sex. Too many people have died in the meantime. What appears not to have died is the admiration for the hippies. Otherwise there can be no conceivable reason for an expensive revival. Yet even there I am not so sure. This was a first night audience, usually primed to applaud every word, every song. The Old Vic audience was often uncannily quiet. The moment when a woman mounts the stage from the auditorium failed to come off; her male partner is even more of a misfit. Meanwhile, the hippies mooch around and occasionally dance. They worship the sun, they worship the moon and they look like pixies at Stonehenge. What a conservative, conformist, primitive, tribal lot they were] Even when they undress they do it in unison. Michael Bogdanov directs. All that one can say is that it was an interesting experiment to try a revival. This production proves beyond doubt that not everything in the 1960s is worth going back to, except as a curiosity. The mood now is one of not being quite sure where to look. It was really an extraordinary idea that people could be held together merely by having long hair. The fashion has changed. Time to bring back Guys and Dolls. Old Vic Theatre (071) 928 7616</p>

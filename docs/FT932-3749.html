			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Costly way to cash a cheque Sir, I refer to your article 'Plan ahead for Holiday Cash' (June 5/6). Your writer lays insufficient emphasis on the charges that may be levied on cashing travellers' cheques. I have very recently returned from Portugal. The banks in Lagos charge Es2,100 (Pounds 9.00) on any travellers' cheque regardless of value. This, according to them, is a government instruction. It means, therefore, on a Pounds 20.00 cheque you get Pounds 11.00 if it is the one cheque. This does not apply to those with local accounts. I have received a reply from American Express indicating that its own branches do not charge. Unfortunately the nearest Amex branch to Lagos is some 20 miles away. Tourists to Portugal should beware.

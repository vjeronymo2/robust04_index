			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: British Telecom to invest in satellite services BRITISH TELECOM is investing about Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) in financing new satellite telecommunication equipment on board commercial airliners to position itself in the emerging market for aircraft satellite communication services. The BT investment reflects the growing interest of international telecommunication companies in new airline satellite communication systems which, together with new satellite navigation systems, are expected to revolutionise commercial air transport over the next 20 years. 'The introduction of new satellite navigation and communication technology is expected to be as significant for the airline industry as the transition from the turbo-propellor aircraft to the jet in the 1950s,' Mr William Fromme, director of the air navigation bureau of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the aviation arm of the United Nations, said yesterday at a Financial Times conference at the Dubai Air Show. Mr Fromme said new satellite telecommunication and navigation systems were expected to improve sharply safety and airspace management and provide significant economic advantages to airlines. But according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata) studies one of the biggest pay-offs would for telecommunication companies because of the increased use of satellite telecommunications on board aircraft. Apart from BT, the US Comsat satellite telecommunication group and Teleglobe of Canada are already committed to substantial investment of airborne telecommunication technology and equipment. So far, about 300 aircraft have been equipped with satellite communication packages. The cost of installing this equipment on board is about Dollars 500,000 per aircraft. With many financially strapped airlines reluctant to financethis new communication equipment, telecommunication companies appear increasingly interested because of the expectation of long-term revenue flows. 'Up to now, many people appear to have underestimated the potential revenues from on-board personal services like communications, information and entertainment,' Mr Fromme said. Studies have suggested that airline passengers could spend between Dollars 20 to Dollars 40 a year each on onboard communication services. Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, estimates that passengers could spend up to Dollars 100 a year each on on-board electronic shopping facilities. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways also sees onboard electronic shopping and entertainment as providing an increasing source of revenue for airlines to offset continued pressure on fares.</p>

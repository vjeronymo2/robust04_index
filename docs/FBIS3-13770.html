In a statement to MENA  in Harare today, the source said the issuance of such a  resolution by the Security Council would reassure the PLO about  the protection and security of the Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories. He noted that a U.S. veto of such a  resolution would be an obstacle to the peace process.</p>

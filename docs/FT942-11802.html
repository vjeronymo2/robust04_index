			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Observer: Savouring success Is there no keeping that Peter de Savary down? Hot on the heels of the collapse of his Placeton property-to-oil company, he now has plans for a Pounds 100m network of 'autoparks' - sites where people can test-drive and buy cars - which, he claims, will be great places for a family day out. So where is he going to get the money from, seeing that Standard Chartered has suffered a loss of up to Pounds 50m on the Placeton collapse? Well, plenty of other banks have been on the phone in the past couple of days, would you believe, perfectly ready to talk business. 'I have banks who are very fond of me,' he points out. Indeed, plans for 'four or five' autoparks around Britain are already well advanced. De Savary says six big car companies - anonymous so far  - are keen to support the idea. The first sites could be operational in 1996, with London's Docklands and Southampton being among the contenders. Each would be about 50 acres and include Disney-style amusements for children plus restaurants and bars operating 18 hours a day. Sounds absolutely heavenly, just what the bankers ordered. Wait a minute; has he checked out Eurodisney recently . . ?</p>

The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes: "Let us devote a few  kind words to the first cosmonaut along with the whole world  which marks Gagarin year at the call of the U.N. Educational,  Scientific and Cultural organisation. Do not shun idealisation.  After all, we should have some ideals".    The TRUD newspaper carries reminiscences by Cosmonaut no. 2  Gherman Titov about Gagarin. "Gagarin preserved dignity, despite  the hard test of world-wide fame and general love. His fate is  like a sun-drenched smile of Russia."    Writing about Gagarin, the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs  an exclusive interview with Valeri Alaverdov, first deputy  managing director of the Russian Space Agency, under the  headline "We've Gained Experience of Man's Longest Stay in  Space". He comments on the Russian Federal Space Programme up  to the year 2000 which was recently approved by the government.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper writes that "Gagarin was  brought up by the Soviet socialist state which inculcated him  with high spiritual qualities". The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  newspaper prints a feature on Gagarin.    ROSSIYSKIE VESTI prints an article by chairman of the state  property committee Anatoli Chubais, noting that the voucher  privatisation in the country will end on June 30, 1994, as  planned, despite any changes in the situation.    "The post-privatisation operation of enterprises is the key  element for us now," he stresses. Therefore, we are  increasingly shifting our activities to creating sources of  financing privatised enterprises."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper describes ongoing military  reforms in the country, regarding them as a top priority for the  state. "The armed forces have entered the second stage of their  restructuring which will end in 1995. It is highly probable  that its tasks will be accomplished, despite the difficult  economic situation in the country."    The same newspaper carries an interview with the former  assistant of the U.S. military attache, retired  Lieutenant-Colonel James Halbrook. He noted that Russia's  golden age is still ahead.    When Russia, designer of numerous technologies challenging  world standards, will gain stability, it will turn into a  mammoth Japan, although this comparison, may be, is not very  apt, the Lieutenant-Colonel continued.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an article on  stepped-up activities of American diplomacy near Russia's  southern borders, stressing that consequences of these  activities "can be unpredictable, including for the United  States".    The newspaper notes that Washington can "achieve an  unheard-of strategic advantage peacefully or with a minimum use  of military force. Coming to the region of the post-Soviet  south, the United States will turn to be in the rear of several  states to which the U.S. has or can have claims (Iran,  Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India and, of course,  Russia)."    The same newspaper informs its readers of a meeting between  U.S. ex-president Richard Nixon, now on a private visit in  Moscow, and former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy,  leader of the Free Russia Party.    Rutskoy said that the party's task should be struggle  against  authorities with "peaceful parliamentarian means".    The PRAVDA newspaper also reports a meeting between Nixon  and  Russian Communist Party Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. It singles  out the latter's words that the Russian Communist Party "does  not embrace either right-wing or left-wing radicalism and is  ready to cooperate with all political forces championing the  revival of a strong Russia".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA calls on the Russian Federation of  Independent Trade Unions to step up its activities. In turn,  first deputy chairman of this federation Aleksey Surikov writes  in the same newspaper what interferes with unions' reformation  work.    According to Surikov, these are inner problems and  contradictions, on the one hand, and strong outside pressure  from authorities and various political movements and parties, on  the other.</p>

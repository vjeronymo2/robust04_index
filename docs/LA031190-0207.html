			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP PANEL BACKS O.C. LEGISLATORS' ANTI-GAY STANDS  </P> <P> After three years of rejection, a coalition of conservative Orange County  legislators succeeded Saturday in passing two anti-gay resolutions through a  state Republican Party committee.  </P> <P> Former opponents of the measures, including a gay Republican organization, said  a week of delicate negotiations before the state party's semiannual convention  led to a compromise that essentially made the resolutions meaningless.  </P> <P> But the authors, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Assemblyman Gil  Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), were claiming victory Saturday and predicting that  the measures would be passed today at a meeting of all the delegates attending  the convention.  </P> <P> "We now have an expression of the state party on the issue, and the state party  speaks for all of us," Dannemeyer said. "Anybody who wants to be a leader in  our party should recognize that traditional family values have been encouraged  and that's the direction he or she should be going."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer's resolution would prohibit the granting of "special privileges" to  individuals or groups based on sexual preference. It is aimed at ordinances  prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in areas such as employment,  housing and education.  </P> <P> Ferguson's resolution is intended to prevent the party from recognizing  organizations based on sexual preference, such as the Log Cabin Club, a gay  Republican organization.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and the Rev. Louis Sheldon, head of  Orange County's Traditional Values Coalition, also attended the committee  meeting and supported the resolutions.  </P> <P> Under the negotiated agreement, Ferguson removed a specific reference to the  Log Cabin Club from his resolution. As a result, Orange County's Log Cabin  President Frank Richiazzi said he does not believe the measure will affect his  organization.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer agreed to remove graphic descriptions of sex acts that had been  included in his measure. Richiazzi said he is not opposed to a ban on "special  privileges" because gays only request that they be treated equally in the  party.  </P> <P> "There is nobody in the gay community that is asking for special privileges,"  Richiazzi said. "It's meaningless now. This small little Bible-thumping group  is in a fantasy world."  </P> <P> Saturday's vote came after more than a week of negotiations aimed at heading  off the divisive battles the resolutions have sparked at past conventions  between party conservatives and moderates.  </P> <P> The negotiations included state party Chairman Frank Visco, staff members from  gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's campaign, the Orange County authors of  the resolutions and the Log Cabin Club.  </P> <P> During the previous convention, "there were people who thought . . . things got  out of hand," said Otto Bos, campaign manager for Wilson. "We kind of worked to  encourage them to talk to each other."  </P> <P> After that convention, held last September in Anaheim, party leaders, including  national GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, condemned the resolutions, saying they were  in conflict with the party's intention to be inclusive and reach out to  minority groups.  </P> <P> Saturday, Visco said he now supports the resolutions. "The Republican Party is  an all-inclusive party within the guidelines of practicality," he said.  </P> <P> Visco said gays are welcome in the Republican Party but he does not believe a  group organized on sexual preference should be a chartered Republican club.  </P> <P> Party leaders were also concerned that the resolutions might aggravate Wilson's  difficult relationship with the conservative wing of the party, since he has  supported the Log Cabin Club.  </P> <P> Bos said he does not believe the resolutions will cause any problems because  they were approved by all sides.  </P> <P> "We have a good feeling about what happened," Bos said. "There are going to be  differences from time to time, but we're all Republicans."  </P> <P> Dornan warned, however, that if Wilson criticizes the resolutions, "he will  increase the percentage against him . . . and that's something for the  Democrats to feed off."  </P></p>

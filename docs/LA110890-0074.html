			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTIST SHOWING IN S. AFRICA VOTE REFLECTS WHITES' WORRY OVER REFORM  </P> <P> The right-wing Conservative Party gained ground Wednesday against the ruling  National Party in a parliamentary by-election, indicating that the number of  whites worried about apartheid reform continues to swell.  </P> <P> The election in Randburg, a suburb northwest of Johannesburg, was seen by both  parties as an important test of white support for President Frederik W. de  Klerk's reform initiatives.  </P> <P> As expected, the National Party candidate, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, easily won  the election, 10,882 votes to 1,969. Nevertheless, the pro-apartheid  Conservative vote in this traditionally liberal district was sharply higher  than its 755 total in last year's election.  </P> <P> Although that was considerably short of the 4,000 votes that some Conservatives  had predicted, party leaders said it nevertheless reflects growing  dissatisfaction with the rapid pace of reform.  </P> <P> De Klerk needs to maintain white support for his initiatives as he opens formal  negotiations with black and white leaders to draw up a new constitution. The  president has promised to present any new constitution to white voters for  approval, and the Conservatives hope to muster enough votes to defeat such a  move.  </P> <P> The Conservatives, who maintain that De Klerk is selling out whites to eventual  black majority rule, currently hold 40 seats in the 166-seat white chamber of  Parliament. The National Party controls 93 seats and the anti-apartheid  Democratic Party 33.  </P> <P> Both Conservatives and Nationalists had gone all-out in the week before the  Randburg election, with both De Klerk and Conservative Party leader Andries  Treurnicht addressing town meetings.  </P> <P> The Randburg constituency had been held by Wynand Malan of the liberal  Democratic Party, who narrowly defeated the National Party candidate last year.  Malan recently resigned and said he would vote for the National Party  candidate.  </P> <P> The Conservatives never expected to win the election in a district that one  party official described as "leftist." But party leaders hoped that a strong  showing would prove that their support is growing, even in liberal areas.  </P> <P> Leonie Steele, the Conservative candidate, campaigned on the theme of swart  gevaar, or "black danger." A typical Conservative poster read: "FW's New South  Africa -- Squatters, Economic Collapse, Bloodbath."  </P> <P> "The (African National Congress) already is starting to take over with their  terrorism in the black townships," said Daan Combrink, a retired oil refinery  production manager and Conservative campaign worker. "It won't be long before  it starts in white towns."  </P> <P> Van Schalkwyk, the National Party candidate, relied on De Klerk's coattails,  urging voters from his party as well as the Democratic Party to vote for him to  show their support for reform.  </P></p>

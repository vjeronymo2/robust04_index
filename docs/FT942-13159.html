			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses moderately inspired by strong US start Bourses were only moderately inspired by a strong start on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. Milan was closed for a holiday. FRANKFURT eased on the session and rose with the Dow in the afternoon, the Dax index falling 11.70 to 2,202.22 and recovering to an Ibis-indicated 2,208.68. The day was marked by disaffection with front-line cyclicals - chemicals, although they would normally be bought at this time of the year, and carmakers, and some engineers and steels - as analysts said that there were some less exaggerated valuations elsewhere in the cyclical category. Turnover dropped from DM11.6bn to DM7.7bn. BASF and Bayer led chemicals down with session falls of DM3.80 to DM314 and DM4.10 to DM385.10; Mr Glen Liddy of Kleinwort Benson said that German institutions, which tend to buy the stocks for their dividends, were holding off. In the automotive sector Continental, the tyremaker, dropped DM5.50 to DM282.50 and Volkswagen DM17.50 to DM531 after a magazine article said that VW might be forced to impose large-scale lay-offs next year. Siemens, representing the quieter cyclicals, virtually held its ground at DM734, down 80 pfg. Mr Liddy thought that its first half results were 'very encouraging', and the shares rose after hours by DM3.50 to DM737.50. PARIS found it impossible to sustain Friday's 2 per cent gain, and the first day of the May trading account saw the CAC 40 index 18.88 lower at 2116.29. Dealers said that falls in bonds left equity investors worried about high yields at the long end of the fixed interest market. Turnover was low at FFr2.3bn. Eurostocks offered a contrast: Eurotunnel, in a mirror image of the market, rose 55 centimes to FFr40.75 in a technical recovery after a sharp fall on Friday; Euro Disney, however, dropped FFr1.70, or 5 per cent to FFr32.20 as traders created short positions to open the new account. ZURICH bounced back from early lows after Wall Street opened. The SMI index, under pressure during the morning from weak bond futures, finished down 24.4 at 2,763.5 after a low of 2,738.5. Nestle fell SFr13 to SFr1,211 in heavy trade ahead of tomorrow's annual news conference. Roche certificates gave up another SFr50 to SFr6,800 but Ciba registered, trading ex-dividend, added a net SFr2 to SFr866. Miss Janet Dyson at Hoare Govett commented that Ciba's growth in the next three years was expected to derive principally from the industrial division  -although restructuring should prevent a significant downturn in healthcare and agriculture - in spite of difficult market conditions. Banks were under pressure, with CS Holding SFr13 lower at SFr593 ahead of Friday's annual news conference. Ascom was steady at SFr1,300 in low volume after the troubled telecommunications company reported a 1993 loss at the top end of expectations, but said that it expected to break even this year and return to profit in 1995. STOCKHOLM was unimpressed by the supplementary budget and instead turned its attention to corporate news and forthcoming results. The Affarsvarlden index rose 1.5 to 1,463.4. Mr Allen Owie at Unibank commented that budget reduction measures had fallen far short of expectations, suggesting that the forthcoming election in September may have constrained the government's room for manoeuvre. Volvo B rose SKr14 to an all time high of SKr712 on news that the carmaker had sold its 43.8 shareholding in Cardo to Incentive, which then launched a bid for the rest of the investment company. Incentive fell SKr3 to SFr302 amid worries that it was paying too much while Cardo shot up SKr98 to SKr498, just under the SKr500 bid level. Gambro B, majority owned by Cardo, rose SKr12 to SKr361, after news of the bid. Handelsbanken B added SKr4 to SKr113 in response to positive 3 months earnings figures. AMSTERDAM failed to recover from early falls, caused by a sharp drop in bond prices, and the AEX index finished 4.15 lower at 414.96 lower in quiet trading. Akzo Nobel fell Fl 2.50 to Fl 220.50 ahead of first quarter results today. MADRID, volatile this year, was consciously staid as it waited out the day of the Banesto auction, the result of which was due after hours. The general index rose a mere 0.03 to 318.99 in turnover of Pta21bn. Banesto fell Pta23 to Pta755 after a broker said it was worth Pta500 a share, and BBV and Santander, thought to be the most likely contenders, fell Pta5 to Pta3,200 and Pta10 to Pta6,150. WARSAW rose for the fourth consecutive session, the WIG index closing 458.6, or 3.5 per cent higher at 13,557.6, but brokers said that there was also increased selling, offering the prospect of strong profit-taking in the days to come. ISTANBUL dropped 5.5 per cent as sellers stepped in after early buying, the composite index ending 1,022.43 down at 17,450.83, after 19,212.39 in the first half of the session.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 25                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1451.69     1450.32     1449.85    1446.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1469.92     1468.79     1469.28    1465.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1444.14     1446.04     1447.46    1449.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1464.22     1463.33     1466.35    1467.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Apr 22    Apr 21    Apr 20    Apr 19    Apr 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1456.24   1436.73   1444.73   1448.50   1470.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1476.62   1458.95   1465.17   1470.66   1492.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90);  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1452.55; 200 - 1470.38 Low/day: 100 - 1443.68  200 - 1463.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and Michael Morgan</p>

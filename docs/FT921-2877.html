			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Questions over coalition refuse to go away - The issue that will dominate Liberal Democratic thinking in the next three weeks MR Paddy Ashdown wanted to talk about policies. As usual the journalists at the launch of the Liberal Democrats' manifesto preferred to explore his party's conditions for participation in a coalition government. The Liberal Democrat leader has responded to the same questions about a hung parliament perhaps a thousand times during the phoney war leading up to the election campaign. But neither the questions nor the dilemma are likely to go away before April 9. His aim is to demonstrate that his party is more than a spanner that they might choose to throw in the Conservative or Labour works: that the political force rescued from the wreckage of the old SDP-Liberal Alliance has a distinctive message. So Mr Ashdown dwelt at length on his manifesto's blend of Conservative free-market economics (the breaking up of private monopolies, introduction of private services on British Rail) and Labour's belief in public investment (more taxpayers' money for education and housing). It was not an attempt to look both ways at once, he insisted. Rather a recipe that had brought proven success for Britain's continental European competitors The price of being the third party in a two-party system is a media focus on the 'What if' question that will dominate the election campaign as long as neither Labour nor the Conservatives look like securing an overall majority. Mr John Major apparently had cleared up some of the confusion in Torquay at the weekend when he ridiculed the terms for coalition which Mr Ashdown has outlined in recent weeks. The prime minister scorned the commitment to a proportional voting system which Mr Ashdown set as the precondition for his party's support; and Mr Major rejected the creation of a Scottish assembly which the Liberal Democrats have said must be included in an agreed four-year legislative programme. Incidentally, Mr Ashdown indicated that other policies in his manifesto would be negotiable in descending order of importance. He presumably would not force a minority government to put 1p on the basic rate of income tax, but would demand more spending on education. He could not admit the obvious implication of Mr Major's stance: that the only leader he could keep in office after an inconclusive election would be Mr Neil Kinnock. He said yesterday that the reality of defeat might easily persuade Mr Major to change his mind. It is not a judgment shared privately by colleagues in the 22-strong contingent of Liberal Democrats at Westminster. They believe that Mr Major could not do a deal. Even if he could, it would be a mistake for Mr Ashdown to sustain a minority Conservative prime minister. Their wider, albeit unstated, judgment runs like this: the party is doing well in the opin- ion polls and will probably do better than that on April 9; but there is no prospect of the decisive breakthrough - to about 30 per cent of the votes - needed to lift its representation significantly at Westminster. In those circumstances, an inconclusive result on April 9 would hold as many risks as opportunities. Mr Ashdown has no choice during the campaign but to stick rigidly to his principal conditions for coalition. He will have to judge after the election if it would really be in his party's interests to vote down a minority Labour government that offered a package which fell just short of proportional representation for Westminster. Some of his Scottish colleagues might be more than reluctant to vote down a Queen's Speech which offered an Edinburgh assembly elected proportionately. In the meantime, Mr Ashdown has another three weeks of answering the same question.</p>

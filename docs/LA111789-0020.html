			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING OUR BACK YARD ON FAST-FORWARD TO PEACE;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: TELL GORBACHEV TO DIG INTO HIS BAG OF TRICKS AND FORCE HIS  ALLIES IN OUR HEMISPHERE TO YIELD TO THE NEW REALITIES OF THE '90S.  </P> <P> We are trapped in a miracle of the satellite TV age. The world is changing so  rapidly that history seems to be on fast-forward one minute and rewind the  next.  </P> <P> Fast-forward: Live and in color, we're watching communism evolve itself out of  existence in Eastern Europe. The Soviet satellites are changing faster than we  can change channels.  </P> <P> We're seeing hundreds of thousands of people who lived under communism for two  generations fleeing to places where they can work and speak and save and spend  in freedom. And we're seeing their iron-fisted rulers benignly step aside,  admitting the failure of communism's catechism and cause.  </P> <P> Rewind: A newscaster insists it's San Salvador today, but the picture on our  screen looks more like Tet in the streets of Saigon -- or is it Havana or  Managua? No matter, it's Communist-backed rebels killing hundreds of innocents,  one more time, as they try to force on yet another country the system we just  saw their Marxist bankrollers admitting has failed and fallen two continents  and one ocean away.  </P> <P> There's no logic to the order of things. It's as if the past can't wait for the  future to catch up.  </P> <P> We're watching and our President is watching, and none of us seem to have much  influence over those pictures on the screen. So rapidly is history shifting  between fast-forward and rewind that we've begun to understand at least this:  Remote control doesn't work.  </P> <P> Changes generated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have swept not just  his nation but our world. In China, the people rose up and were gunned down. In  Eastern Europe, the people rose up and gained new freedoms.  </P> <P> In the Americas, Gorbachev's disciples look to the future and see only the  past. Nicaragua's nervous Marxist Daniel Ortega scrapped a truce and went for  his guns, flinching out of fear that his countrymen would soon draw their  ballots. El Salvador's leftist rebels, in their own desperation, figure it  doesn't matter if they win people's hearts and minds, or merely pierce them  with bullets.  </P> <P> The past that today's Central American communists see as their future is Fidel  Castro, who came to power under Nikita Khrushchev, became a global crusader  under Leonid Brezhnev and outlived Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.  Castro has given them their weapons -- he's even given Ortega a wardrobe of  hand-me-downs.  </P> <P> But suddenly, Cuba's master of tirade seems to have acute laryngitis; his  silence coincides with those satellite pictures from Europe and Moscow that put  the lie to his decades of words.  </P> <P> There is something that George Bush can do. He can borrow a page from the  diplomatic playbook of Henry Kissinger and take it to the summit-at-sea.  </P> <P> It's time for "linkage." It's time for Bush to stop looking so painfully  repressed as he reacts to the good news from the East. It's time for him to let  Gorbachev know in firm, unmistakable words that there is much the United States  can do to help the Soviets repair their shattered economy -- and that we would  like to continue the Bush policy of not seeking to embarrass the Soviets in  their own back yard.  </P> <P> But the Soviets need to undo the mess they've made of our back yard as well.  Say it and mean it: We can't cooperate to the fullest as long as military aid  is being funneled from the Soviet Union and Cuba to Nicaragua and the rebels in  El Salvador.  </P> <P> In Jackson Hole, Wyo., Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed this at  some length with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. The Soviets  clucked sympathetically, proclaimed their willingness to comply, but maintained  that they were limited in what they could do to stop Castro from shipping  military aid to Ortega et al.  </P> <P> That's not good enough. It's time to tell Gorbachev that he's got to dig down  into his bag of geopolitricks and come up with the right stuff -- carrots or  sticks -- that will force Fidel to yield to the new realities of the '90s.  </P> <P> The Soviets need Western technical assistance for their economy, and their need  for defense cuts is even more urgent than ours. Eastern Europe needs a new  Marshall Plan.  </P> <P> Our price must be a hemisphere at peace, here in the West. And while the rest  of us can only sit and watch satellite pictures on our TV screens, it's time  for George Bush to speak up.  </P></p>

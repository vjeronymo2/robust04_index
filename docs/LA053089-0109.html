			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 10 AMERICANS HURT IN KOREAN ATTACK ON BASE  </P> <P> Villagers demanding that a U.S. Air Force bombing range be closed scaled fences  and stormed the range, injuring 10 airmen, military officials said today.  </P> <P> About 100 farmers and villagers attacked the Kooni range about 70 miles  southwest of Seoul on Monday night, said Sgt. Will Baker, an Air Force  spokesman.  </P> <P> The protesters assaulted military guards with clubs and rocks, slightly  injuring the airmen, he said. A Korean civilian worker was also beaten.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retreat to Dormitory  </P> <P> Baker said Air Force personnel retreated to a dormitory after one attacker  pulled out a knife. The villagers then hurled rocks through windows, he said.  </P> <P> The protesters also damaged 22 military vehicles and looted and ransacked  administrative buildings.  </P> <P> About 450 South Korean riot police arrived about two hours after the attack  began and drove the protesters out. Twenty villagers were arrested, police  said.  </P> <P> The attack came after villagers were stopped for safety reasons from working in  fields on the edge of the range during a bombing practice, officials said.  Farmers are allowed to use government land around the range.  </P></p>

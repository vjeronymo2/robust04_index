			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESOP SOPS UP TAXES TO LITTLE EFFECT  </P> <P> There's something intuitively appealing about ESOPs -- employee stock ownership  plans. They're a sort of workers' capitalism. The idea is that workers become  shareholders in their own company. They're then more committed to its success.  Conflicts between workers and managers fade. Cooperation flourishes. The  company becomes more productive and profitable. Workers get rich. Society  prospers.  </P> <P> The trouble is that ESOPs don't actually operate this way. Perhaps 200 major  companies have adopted them in the past year. Procter &amp; Gamble is among the  latest. But don't expect a surge of worker involvement or improved corporate  efficiency. The infatuation with ESOPs is strictly expedient. They provide  generous corporate tax savings and offer top executives a new defense against  hostile takeovers.  </P> <P> Suppose you're one of Procter &amp; Gamble's 77,000 workers. The company will  contribute $1 billion in stock to its own ESOP. The stock will be allocated to  workers' individual ESOP accounts over 15 years. That's an average of almost  $900 per employee a year. Do you come to work earlier? Go home later? Suppose  you detest your supervisor. Do the two of you now turn into fast friends?  </P> <P> "People aren't (experimental) rats," says Joseph Blasi, author of "Employee  Ownership, Revolution or Rip-off?" and a management professor at Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo. "They do not respond automatically to modest financial  incentives." Studies of ESOPs confirm this conclusion. The plans' rewards are  too small and too distant to change how workers work. Most know that  individually they can't raise their firm's profits or stock price.  Profitability and productivity improve only if the ESOPs are part of a broader  program to engage workers and involve them in everyday decisions.  </P> <P> Nor do the plans give workers something for nothing. An ESOP is a fringe  benefit. Companies can typically spend only so much for salaries and fringes.  Spending more on one benefit means spending less on something else, as  economist Michael Conte of the University of New Orleans points out. Sometimes  the shift is invisible. But many companies have explicitly cut other benefits  when creating ESOPs.  </P> <P> The Treasury estimates that ESOPs will cost the federal government more than $3  billion in lost revenues over the next five years. This estimate -- made before  the recent ESOP boom -- may prove far too low. To promote ESOPs, Congress has  granted them many tax breaks. A company creating an ESOP usually borrows (say,  from a bank) to buy its own common stock or to finance an issue of new stock.  The stock goes into the ESOP, triggering these tax benefits:  </P> <P>  -- The company can deduct both interest and repayment of the loan's principal  from taxable income. Normally, only interest is deductible.  </P> <P>  -- The lender (in this case, the bank) doesn't have to pay taxes on half the  interest income from ESOP loans. Some of the tax savings are passed onto the  borrower. Consequently, ESOP loans have interest rates 1 to 1.5 percentage  points lower than normal business loans.  </P> <P>  -- The company creating the ESOP generally gets a deduction for stock  dividends paid to the plan. Dividends aren't usually tax deductible.  </P> <P> But these tax breaks didn't start corporate America's ESOP stampede. What did  was the demonstration -- by Polaroid -- that ESOPs could be used as a takeover  defense. Creating an ESOP places a big block of stock in friendly hands.  Employees are less likely to sell their shares, because they fear new owners  might fire workers. An ESOP can act as a powerful takeover deterrent in states  with tough anti-takeover laws.  </P> <P> Consider Delaware, where about half of all major U.S. companies are chartered.  The Delaware anti-takeover law requires a hostile buyer to get 85% of a  company's stock before being able to exercise effective control. Thus, many new  ESOPs tie up about 15% of a firm's stock.  </P> <P> There have been ESOP successes. In 1984, Weirton Steel Corp. in West Virginia  was spared bankruptcy through an ESOP. But the workers also took a 20% pay cut,  and the real spur to better cooperation was the threat to jobs. A few stirring  stories don't justify a huge tax break.  </P> <P> The ESOP was once touted as a way to transfer corporate wealth to workers. But  the rise of pension funds has already accomplished significant redistribution.  In 1950, pensions owned stocks equal to less than 1% of the stocks owned  directly by households. In 1988, pensions owned $758 billion of stock, equal to  one-third of household stock wealth. ESOPs contributed almost nothing to this  process.  </P> <P> ESOPs are a growing waste of taxpayer money. They may foster corporate  inefficiency by sheltering mediocre managements. Getting workers and managers  to cooperate is important, but tax breaks for ESOPs can't achieve that.  Employee stock ownership and profit-sharing can succeed as a part of a wider  corporate commitment to a collaborative style of management. That's a  commitment that companies and workers must make themselves. It can't be imposed  from Washington.  </P></p>

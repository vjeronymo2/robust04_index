			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield doubled to Pounds 2.7m BURNFIELD, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced 1992 profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.7m against Pounds 1.2m and a small acquisition. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations. The results, compiled under new accounting rules, showed that Malvern Instruments, acquired in mid-1992, contributed Pounds 1.6m to operating profits which totalled Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.3m). Group turnover rose from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 29.8m, with Malvern contributing Pounds 7.5m. The interest charge was Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 146,000). Earnings per share were 6.5p (4.8p) and a final dividend of 4.1p is proposed to give an unchanged total of 5.75p. Profits also benefited from a full-year contribution from Budenburg, the pressure guages and calibration equipment manufacturer acquired in 1991. It made operating profits of Pounds 2.3m, against Pounds 1.1m in the 7 months it was owned in 1991. Sales at Budenburg had fallen by up to 40 per cent for two to three weeks following Black Wednesday but had now recovered. Analysts said customers had deferred orders because of lack of confidence in the short term. Analysts said there were still worries about the continuing contraction in demand at Isopad, the electric surface heating product manufacturer, which does about half its business in Germany. Isopad made an operating loss of Pounds 1.1m compared to a Pounds 183,000 profit in 1991. Burnfield also announced the acquisition of Desranges et Huot, a French manufacturer of pressure calibration equipment, for FFr24m (Pounds 3m). Mr Ben Thefaut, small business analyst at Albert E Sharp, revised upwards his estimate for this year to Pounds 4.8m, giving earnings per share of 9.1p.</p>

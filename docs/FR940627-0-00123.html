			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Requirements for Emission Control System Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 211(b)(2) requires F/FA manufacturers to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to determine their products' effects on ECS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. The NPRM stated that EPA intended to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing ECS performance through the existing waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application program under CAA section 211(f). The waiver program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevents the introduction into commerce of F/FAs which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly degrade the performance of emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Under CAA section 211(f), F/FA formulations which do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not meet specific chemical and physical criteria considered to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantially similar'' to EPA certification fuel (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretive rule in 56 FR 5352), cannot be introduced into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce unless a waiver is issued by EPA. The waiver process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then requires the applicant to demonstrate, through testing if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, that ``such fuel or fuel additive or a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel additive or a specified concentration thereof, will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the emission standards to which it has been certified.'' For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products already registered that do not meet ``substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar'' criteria, i.e., grandfathered products that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered prior to the implementation of the waiver application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, EPA proposed to establish a mechanism that would permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public to submit petitions to EPA requesting ECS testing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a particular fuel or fuel additive of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule reflects EPA's judgment that the mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already established under CAA section 211(f) are adequate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ECS testing of F/FAs. EPA's previous experience with the waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application process has demonstrated the practical value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantially similar'' concept for determining whether a F/FA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product needs to be tested for its effects on emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. EPA is not aware of instances in which products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting ``substantially similar'' criteria were later discovered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have adverse effects on vehicular emission control performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of another ECS testing program under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b) would be duplicative and, therefore, inconsistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' intent. Thus, as proposed, today's rule refers to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver application process under CAA section 211(f) <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ECS testing of ``substantially similar'' F/FAs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4). Products which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform to applicable ``substantially similar'' criteria are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to undergo ECS testing before they can be registered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs which do not meet ``substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar'' criteria are subject to the standard 211(f) application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process prior to registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An example of a waiver decision can be found in 53 FR 33846. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that there are grandfathered F/FA products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Section III.A above) which fall outside the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domain of CAA section 211(f). These grandfathered products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include gasoline aftermarket additives introduced prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 CAA Amendments. Therefore, statutory authority for the ECS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation and regulatory control of grandfathered products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists under CAA sections 211 (b) and (c) rather than section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(f). EPA judges that requiring ECS evaluation of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grandfathered products, without evidence of ECS problems, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unreasonable and unnecessarily burdensome on the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, today's rule provides a petition mechanism for the ECS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of grandfathered products. Under this mechanism, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could require ECS testing of grandfathered products, similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing which a waiver applicant would generally conduct, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so petitioned by outside parties or if other information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the Agency indicates that such evaluation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Such information might be obtained as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission characterization requirements included in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. In addition, vehicle manufacturers or other outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties are allowed to submit petitions to EPA requesting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of grandfathered products based on evidence of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm to vehicular ECS. If EPA judges that ECS testing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted after reviewing the petition arguments, emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization results and/or other available information, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority provided by CAA sections 211(b) and 211(c) to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific grandfathered products to test for ECS effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Grouping System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Objectives and Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 211(e) provides a number of mechanisms by which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may reduce the costs and burdens of compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration requirements set forth in CAA section 211(b). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, CAA section 211(e)(3)(B) permits the Administrator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``provide for cost-sharing with respect to the testing of any fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or fuel additive which is manufactured or processed by two or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more persons, or otherwise provide for shared responsibility'' so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the program requirements can be met without duplication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort. In accordance with this provision, today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintains the grouping system proposed in the NPRM, which permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The groups defined by the specifications in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule are the only groups permitted for satisfying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the registration program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

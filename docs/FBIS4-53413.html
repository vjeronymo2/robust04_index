			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Feelings of respect and  reverence for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are growing  deeper among South Korean pressmen and students with every  passing day.    A journalist in Inchon surnamed Yi, giving his view of the  question of the future of the nation and its leader some time  ago, told his colleagues:    "The dignity of a nation is in direct proportion to the  greatness of its leader.    "Any nation can exalt its dignity and honour and prosper  forever only when it has the heir to its leader in the person of  a distinguished great man who had the steadfast idea of national  independence and serve-the-people spirit, rare passion, fighting  spirit and faith.    "This is a philosophy proven by historical facts.    "The independent position and dignity of our nation are  rising steadily among the international community today because  it has acclaimed Mr. Kim Chong-il, the greatest thinker and  theoretician of the present times, with outstanding leadership  ability, noble virtues and great attraction, as the heir to  President Kim Il-song."    Hearing his words with deep emotions, his colleagues  unanimously evinced their determination to staunchly fight under  the guidance of the dear leader.    A journalist Sin with a newspaper office in Seoul highly  praised the outstanding intelligence of Comrade Kim Chong-il.    He told his fellow journalists:    "The dear leader Kim Chong-il equipped with both literary  and  military accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander  with an unshakable faith and a distinguished great statesman of  sound judgement and with outstanding leadership ability.    "He is an outstanding leader of the international socialist  movement who is meeting the challenge of the imperialist allied  forces with his matchless grit and iron will and guiding the  movement for rebuilding socialism, standing at the centre of  world politics."    A postgraduate of Seoul National University surnamed Kim,  chatting with his fellows about the reality of the northern half  of the country some time ago, said:    "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is the great of great born  with  the gifts of a sage such as clairvoyance, matchless grit and  extraordinary personality.    "He is a great statesman with both literary and military  accomplishments and outstanding leadership ability, and the most  famous general in the world.    "I am sure that the world will turn in the future into an  anthropocentric socialist world true to the intentions of the  dear leader Kim Chong-il, into such a world where the people  enjoy all happiness and comfort."    The fellow students expressed sympathy with him, highly  praising Mr. Kim Chong-il as the leader guiding the new  independent world, as a leader of the world whom the world  people look up to and follow.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Sell-offs with one hand tied: Andrew Baxter unravels the tangled web of a split receivership At 8pm on April 13, an offer for the UK operations of Lancer Boss was faxed to Grant Thornton, the firm of accountants that five days earlier had been appointed receivers for the Bedfordshire-based lift-truck maker. Simultaneously, an offer from the same big UK-based suitor was faxed to Mr Werner Folger, the German lawyer handling the receivership of Steinbock Boss, Lancer's German subsidiary. 'The offer was for the whole group,' said Mr Allan Griffiths, Grant Thornton partner and joint administrative receiver with his colleague Mr Scott Barnes for Lancer Boss in the UK. He added: 'We sent a fax to our German counterpart that night, and said we had to sit down and discuss the offer.' The following day Mr Peter Flesher, another Grant Thornton partner, was despatched to Munich to meet Mr Folger. At Munich airport he phoned Mr Folger's office to check on the time for his meeting, but was told that the lawyer was out and could not be contacted. That morning, Steinbock Boss had been sold to Jungheinrich, the big Hamburg-based lift-truck producer. The saga was one of a number of events that turned the Lancer Boss receivership into one of the most extraordinary in recent years, culminating yesterday with the announcement that Jungheinrich had acquired from Grant Thornton the Lancer Boss Group and associated companies in Great Britain, Ireland and Austria. As soon as the collapse of Lancer Boss was announced, it was clear that this would be no normal receivership. The decision by German banks to withdraw support from Steinbock Boss led to the German lawyer being called in. This prompted the receivership in the UK. Mr Griffiths was left in the unusual situation for a UK receiver of lacking full control of the company he was trying to sell. He believed the group would be worth more if the German and UK parts could be sold together. But Mr Folger and the German banks who appointed him had other ideas. They wanted Steinbock sold as quickly as possible to Jungheinrich, partly to reduce their own losses but also to ensure that Steinbock's future was clear before the Hanover Fair - Germany's leading exhibition of industrial equipment - later in April. Mr Griffiths does not hide his irritation that Mr Folger sold Steinbock as fast as possible, in effect preventing other purchasers from buying the UK and German operations. The UK receivers also became highly critical of the disparity between different national insolvency laws - the main issue raised by the whole saga. 'My argument is not with Jungheinrich, but with the system that allowed this to happen,' Mr Griffiths said yesterday. 'You cannot sell a business with Pounds 70m of turnover in three or four days.' The receiver has warned that a split receivership could reoccur, especially with medium-size UK companies whose European operations were financed locally. He plans to send a report to the Department of Trade and Industry on the lessons learnt. Once Jungheinrich had bought Steinbock and Mr Griffiths had clinched the vital trading relationship between Lancer Boss and its former German unit, the sale of Lancer Boss could proceed more like a regular UK receivership, with potential bidders examining the company, the drawing up of a shortlist and the announcement of a buyer. Jungheinrich was in a powerful position after buying Steinbock Boss, and any other buyer knew it would have to sort out a relationship with the German company or risk losing 50 per cent of its business. In the past few days Mr Griffiths and his team deployed a variety of arguments to push up 'very significantly' the price the German company was prepared to pay. 'We argued that it was worth paying more to keep Lancer Boss out of a competitor's hands,' Mr Griffiths said. It was 'useful', he admitted, that there were three bids in the final negotiations.</p>

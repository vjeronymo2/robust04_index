			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: Lonrho's loss Terry Robinson's move into the chief executive's seat at Union International should be welcome news for the bankers to the Vestey empire. But what will the shareholders in his old employer, Lonrho, make of it? Lonrho is very much the creation of its founder Tiny Rowland and it is hard for an outsider to judge the relative importance of the rest of the top management team. The 47-year-old Robinson was only one of four chartered accountants on the board and although Robinson was a well-known Lonrho hand, he was not the finance director. This job is shared by Philip Tarsh, chairman of the finance committee, and Robin Whitten, the treasurer. Paul Spicer, one of two new deputy chairmen, says that Lonrho's top management has always worked as a team, and Robinson's responsibilities will be 'very easily absorbed' by the existing management. Talk of Robinson being Tiny's heir-apparent was ridiculous. The size of Robinson's share options - second only to Rowland's - suggests he was a very important person at Lonrho. His detailed critique of Alan Bond's empire helped bring down the Australian tycoon, and many regarded the unprepossessing northerner as the acceptable face of Lonrho. Whatever Lonrho says, he will be sorely missed.</p>

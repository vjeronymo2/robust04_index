			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Unions review party funding STATE FUNDING for political parties, promised in Labour's manifesto, would loosen but not sever the ties between the party and the trade unions that finance it, according to Labour and union officials. The ties are under review, with both sides agreed that a more distant relationship is in their mutual interest. State funding would be a financial relief for the Labour-affiliated unions, which at present finance about half Labour's running costs between elections and nearly all election spending. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, believes his proposal for scaling down the union block vote at Labour conference from 90 per cent to 50 per cent is likely to be accepted more quickly, probably within the next three years, as a result of the prospect of state funding. Labour officials argue that the 'political ballast' provided by the unions at party conference, and in the electoral college that elects the party leader, will continue to be required to counterbalance the unreliable constituency parties. One Labour official said: 'The relationship has always been about a lot more than money, and our political links will stay for the medium term.' The unions will increasingly shift their influence to constituency parties, where they will hope to encourage more of their members to join the Labour party. State funding would allow the unions to continue the trend of concentrating a higher proportion of their spending on elections alone. State funding might face considerable political and popular opposition, but it is supported by the Liberal Democrats. The main Labour-affiliated unions have to ballot their members in 1994 on whether their political funds should be retained. Last time the unions won those ballots with ease, partly based on the argument that without union political funds the opposition would be starved of cash.</p>

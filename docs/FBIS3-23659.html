			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Military Sciences Colonel Antoliy </F> Zakharenko under the rubric "Military Training": "We Want a  Mobile Defense, But We Are Planning a Static One...--How  Can This Contradiction Be Resolved?"]    [Text] The journal has published materials before on  the organization and waging of mobile surface-to-air missile  defense (ZRO). In this article Colonel A. Zakharenko touches on  one of its most important problems--the commander's plan to wage  mobile ZRO, and the devising of a plan for combat operations  that would correspond to that type of defense.    The idea of organizing and conducting the mobile  surface-to-air missile defense (ZRO) of fixed targets of the  military and economic potential of Russia and its armed forces  has been gaining more and more popularity among military  scholars and practitioners among the surface-to-air missile  forces [ZRV] with time. The experience of local wars and  military conflicts has served as the foundation for this idea.  The conceptual framework for mobile ZRO, in its most general  form, consists of the following:    Mobile ZRO is created on the basis of the mobile forces and  assets of the ZRV and is waged with the widespread employment of  maneuver by them, both before the start (in immediate  preparations) and in the course of combat operations. The mobile  ZRDNs [SAM battalions] are maintained in peacetime in a  non-deployed state in parking areas near military compounds  built close to the targets or non-mobile (fixed) ZRV sites being  defended. The battalions are deployed to training positions that  are selected in the immediate proximity of the military  compounds to rehearse combat training tasks. A limited number of  ZRDNs of a larger ZRV unit, deployed at specially equipped duty  positions, are on combat alert status.    The ZRDNs, in accordance with the plans for combat  operations, are brought up during periods of threat to their  primary battle positions, from which the repulsion of the first  enemy air strikes is planned. The execution of maneuvers by the  ZRDNs within their deployment areas to alternate battle  positions, according to previously determined variations, is  expected later in order to provide for the survivability of the  unit or, according to the situation, to restore destroyed SAM  missile systems, as well as to perform new tasks that arise.  This concept has been codified in the guidelines with the coming  of highly mobile SAM systems into service with the ZRV; in  practice, however, the troops, as well as the tactical theory of  the ZRV, still have a host of problems that make its complete  realization more difficult. One of those problems, in my  opinion, is the development and adoption of the plan for waging  mobile ZRO by the unit commander and the preparation of the  combat documents.    The general plan of the unit commander and the plan for  combat operations are currently worked out in detail for the  primary combat positions. The scenario formulates, in  particular, variations for the maneuvers of the ZRDN and the  conditions for performing them, which are reflected on the map  of the unit commander's plan in the form of tables that indicate  the time of the maneuver to the first (for the first variation)  and the second (for the second variation) alternate positions,  as well as in the form of a graphical card for the frequency of  coverage of the ZRDN envelopes for the maneuver variations. It  follows from this that a variation of a maneuver assumes a shift  of battle positions by all ZRDNs. But can we be sure that the  enemy will give us such an opportunity -- to realize a selected  variation of maneuver completely?    Priority in the selection of a variation and the moment of a  strike belongs to the airborne enemy. We will thus not be able  to maneuver all ZRDNs into their alternate positions  simultaneously. The duration of the period of threat and the  time intervals between strikes in the course of combat  operations are also determined by the airborne enemy. There thus  may not be enough time for the sequential and orderly  maneuvering of ZRDNs to alternate positions.    Having deployed the units in battle formation in their  primary areas during a period of threat, on the other hand, we  should maneuver the ZRDNs within their deployment areas  according to a previously worked-out schedule at least within a  day (the concrete time is determined by the capabilities of  enemy reconnaissance in the sector where combat operations are  being conducted). And that means the repulsion of the first  strikes by an airborne enemy will be repelled by a ZRDN not from  the primary positions, for which a plan of operations has been  developed in detail and the combat missions have been assigned  to the subunits, but rather from the alternate positions. And  that is just where the actions of the subunits have been defined  very vaguely.    A plan for the combat operations of a unit developed today  based on a commander's plan for combat operations oriented  toward waging a "positional" (from fixed positions) defense thus  does not fully conform to the principles of mobile ZRO.    What can be proposed to overcome this contradiction?    The following approach to preparing and conducting mobile  ZRO  has been tried out in KShU [command/staff exercises] by those  studying in the ZRV faculty, as well as in the ZRV units headed  by officers M. Perfilov, L. Rusenchik and P. Krikun.    Proceeding from a combat task that has been received and an  assessment of the situation, the required values of  surface-to-air missile fire are determined that correspond to  the necessary correlation of forces with an airborne enemy --  the size of the area of air-defense missile fire, its density at  the assigned lines, the number of firings and their  effectiveness, and the frequency of target or area coverage.    A system of air-defense missile fire, as is well known, is  created via the deployment of units in battle formation. The  basic parameters of the battle formation -- the standard  distances of the ZRDN from the target being defended  ([.sup]sp[/]) and the intervals between their positions  (J[.sup]sp[/]), as well as the distances between deployment  lines of ZRDNs of various echelons when their deployment in  echelons is necessary -- are thus calculated on the basis of the  required indicators of the firing system that have been  received. These parameters are used to determine the dimensions  of the ZRDN deployment areas in the assigned deployment area of  the large formation or unit.    A system of battle positions is selected in the deployment  areas of the ZRDNs that allows the fullest possible realization  of the capabilities of the ZRDNs to defeat enemy SVN [offensive  air weapons] at very low altitudes and maneuvering routes. The  quantity of battle positions is not limited on a tactical plane  therein -- the more the better (including on the maneuvering  routes, within the limits of their capabilities). The rejection  of the existing division of positions into battle, training and  alert, and battle positions into primary and alternate, seems  expedient. All of the battle positions are considered equivalent  and, to the extent of capabilities (when they are accessible),  are assimilated by the battalions during peacetime in the  practicing of combat-training missions and in the course of  alert duty. The apprehension expressed by some specialists that  this will allow the enemy to uncover the system of positions, in  my opinion, does not conform to the intent of highly mobile ZRO.    So the system of battle positions has been determined. The  schedule of maneuver of the ZRDNs according to the ZRO plan is  then worked out. It should be optimized on the terms of  preserving the assigned (required) parameters of the firing  system at any moment in time, the minimum time and economic  expenditures for performing the maneuvers, and the limitations  of the systems of reconnaissance, command and control, and  technical and rear support. It can also be tied to deceptive  measures to confuse the enemy, and with the operations of  interacting and covering formations and units. A possible  variation of a schedule is shown in Fig. 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-012-14A>           Fig. 1. Schedule of the combat </FIG>          Recall that the necessary data regarding all of the  positions  should be entered into the local computer network--the  information and computational system (IRS)--of the ZRV unit  ahead of time. The IRS monitors the taking of battle positions  by the battalions during a period of threat and the performance  of maneuvers according to the ZRO plan, and issues  recommendations for the performance of maneuvers during the  course of combat operations based on the situation.    The cutbacks in the armed forces that are taking place  within  the framework of military reform and, as a consequence, the  necessity that is arising for the efficient performance of  combat tasks using limited personnel and assets is an argument  of no small importance in favor of this variation for organizing  and conducting mobile ZRO.    The angular dimensions of the deployment areas of the ZRDNs  (deployment sectors) calculated relative to the hypothetical  center of the target or area being defended may then be assigned  to battalions as their primary sectors (_a_[.sup]pr[/]) when  performing mobile operations by means of combat patrols within  the deployment area of an air-defense missile brigade (ZRBR).  The primary sectors of battalions (_b_[.sup]pr[/]) when  maneuvering ZRDNs using combat patrols within their deployment  areas are best designated according to the bisectors of the  neighboring deployment sector (so that no gaps appear in the  system of fire when performing missions by this or that ZRDN).  These sectors are best used for organization and interaction  with one's own fighters (Fig. 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-012-15A>           Fig. 2. Deployment areas and </FIG>          The assignment of the primary sectors (search and firing) of  the ZRDNs at low altitudes and alert duty sectors for group  search seems extremely difficult when organizing and conducting  mobile ZRO with an increased number of possible positions in the  deployment area of a ZRDN. This requires a great deal of time  for the performance of calculations and coordination, and means  that the mobility of the ZRO will be limited; they should  consequently be rejected.    The assignment of the combat mission to the mobile ZRDN  should thus include the boundaries of the deployment area, the  primary sector, the system of battle positions, and the schedule  and maneuvering signals. These data are reflected on the maps of  the unit commander's plan for combat operations and on the maps  of the ZRDN commanders.    This approach to the development and formulation of the  commanders' plans for waging mobile ZRO corresponds more to  reality than the one employed today among the troops that is  based on prevailing directive documents.    From the editors: Such are the views and  recommendations of a scholar for the organization and planning  of mobile ZRO. True, we do not share them completely. The  readers possibly also have other viewpoints and proposals. We  await your letters.    COPYRIGHT: "Vetsnik PVO" 1993</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: GrandMet finds preferred US route - Corporate issues Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, may have started a trend by issuing a new kind of undated security in the US fixed-rate preferred market early last week. GrandMet issued Dollars 500m of so-called 'preferred securities' on Tuesday, targeting US institutional and retail investors, with a coupon likely to be in the range of 9.25 and 9.325 per cent when the paper is priced this week. The structure of the security, jointly lead-managed by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, offers a tax advantage which makes it around 300 basis points cheaper than a direct issue of preferred shares. Indeed, the offer is only about 50 to 75 basis points more expensive than issuing equivalent debt, yet it gives GrandMet's management much greater flexibility than new borrowing in the debt markets, and the comfort of solid ratings (A2/A+) from the major US credit rating agencies. Mr Nick Rose, the company's corporate treasurer, says it provides an 'economic equivalent of a parent issue of preferred stock', will improve gearing and interest cover, and will lengthen the maturity profile of the group's debt. He also stresses that there are wider advantages to be gained from access to the US fixed-rate preferred market. 'Preferred stock is a retail product which mamas and papas will buy. This is a way to get GrandMet's name and brand across to a new class of investors. It can only be beneficial.' UK companies have been active players in both the variable-rate preferred stock market (which is priced off the short end of the yield curve) and, more recently, in the fixed-rate preferred stock market. However, bankers said the GrandMet deal could be a model for other UK companies seeking to raise capital in the US. 'The transaction opens up another means of tapping a very significant market which can have low-cost financing and other strategic benefits.' says Mr Bruce Macfarlane, a managing director with Merrill Lynch. The tax advantage of the preferred security is rooted in the creation of a so-called 'pass-through' subsidiary, located in the US state of Delaware for tax and legal reasons. The subsidiary issues the stock and then on-lends the proceeds back to the parent and to an operating subsidiary (in GrandMet's case based in the US). Interest payments on the loan are tax deductible. Goldman Sachs, which is also book-runner for the issue, claims the instrument, which it calls a UK preferred security, 'represents an attractive and important source of non-dilutive quasi-equity capital, which to date has been unavailable to UK corporations.' Preferred securities offer investors no voting or equity rights and can be issued in convertible form. Mr Calum Osborne, executive director, capital markets, at Goldman Sachs, explains that the new product builds on a range of initiatives in the US fixed interest preferred market over the last five years. These were originally triggered by changes in rules governing the capitalisation of banks, after the report of the Basle committee in 1989. The ruling of the Basle committee that certain types of perpetual shares could be counted as tier one capital - as essentially equivalent to equity - for solvency purposes, prompted a number of British banks to issue preferred stock. UK companies, including the banks, have issued almost Dollars 4.5bn worth since 1989. However, restrictions in local laws made it impractical for most European banks to issue preferred stock in either the US or in some cases in their own domestic markets, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. The solution was to develop so-called 'pass-through' subsidiaries located in offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg which could issue the preferred securities and then on-lend the proceeds to their parent. European - mainly French and Spanish - companies have issued more than Dollars 3.58bn in US perpetual preferred stock since September 1991. The tax advantages - stemming from the conversion treatments of the inter-company loan - were a by-product of these developments. Bankers such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have worked at ways of bringing these same advantages to a wider range of companies. One breakthrough came late last year when Goldman developed the idea of monthly income preferred securities or Mips, allowing domestic US companies a tax-efficient entry to the preferred market by establishing 'pass-through' vehicles in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where local corporation law was amended to accommodate the new structures last year, or more recently in Delaware. Since last October, US companies have issued Dollars 5.11bn in Mips, with utilities companies accounting for 70 per cent of all issues. The new structure announced last week builds on the Mip idea and gives GrandMet a better agency rating and greater certainty about tax treatment. The preferred security is also undated, unlike Mips which have a 30 to 50-year mandatory redemption. Goldman lays great stress on the favourable response from the rating agencies. 'Standard &amp; Poor's considers the preferred security as superior to a direct issue of parent preferred due to low cost, unlimited deferral feature and limited investor remedies,' says Mr Osborne. 'There has been an accelerated evolution of these structures,' he points out. 'There is a general recognition that you can achieve lower cost in a way which is not destructive to agency ratings.'</p>

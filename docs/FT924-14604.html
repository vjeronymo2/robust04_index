			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / German chemical companies profits plunge by more than 30 per cent The profits of German chemical companies have plunged by more than 30 per cent so far this year, production has been cut and there are still no signs of improvement in the sector, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of the VCI industry association, writes Christopher Parkes. He said the industry's volume output had risen 1 per cent in the first three quarters. However, demand had fallen markedly in the third quarter, leading to production cuts. Mr Hilger is head of Hoechst, which recently reported a 20 per cent decline in profits in the first six months of this year. Producer prices had fallen by an average of 2 per cent and the industry's total sales in the first nine months had fallen to DM125bn (Pounds 50bn), slightly below last year's figure. Speaking to VCI members, Mr Hilger said that business prospects among the most important users of chemicals gave little grounds for optimism. The appreciation of the D-Mark had further increased the industry's difficulties, and association members would have to come to terms with the fact that sales this year would not reach 1991 levels.</p>

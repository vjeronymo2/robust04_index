			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBINS, JOHNSON EXCHANGE HOT WORDS  </P> <P> Accusing him of using tactics from the Spanish Inquisition, the Assembly's  leading Republican publicly upbraided Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) Thursday  for "harassing" Assembly Republicans during budget negotiations.  </P> <P> Robbins, in an unusual speech to the full Senate minutes later, accused Ross  Johnson of La Habra of making anti-Semitic remarks to him and said that such  "absolutely disgusting conduct by the leader of Assembly Republicans is not in  the realm of something that can be excused or tolerated by a member of our  society."  </P> <P> Robbins drew immediate support from Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman  of the joint Assembly-Senate budget conference committee, who deplored  Johnson's conduct as "totally unacceptable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Utter Nonsense'  </P> <P> Johnson then hurried into the Senate chamber and denied to reporters that he  made any anti-Semitic statements. "That's nonsense, utter nonsense," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson said he had made a "joking" reference to "Sen. Torquemada" as he strode  into the conference committee to complain about Robbins' rough treatment of  Assembly Republicans who appeared before the committee to plead for funding for  their pet projects. Tomas de Torquemada was the grand inquisitor during the  Spanish Inquisition.  </P> <P> Robbins, who is Jewish, said the reference was anti-Semitic because it was  Torquemada who played a key role in expelling Jews from Spain in the 15th  Century.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Second Reference  </P> <P> "Maybe, senator," Johnson said during the committee session, "I should have  referred to Sammy Glick." Glick was a character in Budd Schulberg's 1941 novel,  "What Makes Sammy Run," who was portrayed as a ruthless movie mogul who was  Jewish.  </P> <P> As Johnson entered the Senate chamber, he was surrounded by both Republicans  and Democrats, some of whom moments before had hugged and embraced an emotional  Robbins. Johnson said he came to "confront" Robbins directly, but Robbins  apparently had departed.  </P> <P> About 90 minutes later, Johnson issued a statement to the press and called  Robbins a "bully who had intimidated our (Republican) members unmercifully all  day." But he insisted, "If I inadvertently said anything that could be  misinterpreted in that manner, I most sincerely apologize and would  unhesitatingly apologize to Sen. Robbins."  </P> <P> An angry Johnson said he decided to face Robbins in the conference committee  after he heard that the senator had been accusing Republicans of engaging in a  conspiracy several weeks ago to block a Robbins insurance bill.  </P> <P> Robbins complained that the Republicans used parliamentary procedures to kill  the bill that would have imposed stiff fines on insurance companies that tried  to escape provisions of Proposition 103 by mass cancellations of California  policyholders. The initiative, approved by the voters in November, requires  insurers to reduce rates.  </P> <P> "You can't expect to participate in that type of conspiracy and expect to come  here and have this particular conferee be receptive . . . to your request,"  Robbins told one Assembly Republican.  </P> <P> The Republicans denied there had been any conspiracy. Johnson said the bill had  been voted down twice in the Assembly and Republicans saw no need to bring it  up a third time.  </P> <P> "I admire your tenacity," he told Robbins, "but I don't admire at all your  harassing individual members of my caucus. . . just because they voted against  a bill that you authored."  </P> <P> Even before the exchange between Robbins and Johnson, the decorous proceedings  of the six-member conference committee had turned into a donnybrook when  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) threatened to block funding for  rural parks. She said that since suburban and rural legislators are pushing  legislation to take school funding away from inner-city school districts, it  would only be fair to do the same thing with their park money.  </P> <P> She made the remarks as Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge) argued  for funding to acquire parkland in the Santa Susanna Mountains.  </P> <P> "(But) many of your constituents enjoy these mountains," La Follette protested.  </P> <P> "You don't know what my constituents enjoy," Waters snapped. "Every time you  want some more money for the mountains, you say that. . . . You would like to  think that, but let me tell you, they don't."  </P> <P> The conferees are expected to take at least a week to negotiate a compromise on  the state's $50-billion budget.  </P></p>

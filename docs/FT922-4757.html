			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: British premier pledges steps to decentralise EC ANY 'substantial renegotiation' of the Maastricht treaty to take account of its rejection by Danish voters was not a practical proposition at present, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, warned yesterday. He again resisted demands from both sides of the House of Commons for a direct test of the views of the British people by insisting that a referendum would be incompatible with Britain's system of representative government. Mr Major agreed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that consideration of the bill implementing the treaty should be temporarily postponed, but rejected demands that it should be dropped altogether. He said 'The treaty itself has not changed, and neither has my view of the treaty'. The prime minister made it clear to the apparently increasing number of Tory backbench critics of Maastricht that his view had the support of a united cabinet. He promised that Britain would use its six months' presidency of the EC, beginning in July, to carry forward the move to decentralisation through increasing use of inter-government agreements not subject to the terms of the Treaty of Rome or the judgment of the European Court. Mr Major emphasised that the treaty provided mechanisms for more broadly based development of the EC. 'The ratification and implementation of the treaty is in our national interest, and we shall continue during our presidency to work for the Community we secured in that negotiation,' he said. Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire north and one of the 22 Tory backbench rebels who earlier voted against the second reading of the Maastricht bill, underlined the need for further institutional reform in the EC which enhanced the role of inter-governmental co-operation and, correspondingly, contracted the centralising consequences of the Rome treaty. The prime minister stressed that it was a British initiative which marked the move away from centralism at Maastricht and assured the House: 'There is no doubt that is the direction in which we must continue to move as we take over the presidency.' Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield and a member of the Labour cabinet primarily responsible for securing the referendum on Britain's continued membership of the EC in 1975, said the Danes had 'struck a blow for every country in Europe, not just their own'. He forecast that the outcome of the Danish referendum would be seen to have opened the way for a different sort of Europe, harmonising by consent in inter-governmental co-operation and providing the opportunity for a commonwealth of European states rather than a federation. Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister who took Britain into the EC in 1973, praised Mr Major's firm stance. He said 'The basic thing for us is to press ahead.'</p>

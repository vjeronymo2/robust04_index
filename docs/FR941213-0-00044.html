			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of JCAHO or AOA Accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received five comments on the equivalency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the JCAHO's standards to ours. Two commenters believe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JCAHO's standards for discharge planning (and supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for social work services and nursing services) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be equivalent to ours, while two believe them not to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have reviewed JCAHO's 1994 standards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> find them to be at least equivalent to those in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. Included in our determination finding them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent was a consideration of the JCAHO's standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient assessment and education of patients and family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are announcing that JCAHO-accredited hospitals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 482.43. Those hospitals will not have to be surveyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for compliance with this requirement when the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The fifth commenter was philosophically opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accepting the equivalency of the JCAHO's discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning standards to ours because he believed a private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is not accountable to the government for enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept the commenter's contention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a private agency should not be used to enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government standards, as the statute explicitly authorizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this type of use of a private agency (section 1865(a) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act). In order to ensure that the hospitals the JCAHO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredits are meeting standards equivalent to HCFA's, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct validation surveys under section 1864(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals found out of compliance with conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation may have their provider agreements terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they do not correct their deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received one comment concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalency of AOA standards to ours. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the AOA's discharge planning standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more general than HCFA's but that they would be strengthened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet new Medicare standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that AOA standards on discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning in effect at the time the commenters commented were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not equal to or higher than ours. We are pleased to report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the AOA subsequently revised its standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are announcing that AOA-accredited hospitals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 CFR 482.43. These hospitals will not have to be surveyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for compliance with this requirement when the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters believed we should require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals to identify all Medicare patients, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high risk patients, in need of post-hospital care, within 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours of being admitted, including, for one commenter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients appearing in the emergency room, whether or not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are admitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not agree that a 24-hour limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be imposed on the identification requirement. Both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute and the regulation require identification to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take place ``at an early stage of hospitalization.'' We think  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is sufficient because the specific timing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification within that context, we believe, is best left  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the hospital, its staff, and the attending physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discharge planning presupposes hospital admission and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 specifically indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge planning follows hospitalization. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of &sect;482.43 do not apply to patients who appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a hospital emergency room but are not admitted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital inpatients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters thought we should require each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital to have a policy for developing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing screening criteria for identifying those patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose medical conditions and social circumstances would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant discharge planning and to require that the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review its criteria annually. As an alternative, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that hospitals be required to have a procedure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying at an early stage patients likely to need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-acute care services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe the use of an outcome oriented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is sufficient for the regulation and in accord with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basic approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of participation for hospitals (51 FR 22042).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance with the standard, and we wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preserve their flexibility in this regard, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of reviewing all Medicare patients admitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. An on-going reassessment of the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge planning process, which would include any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening or identification methods, is required in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;482.43(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted us to establish specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria (e.g., age, functional ability, psychosocial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors and health status), to identify patients who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to suffer adverse health consequences without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As mentioned in response to the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, we want to continue the approach used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hospitals, which avoided prescriptive administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements through the use of language that is stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of expected outcomes, thereby providing hospitals with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater flexibility. Since the criteria suggested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter are overly prescriptive and not outcome oriented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are not adopting them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

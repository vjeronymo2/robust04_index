			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Japanese stock market plunges Japanese share prices plunged yesterday amid fears of turmoil after the defeat of political reform bills initiated by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares fell 954.19 points, or 4.9 per cent, the largest single-day drop since August 1991, as shaken investors and dealers rushed to unload their holdings. Investors were also worried that political difficulties might further delay the government's ability to stimulate the stumbling economy. The Keidanren, the leading business federation, called on Mr Hosokawa not to call a snap general election. Prolonged political uncertainty would further damage the economy, warned Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the Keidanren's chairman. Parliamentary officials of the ruling seven-party coalition met members of the opposition Liberal Democratic party to try to form a joint panel of the upper and lower houses as a forum for compromise. They plan to meet again today. The LDP blamed 'co-ordination' difficulties. The party is divided between a minority who seek a watered-down version of the political reform plans - the leadership's official line - and a majority who have strong reservations over the proposed abandonment of Japan's multi-seat constituency system. In one small sign of possible progress, the leadership of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition partner, said it was ready to meet the LDP. If, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails to get an agreement by the end of the present parliamentary session on Saturday at midnight, the bills will expire. Mr Hosokawa will then be under pressure to carry out his implied promise to resign, although he is Japan's most popular politician. Political observers believe that if Mr Hosokawa does resign, he would hand over the prime ministership to a leading member of the seven-party coalition, rather than call an election. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and leader of the Japan Renewal party, set up last June by defectors from the LDP, or Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the New Harbinger party, another former LDP splinter group, are thought to be front runners for the job. On the Tokyo stock market, traders expect further turbulence this week due to the uncertainty surrounding Mr Hosokawa's efforts to formulate a compromise out of the reform bills by Saturday. 'There's no knowing how much the market could fall if Mr Hosokawa is forced to resign,' warned Mr Takashi Kanasaki, a director at Yamaichi Securities. On the foreign exchange, political worries also prompted selling of the yen against the dollar. It closed Y0.80 down against the dollar at Y112.10.

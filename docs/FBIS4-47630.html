			<p>Europe      Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 19, 19 May  1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Lat in America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most  recent sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Lat in America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications.      The EER is published in two editions, one for West Europe (also  including media coverage of Canada and Turkey), and the other for  East Europe.  Drawing primarily from domestic media sources of these  countries but also using other foreign media where appropriate, the  EER focuses on national and regional economic issues, such as  economic competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic  reforms and other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade  and investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

Speaking at the association's meeting  on 19 April, Ingberg warned that adapting to enter the EU would  place severe strain on an institution which has played a major role  in assuring relative self-reliance and prosperity in rural areas  since before Finnish independence.      The cooperative movement, having weathered many problems over the  past two decades, including the recent recession, must now face the  challenge of a projected 1 January 1995 entry into the EU and must  brace itself to end protective tariffs and to steadily reduce  agricultural subsidies.  Ingberg argues that cooperatives are going  to have to implement many of the changes made by their domestic  competitors, the larger "private" food conglomerates.  Plants will  need to increase the amount of processing value in their products to  meet the import challenge, modernize their operations, and seek ties  with both domestic and foreign companies which would permit  specialization and allow the movement to continue it traditional  place in helping to maintain viable small family farms and slowing  rural depopulation.  This, however, will require new sources of  financing, since traditional sources--membership shares and domestic  bank loans--will not be adequate.  The size of investments needed  will mean the movement is going to have to seek immediate infusions  of venture capital, perhaps even from abroad since there are few  Finnish venture capitalists.  This may be a major hurdle, according  to Ingberg.  The cooperative movement will also need to change its  marketing practices, never its strong suit, and become more  demanding and market oriented, he concludes.

While the U.S. Government congratulates itself on strong growth and  lower unemployment, Pourquery sees Wall Street reacting to projected  inflationary risk and the Federal Reserve acting with "legendary  prudence" to forestall such a possibility.  The market--as well as  Europe, which fears that higher U.S. rates will derail a hesitant  recovery--is waiting once again for the Federal Reserve to make a  gesture to fight against inflation.  However, the gesture is late in  coming and in the meantime the market's financial operators are  distrustful of the Clinton administration's actions which they judge  are often hesitant, sometime ill considered, and a bit  "inexperienced," according to Pourquery.  He concludes that the  large majority of these operators, are dyed-in-the-wool liberals-  -hardly "Clintonites"--who do not have confidence in this  administration.

The authors imply that this report, in what it calls "a  very official" publication, may have been an attempt by the  Taiwanese Government to embarrass the French and to indicate its  displeasure with France's renewed diplomacy with China which led to  French promises not to sell arms to Taiwan.  They suggest that the  Taiwanese report contributed to Thomson losing the contract to arm  the empty-shell frigates sold to Taiwan in 1991.      The Taiwanese report claimed that Yin's assassination was "an  affair of bribes and secret military sales."  It argued that Thomson  may have been involved since the principal suspect in the case was a  Taiwanese citizen named Wang Chuan-Pu who was reportedly the local  agent for several foreign companies, one of which was Thomson.  "Captain Yin was assassinated after having threatened to reveal the  misdeeds that he had discovered in the attribution of arms sales  contracts," detailed the report.  However, the authors note the  report "temporized," stating that "Wang was not the legal agent of  Thomson but simply an intermediary and that nothing allowed one to  think at that time that the French company had been implicated in  the death of Captain Yin."      The publication of the Taiwanese report, which was destined for  French readers, exacerbated French-Taiwanese relations even further,  since it came only a few days after Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur's trip to China, according to the authors.  Furthermore,  they add that it was published at the same time the U.S. Congress  authorized President Bill Clinton to increase arms sales to Taiwan.

According to Seguin, the referendum  would take place after the presidential elections next year and is  necessary to unblock the social controversy over how best to solve  France's high unemployment rate, much of which is not due to the  recession but is blamed on structural rigidities in the French labor  market.      Labor unions unanimously criticized Seguin's plan.  Secretary  General of the French Democratic Confederation of Workers (CFDT)  Nicole Notat claimed the plan was "too much" and that the question  of employment was "too serious to be reduced to looking for a magic  potion."  Worker's Force President Marc Blondel complained, "The use  of a referendum to go over the heads of the unions is a way to put  us at odds with our representatives. ...  It is no longer possible  to allow double talk:  to call for strong unions and then to  destabilize them."  The CFTC labor union noted that according to a  BVA poll, 77 percent of the French think that unions are "an  indispensable intermediary."      Some political leaders also spoke against the referendum.  Vice  president of the Assembly's Union for French Democracy (UDF) group,  Jacques Barrot warned that such a referendum would "risk a false and  thus dangerous social debate that confines itself to announcing  magic formulas."  Former Socialist Labor Minister Martine Aubry  claimed, "When I heard this proposition, I thought it was a joke."  Furthermore Aubry noted, the search for solutions for unemployment  "is the responsibility of politicians.  If they do not think so,  they should change occupations."  (Dian I. x36286)  (Paris LA  TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 4 May 94 P 4)      FURTHER REACTIONS TO EMPLOYMENT REFERENDUM--In an interview with  former President and Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery  Giscard d'Estaing by Patrick Jarreau appearing in the Paris daily LE  MONDE, Giscard argued that a solution to the unemployment problem is  "too urgent" to be left to a referendum.  New measures are needed to  respond to the French people's concerns, Giscard d'Estaing  continued, noting that he will propose a number of them after the  June European Parliament elections, "since one debate should not  obscure the other."  However, he concluded that Seguin's  contribution is "worthwhile" because it raises people's  consciousness on the need for an overall new approach to  unemployment.      According to Jean-Claude Vajou writing in the 3 May Paris daily  LIBERATION, the Seguin-proposed referendum "appeals to those in the  public who are against particular interests. .. by going over  constituted bodies." Additionally, if a return to "direct democracy"  through use of a referendum creates favorable conditions to oppose  the "technostructure," it also may be a vote for or against the  current government and raise questions of its continuing validity.      In an interview with UDF parliamentary leader Charles Millon by  Eric Zemmour for the Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN, Millon stated that he  opposed a referendum, arguing that unless a simple question such as  are you for or against unemployment" were asked--to which the  answer is obvious--it is difficult to formulate a referendum on a  subject as complex as unemployment.  In addition, Millon noted that  a referendum should not be applied to other than purely  institutional issues, because extending it to societal problems  would mean "increased undervaluation of representative democracy" at  a time when France is already suffering from a weakening of such  democracy.  The natural result of a referendum, Millon concluded, is  a  democracy of opinion" or "democracy of the moment" aimed at any  type of reform.

Although UAP was offered  for sale at a time when the stock market was in a downturn and  investor interest was weak--attracting only 1.9 million shareholders  rather than the 2 to 3 million of previous privatizations--Leser  contends that it was important to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to  counter the failures of his 1986-87 privatization attempts.  For him  to delay the UAP privatization to wait for better market conditions  would have also aroused doubts about his determination to pursue the  program, permanently weakening the market for future privatizations.  Additionally, it would have jeopardized the privatization of the  second-ranked General Insurance Companies of France (AGF).      Leser also writes that by offering a minimum price to  shareholders, the Ministry of Finance also limited the risk of  market prices undercutting the public offering price, as happened in  previous privatizations.  Institutional investors, and especially  U.S. investors who play a major role on the Paris stock exchange,  have recently complained of having purchased shares at higher prices  than private investors.  This time around, Leser remarked, "They are  almost ensured in a couple of months, like small investors, of  making a comfortable return on their investment.

An article in LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR characterized the  results as surprising.  While the article claimed most of the French  were thought to be "individualistic and indifferent to militantism,"  a majority answered that labor unions are an "indispensable  intermediary" between management and labor and that unions are the  best means to defend workers' rights but only if they follow the  German practice where unions manage companies in conjunction with  owners.  Respondents were asked the following questions:      "These opinions are sometimes heard about labor unions.  For each  of them, tell me if you fully agree, rather agree, rather disagree  or fully disagree."

According to  the annual report of the National Federation of Safer, the average  cost per hectare in 1993 dropped below 20,000 francs (Fr), reaching  Fr19,970 compared to Fr20,500 in 1992, a 3-percent drop in constant  1956 francs.  Actually, two facts should have favored a hike in  prices.  For one, farm revenue per hectare was maintained in 1993  and, according to forecasts, will remain stable at least until 1996.  Secondly, to compensate for the CAP-mandated "land freeze," farmers  are trying to increase the size of their farms.  Despite this, the  price of land (in current francs) continued to fall last year.  Agriculture specialists explained the drop by noting the farmers'  lack of confidence in their future and in the continuation of the  level of direct aid by the reform of the CAP.  (Dian i. x36286)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 28 Apr 94 p II)      GERMANY      CZECH SKODA FIRM BUYS MAJOR ERFURT COMPANY--The most significant  Czech direct investment in Germany has been finalized after only  three months' of  privatization negotiations.  Skoda, a major  manufacturer of heavy equipment and machine tools, has bought  Umformtechnik Erfurt (UTE), a 1,600 employee metalworking firm with  a 1993 sales volume of 202 million German marks (DM).  Skoda agreed  to save 1,000 jobs at UTE, to invest DM150 million, and to share  ownership with the Trust Agency and the government-owned Thueringer  Industriebeteiligungs company.  The sales agreement permits  ownership by additional partners, and Russian companies are said to  be interested.  Skoda's international relations manager, Jiri  Kotina, claims that the company intends to expand its business with  the automobile industry and that UTE, which supplies die presses to  Audi, Mercedes-Benz, VW, and SEAT, is part of that strategy.  Twenty-one percent of Skoda is held by the Czech Government and the  balance by banks, investment funds and individuals and the firm  functions as a holding company for 36 largely independent companies.  (Charles W. x36473)  (Berlin DIE WELT in German 2 May 94 p 12)      EAST'S AGRICULTURE REBOUND OUTSTRIPS INDUSTRY' S--In an article  in the daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Helmut Born, secretary general  of the German Farmers' Association, characterizes the profits of  privatized farms in eastern Germany as "respectable," noting that  agriculture in the new laender had come out of the trough more  rapidly than industry.  He concedes that this was true only for crop  farming and that livestock farming has not yet recovered from its  "horrible bloodletting."  The DM15.8 billion expended since 1990 to  support and expand eastern German farming have led to unprecedented  structural change and a reduction in the labor force from 850,000 to  180,000.  For the farmers remaining in business, efforts are  starting to pay off, partly due to the size of the farms in the  east, which historically have been larger than those in the west.      Now, however, a controversy is brewing between eastern and  western Germany over the subsidies paid farmers.  Eastern farms  still have wide-reaching exemptions from taxes and fees and  simplified rules for calculating valuation.  Personal income per  worker is higher for farmers in the east than for those in the west,  the only exception being those belonging to cooperatives deriving  from the GDR-era agricultural co-ops.  With the upcoming expiration  of the concessions, the farmers' association sees an opportunity to  restructure agricultural supports.  It is calling for a kind of mid-  sized agricultural unit program extensively based on cheap credit  that can be allotted to both eastern and western German businessmen  according to uniform criteria. (Charles W. x36473)  (Frankfurt/Main  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 10 May 94 p 18)      TRUST AGENCY BOASTS MBO/MBI PRIVATIZATION SUCCESS--According to  Trust Agency board member Klaus-Peter Wild, privatization by means  of Management Buy Out (MBO) or Management Buy In (MBI)--the  procedure by which some 20 percent of the 14,000 agency's companies  were sold--has been a success.  This counters rumors and speculation  that MBO/MBI companies were facing a gloomy future due to frequently  inadequate initial capital and short-term loan repayment  obligations.  These factors had not offset the advantage of selling  to managers experienced in the respective firms and Wild said that  the number of "serious problem cases" amounted to only 10 percent of  the MBO/MBI sales, with a mere 2 percent involving bankruptcy or  factory closings, although significant longer term problems were to  be expected in about 25 percent of the companies.  It was a matter  of Trust Agency pride that MBO/MBI privatizations had achieved 115  percent of the guaranteed employment figures and that the value of  investments reached 139 percent of the guaranteed figure.  Wild  noted that the Trust Agency continued to consult with company  managements on current and ongoing operational problems, even if the  firms had passed completely out of Agency control.

The  article lists the main economic priorities and the government's  plans on how to tackle them:      Unemployment:  Investments (which have been blocked during the  "Clean Hands" investigation into public corruption) will be  unblocked to create new employment opportunities.  Laws will be  introduced that will favor shorter work hours and part-time  employment; apprenticeship programs will be modified to lower  employers' costs; hiring practices will be liberalized, allowing  companies with fewer than 15 employees to hire directly rather than  from employment pools or agencies; the article of the 1994 Budget  Law which established new criteria for awarding public contracts  will be suspended.      Tax Reform:  Tax reform will be based on certain fundamental  principles:  The first 10 million lire of annual income will be  totally tax exempt, personal income tax rates will be drastically  reduced to favor middle- to low-income individuals, the tax payment  system will be simplified, and personal income tax payments will be  reduced from quarterly to semiannually.      Privatizations:  The new government will proceed with the rapid  privatization of the National Insurance Institute (INA) and the  National Electric Power Board (ENEL), fine-tuning the procedures for  the concession of electric service and regulating ENEL's rates.      Pensions:  The law which allowed the creation of private pension  funds will be revised to eliminate the tax burdens which have kept  these funds from actually being established.  However, the  incentives to acquire private pensions do not exempt individuals  from contributing to the public pension system.  Only lower-income  individuals will be guaranteed adequate living standards when they  retire by tying pension payments to salary scales.  Higher-income  individuals will be compensated from available national funds only  after lower-income individuals have been guaranteed adequate  compensation.      Health:  Health benefit payments will be made directly to  patients; a minimum level of assistance will be established, to be  paid through taxation, which will be the same throughout the  country.  The service will be paid for directly by the patients with  both private and public funds which will be disbursed to them by  private insurance companies.  Competition in the public health  system will be stimulated by passing regional laws that allow  hospitals to be run like private companies.      Schools:  A new method of financing schools will be established  which will be equally valid for public and private institutions.      Family:  A new legislation that will favor families with children  has already been drawn up, which will provide assistance in the form  of "house coupons" for lower-income couples, extended mortgages for  first-time home buyers, and a new system of tax deduction for lower-  income families.  To encourage the elderly to remain with their  families, families who assist the elderly without burdening the  state budget will be rewarded.      --Immigrants:  Immigrants will be given the same access to  employment as citizens; they will be provided with adequate housing,  Italian language instruction, and employment assistance. (Anilla B.  x36283)  (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA 8 May 94 p 2)      ALITALIA LOSSES PROMPT REORGANIZATION REVISION--The unexpected  extent of Alitalia's losses in 1993 will require the company to  revise its reorganization plan, according to an article in IL  MESSAGGERO.  Although it was expected that Alitalia would record  substantial losses in 1993, the 345.6 billion lire actually lost was  a surprise even to its president, Renato Riverso, and its CEO,  Roberto Schisano.  The loss amounted to 130 billion lire more than  in 1992 and losses in the first quarter of 1994 already amount to  190 billion lire.  Since the losses for 1993 amounted to more than  one third of the company's capital, by law the board is obligated to  call a meeting of the shareholders, which it has arranged for June.  If by that time Alitalia has not reduced its losses to less than one  third of its capital, the shareholders will have to authorize the  company to restructure its capital.      Reducing the losses, however, will not be an easy task and will  require "great sacrifices," beginning with a complete revision of  the company's reorganization which had been approved just six months  ago.  Alitalia's reorganization will be revised to include the  following changes, which Schisano said should lead to increased  profits within the short to medium term and will allow Alitalia to  successfully compete on the international market:      * Flight frequency and regional business, especially in the north  at Milan's airports, will be increased.  Romano Prodi, president of  the Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry (IRI), Alitalia's  main shareholder, said that because of the delay in increasing  activities in Milan, Alitalia is losing 1 trillion lire yearly in  business to Munich, Frankfurt, and Zurich airports.      * Alitalia's fleet will be examined, possibly replacing the Jumbo  B-747's with the more economical and flexible "twin-engine" jets.      * Alitalia's assets will be reviewed.  Alitalia will examine its  sale of the Rome airports, for which there are already potential  buyers.      * General expenses will be cut and will include the probable  dismissal of 2,000 employees through early retirements, incentives  to resign, and "solidarity contracts."      * Regulations for hiring aircraft crews will be reexamined,  leading to expected increased productivity from pilots and other  members of the crew, and may involve a cut in the number of pilots.

One way  of determining this, das Neves contends, is to examine whether in  the past Portugal showed financial stability in accordance with  these criteria.  Using available statistics, das Neves claims the  following would be the picture of Portugal's economy based on  historical performance:      * Debt: Public debt below 60 percent of GDP.  On average,  Portugal's public debt during the 140 years between 1851 and 1992  was 54 percent of GDP, even if in 1993 it rose to 65.8 percent of  GDP, higher than the Maastricht requirement.      * Deficit: Budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP.  The average  government budget deficit in the same 1851-1992 period was 2.2  percent of GDP, again within permissible limits.  It did rise to  8.25 percent in 1993.      * Inflation: Differential between Portugal's inflation rate and  the average EU inflation rate less than 1.5 percent.  During the  period 1870-1992, the long-term rate of inflation in Portugal was  4.6 percent.  As the average inflation rate in EU countries during  the same period was around 4.4 percent, the 0.2 percent differential  meets EMU requirements.  In 1993, the differential was about 3.1  percent, above the allowable limit.      * Interest Rates: Differential between Portugal's long-term  interest rates and average EU interest rates less than 2 percent.  The average long-term EU interest rate during 1961-92 was about 9.3  percent.  While it is difficult to gauge long-term interest rates in  Portugal, as a result of using the Bank of Portugal's discount rate  as an indicator it appears that the average rate for the same period  was about 9.8 percent.      * Exchange Rates: An exchange rate within the European Monetary  System's (EMS's) original narrow band.  This is the most difficult  criterion to gauge, since Portugal does not have a long experience  in EMS participation.  However, it should be noted that Portugal did  not experience difficulties in other systems of fixed exchange rates  such as Bretton Woods, and that the Portuguese average annual  devaluation rate in relation to the British pound--the currency used  as a reference during most of the last 100 years--was 1.3 percent;  by subtracting the last 20 years from that period, this rate becomes  0.14 percent, which shows significant stability.      These historical trends indicate, according to das Neves, that  Portugal is much stronger and more stable than recent events may  make it seem.  While it may not be easy to become part of EMU, it  "will not be difficult to live in it," he continued, in contrast  with other countries that may presently appear more stable than  Portugal.

She has given a promise to all of them  and she is busying herself trying to keep her promise."      * Republican Populist Party Chairman Deniz Baykal:  Reported to  be planning a trip to Karabuk to support the workers of the Karabuk  Iron-Steel factory, which the economic program has proposed closing.      * Motherland Party Group Deputy Chairman Hasan Korkmazcan: Stated  that his party was not going to support the economic stability  package, declaring that Ciller was a "political fraud."      * Public Sector Workers Trade Unions: Members are cited as saying  they were going to hold demonstrations on 11 April in Ankara Sakarya  street to protest the stability package.      * The Ankara Democracy Platform: This group--composed of the  Turkish-Workers (Turk-Is), the Confederation of Revolutionary  Workers Union (DISK), Public Sector Workers Union, and various  associations and chambers related to the Turkish Union of Chambers  of Architects and Engineers (TMM0B) and the Turkish Physicians Union  (TTB)--is cited as criticizing the stability package.      * The Istanbul branch of the Chambers of Construction Engineers:  Members have stated, "Society will surely not take this bitter  medicine without resistance."(Ender C. x36285)  (Istanbul MILLIYET  in Turkish 8 Apr 94 p 11)      FORMER CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR PROPOSES SOLUTIONS--Rusdu Saracoglu,  former governor of the Central Bank, speaking at the Institute of  Banking and Insurance of the University of Marmara, provided some  scenarios for the future of Turkey's economy:      * If the True Path Party-Socialist Populist Party (DYP-SHP)  Coalition continues, the markets will not have confidence in the  government's  economic stability program.  The pressure on the  Turkish lira will continue.  Investors will be able to make up for  their losses due to foreign currency appreciation only with  overnight 500-1000 percent interest rates on Turkish Liras.      * A Motherland Party (ANAP)-supported DYP minority government  will be equally ineffective since the ANAP can withdraw its support  at any time.  A party which does not have a guaranteed majority can  not carry out a stabilization program.      * If DYP and ANAP form a coalition and endorse an early election,  they will not be able to achieve economic stability.  Recent local  election indicate that these two parties both will have to go to  their constituents with populist promises.  If they go into the  elections with separate partners, it is unlikely that they can  convince people to support the stability package.  After the  elections, the administration still will have to undertake large  public expenditures.      * A technocrat government is completely absurd.  Saracaglu points  out that his name is mentioned in such scenarios but states that it  is unrealistic.  Such a government, installed just to reform the  economy,  would not run in the 1996 elections.  It is hard to guess  what is going to happen after 1996.  Individuals are not going to  change their present behaviors if they know that the reforms will be  short-lived.  And this kind of thinking will prevent the reforms  from being successful.      * A United ANAP-DYP would be the best solution, Saracaglu  contends, and would be his choice of a new government.  However, the  parties on the Left also must unite.  A united DYP and ANAP would  have to assemble an able cadre, an economic program, and immediately  call for early elections.   The vote potential of these two parties  is about 45 percent.  Explaining the economic package to people  prior to the elections may cause them to lose about 5 percent of the  votes.  However, such a coalition could win an election and govern  for five years with their existing vote potential.  In this case, a  Turkey with a balanced budget, monetary discipline, based on the  principle of a small but effective government, and with judicial and  educational reform could result from this crisis.

He stated that the  objectives of privatization to date have been to make money but in  the future the real purpose of privatization will be to make the  Public Sector Enterprises (PSE) productive.  Furthermore, Yaramanci  suggested that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller should prepare the legal  basis for such a change "as soon as possible," adding that "all of  the countries which have been successful in privatization owe it to  the prime minister and the head of the technical team."  He also  stated that if a legal foundation is not established for the  privatizations, foreign investors will be skeptical of the whole  thing.  He also thought that privatization lacked a cultural  foundation and that a great majority of people did not have a sound  understanding of it.  Yaramanci said, "we will solve the problem of  unemployment which might result from privatization by paying 15  percent of the income earned from privatization as unemployment  benefits.      Yaramanci listed the following as principles the KOI would follow  in privatizing companies:      * Government-owned companies will be privatized "in accordance  with their own characteristics."  If necessary, some should be  leased.      * Privatization will be implemented on the basis of market price  rather than insisting on government-fixed prices.      * PSE private purchasers will include an experienced group of  shareholders who can take on managerial responsibility.      * Foreign capital will be allowed to finance privatization since  the total amount of capital needed is unlikely to be found  domestically.

Additionally, he pointed out  that the bank did not plan to give further credit to countries  outside of the BSEC.  He explained, for example, that about half of  the $1.15-billion credit allocated the former USSR still remains,  $599 million having been disbursed during 1989-91.  For the BSEC  countries, funds are allocated as follows:      Romania: Of the $50-million export credits allocated to this  country in 1990, $49 million have been used.  A second credit line  amounting to $75 million was opened to this country in 1993, none of  which has been used so far.  By sector, the credit has been applied:  44 percent for agricultural, 26 percent for machinery and electric  material, and 11 percent for minerals and basic consumer goods.      Albania: Some $13.8 million of the $15-million credit allocated  in 1991 has been used to export iron and other metals, 16 percent  for textile and clothing, 16 percent for machinery and electrical  materials, 13 percent for chemicals, and the rest for basic consumer  goods and other investments.      Bulgaria: Of the $50-million credit allotted in 1991, $20.9  million of this has been used.  Some 74.8 percent to finance export  of construction materials, 18.7 percent for textile goods, and 6.3  percent for other goods.  An agreement to open a second line of  credit to Bulgaria for $50 million during 1993-94 has not been  signed yet because Bulgarian officials have not yet completed the  required procedures.      Ukraine: Two separate credit agreements have been concluded to  finance exports and projects in 1994, which are not to exceed $50  million.      Moldavia: Loaned $10 million for 1994.  Discussions with Moldavia  about the loan has just started and Moldavia has asked that this  credit be used to finance telecommunication projects to be realized  in this country by Turkish companies.      Georgia: A credit agreement amounting to $50 million has been  concluded, $28 million of which will be used for consumer goods and  $22 million for investments by Export-Import Bank of Georgia and  Turk Eximbank in 1993.  A list of products subject to these credits  are being established by Georgia.      Azerbaijan: Two credit agreements have been signed between the  International Bank of Azerbaijan and Turkey's Eximbank.  One was  signed in 1993 to export goods amounting to $100 million and the  other on 27 January 1994 to finance a project amounting to $150  million.  The credit will cover food, medicine, medical supplies,  and telecommunication equipment as well as the construction of  telecommunication and industrial plants.

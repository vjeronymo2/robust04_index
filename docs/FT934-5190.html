			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: Who will buy the Citizen's Charter? - The global market for UK ideas of public service reform It is probably too soon to say that the Citizen's Charter has won popular acclaim in the UK. It will take many more years to convince the sceptics that the government's initiative for improving the quality of public services is more than a cosmetic exercise. But there is considerable interest throughout the world in the ideas behind the charter, and in ways of making public services more responsive to their customers. From Argentina to Zimbabwe, governments are looking for ways of improving service quality while bearing down on costs. And with Britain ahead of the field, at least for the moment, selling the know-how of the Citizen's Charter offers a new export industry for management consultants and training organisations. Peninah Thomson, a management consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, has already sold the idea to Kuwait. For the last year, she and a team of consultants have been helping Kuwaiti ministers and civil servants think more about their customers. Thomson is convinced that the charter approach could be a valuable invisible export. 'We've invented a better mousetrap in public administration,' she says. 'The world is beating a path to our door. 'Kuwait could have chosen an American model of admini-stration, but chose ours instead.' Further work may follow in other Gulf countries, such as Dubai, which have seen what the initiative means in Kuwait. The government of Hong Kong has also run a programme to improve the quality of its public services. Ripa International, part of the Capita Group, is another training and consultancy company which helps public administrators learn the charter techniques for use in their own countries. Sierra Leone, South Korea and Indonesia are among 60 countries which have sent civil servants on courses to learn more about UK government reforms. This week, a group of fast-stream trainees from the Polish civil service is in London for training, a symptom of the growing interest in better quality public services in eastern Europe. The Cabinet Office unit which manages the Citizen's Charter has received a stream of queries from more than 40 countries interested in the UK approach. According to Diana Goldsworthy, the unit's deputy director, these range from 'the guy from Zimbabwe who wants an hour to chat about improving public services, to the South Australian state government which has unveiled its own Citizen's Charter.' Close links have also been developed with the US, where vice-president Al Gore heads a drive to 'reinvent' the federal government machine. A two-day conference on Service for the Citizen, staged by the unit last December, attracted participants from more than 20 countries. A second conference next month will compare the experience of Australia and the US with that of the UK and other European countries. What impresses other governments is the simplicity of the UK approach. 'There's no high-flown theory behind the Citizen's Charter,' says Goldsworthy. 'It simply looks at the needs of the consumer of public services and finds ways of satisfying those needs. 'It is pragmatic and flexible, and it hasn't required a great deal of legislation to implement it. The unit manages the charter as a project, using techniques which can be transplanted anywhere.' Thomson believes that more could be done to sell British expertise abroad. Greater collaboration is needed between the Cabinet Office which has developed the ideas, the Foreign Office which represents Britain overseas and the companies which can help in implementing Citizen's Charter-type programmes. 'There's a huge interest out there in something Britain's got to offer,' she says. 'We need to work together so that more countries can buy the UK model of public sector reform.'</p>

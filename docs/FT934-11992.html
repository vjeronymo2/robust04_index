			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: 3M slides on strength of dollar 3M, the Minnesota-based adhesives manufacturer, yesterday blamed the strength of the dollar and weak economies in Europe and Japan for its disappointing third-quarter results. For the three months to September 30, its earnings slid 2.4 per cent to Dollars 316m, or Dollars 1.47, from Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.48, a year ago. Most analysts had expected earnings of Dollars 1.50 a share in the latest quarter. On Wall Street, shares in 3M eased Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 at the close. 3M said the strength of the dollar reduced its worldwide sales by about 5 per cent and net income by about 8 cents a share. 'This was the most negative currency translation in eight years,' the company said. 3M's third quarter sales fell 2 per cent to Dollars 3.48bn from Dollars 3.55bn. Mr LD DeSimone, chairman, said currency could have a significant impact on fourth quarter earnings. Provided the economic and currency situations do not deteriorate, 3M expects to at least match last year's fourth quarter performance. For the nine months, net income was Dollars 977m, or Dollars 4.49, on sales of Dollars 10.54bn. This compares with earnings of Dollars 944m, or Dollars 4.31, on sales of Dollars 10.51bn in the same period of 1992. Last year's earnings were depleted by 2 cents a share for accounting changes.</p>

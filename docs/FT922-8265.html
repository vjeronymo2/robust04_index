			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Legal aid checks criticised CRIMINAL legal aid is being granted without proper checks on applicants' eligibility, according to a report by the Commons public accounts committee. The matter was investigated after the qualification by Sir John Bourn, then comptroller and auditor-general, of the 1990-91 appropriation account of the Lord Chancellor's Department. Sir John cited 'uncertainty as to the propriety and regularity' of spending on criminal legal aid. Magistrates' courts - which account for more than half of the Pounds 333m spent yearly on criminal legal aid - attracted particular criticism. Sir John pointed to problems with insufficient information on the grounds for applications and lack of evidence about checks on income. Applicants for legal aid are required to provide 13 weekly pay slips as proof of income. The MPs found that pay slips were often not provided, and sometimes not even requested. 'It is unsatisfactory that court staff should knowingly fail to ensure that legal requirements are complied with,' the MPs said. Expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid. HMSO, Pounds 9.75.</p>

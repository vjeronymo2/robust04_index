			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tugay Ozceri, Turkey's permanent representative to  NATO, has said that the NATO Council decision on  Bosnia-Herzegovina is clear and that there is no need for a new  UN Security Council resolution to undertake an air raid against  the aggressors.    In a statement to ANATOLIA Agency at the conclusion of the  NATO Council meeting, Ozceri assessed the developments saying  that the removal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometers  within 10 days has been envisaged. He noted that the deadline  is 20 February and that the heavy weapons will either be pulled  back from the region or handed over to the UN peacekeeping  forces. Ozceri noted that the heavy weapons belonging to the  Bosnian Muslims will remain in the region under UN  responsibility. He added that a very close relationship has  been formed; a decisionmaking mechanism has set up between the  commander of the NATO southern Europe allied forces in Naples  and the commander of the UN peacekeeping forces within the  framework of the principles and methods developed at the  military committee since August in a bid to speedily activate  the air strike system in the event the aggressor does not comply  with the ultimatum. He stated that no one doubts the system  will function very well, adding, however, that the command  should come from the United Nations.    Ozceri said that the UN secretary general will have to  authorize the first raid, and the subsequent orders will come  from his representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Expressing the  wish that the NATO decision will have an effect on Serbia and  Bosnian Serbs, Ozceri said: This is a satisfactory decision  from Turkey's viewpoint. Turkey had been predicting every stage  since August 1992 and had, therefore, put forward an action  plan. Unfortunately, our warnings were not heeded. At this  point we have passed through all the stages predicted by Turkey  and we have reached that point which we envisaged to be the last.    Ozceri noted that the decision is beneficial from the  viewpoint of preserving NATO's credibility as well.</p>

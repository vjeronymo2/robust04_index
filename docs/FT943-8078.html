			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Sinking terminals fight for oily lifeline: The battle to benefit from Scotland's new finds What's in a name? Everything, according to local government officials on mainland Scotland and the northern isles vying for a share in the future wealth of the UK's most promising frontier oil province. 'West of Shetland' is the most common term for an area of the North Sea in which British Petroleum is developing its Foinaven discovery. But use that term in the Orkney Islands and you will soon be reminded that Foinaven lies 'north of Orkney'. For those on the mainland, 'Atlantic margin' has the right neutral ring. The one thing all officials can agree on is that oil fever has broken out again in some of Scotland's more remote coastal and island communities. But this time there is little chance of a bonanza on the scale of earlier North Sea discoveries. Although between 2bn and 10bn barrels of oil may eventually be found, developing deep-water fields in the harsh conditions of the open ocean is risky and expensive. And the waxy oil found so far sells at a discount to Brent Blend, the North Sea benchmark. Local officials, however, are optimistic that the new finds will throw a lifeline to at least one of the huge oil terminals at Sullom Voe, Flotta and Nigg, which without new business face steady decline and eventual closure. Foinaven's expected production of 75,000 barrels per day by late next year or early 1996 will do little to fill the increasingly empty tanks at the terminals, which can handle hundreds of thousands of barrels a day. But experts believe Foinaven will be only the first of a string of discoveries developed over the next few years. Schiehallion and Clair, two other discoveries, are being assessed. And if the Foinaven reservoir behaves in the way BP engineers hope, the first phase could be followed by a more ambitious second stage of development. Other companies are optimistic about the area. There are reports that Amerada Hess has found sufficient reserves to justify commercial development. However, even the most optimistic forecast for future production suggests that it will not be enough to sustain three terminals. Hence the increasingly bitter competition to secure the contract to land and store Foinaven oil. Nigg, the smallest terminal, was built 13 years ago to receive oil by pipeline from the Beatrice platform. It also offloads tankers from the new Gryphon field. Failure to win the Foinaven contract would be 'life-threatening', said an executive with one of the terminal's owners. With Beatrice production in sharp decline more of the terminal's operating costs would have to be added to the smaller Gryphon field, a burden which 'may not be economic', said the executive. Only about 25 people work at the Nigg terminal, but its closure would have wide repercussions. As well as the loss of harbour fees, rates and other oil-related payments, Nigg would face the departure of the tug boats used to berth the tankers. That would put an end to the growing number of visits by cruise ships and the tourist trade which has been built up to serve them. Nigg's bid to BP is expected to be about half that of Flotta and Sullom Voe, because it already has the heated storage tanks which Foinaven oil requires. But shuttle tankers would have to add eight hours to their return-journey time compared with the other two. Flotta, which lies alongside the natural deep-water harbour of Scapa Flow, is likely to offer BP a partnership which could include a stake in the terminal. Orkney Islands Council would support using part of a Pounds 60m fund controlled by it and the terminal's owners to pay for modifications to Flotta's facilities. Mr John Bryce of Elf Enterprise, operator of the terminal, said both Flotta and Sullom Voe would have to invest between Pounds 3m and Pounds 8m in new Foinaven-related facilities. But the winning local authority could gain between Pounds 3m and Pounds 6m in additional revenues over five years, he estimates. Profits for the terminal operators from a Foinaven contract are likely to be modest, given BP's rigorous emphasis on cost-cutting. But officials at both Sullom Voe and Flotta believe success with Foinaven would put the winning terminal in a better position to serve as the landfall for a pipeline which might be built once other fields are on stream. 'We need to get business in here now,' said Mr Bryce. 'We don't want to be in the position of mothballing facilities only to discover that somebody wants to build a pipeline.' People in Shetland know it would be humiliating if oil from West of Shetland, to use the most common term for the area, failed to come to Sullom Voe. Because of its size Sullom Voe plays a proportionately more important part in the Shetland economy than Flotta and Nigg do in the economies of Orkney and of the Highland region respectively. Daily throughput of oil at Sullom Voe averages about 800,000 barrels per day, more than double the flow at Flotta. It employs 411 people and pays rent and other charges amounting to about Pounds 9m a year to Shetland Islands council. However, throughput at Sullom Voe is predicted to fall to about 450,000 barrels per day over the next four to five years as the Ninian and Brent fields which feed it decline. They have already warned Shetlanders that Foinaven will not be 'a white knight' that halts the terminal's long-term decline. Shetland Islands council, concerned not only that Foinaven oil could bypass it but also that users of Sullom Voe could adopt other ways of transporting crude, wants to know what it can do to improve Sullom Voe's chances. So far, it says, it has heard nothing from oil companies, but it would be understandable if they were to ask for a substantial rent reduction.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Switzerland to aid Kyrgyzstan Switzerland said yesterday it would provide technical and financial aid to the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan under a new co-operation agreement. A finance ministry spokesman said Swiss President Otto Stich and Mr Askar Akayev, his Kyrgyz counterpart, who arrived with a delegation in Switzerland for a three-day official visit, signed the deal in the capital Berne. Switzerland will provide SFr4m (Pounds 1.95m) of technical aid a year, covering agriculture, forestry, the dairy industry, privatisation, and help to non-governmental organisations. It will also provide financial assistance for energy and healthcare projects. The two countries have had links since Switzerland joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in May 1992. Kyrgyzstan was one of several former Soviet republics which joined Poland in a group that then let Switzerland represent it on the IMF's executive board.</p>

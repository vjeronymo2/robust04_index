			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Reviving the inner cities 'THE DECAY at the heart of Britain's cities is one of the biggest challenges faced by its government,' according to Urban Trends, the new survey of inner-city life from the Policy Studies Institute. Since the first white paper on urban regeneration was published in 1977, billions of pounds have been spent on the UK's inner cities through a battery of government initiatives. Yet the PSI survey concludes that these measures have had little impact on narrowing the gap between the most deprived boroughs and the rest. Even more gloomily, this first independent assessment of 15 years of urban regeneration policy finds that the gap has widened in some respects. In most of the areas studied, the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools has worsened over the period - against the national trend. People from deprived areas have done worse out of training than those from other areas. Homelessness in many of these areas has increased by more than average. These are depressing findings at a time when minor riots have become an almost routine feature of life in many British cities. The report does, however, find some evidence of success in the efforts of urban development corporations, City Action Teams and Task Forces in improving the employment position of those who live in their areas. Considerable effort has gone into reclaiming derelict land and docklands. Transport and other economic infrastructure has been improved to tempt business back. But the effects have been patchy: while a third of the deprived areas surveyed saw their share of UK unemployment fall, the share increased in just over a third. City Challenge That patchiness could be exacerbated by City Challenge, the new bidding process used to allocate much of the government's funds for urban regeneration. On Thursday, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will announce the 20 urban priority areas which have won a share of Pounds 750m over the next five years in the second round of bidding. Eleven local authorities shared out more than Pounds 400m in last year's first round, so just over half of the 57 urban priority areas should have been successful in winning City Challenge money by the end of this week. The rest will have to wait until round three for their chance to fund what are likely to be equally deserving projects. Ministers are said to be uneasy about the fate of local authorities which lose out in competitive bidding. The failure of Birmingham's bid in the first round of City Challenge threatened the future of its imaginative partnership with the private sector to regenerate the Heartlands area, for example. A new urban development corporation was hastily created which provided Pounds 50m of funding to keep the show on the road. More such ad hoc solutions may have to be conjured out of Mr Howard's hat if some inner city areas are not to be allowed to spiral on down after Thursday's winners are announced. Funds unavailable The PSI, inevitably, proposes more money, which is highly unlikely to be available given the pressing need to contain the growth in the public sector borrowing requirement. It would be foolish to expect a crock of gold. More promising is the PSI's second recommendation: better management of whatever budget there is for inner-city regeneration. Money is already available through a plethora of different schemes, via various agencies and from several government departments. A clearer focus, preferably involving just one stop for local government, would allow targets to be better defined and progress to be regularly monitored. It would also reduce the scope for local authorities to indulge in 'grantsmanship', in which skilful exploitation of government grants yields bigger dividends than efficient delivery of services. There is no reason in theory why City Challenge cannot evolve to provide a one-stop funding agency, with clear objectives and tight monitoring, but that will involve the government throwing away the powerful sanction of withholding funds entirely. Without a more mature and trusting relationship between central and local government, Britain is unlikely to do more to regenerate its inner cities in the next 15 years than it has done in the past 15.</p>

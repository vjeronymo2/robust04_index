			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> THE ROCKIES;  </P> <P> YELLOWSTONE TIMBER HAULING PROHIBITED  </P> <P> The National Park Service will not allow commercial timber hauling through  Yellowstone Park, despite a request by the U.S. Forest Service. Parks Director  James Ridenour denied the request as environmentalists labled the decision the  first big test of Ridenour's willingness to protect the parks from commercial  assault. Ridenour was concerned that a lumber company's plan to transport about  20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse impacts on  important grizzly bear, elk and bison habitats as well as roadways, said a  spokesman. The timber to have been hauled is from trees partially burned by  fires in the park last year.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has reevaluated the article by Goodrich et al. (Ref. 1), considered the additional cited references (Ref. 2), and examined current policy on the labeling of United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) Absorbable Dusting Powder (cornstarch). Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) provide data from observations and arbitrary scoring of adhesions after intraperitoneal injection into 4 groups of 13 adult female mice with: (1) Powdered starch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline, (2) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of an iodophor and washed three times in saline before resuspension in 1.5 mL normal saline, (3) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of a 10-percent solution of surfactant washed three times in saline and resuspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline and (4) normal saline (control animals). The data do not indicate any significant difference between suspensions of the surfactant mixed with starch and the surfactant-iodophor mixed with starch. The agency's policy on the labeling of surgical gloves treated with Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P., determined upon evidence presented during the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 25, 1971 (36 FR 9475). The agency requires the following statement on surgical gloves treated with Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P.: ``Caution: after donning, remove powder by wiping gloves thoroughly with a sterile wet sponge, sterile wet towel, or other effective method.'' Products containing Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. for lubricating surgical gloves were formerly classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as new drugs, but are now regarded as transitional devices, for which premarket approval is required under the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 FR 63472 at 63474). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health is establishing categories for all surgical devices, including surgical gloves lubricated with powdered starch. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the labeling for this class of products will be dealt with in a separate rulemaking procedure and separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that the user's removal of dusting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powder from surgical medical devices (rubber goods) treated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. decreases the incidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhesions and is not persuaded that the data in the article by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson provide a sufficient scientific basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a warning label. Therefore, the warning about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interaction of iodophors and starch-containing products proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in this amended tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Goodrich, E. O., J. R. Prine, and J. S. Wilson, ``Iodized Starch Granules as a Cause of Starch Peritonitis,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Surgical Forum, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  25:372&hyph;374, 1974.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Nonclinical and Clinical Safety Studies on Postoperative Observations of Abrasions, Comment No. C111, vol. 4, tabs 6&hyph;14, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. A number of comments submitted new data (Ref. 1) to establish that povidone-iodine is safe and effective as a topical antimicrobial drug. The comments requested that povidone-iodine be reclassified from Category III to Category I as a topical antimicrobial ingredient for use as an antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in this document, this amended tentative final monograph addresses only topical antiseptics for health-care antiseptic uses as a surgical hand scrub, antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and patient preoperative skin preparation. As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, antimicrobial soaps are no longer included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. The agency addressed the other use categories mentioned in the comment in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644). As discussed in comment 38 of that document (56 FR 33660), FDA has tentatively concluded that povidone-iodine should be classified in Category I for use as a first aid antiseptic (formerly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has considered the new data submitted and other information in support of the request to reclassify povidone-iodine from Category III to Category I. On the basis of these data and information, the agency tentatively concludes that povidone-iodine should be reclassified from Category III to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category I as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, and health-care personnel or antiseptic handwash drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

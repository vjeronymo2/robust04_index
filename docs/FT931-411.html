			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge behind 20% rise at MY A LOWER interest charge helped MY Holdings, the USM-quoted paper and packaging company, increase interim profits by 20 per cent. The rise - from Pounds 758,000 to Pounds 911,000 in the six months to February 28 - came despite a 3 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 16.1m. The company said its cushion packaging division suffered a fall in demand while margins were pressured by higher material costs and lower selling prices. Operating profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 983,000. Interest costs fell from Pounds 305,000 to Pounds 72,000 because of lower interest rates and tight cash control. The company said borrowings had risen since the year end but gearing remained low at 16 per cent. Kohler Packaging, the carton manufacturer acquired in February, is expected to contribute to profits in the second half. Earnings increased 1.48p (1.47p) per share. The in-terim dividend is unchanged at 0.25p.</p>

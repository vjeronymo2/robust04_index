			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBOUND ON WALL STREET;  </P> <P> GLOSSARY OF 'WALL STREET SPEAK'  </P> <P> Wall Street likes to speak its own language much of the time. Here is what some  of it means:  </P> <P>  Arbitrage: The attempt to make a profit on takeovers by guessing which company  will be the next target. Also used to describe the practice of buying and  selling comparable securities -- for instance, a stock and a stock index future  -- and profiting on the price difference.  </P> <P> Call option: An option agreement that allows an investor to buy a stock or  other investment at a certain price during a certain period of time. The call  buyer is speculating that the investment's price will rise.  </P> <P> Computerized program trading: A type of stock trading used by big institutional  investors that involves trading huge blocks of stocks and stock index futures.  This kind of trading is believed to have aggravated the stock market crash of  October, 1987.  </P> <P> Junk bonds: High-yield bonds that also carry high risk and, after recent market  reverses, appear to be earning their name as companies fail to make interest  payments. Junk bonds have been used to finance many takeovers, particularly  leveraged buyouts.  </P> <P> Leveraged buyout: Buying a company with borrowed funds that are repaid with  cash generated by company operations or by selling parts of the company.  </P> <P> Margin account: A line of credit to buy stocks, limited to 50% of the value of  the stock.  </P> <P> Margin call: A demand by a lender that an investor put up more collateral for  securities bought on credit.  </P> <P> Mutual funds: A fund managed by an investment company that raises money from  shareholders and puts it into a variety of investments.  </P> <P> Option: An agreement, arranged for a fee, to buy or sell a stock or other  investment at a certain price for a limited time. See call option and put  option.  </P> <P> Portfolio Insurance: An investor ploy to avoid losing money by selling options  or futures against the stock in a portfolio in hopes of offsetting price  declines and magnifying price increases. Widely viewed as a contributor to the  October, 1987, crash.  </P> <P> Put option: An option agreement that allows an investor to sell a stock or  other investment at a certain price during a certain period of time. The put  buyer is speculating that the price will fall.  </P> <P> Price-earnings ratio: The price of a company's stock divided by the company's  annual earnings per share. It is an indicator of how much an investor is paying  for a company's earnings muscle.  </P> <P> Selling short: Selling borrowed stock to take advantage of an anticipated drop  in the price. The investor hopes to buy back the stock at a lower price before  it is time to return the securities.  </P> <P> Stock index futures: Contracts to buy and sell packages of stocks for delivery  in the future. Investors use stock index futures to speculate on where stock  prices are going and to hedge against the market's ups and downs.  </P></p>

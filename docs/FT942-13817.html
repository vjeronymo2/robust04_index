			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures touch five-year highs Coffee futures prices soared in London yesterday with the second position on the London Commodity Exchange hitting Dollars 1,545 a tonne at one stage - its highest point for five years. However dealers began to back off in late trading when the New York market failed to extend the gains made earlier and London closed at Dollars 1,493 a tonne, Dollars 9 higher than the previous close. The drawdown in stocks of robusta coffee - the coarser variety that is traded in London - has fuelled a surge in prices in the last few days. The arabica futures contract on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has been pushed upwards by London, but it was beginning to go off the boil yesterday. 'A lot of technicians are indicating the market here is a bit toppy and we haven't been able to take out resistance levels,' said Mr Bill O'Neil, softs analyst at Merill Lynch in New York. 'The next few days will be a key to determining the market's short-term direction.' Confusion among traders about Brazil's plans to begin the sale of its 17m-bag domestic stockpile, which were announced last week, has added to the market's jitters. Brazil announced it would sell 2.4m bags in this financial year, but it is unclear how the sales will be spread throughout the year. The government is also under pressure from growers to call off the sale. The tightness of physical supplies of coffee in the London market is putting a squeeze on traders with short positions, which is likely to support prices for some days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists and puppets on 26 and 27 April staged a provocative  joint aerial surprise attack exercise simulating a Northward  invasion with the skies above Yongwol, Umsong, Kunwi, and Yoju  in South Korea as the operational stage.    Pacific-based fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes,  vertical takeoff and landing assault planes, tanker planes, and  an early- warning plan, and flying groups of the U.S. Air Force  present in South Korean and the puppet Air Force, were massively  mobilized in this war exercise, which lasted for two successive  days.    The exercise was frenziedly staged under the command of an  E-3 early warning plane, which is called the air-flying command  post, with KC-135 tanker plane supplying fuel in the air. The  purpose of this war exercise was to ensure the unified command  of various attack airplane wings and to enhance combat-ready  capabilities for cooperative surprise attack between the U.S.  Air Force and the puppet Air Force.    On the other hand, the South Korean puppets frantically ran  amok with artillery firing and helicopter operational exercises  in areas close to the demilitarized zone [DMZ] in the military  demarcation line.    The armed helicopter groups, which were mobilized in the sky  above Paengnyon, Paju County, on 27 April, frenziedly staged a  missile strike exercise, and armed helicopters and transport  helicopters, which flew in the skies above Paju and Yonchon, and  areas in Chorwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, ran wild with  ground support exercises while making a low-altitude ultra  low-altitude flights.    On 26 and 27 April, large-caliber artillery groups of the  puppet Army in Chongda-ri and Yongsan-ri, Paju County, and  Oksan-ri, Yonchon-up, Yonchon County, and Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up,  Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province, fired more than  100 shells into spots near the DMZ in front of our eyes, thus  running amok with war frenzy.    These successive dangerous war gambles of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets timing to coincide  with the "Hwarang" war exercises involving 1 million and  hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians are further  straining the situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOKER ON A PEACE SHUTTLE;  </P> <P> THE JESTER AND THE KINGS A POLITICAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MAREK HALTER; TRANSLATED  BY LOWELL BIR (ARCADE PUBLISHING: $19.95; 288 PP.)  </P> <P> Talk is powerful. Through conversations, people make history. "The Jester and  the Kings" is an engaging autobiographical account of Marek Halter's efforts to  get Arabs and Israelis to talk to one another.  </P> <P> Halter, a Parisian artist, comes from a Jewish family who lived by the word --  printers who trace their trade back to Gutenberg. He grew up with the idea that  to be Jewish was to be just. His family escaped the Warsaw ghetto through the  sewers due to the daring of a Catholic friend and fellow member of his father's  printer's union. After the war, Halter, a young militant for socialist Zionism  and a budding artist, made his way to Paris.  </P> <P> And in Paris he stayed. Halter felt that the existence of Israel had now made  it possible for him to be a good Frenchman. "Now I was like others," he writes.  But it wasn't so easy. Zionism's success did not end anti-Semitism. It only  changed its forms.  </P> <P> Halter became part of the great reservoir of emigre Jewish intellectuals whom  France would honor as great Frenchmen, but never as Jews. Unlike many, he is a  proud and public Jew. In those early years after World War II, a Jew could  support the fledgling state of Israel and belong to what the socialists  understood as the great progressive march of history. The Soviet Union had been  one of the first to support Israel. As he marched in Paris' May Day parade of  1949, Halter recounts that the crowd cheered for the Algerians and the  Israelis.  </P> <P> The Six-Day War changed all that. The Israelis now occupied all the territory  that was originally to be partitioned into a Jewish and an Arab state. Israel  had proved herself a regional power. As Halter's account makes clear, it was a  power the world simply could not accept. The world could respect Jews who lived  by the word, but they were deeply uncomfortable when they showed themselves  capable of wielding weapons of steel. In short, when the Jewish state began to  act like all the others, the world turned its back in disappointment.  </P> <P> The denigration of Israel was most abrupt among the European left. Once a  progressive light to the nations, Israel became a pariah pioneer state. Halter  shows how much of the socialist community projected its image of struggle  against the dark forces of Western imperialism onto the Arab jihad against  little Israel.  </P> <P> And the country that made the most radical about-face was Halter's own. France,  which had been Israel's major military supplier, now turned her back on her.  While some French Jews were now proud to be Jewish, others squirmed in their  very skins. Jewish students, Halter recounts, were afraid to admit that they  had relatives in Israel. In the student revolution of 1968, Claude Lanzmann,  the producer of "Shoah" who had fought the Nazis as a teen-ager, was called a  "supporter of the fascist Zionists" by a French militant for being offended by  Fatah's violent posturing against Israel.  </P> <P> Halter and his wife Clara's frantic efforts to achieve peace were premised on a  simple proposition: that two nations in two states must share one land in  peace. He became the tireless go-between, the court jester who believed that  his naive dream of peace had power to persuade enemy kings that the time to  talk was now. With the traces of a lost civilization still on his tongue, he  was able to woo an initially mistrustful Prime Minister Golda Meir by breaking  into Yiddish. There is high drama, indeed sexuality, in Halter's promise of  conversation between enemies. Unfortunately, the promise is rarely consummated.  </P> <P> Halter's crusade took place between Israel's victory in the 1967 war and the  "earthquake" that brought Menachem Begin to power in 1977. His repeated  failures provide a cautionary tale for those who are now trying to succeed  where he did not. Halter failed because what the Arabs would say in private  they could not repeat in public. PLO members repeatedly denied having made  statements that the Halters had on tape. The whispers of peace began early. In  1969, Yasser Arafat and his top aides were willing to accept a two-state  solution in private, but not in public.  </P> <P> Halter failed because the Palestinians felt vulnerable when compared to the  Israelis, lived daily the humiliation of dispossession and occupation, and  demanded that Israel recognize their national right first before they  recognized Israel's. The Palestinians understood their refusal to speak to  Israel as their last and most potent weapon. He failed because Palestinian  radicals interrupted the conversation with terror against Israeli civilians and  Palestinian moderates. Thus Palestinian radicals massacred Israeli athletes in  Munich to help prevent an imminent conversation between Egyptians and Israelis  for which Halter had been the go-between. Because the conversation did not  occur, the Egyptians launched the Yom Kippur War. Arafat was always afraid that  Dr. George Habash and his Soviet-supported Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine would murder him for any moderation.  </P> <P> Halter's account makes sad reading, for it reveals just how much the situation  has changed and how the premises that might have brought peace even a decade  ago no longer seem to have the capacity to persuade. In Halter's world, it was  the Arabs who were most reluctant. Israel's elite -- David Ben-Gurion, Golda  Meir and Moshe Dayan -- were willing to talk to Egypt and even the PLO well  before Egypt or the PLO were willing to talk to them. Even as Menahem Begin's  minister of defense after 1977, Dayan still wanted to meet with Arafat.  </P> <P> Halter could speak independently to Arab and Palestinian leaders, and then make  his way comfortably through the corridors of the Knesset. He fervently believed  that once Arafat spoke the magic words accepting Israel and renouncing  terrorism that there would be a groundswell of Israeli support for territorial  concessions and negotiations with the PLO.  </P> <P> Shortly after Sadat made his triumphal visit to Jerusalem, Halter met with  Arafat and asked him to repeat Sadat's brave move.  </P> <P> "It's up to the Israelis to recognize us first!" Arafat reportedly shot back.  And what if Begin refused?  </P> <P> "Then hundreds of thousands of Israelis would demonstrate in the streets,"  Halter replied.  </P> <P> Today, Halter's dreams have come true. Except hundreds of thousands of Israelis  are not marching in the streets. Palestinians who support the PLO talk  regularly to Israelis, but the Israeli Knesset has now made it illegal for them  to talk to members of the PLO. In 1988, American Jews, including Los Angeles'  Stanley Sheinbaum, talked on the record to Yasser Arafat about his willingness  to accept Israel. Israeli and American Jewish leaders treated them as quislings  who had ventured beyond responsible political behavior. Israelis who are  willing to talk to the PLO have been either pushed out of their parties or  shoved to the margins of the power structure.  </P> <P> The PLO has officially recognized Israel. It took the intifada and sustained  Soviet pressure on the PLO radicals to do it. The Palestinians have played  their card. The move allowed the American government to begin official contact  with the PLO, discussions that Congress now seems determined to cripple. It now  appears that Israel will not begin the conversation until it is forced to. And  there is nobody in the wings that appears willing to even nudge Israel to the  table.  </P> <P> Halter's book explains why the words Palestinians have now spoken in public are  so important.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Rao puts rival in charge of riot-hit city INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, who is battling to rebuild his authority after months of bloody communal unrest, has sent Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, to take control of the local authorities in Bombay, the city which bore the brunt of the violence. Mr Pawar, who is from Bombay, resigned from the cabinet yesterday to become chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay. The move is being presented as an effort to bolster the state administration with a strong and experienced leader who has held the job of chief minister three times already. But Mr Rao's decision is widely viewed as an attack on Mr Pawar, who sees himself as a potential future premier.</p>

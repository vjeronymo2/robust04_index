			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Germans queue to see their Stasi files THOUSANDS of east Germans queued patiently yesterday to find out whether their acquaintances, friends or family members had informed on them to the all-pervasive Stasi security police. Mr Uwe Kussmann, an east Berlin house painter, and his wife Barbel were among the first to apply in east Berlin to see the file kept on them by the now-disbanded Stasi, or Ministry of State Security. The Kussmanns' repeated applications to leave East Germany in the 1980s were rejected, along with those of many other citizens. Both were harassed at their jobs and isolated by their workmates. Mr Klaus Lange and his wife Ulrike suffered the same treatment at work and were rejected by their colleagues. 'Everyone obeyed the Stasi in order to avoid complications,' Mr Lange recalled. Both the Kussmanns and the Langes said the past was not over for them. '(Erich) Honecker wants to visit his daughter and grandchildren in Chile, but I was never allowed to visit my grandmother in the west,' he remarked without bitterness. Mr Honecker, former leader of East Germany, was given refuge recently in the Chilean embassy in Moscow and would face trial if he were returned to Germany. Along with other east Berliners, outside an unmarked building in east Berlin's Behrenstrasse, Mr Gerhard Schroder and his wife Helene applied to see their files. The building houses the federal agency administering Stasi information collected on nearly 2m citizens. In 1964, the Schroders were looking forward to a visit from relatives in West Germany. A stranger approached Mrs Schroder while she was hanging out the laundry. 'He wanted to know all about our relatives. I told him he was cheeky and to mind his own business,' she said. From then on, Mr Schroder, who had joined the Communist party in 1961, had trouble at work as a mechanic for Interflug, the East German airline. He left the party in 1970. When an application by the Schroders for reunion with their relatives in the west was rejected in 1986, they stopped hanging the East German flag from the window of their flat on public holidays - an act of defiance that was reported to the Stasi. The Schroders now want to find out who informed on them. 'It isn't a question of seeking revenge. We simply would ignore the person,' he said. One east German who sought access to his file, a dapper man in his 50s with a moustache and gold-rimmed glasses, refused to give his name, saying only that he was a goldsmith by trade. 'The Stasi is still around so I have to be careful,' he said. He served seven months of pre-trial detention in 1984, on charges of helping someone escape to the west. Although the charges could not be proved, he said, he was forced to sell his home outside Berlin to the Stasi. He displayed photos of a luxurious bungalow with an outdoor swimming pool. 'I know that the man who is illegally occupying my house is a top Stasi officer and I want to get the names of the people responsible for my arrest,' he said.</p>

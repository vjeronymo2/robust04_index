			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Sheerness dockers vote for strike MORE THAN half of the 600 dock workers at the Port of Sheerness, on the Thames, the country's largest car and fruit port, yesterday voted to strike over a new contract of employment that will reduce their earnings by up to 10 per cent. The new contracts are designed to preserve jobs by making pay cuts rather than redundancies, which is the method most companies use if forced to cut their wages bill. Worst affected at Sheerness will be the 200 former registered dock workers who will lose up to Pounds 2,500 a year on salaries that were more than Pounds 20,000 a year. Their revised contracts at the port replace a two-shift system, which carried extra shift payments on basic pay, and introduces a more flexible roster obliging them to work 39 hours a week and to be available for work between 6am and 10pm for five days a week. Mr Steve Swords, a shop steward, said most workers objected to the new hours, which he said 'restored Victorian conditions'. Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive of Medway Ports, said: 'Everybody is taking a pay cut, including me. We have a highly skilled and productive workforce. We want to retain them but we have to be competitive.' It is understood that Medway Port's management has contingency plans to keep the docks open if there is a strike. Medway Ports was created in a management buy-out in March this year. The new shareholders included two thirds of the workforce. Cuts in pay have been relatively rare, even during the present recession, but in recent months radical changes in terms and conditions have resulted in reductions in pay for several groups of workers. Among these are: About 30 per cent of employees at London Underground will have their pay cut over the next few years under a new working plan. Staff at the new retail arm of South West Electricity will have their pay reduced when their terms of employment are switched from those negotiated centrally in the electricity supply industry to terms similar to the retail industry. Ninety workers at Middlebrook Mushrooms, a subsidiary of Booker, the food group, will have to work longer hours for no increase in pay, which the unions say is effectively a pay cut.</p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (21): Uncertainty slows activity - Italy / David Lane says the outlook is increasingly optimistic Lean pickings rewarded the efforts of investment bankers and corporate finance advisers operating in Italy's buy-out market during the three years of recession from 1991 to 1993. Figures from KPMG Peat Marwick show that only 15 MBOs and MBIs were concluded last year. While a slight improvement on 1992, it was only one half the level of activity recorded in 1990. 'Last year was awful,' says Paolo Colonna of Schroder Associati, who sees this year as one of transition. 'The economy is picking up, but the corporate sector and banks still have problems. The low level of completed buy-outs reflects this,' he says. Others are more bullish. Dante Razzano, Morgan Grenfell's managing director, believes that when the figures are extracted at the year-end, the total will be reasonable. 'There is a lot of activity at the moment, albeit few transactions are being closed.' Stefano Tanzi at KPMG Peat Marwick, which studies buy-outs, is also optimistic, noting that a dozen transactions were closed in the first half of the year. 'There are numerous operations in the pipeline. We expect an increase that could take the total as high as 25 this year,' says Mr Tanzi. Uncertainty is putting a brake on action. Italian managers and company owners are holding back on decisions until the political and financial situation becomes clearer. Many expected that the elections in March which led to a pro-business, right-wing government would stimulate buy-out operations. However, expectations of government decisiveness in matters such as privatisation and the adjustment of public sector accounts, and of measures to encourage innovative financial operations, have been disappointed. While economic activity has picked up sharply in Italy this year, with industrial production rising steeply and exports booming, significant problems remain unresolved. The continuing large public sector deficit and the enormous weight of accumulated public sector debt overhang the financial system. There is concern that inflation has not been tamed. Interest rates seem to be on a rising trend. 'The cost of money, now up to 12 per cent, is definitely a factor in making managers think carefully before deciding on a buy-out. They ask themselves about the direction and magnitude of future rate moves, and the answer is most uncertain in the present situation,' remarks Mr Tanzi. At the same time, the authorities are urging caution on banks whose non-performing loans have risen significantly over the past three years. Quality of lending has become an issue in bank boardrooms. This may explain why there are funds looking for transactions. 'There is a lot of willingness by serious lenders to provide money again,' notes Mr Razzano. Mr Tanzi also says that large amounts of finance are available for equity and debt. The downward trend in the average debt-to-equity ratio in transactions is possibly a factor in encouraging lenders. Protagonists in leveraged operations have become more cautious about debt during the past four years, and the debt-to-equity ratio is one half of the level recorded in 1990, though KPMG Peat Marwick report that debt-to-equity ratios are significantly above average in large transactions. Does the availability of funds but few takers mean an absence of significant opportunities in Italy? Investment bankers and corporate finance advisers do not believe this is so. Schroder Associati's Mr Colonna says that privatisation will continue to offer opportunities. 'Buy-outs will also arise when large groups are restructured and in the process of internationalisation,' he suggests. At KPMG Peat Marwick, Mr Tanzi says that changes in the ownership of family companies will bring many buy-out opportunities during the next decade. Mr Razzano at Morgan Grenfell has a shorter time scale. 'Next year Italy's buy-out scene will be very active,' he forecasts. All agree that pickings should be fatter in the future.  -------------------------------------- Italian MBOs/MBIs  -------------------------------------- 1990       30 1991       15 1992       13 1993       15 1994*      20  -------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Peat Marwick and estimate*  --------------------------------------</p>

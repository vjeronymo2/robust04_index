			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jim Hatton] </F>   [Excerpt] PHNOM PENH, March 7 (AFP) -- Government forces  have begun the long expected offensive against Pailin, the last  remaining stronghold of the extremist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and  a senior official here predicted Monday it would be captured  "very soon." The three-pronged assault was launched Saturday by  hundreds of troops backed by tanks and heavy weapons on the gem  mining center in northeast Cambodia on the border with Thailand,  the government official said.    The fighting was said to be fierce and casualties were  expected to be heavy, in part because the area is known to be  heavily mined, he said. "We cannot escape a lot of casualties.  We know that a lot of our soldiers will be killed or wounded,"  the official said. "But we must do this for the defense of  Cambodia. There is no other way to end the war with the Khmer  Rouge except fighting," he added. "We know the Khmer Rouge very  well. They talk this and they do that."    Government forces were attacking Pailin from the north,  south  and east, he said, while an elite unit of some 200 paratroopers  had been strategicly stationed west of Pailin to cut off the  guerrillas possible retreat into Thailand. Pailin is about 10  kilometers (six miles) from the border with Thailand. General Ke  Kimyan, the army's chief of staff, was personally directing the  assault force, the official said. "We will take Pailin very  soon," he said.    He did not specify the size of the assault force, but said  it  was larger than the contingent that had taken the Khmer Rouge  stronghold of nearby Anlung Veng last month.    Government troops attacking from the north had earlier taken  control of Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Pailin and  were using that as a springboard to hit the main target, he  said. Similarly, the force advancing from the south had earlier  captured Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away and were using  that as their base, he said.    The third force was advancing from the east along Road 10,  the official said. No casualty figures from the Pailin fighting  had reached the capital yet, the official said. But he said  more than 200 government soldiers had died in the battle for  Anlung Veng.    The government has denied reports that Anlung Veng has been  recaptured by the Khmer Rouge, saying they had made a strategic  withdrawal because of shelling and that the guerrillas had not  actually moved back into the city. Anlung Veng is some 230  kilometers (140 miles) to the northeast of Pailin, and is  unlikely to affect the fighting there. [passage omitted]</p>

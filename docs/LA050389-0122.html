			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> ALLERGAN NAMES BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS SPINOFF FROM SMITHKLINE NEARS  </P> <P> Allergan Inc. won't be spun off from its parent SmithKline Beckman Corp. until  this summer, but the Irvine eye- and skin-care product company has already  named its board of directors.  </P> <P> SmithKline, a Philadelphia pharmaceutical giant, plans to distribute shares in  its Allergan and Beckman Instruments Inc. subsidiaries to SmithKline  stockholders before SmithKline merges most of its operations with the British  firm Beecham PLC.  </P> <P> Fullerton-based Beckman created its board last year when SmithKline spun off  14% of Beckman's stock to public investors. But Allergan remained a wholly  owned subsidiary, so it had no board of directors until now.  </P> <P> Here is Allergan's nine-member board:  </P> <P> Chairman Gavin S. Herbert Jr., who joined Allergan in 1955, seven years after  his father founded the company. Herbert is also a director of SmithKline  Beckman and Beckman Instruments.  </P> <P> William C. Shepherd, Allergan president since 1984. He joined the company in  1966.  </P> <P> Richard J. Flamson III, chairman of Security Pacific National Bank. His other  directorships include Northrop Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.  </P> <P> William R. Grant, chairman of New York Life International Investment Inc. He is  also a director of SmithKline Beckman and Irvine-based Fluor Corp., and he is a  general partner of Amster &amp; Co., a risk arbitrage firm.  </P> <P> Harry C. Groome III, president of SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories, another  SmithKline subsidiary. He joined SmithKline in 1963.  </P> <P> Kenneth N. Kermes, executive vice president of corporate finance for  SmithKline. He is a director of Beckman Instruments.  </P> <P> Handel E. Evans, executive chairman of Walsh International, a supplier of  information services to the health care industry. He is also a director of  SmithKline.  </P> <P> Louis T. Rosso, president of Beckman Instruments.  </P> <P> Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beckman. He is also a member of the board  of Atlantic Richfield Co.  </P></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paramount poison pill decision likely today A US court is expected to rule today on the legality of the 'poison pill' provisions in the Dollars 9.7bn merger agreement between entertainment group Paramount Communications and the television cable company Viacom. QVC Network, a home shopping channel which has made a rival Dollars 10.6bn bid for Paramount, has asked the Delaware Chancery Court to throw out the provisions, which are designed to make it prohibitively expensive for QVC to buy Paramount if the agreed merger with Viacom collapses. The court can throw out the poison pill provisions if it rules that the merger agreement between Paramount and Viacom is not a strategic alliance, as the two com-panies contend, but a straightforward sale of Paramount to Viacom. QVC argues that if Paramount is up for sale, it should be sold to the highest bidder. In a separate move, QVC sent a letter over the weekend to the Paramount board claiming it had obtained the financing for its Dollars 10.6bn offer, and asking the board to begin negotiations. The Paramount board had previously rejected QVC's higher offer on the grounds that it was conditional upon QVC obtaining Dollars 3bn in bank loans. Wall Street analysts, however, believe that Viacom will triumph in the battle for Paramount. Late last week, Paramount's shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange as investors anticipated that the Delaware court would reject QVC's call to throw out the poison pill provisions in the Viacom-Paramount agreement. Analysts believe QVC's only chance of success is to significantly raise its own bid. Lee Iacocca, former Chrysler chairman, sold another Dollars 31m worth of Chrysler stock last month, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

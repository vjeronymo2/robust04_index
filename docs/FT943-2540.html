			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: Reading Once upon a time, many years ago, Len Deighton wrote some wonderful spy-thrillers which created romantic magic out of a dirty Cold War world - The Ipcress File, Billion-Dollar Brain and the rest of the 'Harry Palmer' books and films. Then he became a one-man industry, swapping from fiction to (rather good) non-fiction, and the peculiar charm disappeared. He was always readable, but he lost - or jettisoned - his romantic sub-text. Worst of all, Deighton got involved in an interminable series about a boring and middle-aged British agent called Bernard Samson. So far we have been given Game, Set and then (wait for it) Match; an historical Winter as a breather; then Hook, Line and Sinker. Now, God help us, we have Faith, which will assuredly lead to Hope and Charity in due course. Can no-one persuade Deighton to call it a day? The end of the Cold War, which has pole-axed most thriller writers, has meant nothing to Deighton. With Faith he is cheerfully harking back to 1987, and making much of the tensions in East Germany as glasnost gains ground. We have the same old cast of characters: Bernie's wife Fiona, who, in a deeply implausible plot device that straddled a batch of books, was a double-agent defector; his old Berlin pal Werner Volkmann; smoothie American colleague Brett Rensselaer; nubile and loving young girl-friend Gloria; Tante Lisl, now with a new hip, in her Berlin hotel; ancient bossman Silas Gaunt; youthful bossman Dick Cruyer; and the station chief in Berlin, Frank Harrington. All are utterly incredible. But they have a residual charm, and Deighton writes with a fluency which helps this nonsense slip down as easily as some of his carefully-described meals. Bernie is back with Fiona, worried about the kids and still in love with Gloria; Fiona is in need of treatment, even as she is rumoured for head of MI6; Bernie is beaten up more than can be good for a chap of his age; Werner is looking as suspicious as ever. Curious, but absurdity like this can grow on you. Faith, by Len Deighton. (HarperCollins, Pounds 14.99, 337 pages).</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Major deepens Tory divisions on Europe Mr John Major yesterday disowned all the central elements of the manifesto on which the Conservatives' allies in the European Parliament will fight its elections in June. Confirming the increasingly Euro-sceptic stance of his government in the approach to the polls, he said the Conservatives planned a 'distinctively British' platform. To the dismay of Conservative MPs on the pro-European wing of the party, Mr Major agreed with one of his party's leading Euro-sceptics that the manifesto of the European Peoples' party should be brushed aside. The Conservatives have formal links with the EPP, the alliance in Strasbourg which represents most of the Christian Democrat parties in the rest of the European Union. The EPP finances the offices at Conservative Central Office in London run by Tory members of the European Parliament. But in the Commons yesterday Mr William Cash, one of the MPs at the forefront of the anti-Maastricht campaign, urged the prime minister to disassociate the party 'from the EPP's call for a single currency, a European central bank, the social chapter and a common immigration policy'. Mr Major replied that the government was not obliged to accept those policies, adding: 'Nor will we.' His comments, however, brought private warnings from senior figures on the centre-left of the party that an anti-Brussels stance in the election campaign would risk a new split. One middle-ranking minister said he was 'appalled' by the tone of some of the government's recent statements. Mr Major attacked Labour for allegedly signing up to the 'centralising' policy of its socialist partners.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRYSLER ENDS EFFORT TO SELL SUBSIDIARIES  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. said today it has taken down the "For Sale" signs at its  defense, electronics and aerospace units that have been up since last December,  after receiving no acceptable bids for the companies.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Chrysler Technologies in Washington said Chrysler will instead  retain and nurture Electrospace Systems, Airborne Systems and Pentastar  Electronics, which he said are all profitable.  </P> <P> Chrysler sold its Gulfstream Aerospace division last March for $825 million,  after paying $637 million for the Savannah, Ga., corporate jet maker in 1985.  </P> <P> "We said at the time of the Gulfstream sale that Chrysler was not in need of  cash," Chrysler Technologies spokesman John Stellman said, adding that the No.  3 car maker currently has more than $4.3 billion on hand. "We didn't find  buyers so we are perfectly content to just continue owning them."  </P> <P> In light of military cutbacks, Chrysler will instead concentrate on reducing  the amount of defense business by those operations while increasing commercial  sales, he said.  </P> <P> "Looking at their potential profitability, it makes better business sense to  hold onto them than to discount the price," Stellman said, adding that while  these companies "don't interact" with Chrysler's vehicle business, "they don't  interfere with it either."  </P> <P> "Part of our ongoing plan has been to move into more commercial-type work,"  Stellman said. "We would like to increase that from 10% now to about 25% in the  coming years."  </P> <P> The three companies in Chrysler Technologies employ about 3,500 employees in  Texas, Alabama and Virginia. While Chrysler does not disclose profits of its  operating units, those companies posted $300 million in sales last year.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said Chrysler could still sell one or all of those companies  if it were to get a good offer.  </P> <P> "It's more that nobody decided to buy them," said David Healy, of Barclays BZW  in New York. "It's probably true that Chrysler is under no particular gun to  liquidate at this time since it does not have a cash squeeze. They've got more  cash than they have had for some time."  </P></p>

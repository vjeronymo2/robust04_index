			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Vachnadze under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Georgia"]    [Text] On 7 June Vice Prime Minister Teymuraz Basiliya  submitted the Republic of Georgia's state budget for the second  quarter of 1994 for parliamentary approval. The deputies  thought the submitted budget scandalous. Deputy Bakur Gulua  described the very attempt to propose such a budget for  parliament's consideration as immoral and insulting. Bitter  dissatisfaction greeted the point in the budget that speaks  about parliament's needs -- as little as 0.3 percent is set  aside for them. Dissatisfaction was also expressed with regard  to the sum reserved for the head of state's staff -- 0.7  percent. Little more than that was allowed for the entire system  of education. "We have no use for a government that counts  already worthless money in such an original manner," the  parliamentarians said in almost one voice. The din in the room  rose a notch when Basiliya gave even more totally unacceptable  figures for the deputies: 6 percent of the budget was earmarked  for the needs of governing the state and not more than 4 percent  toward the Defense Ministry's enormous demands.    "Enough of deceiving each other," Deputy Tengiz Kitovani  stated, and moved that discussion of the budget be postponed so  that the head of state, the prime minister, the vice prime  ministers, as well as the president of the National Bank and the  finance ministers, who are away on trips at the moment, could be  present.    The discussion of the budget will continue today.</p>

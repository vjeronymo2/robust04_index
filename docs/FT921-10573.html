			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says PM to blame for recession - Economy LABOUR MPs accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday of being primarily responsible for leading Britain into the longest recession since the 1930s. 'There is no question of doubt that this government caused the recession,' declared Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, as mounting pre-election fever brought the prime minister under the most sustained attack he has faced since taking over from Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Tory MPs rallied to Mr Major but were unable to prevent him from being halted in his tracks by the ferocity of the Labour onslaught. A deafening shout of 'Yes]' came from the opposition benches when the prime minister, as a preliminary to listing other countries whose economies are in trouble, asked: 'Did we cause the recession . . ?' Mr Major quickly recovered and scoffed at the idea that the government was also responsible for the recession in the US, Sweden, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. To government cheers, he told Mr Kinnock: 'If you believe that, you are certainly not capable of leading your party, let alone this country.' Downing Street officials later also rejected Labour's claims that the recession was the longest since the 1930s. Mr Kinnock opened the Labour attack by reminding Mr Major of his earlier comment that if the government's counter-inflation policies were 'not hurting they were not working'. The prime minister countered that the measures taken by the government had been designed to enable Britain to emerge from the recession in a way that ensured sustained recovery. He said Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, had told bankers on Monday that the conditions were now in place to 'underpin a sustained recovery'. Mr Kinnock said: 'This government caused the recession, continued the recession and now has not got a clue how to get us out of the recession.' The prime minister argued that if Mr Kinnock was 'genuinely concerned' about recovery he would not be advocating higher taxes, which would only worsen the situation. Mr Kinnock shouted: 'You put taxes up]' To government cheers, Mr Major insisted that Labour's policies would mean 'perpetual recession for this country'. Mr Steve Norris (C Epping Forest) condemned Labour's 'crazy proposal' for reviving the power of local authorities to fix the level of business rates. The prime minister gave an undertaking that the government would not permit a return to the former system under which councils had often increased business rates by more than the rate of inflation - something that could not happen now.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA)--His Eminence al-Azhar Grand  Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq has appealed to the United  Nations to adopt the necessary resolutions to stop the massacres  Serbians are committing against the Muslim citizens of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and refrain from rewarding the aggressor on  his actions.    In a statement he issued today, the al-Azhar shaykh called  on  Islamic governments and peoples to unite and back the efforts  Egypt and some Islamic states are making at the United Nations  to deter the treacherous aggression, return the lands the Serbs  usurped to their Muslim owners, and lift the arms embargo so  that the Bosnian people can defend themselves against an enemy  equipped with the most modern mass destruction weapons taken  from the former Yugoslavia and some other governments.    The al-Azhar grand shaykh expressed his pain and deep  concern  at the crimes being committed against Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina; the desecration of sanctities; and the  killing of old men, women and children. These crimes conflict  with the UN charter, the Declaration of Human Rights, basic  ethical values, and the human bonds that link the people of the  earth together, the statement said.    Jad-al-Haqq remarked that it is regrettable that this  unjustified aggression should involve Muslims, although they are  entitled to live according to their creeds and canons that  recognize others' right to live according to their own creed.  Islam reiterates that "there will be no coercion in religion,"  [Koranic verse] he said.    Concluding his statement, Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq prayed to Allah  to guide mankind to the right course and preserve Muslim blood,  land, and lives in Bosnia-Herzegovina and everywhere in the  world.</p>

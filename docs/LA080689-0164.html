			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEKS TO REMEMBER -- AND FORGET;  </P> <P> NAGASAKI: RELUCTANT ACTOR IN ROLE OF ATOMIC MARTYR  </P> <P> Cicadas hum furiously from the branches of a grove of cherry trees in a small,  simple park that marks The Spot. About 1,800 feet overhead, on a hot morning  like this one 44 summers ago, history visited Nagasaki with a horrific flash  and a boom.  </P> <P> The decades have passed, but Nagasaki still struggles to remember, to forget  and to get on with life.  </P> <P> Hypocenter Park is characteristic of the city's ambivalence about its past. A  casual visitor might stroll the length of it without noticing a sleek, black  monolith at Ground Zero, or see a nearby corner littered with an odd assortment  of nuclear junk. Signs identify the debris: a warped water tank from Keiho  Middle School, a mangled I-beam from Mitsubishi Steel Works, a ruined wall from  Urakami Catholic Cathedral.  </P> <P> The tale is familiar. Three days after the first atomic weapon was detonated  over Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, an American B-29 bomber dropped a second  nuclear device, a 22-kiloton plutonium bomb irreverently named "Fat Man," on  Nagasaki, taking more than 70,000 lives and hastening Japan's surrender in  World War II.  </P> <P> But the story of the atomic legacy left to the city of Nagasaki is more  difficult to grasp. Compared to Hiroshima, where twice as many people were  killed, Nagasaki's martyrdom is pensive and melancholy. Hiroshima has for years  boldly promoted itself as an international peace capital, and in the process  spawned what might be called "nuclear tourism," drawing more than 100,000  foreign visitors each year to its sprawling, elaborate Peace Memorial Park and  museum complex.  </P> <P> Nagasaki has followed suit, but somewhat reluctantly and on a smaller scale.  Japan's foremost Christian city, by dint of its association with Portuguese  traders and Roman Catholic missionaries in the late 16th Century, it has been  far less strident in its anti-nuclear appeal. People in this city like to cite  the aphorism: "Hiroshima in anger, Nagasaki in prayer."  </P> <P> Indeed, while Hiroshima is in the midst of a highly publicized campaign to  raise $1.5 million in donations to repair and maintain its signature "atomic  dome" ruins, Nagasaki is tearing down what remains of the scattered public  school buildings that survived the blast. Ostensibly, this is for safety  reasons, but many of the city's 450,000 citizens would seemingly just as soon  let go of the burden of history.  </P> <P> "Except for a few old people who survived it, nobody in Nagasaki really cares  about the atomic bomb," said Tokio Kankeko, 40, proprietor of a coffeehouse  near the city's Chinatown district. "People want to forget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favors the Wrecking Ball  </P> <P> Hirotake Ejima, 47, a local salaried worker, said he considers the bomb a vital  part of history but still favors the wrecking ball for the old school buildings  identified with the bombing.  </P> <P> "There's no denying what happened, but we should move forward with life," Ejima  said. "We're all for peace, but if you cling to the past, it's only going to  deepen the wounds."  </P> <P> For some, however, the wounds never will heal. Kazuko Nagase, 51, was 7 when  she was stunned by a burst of yellow light and saw her wooden house come  tumbling down on top of her. She escaped serious injury and was spared the  searing burns that disfigured many hibakusha, or atomic bomb victims. But she  has suffered from kidney ailments and other symptoms of radiation sickness.  Acute exhaustion has made it impossible for her to work.  </P> <P> "Today's fatigue carries through until tomorrow, no matter how well I sleep at  night," said Nagase, a tiny, stooped women with bow legs who for the last 14  years has lived in a special home for hibakusha run by an order of Catholic  nuns. "I think of the atomic bomb every day. If that hadn't happened, I  wouldn't be living like this. I've been waiting more than 40 years to get back  to normal again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distressed Over Plans  </P> <P> Nagase is distressed that city officials are considering demolition of the  elementary school she attended before the bombing, whose crumpled shell of  reinforced concrete was repaired after the war and made serviceable.  </P> <P> "If they take it down now, we'll lose an important thread," Nagase said. "There  won't be anything to teach the children about the bomb. I hope they'll keep it,  at least until I die."  </P> <P> Altogether, more than 300,000 people are believed to have lived through the  conflagration and radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, though thousands are  dying each year. The survivors' vivid accounts of death, chaos and panic  dominate remembrances each August, when Japan goes through a ritual of  re-examining the ghosts of World War II.  </P> <P> As the victims' wounds are symbolically reopened, appeals for global  disarmament are renewed. The country's splintered -- and extremely politicized  -- peace movement moves into high gear at this time every year, with rival  conferences and incessant resolutions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints from Foreigners  </P> <P> Foreigners frequently complain, as they walk away from the pacifist speeches  and the displays in the atomic bomb museums, that the Japanese seem to believe  that they were the war's primary victims.  </P> <P> Indeed, Nagasaki's outspoken mayor, Hitoshi Motoshima, 67, advocates shifting  the focus away from the "victim's consciousness" that permeates the  anti-nuclear movement here and instead asking what Japan did to invite  catastrophe.  </P> <P> "The truth is that when the atomic bombs were dropped, the people of the world  applauded -- it was revenge against Japan's brutal aggression," Motoshima said.  "The Nagasaki bomb has a lot of meanings, but one is that it all started at  Pearl Harbor and ended right here."  </P> <P> Motoshima, a Roman Catholic whose family is descended from Nagasaki's  centuries-old sect of "hidden Christians," gained widespread notoriety last  December by daring to say publicly -- in a speech marking the anniversary of  Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor -- that Emperor Hirohito bore some  responsibility for the war.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shattered Mood  </P> <P> The statement brought Motoshima a series of death threats, but it also  shattered a mood of restraint as Hirohito lay on his deathbed and underscored  the fact that the Japanese seldom seriously debate the causes of World War II.  </P> <P> "The Japanese have a philosophy of neglect. We say, 'Put a lid on something  that stinks,' " Motoshima said in a recent interview. "So more than 40 years  have gone by, and we've dealt with all this through nonverbal communication.  It's unspoken, and when it comes right down to it, the Japanese do not know  what war is. Nobody knows what we did."  </P> <P> People know what the Americans did, however. It is illustrated in graphic  detail in the small museum run by the city near Nagasaki's Hypocenter Park, and  on a grander scale in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. In the Hiroshima museum,  foreign visitors may listen to a recorded guided tour in which a sonorous,  British-accented male voice explains that the bomb was a "dreadful, genocidal  weapon." Among the exhibits is a glass display case containing ghoulish wax  figures of bomb victims, whose burnt skin is peeling off their hands and  breasts.  </P> <P> Both cities, understandably, have special peace education programs in the  schools to teach children about the horrors of nuclear war. But Fumio  Yamashita, 23, a civil servant whose job it was to guide a visiting reporter  through the Nagasaki A-bomb museum, conceded that he did not learn much about  Japan's own acts of aggression while in school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Silence on Causes of War  </P> <P> "There really isn't much talk about the war in peace education," Yamashita  said. "We didn't hear anything about what caused the war."  </P> <P> Right-wing elements in the national government, particularly in the Education  Ministry, meanwhile, are pushing a revisionist version of history that has  increasingly worked its way into the textbooks used in public schools. Among  the revisionist theories gaining credence is that the United States forced  Japan into war by cutting off its access to oil supplies.  </P> <P> At the same time, Japan's nuclear phobia shows no signs of abating. A furor  resulted in May with disclosures that an A-4E Skyhawk plane carrying a  one-megaton hydrogen bomb rolled off the American aircraft carrier Ticonderoga  off Okinawa in 1965. The plane and bomb were never recovered and are believed  to have sunk -- harmlessly -- in waters 16,000 feet deep.  </P> <P> Because the Ticonderoga later made a port call at Yokosuka, near Tokyo, critics  said the incident was solid evidence of a pattern in which the United States,  then and since, has routinely introduced nuclear weapons into Japanese  territory despite the "three non-nuclear principles" declared for Japan by  former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in 1968: not to produce, possess or store  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fresh Grist for Indignation  </P> <P> It has long been an open secret, confirmed publicly by former U.S. Ambassador  Edwin O. Reischauer, that American ships have carried nuclear weapons into  Japanese ports without first consulting with Japanese authorities, as required  under the U.S.-Japanese security pact. Still, the Ticonderoga incident provided  grist for fresh indignation, perhaps in that it exposed a predilection for  ostrich-like avoidance in Japan.  </P> <P> The government's position has been that because it receives no advance  consultation, it assumes that the United States is not introducing nuclear  weapons to Japanese waters or violating the non-nuclear principles. The United  States will neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard  ships.  </P> <P> Nagasaki's mayor, Motoshima, advocates giving some sort of legal status to the  "principles."  </P> <P> "We can't leave it vague forever," Motoshima said. "The government has got to  make efforts to clarify" how the protocols are in fact observed. "And once the  true situation is clarified, we must have realistic discussions on what is  acceptable."  </P> <P> Mayor Takeshi Araki of Hiroshima would go a step further: Let the cities of the  world take the initiative. Araki and Motoshima are currently co-hosting an  international conference of "Mayors for Peace," which coincides with the A-bomb  anniversaries.  </P> <P> "It's the cities and local governments that bear ultimate responsibility for  the safety and welfare of their residents," Araki said in an interview. "We  can't leave it up to nations anymore."  </P> <P> But asked what concrete actions these cities might take to ensure peace, Araki  was, in a word, vague.  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Italian coalition totters as Bossi pulls out The government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, looks almost certain to be brought down in a no confidence vote on Wednesday after the weekend defection of Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League. The fall of the eight-month-old right-wing coalition would initiate a highly unstable period of political bargaining. All the options for forming a new government are beset by serious unresolved problems and, in the absence of a new parliamentary majority, early elections could be called for next spring. After weeks of mounting dissension between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi, the League leader announced his formal break with the government coalition on Saturday. Mr Bossi said he was backing a no confidence motion to be proposed jointly with Mr Rocco Buttiglione's Popular party (PPI), the heirs of the Christian Democrats who dominated Italy's post-war politics until discredited by the country's spate of corruption scandals. Mr Bossi played down suggestions that his break with the government would split the League and leave him as head of a small rump of the movement. In recent days as many as 50 of the 163 League members in both houses have talked of staying with Mr Berlusconi. But Mr Bossi has proved an astute politician and it is significant that the League has not directly associated itself with two other motions of no confidence also being presented on Wednesday. One of these has been tabled by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the main opposition force, with which Mr Bossi has been in close contact. An open alliance with the PDS is still rejected by many in the League because of the former's communist past and its ambiguous relationship with Reconstructed Communism, which represents the hardline core of the old Italian Communist party (PCI). Reconstructed Communism has tabled a third motion of no confidence. These separate motions will have the benefit of allowing at least one trial run to test the compactness of the League vote and the scale of opposition to Mr Berlusconi. At the same time the three votes allow the League, as well as the PPI, to signal their distance from the left. Even if the League splits, it would be surprising if the anti-government bloc failed to muster the 316 votes necessary to bring down Mr Berlusconi - albeit by a slim margin. The present coalition consists of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the League, Mr Gianfranco Fini's neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, and two minor partners, the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD) and Radicals. Altogether the coalition has 368 votes in the chamber of deputies, of which the League accounts for 105. The PDS-led Progressives have 167, while the PPI has 33. The 39 deputies of Reconstructed Communism have said they will vote to bring down the government. The timing of Wednesday's no confidence votes still depends on completion of the 1995 budget's progress through parliament. On Saturday night the Senate gave its final stamp of approval. Delaying tactics could be used on the final budget sessions this week in the chamber of deputies by government supporters, thus postponing the confidence debate.</p>

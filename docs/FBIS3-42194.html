			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tharwat Shalabi] </F>   [Text] AL-AHALI has learned that several terrorist leaders  residing abroad will be handed over to the Egyptian authorities  in the near future in line with agreements recently signed with  several Arab and other foreign countries.    Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi worked hard to  conclude the agreements with these countries during a recent  Arab interior ministers' conference in Tunisia. The countries  with whom agreements were signed include a neighboring country,  a non-neighboring country that is suffering internal conflicts,  and a major Gulf country, which set the condition that the  agreement must not be made public in order to avoid terrorist  reprisals!    Following security negotiations with Egypt, Denmark arrested  Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, the most prominent al-Jihad leader abroad,  and several other leading figures of that organization. Some  Danish parliamentarians are opposing their being handed over to  Egypt, however, on the grounds that Egyptian law provides for  the death penalty, which these parliamentarians regard as  violating human rights.    Egyptian security departments have sent high-level  delegations to Afghanistan and Pakistan to sign similar  agreements. Domestic events in Afghanistan have held up talks  with that country.</p>

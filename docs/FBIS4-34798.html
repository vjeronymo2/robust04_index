			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Nancy Pazos in Quebec, </F> Canada]    [Text] Carlos Menem already has discovered a finishing  flourish for his tour of northern North America. At the White  House on 24 June, the president will announce to his U.S.  counterpart, Bill Clinton, that Argentina is willing to send men  to the Dominican Republic to reinforce controls at the Haitian  border as the Haiti Friends Club proposed in the United Nations.    Haiti was the first issue U.S. State Department people  included on the bilateral agenda for the meeting with Menem.  The United States is waiting for a definition of the political  situation of that country. Some people are speculating that if  the international embargo imposed against the dictatorship of  Raoul Cedras does not yield any results, the United States would  be willing to invade Haiti.    During the few breaks in their Canadian tour that ended in  Quebec, a city privileged by nature, Menem and his foreign  minister, Guido Di Tella, reviewed the stance that Argentina  will take on various issues. A sentence that echoed frequently  in the president's ears was: "Within the UN and OAS framework,  and within this framework alone, we are ready for anything."    Argentine joined the Friends Club two weeks ago, already  made  up of the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela and  coordinated by former UCR [Radical Civic Union] Foreign Minister  Dante Caputo, representing the OAS.    The Friends Club's initial measure involved canceling all  commercial flights (the only air connection with foreign  countries is Air France) and freezing the bank accounts the  Haitians -- and their closest relatives -- who participated in  the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide have in the  United States.    The Friends Club also fixed its eyes on the  Haitian-Dominican  border. It believes the international embargo might be evaded  through this 300-km-long border.    Menem actually does not have to resort to the announcement  to  demonstrate his siding with the U.S. stance. Our country  actually is the only Latin American country that supports the  maritime trade embargo with a corvette. Nevertheless, the  president had to make a showy gesture, and he is aware of the  fact that Haiti represents an obsession for Clinton.    In addition to the presidents, U.S. Vice President Al Gore,  Christopher Warren and Anthony Laker (the two Department of  State heads)n [name and title as published], U.S. Ambassador to  Argentina James Cheek, Guido Di Tella, and Raul Granillo Ocampo,  the Argentine ambassador to the United States, will meet around  the oval table in the White House.    Messages to finalize the details kept coming from the United  States on 22 June while Menem's entourage hurried to complete  its extensive tour of Quebec (that included a golf game with  Governor General Martial Asselin at the local Royal Club) on  time.    The president will arrive at 0930 today at the Sanford  airport in Maine. There he will be met by his "close" friend  George Bush (concerning Clinton, Menem on 22 June noted that he  and Clinton are "from the same continent"); Bush's wife,  Barbara; and Granillo Ocampo. Menem will travel with daughter  Zulemita; his personal doctor, Alejandro Tfeli; and his private  secretary, Ramon Hernandez, aboard a private jet loaned by an  unknown U.S. businessman who is a friend of Bush. The  presidential airplane Tango-01 will go on to Washington with the  rest of Menem's entourage.    Today's agenda already has been completed: Menem will play  tennis in the morning, have lunch, have some photographs taken  by journalists, and finally play golf. For dinner, before  leaving, Menem will contribute a selection of Argentine wines.    If everything goes the way he has planned, Menem's only  disappointment might be that he will not make a stopover in  Boston. Menem decided to watch the Argentina-Nigeria soccer game  on television from somewhere in the United States. Otherwise,  Box No. 134, which has been reserved for Menem, will be occupied  by Bush and Granillo Ocampo.</p>

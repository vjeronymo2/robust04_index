			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cut the waffle, just tell me the price  -SIB aims to reveal the true cost of investment products THAT A picture is worth a thousand words is the basic concept underlying the latest plans to make it easier for investors to understand what they are actually buying. The Securities and Investments Board, the City of London's chief watchdog, last week issued a consultant's report outlining proposals aimed at setting an easy to comprehend price-tag on some of the most sophisticated products consumers buy. Tim Miller, the consultant, has proposed that instead of viewing complicated tables showing expenses and projected returns, potential investors will be shown a graph. A graph for, say, a 25-year endowment would show the value of the policy in each year of its life, assuming three things: first, that you continue all premium payments; second, that you cash it in and suffer the effects of charges and expenses; and third, what investment returns would look like if there were no expenses and charges. The difference between lines number two and three represents the price-tag. This would clearly show that within the industry there are wide differences in just how much each product actually costs. The current SIB proposals on what people should be told before they buy a product have many shortcomings, Miller argued. Among these is the fact that the proposals, including the so-called 'key features document' intended to set out charges for investors, contains 735 words. Miller claims that his charts will cut the number of words needed to explain a complex product, such as a long-term endowment policy or a unit trust, by as much as 75 per cent. Miller, who is the former marketing director at M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest manager of unit trusts, makes several proposals on how the costs of unit trusts should be disclosed. These will provide less initial information than has been previously available and will eliminate the 14-day cooling off period during which customers are allowed to cancel their contract without penalty. However, Miller argues that investors will be compensated for this lack of information in other ways. Miller says that sales agents should be required to use 'forward pricing' in charging the customers. That is the price per unit on the morning following the sale agreement, rather than its price on the morning of the day on which the sale is agreed. Thus, if the stock market is surging, investors will pay more for their units but will be protected against at least some losses in a falling market. He also suggests a formula which has been much debated in the unit trust industry; that of showing investors a single price. Under the current system, three prices are displayed; offer, bid and cancellation. The difference between the offer price (at which investors buy) and the bid price (at which investors sell) represents the cost to the customer. Miller says that any confusion on cost which may arise out of single pricing is likely to allayed by his other proposal, which is to require companies to provide each customer with a prospectus. This would apply to unit trust as well as life insurance products and would spell out more clearly exactly what the charges are. Meanwhile, Miller considered but rejected two controversial proposals which consumer groups have been pressing for in recent years. He argues that both are essentially good ideas which would limit the sale of products to investors for whom they are clearly unsuitable, but says that there are practical difficulties with both. The first is 'unbundling', the separation of the investment aspects of an insurance product from the life protection element. Although products frequently carry the appellation of insurance, in fact the life insurance element makes up the smallest part of the premium paid. Miller says that although unbundling could be done in theory, it could make graphs more difficult to read and thus be counterproductive. Also, Miller considered, but rejected, the outright banning of the sale of certain combinations of products. In particular, he has his eye on home income plans, in which mostly elderly people are induced to take out a mortgage on their home and invest the proceeds in mortgage endowment plans. 'Certainly there would be far fewer cases of unsuitability if there were no endowment mortgages,' Miller said. However, Miller says that this would be tantamount to making repayment mortgages mandatory. But what would be wrong with that, many investors may well ask? After all, repayment mortgages are the staple product of the US mortgage market and that fact appears to have no adverse impact on home sales in that company. Finally, Miller suggests that when an investor comes face to face with a sales agent, the agent should be required to describe himself specifically as a sales agent, tell the investor who he works for and who pays him, and outline exactly what he is allowed to sell. It is difficult to believe that up until now, any other rules have been allowed to prevail.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / West to relaunch Bosnia peace plan: US, EU and Russia agree new drive Foreign ministers from the US, the European Union and Russia yesterday overcame deep internal divisions over Bosnia and settled on a plan to relaunch peace negotiations during a proposed four-month ceasefire. The ministers also reaffirmed an existing plan giving Bosnia's Serbs 49 per cent of the country with Moslems and Croats taking the rest. The parties to the conflict currently reject this arrangement, although they initially signalled acceptance. The apparent agreement took place in the shadow of a clash over Bosnia between the US and Russian legislatures over which side in the conflict should be allowed to receive weapons shipments. The Russian parliament yesterday urged President Boris Yeltsin to lift the arms embargo against Serbia unilaterally if any other country began sending arms to Bosnia. This was an angry response to a US Senate resolution supporting sales to the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo. The state Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 270-1 for the resolution, which also told the Russian government to seek a negotiated end to all sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro. Sharp differences over how to make peace in Bosnia have left mediation efforts in some disarray. The US has backed the Moslems in their reluctance to sign an overall truce which would consolidate recent territorial gains by the Serbs. The Russians, and to some extent the west Europeans, want pressure on the Moslem as well as the Serb side to accept a territorial compromise. The Russian parliament's move, which does not bind the president but carries moral weight, was in response to a vote on Thursday in the US Senate, which called for a unilateral end to sanctions against the Moslem-led Bosnian government. The twin votes brought Washington and Moscow closer to open confrontation over Bosnia, with emotion running high in both capitals. Supporters of the Bosnian government in Washington say it has been unfairly deprived of the chance to defend itself against a vastly better armed enemy. Even within the EU, there has been a struggle to co-ordinate policy over Bosnia. The establishment of a contact group in which the EU was represented only by Britain, France and Germany caused intense irritation in Italy and Greece, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency. As a compromise, yesterday's meeting in Geneva was also attended by Greece and Belgium, the current and previous holders of EU chair.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hermes forms alliance Hermes, the German credit insurance group, and Dansk Kaution, the Danish credit risk insurance company, have agreed a strategic alliance. The German company would pay about DKr105m (Dollars 16.1m) for a 20 per cent stake in the Danish company, while Dansk Kaution would acquire a 30 per cent holding in Hermes's Swedish credit insurance company for DKr12m, Dansk Kaution said yesterday. Dansk Kaution's articles of association, which prevent any one shareholder from owning more than 12 per cent of the company, must be changed before the alliance can come into force.</p>

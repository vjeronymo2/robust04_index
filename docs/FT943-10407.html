			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Straw snubs gang of four pact hopes Labour yesterday scotched any hope of an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats following recent calls from members of Britain's third party for closer co-operation. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, rejected any hope of a deal in spite of indications that Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader had attracted strong support among the Liberal Democrats. In the last week three of the 'gang of four' who founded the Social Democratic party in 1981 - Lord Jenkins, Baroness Williams and Lord Rodgers  -have welcomed Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader and said that his party is now a natural ally for the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Straw said that there was still plenty to choose between the two parties, and that Labour's ascendancy in the polls did not warrant any alliance with other parties. Mr Straw told BBC radio: 'It is a bit rich for the people who left the Labour party and then waged war on it for 12 years . . . to say 'the Labour party has changed and we would like to be welcomed back with open arms'.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, expressed concern earlier this week that the SDP's founders were starting a rapprochement with Labour. He refused to entertain any suggestion of a pact.</p>

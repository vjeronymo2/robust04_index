			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: Railway privatisation in Britain and Germany similarly flawed Sir, In his letter (January 29) Mr Godward correctly points to the simplicity of the German rail privatisation proposal which, by reducing the uncertainty among both train makers and would-be private train operators, is less damaging than the British one. Nonetheless, both plans are basically flawed in the very same way. By requiring the rail-track authorities to earn a commercial return on their assets, or at least to break even, both higher fares and line closures will become unavoidable, in contrast to the assurances given by the transport secretary, Mr John MacGregor. This not only puts the rail travelling public, already suffering from chronic under-investment in the rail system, at a further disadvantage. It makes rail freight uncompetitive ('SNCF hints it may sue over UK rail plans' January 29) and results in an overall loss of benefit. This is because natural monopolies, as is well known from basic economic theory, have to be subsidised, that is, sell their services at below average costs, in order to allocate them with economic efficiency. Of course, there are some gains to be expected from rail privatisation. As a number of both theoretical and empirical studies show, private enterprises are on average more cost-efficient than their public counterparts. The main reasons are that in the public sector there is more bureaucratic waste and managers lack incentives to employ cost-reducing measures. However, it is far from clear whether the benefits to be gained from increased cost efficiency can outweigh the loss of efficiency in allocating services. There is nothing wrong with running a railway along commercial lines once the overall goals have been formulated. But the goals themselves should not be allowed to be confused with those arising from commercial viability. As the Beeching experience from the 1960s has shown, the damage inflicted by a misguided railway policy might become irreparable.

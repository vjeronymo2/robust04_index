			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Three or more easy, democratic ways to reform the House of Lords Sir, Roland Rudd's article, 'Time to go, m'lords' (August 25), argues that there is no democratic alternative to outright abolition of the House of Lords. Yet as the article explains, the main problem is that peerages are determined largely by birth. So wouldn't the most appropriate response be to recruit peers on a more equitable basis? Ideally, perhaps, anyone who wanted to sit in the Lords should be given a peerage. Such a reform would be impeccably democratic. It would also offer prime ministers a wealth of talent from which they could select their cabinet ministers. Unfortunately, stricter selection criteria might be needed to keep down running costs. One solution, which is similar to Tony Benn's proposal, would be to offer a peerage to anyone who supported government policies. However, this would not be so democratic and there might be an insufficient number of applicants. The market solution would be to hold competitive auctions for peerages, which could become a useful source of public finance. Lloyd George is alleged to have experimented along these lines. A more modern approach might be to privatise the auctions so as to diminish the scope for political influence. But would there be enough MPs prepared to free the Lords from the dead hand of the state? My suggestion would be to set an age threshold for new peerages. Anyone reaching an appropriate age - say, 95 - would be automatically elevated to the Lords on their birthday. It would be interesting to see whether anybody noticed the difference.

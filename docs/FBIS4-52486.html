			<p>BFN     [Text] Accompanied by His Excellency [H.E.] Sok An, H.E.  Khieu Kanharit, and other aides, Samdech Hun Sen, vice chairman  of the Cambodian People's Party and second prime minister of the  Kingdom of Cambodia, arrived in Tokyo on 9 May.    That morning at the New Otani Hotel, Samdech Hun Sen granted  an audience to H.E. (Nishio) Watanabe, former chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party, who expressed his joy concerning the  positive developments in the Cambodian peace process. H.E.  Watanabe also expressed the firm hope that the current meeting  of the Socialist International Council would certainly welcome  the good experiences of national reconciliation and development  from the Cambodian delegation.    In his reply, Samdech Hun Sen conveyed the Cambodian  people's  gratitute to the Japanese people, who had helped the Cambodian  people sail across a difficult stage in their history. He  pointed out that although the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]  faces a great many problems that have piled up for more than 20  years -- especially the social, economic, and Khmer Rouge  problems -- the RGC is still optimistic about Cambodia's future.  This is because what is important now is that Cambodia's  problem is no longer a foreign conflict or intervention, but it  is only the concern of Cambodia.    Samdech Hun Sen also invited H.E. Watanabe, an activist and  a  pioneer in the construction of the Chroy Changva bridge [in  Phnom Penh], to visit Cambodia. The latter accepted the  invitation with pleasure.    That afternoon, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation visited  the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where he conducted research and study  on key mechanisms of a free-market economy.    In the evening, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation attended  a  reception in their honor by Japanese deputy foreign minister  (Azuma). H.E. (Azuma) expressed his concern about the  development of less than good relations between the Kingdom of  Cambodia and the Kingdom of Thailand, both good friends of  Japan. He voiced hope that the two countries would be able to  reach a wise and peaceful settlement.    For his part, Samdech Hun Sen informed H.E. (Azuma) about  the  view of the RGC, which believes that it cannot rebuild the  country by taking its neighbors as enemies. Therefore, it is  not the time for Cambodian-Thai relations, although tense in the  recent past, to be considered ruptured. The RGC will strive to  maintain its patience and preserve good relations with its  neighbors, thereby insuring regional stability    The reception was held in an atmosphere of joy and  cordiality.</p>

Ask Valerie Harper whose new  CBS series "City" beat her old NBC show "The Hogan Family" on Monday night.  </P> <P> Harper won a lawsuit against the "Hogan" producers after they fired her. But  will Harper's ratings victory continue through the season? The "City" debut  scored a 13.9 rating and drew a 21% share of the audience, barely edging out  the Hogan clan, which scored a 13.8 rating and 20 share. Each rating point  equals 921,000 households.

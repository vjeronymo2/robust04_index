"When one thinks that one-tenth of the world population,  concentrated in the G7 countries, consumes about two-thirds of  the available energy, it is easy to imagine what a destructive  effect the pressure of a growing population has on the  environment and rare resources," Ciampi said.    "If the developing countries go on, in an uncontrolled  manner, to achieve the same level of consumption as us, how many  other planets will we need in addition to Earth?" he added.    Environment ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Japan, Italy, and the United States are attending the two-day  meeting.</p>

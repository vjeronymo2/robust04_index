			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Swiss Bonds: Swiss Eurobond market finally in view SIR Siegmund Warburg must be chuckling in his grave. Only two decades after the City of London's great financial innovator tried to establish a Euro Swiss franc bond market, it is finally about to come into being. Warburgs' arrangement of a Swiss franc currency bond issue for the city of Copenhagen in the 1960s caused a huge outcry in Switzerland, where the 'gnomes' feared they would lose control of their precious currency. It also led quickly to a syndication agreement among European central banks restricting membership in bond syndicates in each European currency to locally domiciled firms. Any issue mounted by a foreigner in any currency other than the US dollar would be blocked by all the central banks. These provisions have gradually been relaxed in many European countries but, until now, they have remained strictly in force in Switzerland. The Swiss, it seems, got caught up in their own protectionist web. In the early 1970s, the government introduced stamp duties on securities as an easy way to raise revenue. That made it more expensive to issue and trade bonds in Switzerland than elsewhere but, for many years, when the Swiss franc was a very strong currency and the Swiss banks' placing power was awesome, it did not seem to matter. Foreign borrowers were happy to pay a premium for this service, and buyers, most of them Swiss institutions, were not much interested in a secondary market. In recent years, however, as markets in other currencies have become more liquid and competitive, the Swiss market has sagged. For a long time, the banks' entreaties to the government to remove the stamp duties were brushed aside as greediness. Last year, after it became clear that the government's revenues from the duties were declining, Bern finally agreed to act. In a referendum last September, a majority of Swiss agreed to the government's proposal to reduce some of the duties and to abolish others, notably those on bonds by foreign issuers. Of course, tax reductions never come into effect as quickly as tax increases, and it is only from April 1 that the stamp duty changes come into effect. That, in turn, finally cleared the way for the Swiss National Bank to loosen its rules respecting syndicates of Swiss franc bonds for foreign issuers. (If it had liberalised before the duties were removed, most of the syndicates would have decamped to London to avoid them, to the detriment of the Swiss financial centre.) The SNB was originally inclined to remove all restrictions on syndicate membership in line with European Community policy. But a few quick phone calls to its counterparts revealed that an 'anchor' strategy was still being applied in most European countries. That means that the syndicate lead manager must be locally domiciled. From April 1, that is what the rule will be in Switzerland as well. In practical terms, the changes will make the Swiss franc market more competitive for foreign borrowers. It should also improve liquidity, by repatriating some of the secondary trading that has already shifted to London to avoid the stamp duties. It will also be a relief to many of the extraordinarily large number of Japanese banks and securities houses with subsidiaries in Switzerland. Most of them have little hope of being a lead manager; now they can shut their expensive Swiss offices and participate in Japanese Swiss franc issues from London or elsewhere.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Boost for UN drive to cut costs of trade World trade could receive a sharp 'boost' from a UN symposium on trade efficiency to be held in the US next October, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said yesterday. The symposium will focus on the use of technology to encourage more companies, especially smaller ones, to enter international trade, and to cut the costs and paperwork involved in overseas transactions. These costs, currently estimated at around Dollars 300bn (Pounds 200bn) a year in global terms, could be cut by Dollars 75bn or 25 per cent within 10 years by simpler procedures and more electronic or 'paperless' trading, according to Unctad. The centre-piece of the symposium will be the rapid development of trade points, centres which bring all the services needed by exporters under one roof. Over 80 rich and poor countries now have or are planning trade points, which cost anything from Dollars 30,000 to Dollars 1m to set up. The centres bring together in one place government departments, customs authorities, chambers of commerce, banks, insurers, freight forwarders and other agents in trade transactions. Companies have access to computerised information on markets, potential clients, tariffs and trade rules and, from next year, to an electronic network linking trade points worldwide. Delegates from about 70 countries met in Geneva last week to make plans for the trade efficiency symposium, which will be held in Colombus, Ohio. The trade point in Colombus, inaugurated last month, is a 'virtual' trade point linking users and service providers electronically. Ms Elizabeth Shelton, who chaired last week's meeting, said yesterday that trade points had already proved their worth. In Algeria, the number of players in international trade had expanded from 20 to 2,500. Mr Torbjorn Blomfeldt, secretary general of Finpro (Finnish Committee on International Trade Procedures), said last week that a typical trade transaction involved 27 different parties, 60 original documents and 360 document copies. 'The procedures are so complicated smaller companies are hesitant to enter international trade', he said.</p>

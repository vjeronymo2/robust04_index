Li said he was pleased with the smooth development of Sino-  Japanese relations in recent years.    "Sino-Japanese relations have made satisfactory achievements  in every field of communication and cooperation," Li said.    "Cooperation in the economy, trade and technology has been  on  a track of steady development, with the volume of bilateral  trade hitting 35 billion U.S. dollars last year, which is a  result of joint efforts and symbolizes that Sino-Japanese  relations have entered a new stage," said Premier Li peng.    He urged that both countries should exert further efforts to  keep the momentum going.    "With the deepening of China's reform, and the growing of  China's huge market, the prospects for Sino-Japanese cooperation  is promising," Li said.    Tsutomu Hata arrived in Beijing this afternoon.    Li said Hata's two-day official visit to China will  certainly  strengthen Sino-Japanese relations.    "The purpose of reform is to develop productivity, and  enhance people's living standard," Li said when briefing Hata on  China's reform.    The years of practice had indicated that China had paid much  attention to and was able to deal properly with problems arising  in the process of reform and development, Li said.    "Whenever we are to adopt a new measure, we always take into  consideration the endurance capability of the country,  enterprises and people," Li said.    When talking about the Korean peninsula, Li emphasized that  China supports the non-nuclear proposal and stability and peace  there, and hoped the nuclear problem of the peninsula would be  resolved through negotiations.    "We oppose any coercive way or embargo, which will  inevitably  make the problem more complicated," Li said.    Hata said Japan was satisfied with the current Japan-China  relations, and expressed admiration for China's rapid economic  growth.    Hata held that China's reforms are of great importance to  Asia and the Pacific region.    Hata told Li that though a new government now ruled in  Japan,  the policy of Japan-China friendship will not be changed.    Li extended through Hata his invitation for Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa to visit China.    Hata said prime minister Hosokawa was looking forward to  touring China soon.    Among those also taking part in the meeting were Deputy  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and other high Chinese  and Japanese officials.</p>

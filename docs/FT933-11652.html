			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Daimler to make New York debut in October TRADING in Daimler-Benz shares on the New York Stock Exchange - the first German stock to be listed there - will start on October 5, the automotive-based technology group said yesterday. The listing, as expected, will be in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Citibank, the main subsidiary of Citicorp, has been appointed depositary bank. The move was a further commitment to internationalisation, the company said. It follows listings in 1990 in London and Tokyo, and in Paris in October 1991. It also gives Germany's biggest industrial concern access to the world's largest capital market at a time when domestic sources are strained. Together with plans to build the group's first US vehicle works, the listing is also an important image-building move in the world's largest car market. Last year, Daimler's US sales reached DM13bn - some 13 per cent of the group total - through 27 group subsidiaries employing 13,000. The group started negotiations over a listing more than a year ago, together with other leading German groups - including chemicals concerns with considerable business interests in north America. However, the other companies pulled out of the talks because they were not prepared to meet transparency requirements demanded by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to one senior official, the compromise reached with Daimler did not entail an 'unconditional surrender' by the German group. For the current year, Daimler will adapt its accounting methods to 'meet the expectations of the international investment community,' it said yesterday. Daimler shares have previously been traded in the US by various banking institutions issuing their own unsponsored ADRs.</p>

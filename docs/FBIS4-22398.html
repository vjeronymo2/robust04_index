			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [IATs-NOYAN TAPAN report: "Will Armenian Side Respond to </F> Chinese Initiative?"]    [Text] Contacts are currently underway between the Republic  of Armenia Ministry of Energy and Fuel and representatives of  the People's Republic of China [PRC] on the matters related to  development of the power generation industry in Armenia, in  particular, hydroelectric power generation. Under consideration  now is the possibility of acquiring power generation equipment  for small GES's [hydroelectric power stations] (NOYAN-TAPAN  comment: Small GES's have generating capacity between 100 kw and  10 MW.) The PRC is the world leader in terms of the number of  micro- and mini-GES's and has considerable experience in making  equipment for them.    Liu Xueli, first secretary of the PRC Embassy in the  Republic  of Armenia in charge of economic issues, said in an interview to  a NOYAN-TAPAN correspondent that Chinese equipment for small  GES's is of good quality and inexpensive. The PRC has exported  it to many countries of the world: Italy, the United States,  Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, India, and so on. In the initial  development of its power generation industry, China built in  parallel large thermal power generation stations and small  GES's. In the 1960's, when China also experienced a shortfall of  electric power, the state provided incentives for construction  of small GES's and small thermal power stations. The Chinese  government exempted those who built small power stations from  taxes. Only then did the state concentrate its efforts on  building high-capacity GES's. In addition to money invested by  the state itself, international credits are used in construction  of these objects. Keeping in mind the geographic peculiarities  of some regions in China--first and foremost in the west and  south, where there are high mountains and many  rivers--construction of small GES's is very profitable. "I have  to point out that analogous geographic conditions exist in  Armenia. And Armenia's current situation (the blockade and other  difficulties) draw one's attention to hydroelectric power  generation. I believe that construction of GES's is necessary in  order to develop Armenia's energy sector," said Liu Xueli.    As it turned out, the Chinese side has already submitted to  the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Energy and Fuel concrete  proposals on deliveries of equipment for our small GES's. These  proposals will be studied by the Armenian side. Will the  Armenian side respond to the Chinese initiative?</p>

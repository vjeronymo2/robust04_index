			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Israel to sign energy contracts with Arab neighbours ISRAEL says it is in the process of agreeing multi-billion dollar energy projects with Arab partners which will revolutionise its domestic energy sector. It claims that the agreements will mark a turning point in economic relations between Israel and the Arab world. Israeli officials and businessmen say Israel will sign an agreement with Qatar within the next six weeks to start work on a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) natural gas project which involves the supply of natural gas to Israel, and the use of Israel as an export terminal for Qatari gas across the Mediterranean to Europe. The project was said to have been agreed during secret talks in New York and Qatar in August and September followed by three meetings in Israel. Qatar, which has not confirmed the deal, could face regional hostility to any such agreement, in particular from Iran. Ten days ago, the two countries formed a joint committee to liaise on the development of oil and gas projects. Iran remains bitterly opposed to Israel and to the peace deal struck with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. At the same time, the Israeli Merhav group of companies, owned by Mr Yossi Maimon, said it had agreed a Dollars 950m joint venture with a private Egyptian company - the biggest Israeli-Arab joint venture by far - to build an oil refinery at the Egyptian free trade zone of Alexandria. The project is said to have been authorised by the Egyptian national investment authority. Both projects, which are dependent on favourable feasibility studies, have been the subject of secret negotiations for months but were accelerated by the Israeli-Palestinian outline peace agreement signed in Washington last month. Israeli officials and businessmen say the two projects mark the beginning of a 'New Middle East' where Israel will emerge as a main business partner and a regional centre for Arab trade to Europe. According to Israel, Qatar has pledged to supply the Israeli market with natural gas for 25 years. Israel needs 6.7m tonnes of oil equivalent a year to convert its electricity generation from coal and oil to gas. Israel is also looking for cheaper sources of energy to supply its petrochemicals industry in the Negev desert. Qatar is said to have agreed to pay Dollars 1m for a feasibility study which would look at a number of options. One is to build a gas pipeline from Qatar to the Israeli port of Ashkelon, where Qatar will also construct a gas liquefaction plant. Another possibility would be to ship gas to the Israeli Red Sea port of Eilat and then by pipeline to Ashkelon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Donaldo Torres Argenal] </F>   [Text] Petroleum-importing companies have threatened the  government with discontinuing purchases of oil; therefore,  rationing could result beginning 6 June if fuel prices are not  deregulated.    According to sector businessmen, ever since the Economy  Ministry made the decision to freeze fuel prices, they have been  registering losses amounting in the millions.    Augusto Gigerbaud, manager of Distribuidora de Productos  Derivados del Petroleo (DIPPSA) [a petroleum byproducts  distributing company], has said if government officials do not  reply to them within the next 48 hours, fuel rationing will  commence nationwide beginning 6 June.  <H5>  They Demand the Government Take Measures </H5>   Gigerbaud has added they can no longer register such losses;  therefore, it is necessary for the government to take immediate  and extreme measures. Either our cost of the product is taken  into consideration, or they must sacrifice their profit margin,  he has said.    As to the freezing of fuel prices, the businessman has  termed  the measure as arbitrary and dangerous, due to the repercussions  that could adversely affect importing companies.    Gigerbaud has reiterated the measure is arbitrary, because  whenever the government has asked us to make a sacrifice or  help, we have agreed to do so.    In this regard, the businessman has said that before  President Carlos Roberto Reina made his presentation via  television to mark his first 100 days in office, a member of his  economic cabinet had called them three days before requesting  that fuel prices not be increased.    Gigerbaud has said they are often asked to do this type of  favor, and this is why they consider it unjust for the  government not to make the correct decision, thereby creating a  crisis.  <H5>  Texaco and Esso Will Join </H5>   The DIPPSA manager has said he is certain the multinational  companies Esso and Texaco will also agree not to continue  importing petroleum and to initiate rationing.    They cannot continue to support losses in the millions, as  it  is occurring with us, because these losses already total in the  millions, the businessman has said.    EL PERIODICO has wanted to find out the opinion of the  representatives of the multinationals, but the security  personnel of both companies only stated the executives did not  want to disclose any information, adding they had been ordered  not to allow any members of the media inside the installations.  <H5>  The Government Does Not Know How To Handle the Petroleum </H5> Sector    Meanwhile, Henry Arevalo, DIPPSA executive president, has  said that by freezing the prices of petroleum byproducts the  government is demonstrating it does not have the capability to  handle the petroleum sector. It has changed its petroleum  policy several times within two months  <H5>  A Crisis Draws Near </H5>   According to Arevalo, these measures demand too much a  sacrifice from them, cornering them to the extent they can no  longer support these losses. Thus, the companies can no longer  export petroleum. [sentence as published]    Arevalo has warned that if the situation persists, a large  crisis could be created in the fuel supply, and the government  would be solely responsible for not taking the correct measures.    He has said if additional purchases of petroleum abroad are  not confirmed within the next three days, they will have to  start rationing to stretch their inventories. Consequently,  alarming situations will be produced.    Arevalo has reiterated that, until the government assumes  its  responsibility, they will no longer continue to import fuel.  This would force the public sector in turn to supply the demand  for which it does not have the capability.    The businessman has explained they do not wish to cause  additional problems for the current administration; to the  contrary, they would like to cooperate in every way possible so  as not to adversely affect the community.    The only thing at which the government measure is aimed is  not allowing them to recover their investment in importing  petroleum. To recover the investment, fuel prices must be  deregulated, because the value of this sector on the  international market continues to rise, Arevalo has said.    In conclusion, the businessman has said the government's  problem is "it starts to look for medicine when the patient is  already in a coma."    [Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish on 4 June 94 on page 1,  in a similar item, adds: "Economy Minister Delmer Urbizo Pating  has warned the government will not negotiate anything under  pressure, given the importers' decision not to continue the  supplying of fuel. The minister has added that based on advice  from a consultant of the World Bank, the price of fuel will be  negotiated with the petroleum importers."]</p>

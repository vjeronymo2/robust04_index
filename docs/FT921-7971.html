			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Ukrainian leaders see little future for CIS SENIOR Ukrainian leaders believe the Commonwealth of Independent States is doomed as an effective long-term force and will have only a 'transitional' function in enabling the states of the former Soviet Union to go their own way. Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, said the CIS was a 'form which helps the states of the former Soviet Union go through a divorce process'. The CIS, he said, was 'on the edge of a precipice' and he accused Russia of seeking to re-establish union structure. 'Under the cover of co-operation, they really wish to govern.' Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, chief political adviser to the Ukrainian president, said the meeting of CIS heads of state in Minsk last Friday 'decided nothing' and held out little hope that more definite decisions would be taken at their next meeting in Kiev in March. Prof Volodymyr Vasylenko, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian government, said the Ukraine would seek to avoid an open rift before 1994, the deadline for removing all nuclear weapons from the republic. The Ukrainian view of the Commonwealth as an institution designed for breaking apart rather than working together is at odds with that of other member states and could influence western policy towards the former Soviet Union. Western anxieties have already been raised by the deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia, the two largest CIS states. Military tension between them has risen after six bombers were flown from a base in Ukraine to Russia and Ukraine retaliated by taking over a strategic bomber base near Kiev. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukrainian president, speaking in Kiev to foreign journalists yesterday, again attacked his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, for announcing a reduction in nuclear weapons in Washington earlier this month without reference to the presidents of other states of the CIS and demanded consultation in the future. 'I am not against a reduction of nuclear arms but it must be founded on reality. We must know how the reduction will be carried out, in what stages,' he said. Ukrainian officials assert their republic's intention to apply for membership of the Council of Europe and ultimately the European Community as an independent state. Mr Pliushch said that he 'resented' the fact that Russia was seeking to negotiate with European institutions on behalf of other CIS states. Mr Mykhalchenko said of Mr Yeltsin: 'The leader of Russia says one thing at breakfast, another at lunch and a third at supper. This is impossible.' Mr Kravchuk said that while he would not describe Russia as imperialist there were 'imperialist forces within its government.'</p>

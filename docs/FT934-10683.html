			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Marketing practice far from perfect - Kate Atchley says recent research reveals that many firms are still not meeting client needs and expectations TO 'understand your clients if you want to succeed' has become something of a platitude with which few practising accountants would argue. By now they can be expected to have nurtured the necessary client-centred approach. Or can they? Research carried out recently by Kato Communications and Gilchrist Practice Development Consultants shows accountancy practitioners to be way off the mark in understanding many client needs and attitudes. The results deserve close attention, because the firms likely to succeed in the medium term will only be those which are effective in narrowing the gap between clients' expectations and clients' experience of the services provided. The Kato survey* polled a sample of smaller and medium-sized firms registered with the chartered accountancy institutes in England, Wales and Scotland, and excluded sole practitioners and the largest 20 firms. They were asked about their clients' views of their services. Gilchrist posed the same questions to clients themselves: typically companies with turnovers in the range Pounds 500,000-Pounds 2m. The area generating the most striking disagreement was over fees. Accountants rate reasonableness of fees as a top priority for clients: 98 per cent said this was very important or important to their clients. But only 47 per cent of clients agreed, arguing instead that fee levels are not fundamental to an assessment of their accountants. Even so, when clients were asked about fees, only 9 per cent rated their accountants as 'good' or 'very good' in setting reasonable fees. Dissatisfaction with fees has been exacerbated by the economic downturn and growing competition from firms willing to undertake work at cut-throat prices. None the less, it presents a serious credibility threat for firms and deserves careful attention. The first step is identifying client attitudes to fees charged by the practice concerned. The survey offers some useful clues to reducing clients' dissatisfaction with fees. For instance, 43 per cent of clients said they were unsure how fees are compiled - while just 23 per cent of the accountants thought clients needed more help in this respect. Accountancy practices often apply double standards. They look for near-certainty from their own suppliers in respect of future charges; but they construct all kinds of fanciful reasons why they should not honour their own clients' preference for the same level of certainty. To be successful, firms should put an end to unnecessary obfuscation of fee levels and the compilation of bills when dealing with clients. They could adopt monthly billing and improve their cashflow as a consequence. The survey showed that 45 per cent of clients would prefer their accountancy costs to be spread more evenly throughout the year. Estimates could be provided routinely for compliance work, with a clear specification of the work expected to be undertaken for the given fee. However, this will only solve part of the problem. While the audit continues to be perceived as a low-value service, clients will want to buy as cheaply as possible. Why do some firms appear to experience little or no resistance to their fees? Our best guess is that these accountants are succeeding where most are failing - they are delivering a responsive and proactive service to their clients. Unprompted, 31 per cent of clients said that they wanted their accountant to be more proactive - to offer new ideas and to use more imagination when analysing their business. Surprisingly, a mere 0.2 per cent of the practitioners, again without prompting, said that this was what clients were looking for. Closing this gap between client and accountant is going to be tough for the average firm. But successful attempts to get 'on side' is bound to improve clients' sense of receiving value from their accountant, and to ease fee dissatisfaction. This will not be simple to achieve. Many firms have reduced the number of senior staff during the recession; and partners have client lists too long to consider personally the individual needs of each as fully as they might wish. Again, the firms which produce creative solutions to this conundrum will be ahead in a few years' time. Delegation and inculcating a client-centred approach throughout the firm can help a great deal. The picture is not all bad, however: 95 per cent of clients said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services they received, which closely matched the accountants' estimate of 90 per cent satisfaction. More than three-quarters of clients rated their accountants good or very good on issues such as rapport, accessibility of staff, technical expertise and responsiveness. Good rapport came out top with a 91 per cent rating, which augurs well as a starting point for those partners determined to achieve greater client satisfaction. This reinforces the maxim that 'people first choose people'. Clients choose accountants first and foremost if they regard them as people they will feel comfortable working with. It is no great surprise to find them happy with the rapport achieved. That said, the profession does seem to be slipping up in some mainstream areas: only 64 per cent of clients were satisfied or very satisfied with tax advice received, and 62 per cent with general business advice. These responses appear to be linked to the call for a more proactive approach. Tax planning advice may need to be resuscitated, after declining in prominence during the recession and because many tax options have been closed in recent years. Everyone is looking for better value for money. Both the accountants and the clients were asked to identify improvements which would achieve this. Aside from a more proactive service, 38 per cent of clients called for greater clarity about fees; and 10 per cent for more contact. Surprisingly, only 1 per cent of accountants saw improvements as a result of greater contact. But they indicated that spending less time on regulatory and compliance issues would help them concentrate more effectively on their clients. Many complain of the pressures imposed by the regulatory authorities, growing competition between accountancy firms, rising bad debts during the recession, and the inability or unwillingness of clients to pay for services during periods of low profitability. What are the lessons? No matter how the economic and professional climate changes, a firm's best course lies in finding out what the client wants and seeking to deliver it to the best of its ability. There may be scope for altering clients' expectations, but good practice development (alias marketing) consists of doing the right thing. Equally, accountants are not using their clients sufficiently to generate new work. We found that 91 per cent of clients would be happy to recommend their accountant to other businesses if asked to do so. Among the accountants, 41 per cent claimed that they had asked their clients to pass on a recommendation. But just 5 per cent of clients had got this message. It seems that the scorekeepers are being too modest for their own good. *The writer is managing director of Kato Communications.

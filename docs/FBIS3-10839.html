"The two economies complement each other quite well. Many  Venezuelan products -- for example, oil, iron, steel, and  aluminum -- are needed in the PRC, while some of our light  industry products could find a good market in Venezuela," Liu  has said.    In an effort to strengthen bilateral trade, both governments  are seeking ways to sign new economic cooperation agreements  that establish a legal framework for an economic exchange.    Within the framework of the consultation mechanism, the two  parties have discussed issues of bilateral interest to  strengthen Beijing-Caracas ties. They have also talked about  the internal situation in both nations and mutual support at  international organizations.    The meeting was attended by Deputy Foreign Minister Roy  Chaderton, International Policies Director Demetrio Boersner,  Vicente Vallenilla, international economy and cooperation  director, as well as other high-ranking Foreign Ministry  officials. The PRC delegation was led by Vice Foreign Minister  Liu, Liu Guo Xing, director of Latin American Affairs at the PRC  Foreign Ministry; and Huang Zhiliang, PRC ambassador to Caracas.    Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli received Liu at the  Yellow House following the meeting.</p>

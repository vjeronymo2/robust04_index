			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, Jan. 30, IRNA -- The Islamic Salvation Front  (FIS) Sunday dismissed the appointment of the defence minister  as the new head of the Algerian regime as "insignificant," and  said days of the military-backed regime were "numbered."    Algeria's High State Council Sunday named General Liamine  Zeroual, defence minister for the past six months, as head the  new regime after the collapse of last week's national conference.    "For us the issue is of no importance. The regime has lost  its last card after the failure of the national conference. The  regime is now politically bankrupt," a spokesman for FIS,  Yousuf, told IRNA by phone from Germany.    The official FIS spokesman in Europe Rabeh Kabir, who lives  in exile in Germany, was not available for immediate comments on  the naming of General Zeroual.    He will replace the High State Council which was set up by  the military two years ago after the cancellation of elections  in the wake of a landslide victory for FIS.    The appointment of General Zeroul implies that the army  wants  to continue its role as the main decision maker in Algeria.    In a separate statement, faxed to IRNA sunday, FIS blamed  the  regime for the killing of a leader of the Islamic Hamas [Islamic  Society Movement] in Algeria professor Mohammad Bouslimani.    "The world should know that this regime has lost all  justification for its existence and its days are numbered.  Hence it took recourse to assassinating professor Mohammad  Bouslimani as a ring in the shameless chain aimed at making  Islamists hit each other," said the Arabic statement Nr. 10.    It said "FIS strongly condemns and denounces this  assassination and all of its kind," and added that there is no  solution to the crisis except by "responding to the demand of  the people to choose its rulers and to the right to live under  the shade of an Islamic state."    Last Tuesday's national conference held near Algiers was  seen as a last ditch move by the regime to preserve its illegal  rule. Major political parties boycotted it and the 2-day meeting  ended in failure when former foreign minister Abdel-Aziz  Bouteflika refused the post for the presidency.    The Islamists in Algeria are struggling to create an Islamic  state after they were robbed of certain election victory by the  army in January 1992.    The regime banned FIS and imprisoned thousands of Islamists.  Nearly 2,000 Islamists, security personnel and other citizens  have been killed in the violence.</p>

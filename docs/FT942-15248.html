			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Treasury retreats on CGT measure The government said yesterday that individual taxpayers could continue temporarily to take account of inflation when calculating losses for capital gains tax purposes. The change could benefit higher rate taxpayers by up to Pounds 4,000. The government's retreat on one of the most unpopular measures in the November Budget follows pressure from Conservative backbenchers and angry private investors. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, has put forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to give 'transitional relief' to individuals caught unawares by his Budget measure to end, with immediate effect, the indexation of losses. Before the Budget, companies and private individuals were able to adjust capital gains and losses for inflation. The Budget continued to allow indexation of gains. Yesterday's concession will apply to individuals and trustees but not to companies. Investors will be able to use indexation to create or increase losses by up to Pounds 10,000 on sales between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995. A higher rate taxpayer who used the maximum allowance would save Pounds 4,000. Mr Nick Brown, a Labour front bench Treasury spokesman, said yesterday's move was 'an attempt to buy off the protest of fairly well-to-do widows and orphans'. Individuals can report total capital gains of up to Pounds 5,800 per year without paying capital gains tax (CGT). The Inland Revenue estimates 125,000 taxpayers will pay CGT for the 1993-94 tax year, and projects CGT receipts of Pounds 1bn from individuals. Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield of accountants Touche Ross said: 'The private investor will be thankful for this small mercy which is probably as much as can be realistically expected given the government's stated intention to crack down on what it sees as avoidance and raise revenue.' The Inland Revenue said the indexation allowance for losses had been 'widely exploited for tax avoidance purposes by both companies and individuals'. It estimated that without the Budget change, the Treasury would lose Pounds 3bn a year by the end of the decade. It puts the cost of transitional relief at Pounds 45m. The original Budget proposal to scrap the indexation of capital losses is understood to have been one of the main points raised with Mr Clarke by Conservative MPs serving on the finance bill committee. Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, said yesterday MPs were still concerned that removing indexation was a 'blunt instrument'. They hoped that a more sophisticated way of stopping tax avoidance could be found. He welcomed yesterday's measure but said some Conservative MPs had hoped for a higher indexation allowance. Mr Brown said the amendment did not tackle the principle of whether to withdraw indexation of capital losses. He said it 'merely provides a small transitional relief'.

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Satellite contract faces challenge GENERAL Dynamics of the US may dispute the award of a contract last week to Arianespace of Europe to launch Indonesia's Palapa C-1 satellite system in 1995. The award of the contract, worth an estimated Dollars 160m (Pounds 107m), by the private Indonesian company Satelindo, took industry officials by surprise. It will be the first Indonesian satellite not launched by a US company. Dr Clifton R Wharton, US deputy secretary of state, visiting Jakarta, said yesterday that General Dynamics had met an Indonesian government minister to discuss the case. The US government backed General Dynamics' bid. Dr Wharton stopped short of accusing Arianespace of using unfair means to win the deal but said Washington was discussing with Indonesia the need for business 'transparency'. Although Satelindo is a private company, the US may be able to place pressure on the Indonesian government to change the contract, which remains unsigned.</p>

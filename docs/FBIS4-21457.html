			<p>Technologies   <F P=102>   94WN0225B Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Russian 17 Mar 94 p 11 </F> <F P=103> 94WN0225B </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Billions for Ecology''] </F>   [Text] Russia has developed a program called  ``Conversion-Ecology.'' The urgent need for such a program stems  from the worsening environmental situation coupled with the  virtual absence of an independent sector in this country  oriented toward the development and manufacture of environmental  products, as well as the fact that the task is truly complex.  Using the intellectual and scientific-technical potential and  production capacity of the defense complex to solve  environmental safety problems by providing comprehensive  environmental monitoring, creating new environmentally safe  technologies and improving means of processing industrial and  household wastes will help make that task manageable.    The program envisions involvement by more than 90 research  and planning organizations under the Russian Federation  Committee on the Defense Industry.    According to 1993, estimates, the cost of the program will  be  R54.28 billion [rubles].    Funding will come from the republic budget, investment and  conversion credits, capital investment, foreign investment,  customers' own funds and other off-budget allocations.    Implementation of the program is expected to take three  years.    The program will include the development and production of  new technologies and means of cleaning up exhaust gases and  waste water and of processing, neutralizing and reusing solid  waste; measurement and information systems for background  monitoring of the state of the environment, and systems to  monitor pollution sources; and environmentally safe and  resource- and energy-conserving technologies and types of  production.    The ``Conversion-Ecology'' program will be coordinated by  the  Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources.</p>

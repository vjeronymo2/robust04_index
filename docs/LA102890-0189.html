			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILL REMAINS UNDEFEATED WITH A KO  </P> <P> Virgil Hill remained undefeated in 29 fights when a bloodied Frankie Minton  threw in the towel after the eighth round of their non-title bout Saturday  night.  </P> <P> Hill, who did not risk his World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight title for the  bout, pounded Minton with lefts and rights.  </P> <P> Although Minton was not knocked down, he was cut above his right eye in the  fourth round.  </P> <P> "It was bleeding," Minton said. "I saw a lot of blood."  </P> <P> At the end of the eighth, in which Hill staggered Minton just before the bell,  Minton and his manager, Pete Susens, told referee Richard Steele that they had  had enough.  </P> <P> "He was more beaten than the cut," Steele said. "The cut was the least worry.  To save him, they felt the fight should've stopped."  </P> <P> "I thought I had a bad cut over my eye," said Minton, 26-9-1.  </P> <P> The cut did not prove to be as serious as he thought, Minton said. It did not  require stitches or impair his vision.  </P> <P> Sitting at ringside for the fight before about 4,000 at the Bismarck Civic  Center was Michael Moorer, the unbeaten World Boxing Organization  light-heavyweight champion.  </P> <P> The Hill and Moorer camps are negotiating a title unification bout sometime  next spring.  </P> <P> Hill's manager, Gary Martinson, said the two fighters agree they should fight.  Details of the contract are being worked out.  </P></p>

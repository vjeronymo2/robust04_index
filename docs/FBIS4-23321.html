			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>   [Text] Another 17 people died as a result of shelling by  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  against the city of Cuito this afternoon. Thus, a total of 301  people have been killed and 614 wounded since Jonas Savimbi's  organization resumed shelling the besieged city on 26 May.  Hospital sources told our reporting team this afternoon that  many wounded people could die in the coming hours because of  lack of medical assistance and medicine.    Because of the intensity of shelling, the Doctors Without  Borders from Belgium based in this city are unable to abandon  their shelters to assist about 600 wounded people. Moreover,  the Doctors Without Borders from Belgium and officials from the  United Nations and other international humanitarian  organizations are expected to be evacuated from the city any  time from now. Arrangements are already under way.</p>

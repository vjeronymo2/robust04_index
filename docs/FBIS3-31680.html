In spite of all that, he  is optimistically looking forward to the arrival in Gorj County  tomorrow of the governmental inquiry commission scheduled to  investigate irregularities in the activity of the Brown Coal  Public Corporation, which might lead to the strike being ended.  Otherwise, Mr. Nicolae Mihu said, the coordinating council of  the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation intends to continue  the strike action in the mining units and to explain to the  miners that they should no longer go to Targu Jiu, as Miron  Cosma demanded from them last Friday night.</p>

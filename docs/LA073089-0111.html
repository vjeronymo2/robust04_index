			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TEEN SONS LEARN THE FAMILY BUSINESS -- ARMED ROBBERY  </P> <P> Like a lot of couples, Matthew and Pamela Schultz taught their teen-age sons  the family business. It wasn't your typical mom-and-pop operation -- the  Schultzes were into robbery.  </P> <P> For William, 16, and Matt, 15, the tools of the trade were AK-47s, police  scanners, surveillance and survival gear, maps, wigs, even hypnosis, police  say. They were trained in hand-to-hand combat, went through daily routines of  jogging, sit-ups and push-ups, and memorized streets, zones and police codes.  </P> <P> There were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging police movement.  </P> <P> Files police found in a rented home near Sarasota included blueprint-like  drawings and maps showing distances to police and fire stations, hospitals,  malls, railroad terminals and streets leading to interstate highways.  </P> <P> After a job, the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eliminate Mistakes  </P> <P> "Some sessions were more detailed than others," said Detective Bob Drone in  Kenneth City, 50 miles north of Sarasota. "The reason was if any mistakes were  made during a robbery they could be corrected before the next one."  </P> <P> One mistake the Schultzes made cost them; they pleaded guilty in Tennessee to a  botched robbery and drew a 10-year prison sentence.  </P> <P> Documents police found in the house left no doubt that the Schultzes thought of  it as a business. There were ledger entries for expenditures. A contract dealt  with firearm purchases, handling of loot and standards of behavior.  </P> <P> "No greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure," it warned,  according to investigators.  </P> <P> Police don't know much about the family. Schultz, 29, was at one time a  trucker. His 35-year-old wife was a one-time exotic dancer and was married to a  Rochester, N.Y., man named Hinton, who fathered the boys and since has died.  </P> <P> The Schultzes told their landlady, Stella Penney, they were Matt and Pat Avery  last September when they rented the three-bedroom country home she owned on 10  acres near Sarasota. They said they would be there two years.  </P> <P> Schultz told Penney he was a Marine on special assignment at MacDill Air Force  Base in Tampa, 70 miles away. "I wasn't suspicious. I didn't know they were  criminals," she said, adding that the boys were polite, but didn't seem to go  to school and dressed mostly in military clothes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grew Wary  </P> <P> Over the months, Penney grew wary of Pamela Schultz, who demanded several days'  notice before the landlady could visit, then was rude to her. "I was getting  kind of scared of her. The others would come around and apologize, make excuses  for her that she was having a bad day or the like."  </P> <P> The first police knew of the Schultzes was a six-month spree of robberies and  burglaries that began in the Sarasota area in May, 1988. On Nov. 26, the  Schultzes sat outside a Kenneth City restaurant while the two teens and a  runaway they had picked up took $3,000-$4,000 at gunpoint, Drone said.  </P> <P> On Dec. 1, Penney got the November rent. "Matt opened his wallet and I saw a  stack of big bills, 2 inches thick. It was loaded; there were hundreds. I said:  'What did you do, rob a bank?' "  </P> <P> Schultz said no, then told her he was going to Tampa on business and would be  back in a few weeks. But the family fled.  </P> <P> "It looked like they got out in a hurry," Penney said. They left behind two big  dogs, their clothes and a $300 electric bill.  </P> <P> Gone were the stove, dining room table and fans, and the carpet was ruined. One  bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors. A barrel on the wooded lot  had been used for target practice and looked like swiss cheese. Shots had been  fired into the barn. Empty ammunition shells were scattered around and there  were three homemade obstacle courses in the front yard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Headed Home  </P> <P> Scared by a local crime-reenactment TV show, the Schultzes headed home to  Churchville, N.Y., starting back south in January or February, police say.  </P> <P> They made it as far as Red Bank, Tenn., outside Chattanooga, where police  nabbed the two Schultz boys and a runaway from New York after the botched armed  robbery of a businessman as he made a night deposit, said Sgt. Dan Dyer.  </P> <P> Police recovered all but $110 of the $1,180 cash and $300 in checks. Some was  stashed in a motel light fixture and $300 was in a refrigerator drip tray, he  said. "The light globe had been lined with tissue paper so the money was not  visible even when you shined a flashlight on it. Some of the stuff was  ingenious."  </P> <P> Police confiscated an AK-47 and 750 rounds of ammunition, a .45-caliber pistol  with 130 rounds, an automatic rifle with 300 rounds, magazine clips and a  number of military-type knives, Dyer said. "They had enough weapons and ammo to  keep us held off the better part of a week."  </P> <P> The Schultzes pleaded guilty last month to the robbery. A judge sentenced the  adults to 10 years to run concurrently with any sentence in Florida. The boys'  unspecified sentence is to be parallel and concurrent to Florida's.  </P> <P> The family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent July 7 to charges  stemming from three shoe-store robberies, one each at a computer software store  and a yogurt shop and burglaries of a restaurant and three schools.  </P> <P> Matthew and Pamela Schultz and William Hinton, now 17, face 24 counts each of  conspiracy, robbery with a firearm, burglary and grand theft. Each is being  held on nearly $500,000 bond. Matt Hinton was indicted by a grand jury on 19  counts as an adult and is being held on $200,000 bond.  </P> <P> They are to be tried Oct. 23.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traced to Home  </P> <P> Police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns, ammunition and  60 pounds of spent shells. They also seized a 3-inch-thick file giving more  than a glimpse into the carefully orchestrated, resourceful operation that  included runaways the adults brought into the fold.  </P> <P> The contract they found reads in part:  </P> <P> "Any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held by the overseer  for proper use." Stolen money would be "cleaned and unmarked by overseer Matt."  Big expenditures "would not be allowed in one lump sum as it might be traced  back." Anyone who took drugs or alcohol within seven days of a job would be  excluded. Traceable items had to be destroyed.  </P> <P> There also were individual's notes: "three days ago, stopped smoking . . . you  can beat anybody but Matthew . . . you are smart, smarter than the cops . . .  you feel no pain . . . won't remember being hypnotized."  </P> <P> Jobs were carefully planned. For a grocery store stickup, they figured 20  seconds to open the safe, 15 seconds to grab the money, 10 to get out followed  by a 100-yard dash. Police were two-fifths of a mile away. They had 36 seconds  to run half the driveway with maybe 12 stacks of money totaling 20 to 30  pounds.  </P></p>

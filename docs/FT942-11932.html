			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (10): Capitalist instincts sprout / Examining the effects of an agricultural revolution Picture the 1992 Los Angeles riots taking place in the countryside and you will get a fairly accurate picture of how Romania's agricultural reforms were conducted after the 1989 revolution. Irrigation systems were torn apart by peasants who needed pipes and spare parts, tractors were cannibalised and herds of livestock were split haphazardly among their shepherds. 'After 1989, everyone grabbed everything he could,' explains Valentina Vladoiu,who runs what is left of the state farm in the mountain village of Calvini. She is also president of an association of 28 private farmers who have teamed up to create a 32 hectare farm. Three gutted barns 200m from Mrs Vladoiu's two-storey home show the scant resources the farmers have to work with. Timbers, window frames and even electrical fuses have been looted, leaving skeletal structures. Mrs Vladoiu says: 'Those who were stronger and quicker took everything.' Thisbrutal privatisation was made formal in 1991, when the government passed a land decree meant to return property to its pre-war owners. More than 80 per cent of arable land in Romania is in private hands, although the new owners do not yet have the right to buy and sell their holdings. Survival of the fittest proved to be the guiding principle in the redistribution of agricultural land. Driving over a muddy dirt track through her village Mrs Vladoiu points to the most fertile, black, loamy fields in the valley and reels off the names of their owners. One belongs to the mayor; the next to his brother; further along are the new, private holdings of his best friends. The picturesque but barely fertile fields that climb up the slopes of the mountains surrounding Calvini were reserved for less well-connected villagers. 'Of course this is causing tension in the village,' says Mrs Vladoiu. 'Those who had the best land before the war now have the worst and vice versa.' Giving land back to the peasants, who account for 45 per cent of Romania's population, wiped out one of the few achievements of socialism in the agricultural sector. The large collective farms were cut into the inefficient, handkerchief-sized plots that were the Eastern European norm before the second world war. These radical and chaotic rural reforms led to a disastrous fall in agricultural production in 1990-92 of between 20 and 30 per cent on the figures of the late seventies and early eighties. But agricultural production is recovering. The harvest in 1993 was 12.4 per cent higher than 1992. Western experts say that, in the agricultural sector,Romania's radical approach has brought irreversible reforms. 'The beauty of the big bang approach is that it brings a creative destruction,' says Mr Mike Hicks, deputy head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Bucharest. 'In Romania they broke their legs in the fall, but now agriculture is starting to crawl its way up and eventually the bones will heal.' Shops full of meat and cheese - a minormiracle in a country that, in the 1980s, had one of the lowest average calorie consumptions in Europe  - is one sign of healing. Another is that ever-more-prosperous entrepreneurs are assembling large, viable farms by leasing land from dozens of individual owners. Two hurdles must be cleared before Romania can reclaim its traditional position as one of the chief agricultural producers in central Europe. First, farmers have not been given formal, legal title to their land, and sale of the newly privatised rural properties is banned for ten years. Without clear titles, farmers are finding it difficult to obtain credits to buy machinery, seed, fertilisers and herbicides. The ban on the sale of land is slowing the creation of larger, more efficient farms. The second issue, often overlooked by the architects of agricultural reform in post-communist economies, is howagriculturalmaterials and products are distributed. In highly centralised Romania a single organisation, Romcereal, supplied all agricultural materials: seed, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fuel. It collected, stored and distributed all the agricultural products in the autumn. A sister organisation controlled most heavy agricultural machinery. Romcereal maintains its monopoly on distribution, despite land privatisation. Many private farmers - often unable to get credits and with limited access to agricultural materials and machinery - have little alternative but to indenture themselves to Romcereal. In return for a guaranteed supply of materials, they agree to sell part of their grain to Romcereal at reduced prices. Gradually Romcereal's monopoly is being eroded. It faces stiff competition from western commodities companies offering similar package deals, but with higher quality products and better prices. Some rural entrepreneurs are becoming rich enough to buy their own materials, build their own granaries and sell their crops at market prices. Better still, Romcereal is beginning to collapse from within, as capitalist instincts start to sprout in the hearts of the old agricultural bosses. Mr Alexandru Chioreanu, the head of Romcereal's branch in the Transylvanian town of Arad, is eager to break away from the domination of his head-office in Bucharest and, eventually, to break up and privatise Romcereal. 'We are not very interested in what Bucharest has to say anymore,' Mr Chioreanu says. 'Instead, it is they who must listen to us. There is no doubt that Romcereal should be broken up. The state should retain two or three silos and the rest should be completely privatised.' When that happens, Mr Chioreanu will probably have the option of becoming the head of a local commodities trading company, Arad's version of Cargill. But he has a different capitalist dream. He is trying to piece together a 100 hectare farm which he will run as soon as Romcereal is pushed into the private sector.</p>

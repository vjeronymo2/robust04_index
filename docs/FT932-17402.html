			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bank governor gloomy on deficit BRITAIN faces a 'fundamental weakness' in its large trade deficit which would take many years to correct, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday. He also said that the recession was probably over, though unemployment would stay high for some time, and hinted that a cut in social security spending might be needed to correct the growing fiscal deficit. Answering questions from the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said a reduction in interest rates might be difficult to sustain and would do little to strengthen an upturn. The governor also said Britain might face problems in in keeping inflation below the Treasury's 4 per cent target during the life of the current parliament.

Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he was 'sceptical' about whether a cut in interest rates would boost the economy. 'I don't think people want to be led too quickly into rises in spending,' he said. In the event of a cut in base rates, which have fallen by 4 percentage points since Britain's exit from the ERM, banks and building societies might not be able to pass on the full cut to borrowers because of tightening competition in the banking sector. Asked whether a hypothetical country with Britain's economic characteristics might be thought likely to meet the government's inflation target, Mr Leigh-Pemberton answered: 'The odds would be against it.'</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Overnight rate hits 8% OVERNIGHT interest rates were squeezed up to 8 per cent in the UK as an unusually high daily liquidity shortage overhung the money markets, writes Peter John. Meanwhile, short-term interest rate futures were sold down on worries that some European central banks might be becoming more wary of making further interest rate cuts. The UK liquidity shortage coincided with a record sized gilts auction, and forward rates for the rest of the week suggested that tight monetary conditions could continue today. The Bank of England initially forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 2.4bn and the estimate was later raised to Pounds 2.5bn. The Bank provided Pounds 785m of early assistance, followed by Pounds 278m of assistance in the late morning and a further Pounds 698m in the afternoon. However, that only took Bank operations to Pounds 1.761bn and the Bank needed to provide a further Pounds 560m of late assistance at the usual unspecified rate, taking total help to Pounds 2.321bn. The difficult nature of the day's trading pushed the forward rate for today's and tomorrow's overnight money to 6.5 per cent. Dealers suggested that banks who had the collateral necessary to take out the shortage might have been holding their fire power for today when half of yesterday's Pounds 3.5bn gilts auction becomes payable. The problem could be compounded by large amounts of maturing assis-tance likely to result in another high shortage. Meanwhile, comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the head of the Bundesbank, contributed to weakness in short-term interest rate contracts. Mr Tietmeyer sought to damp down speculation that the recent rash of interest rate cuts was the beginning of a trend. Euromark futures for December fell 7 basis points to 93.81 and the equivalent French contract closed weaker at 93.63. The short sterling December contract declined 6 basis points to 94.53. Some dealers said the December contract was well supported at 94.50 but others were concerned that the move reflected a fundamental change of sentiment. German call money was pushed up to about 6.57 per cent from about 6.5 per cent as the Bundesbank allocated only DM66.7bn at its securities repurchase operations and drained DM7.4bn from the system.</p>

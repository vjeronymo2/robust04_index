			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with neocentrist floor leader Francesco D'Onofrio </F> by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "D'Onofrio: Under  Martinazzoli's Banners, Occhetto's Hard Core"]    [Text] Rome -- The Parliament had been disbanded, the  government's term had ended, the DC [Christian Democratic Party]  no longer existed. Nevertheless, as the sun set on the First  Republic, deputy Franceso D'Onofrio did not look like a ghost.  Seated, or rather, slouching on a sofa in the Chamber of  Deputies, he spent the day shaking hands with those who came to  pay tribute, not only DC members. He has already been  consecrated as the "bishop" of the split from the Italian  People's Party [PPI]: for 24 hours now, D'Onofrio has been the  floor leader of the Christian Democratic Center (so far  comprising 23 former DC deputies).    [Guiglia] You have "split" from [PPI Secretary]  Martinazzoli,  but will you not make peace sooner or later, as good Christian  Democrats?    [D'Onofrio] We will certainly remain united within the  Catholic Church. In Italian political life, however, we will  not be reunited, not at least with those who represent PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] leader Occhetto's hard core  within the People's Party.    [Guiglia] Was the rift caused by ideological motives or by  electoral calculations?    [D'Onofrio] Fortunately, the current majority system cannot  guarantee anybody a seat. Even the infamous proportional quota,  which forms part of the mechanism and is coveted by several  parliamentarians, is mere "guesswork."    [Guiglia] Within the moderate pole, [Pact for Italy leader  Mario] Segni does not want a dialogue with the MSI [Italian  Social Movement]. Do Christian Democrats agree?    [D'Onofrio] I am one of the few DC supporters who showed  some  interest in [MSI Secretary Gianfranco] Fini's evolution toward  the center. If National Alliance's upcoming convention confirms  what Fini has often told me -- namely, that a new right, capable  of governing and with a European outlook, is rising from the  ashes of the MSI -- then my position is very simple: The  alliance of those who really want to constitute an alternative  to the left cannot afford not to examine, very closely, the  possibility of its platform converging with that of National  Alliance.    [Guiglia] Can you also trust [League ideologue Gianfranco]  Miglio, and his three Italies doctrine?    [D'Onofrio] As far as Miglio the academic is concerned, I am  a minor colleague of his. As regards Miglio the politician, I  never believed that he was one and the same thing as the League,  nor that the League was the same thing as him.    [Guiglia] Does this also apply to Segni and his "Pact for  Italy"?    [D'Onofrio] Mariotto [Segni] cannot expect to be umpire and  center-field at the same time in this game. He must choose  between being the leader of a government coalition whose  identity is guaranteed and safeguarded by him, or,  alternatively, he must limit himself to leading a platoon of  deputies back into parliament.    [Guiglia] You are considered a Cossiga man. However, the  former president tried to negotiate with Martinazzoli until the  very last. Did Cossiga betray the "pickaxe policy"?    [D'Onofrio] The former head of state's mission to Brescia  aimed simply to confirm whether the First Republic was indeed  dead.    [Guiglia] Cossiga acting as Martinazzoli's coroner?    [D'Onofrio] I think that by meeting Martinazzoli, the  chairman simply wished to have direct confirmation, namely, of  the fact that he had been the first to read the signs correctly.  Cossiga predicted that the end of the Cold War would lead to  the disappearance of the DC and the PCI [Italian Communist  Party]. He was dead on!    [Guiglia] However, did the "pickaxer" congratulate you on  your split?    [D'Onofrio] Cossiga basically told us the following: "I do  not regard you as deserters, because nobody was fighting the war  any more."    [Guiglia] Martinazzoli, Segni, D'Onofrio -- will we end up  with three DC's instead of one?    [D'Onofrio] The People's Party can no longer claim to be the  sole heir to the democratic tradition. There are many heirs  today, all of them legitimate. In addition, we have disproved  those who did not wish to talk to the League on the grounds that  an agreement on national unity was impossible.    [Guiglia] What is the basic difference between  Martinazzoli's  party and that of D'Onofrio, Casini, and Fumagalli Carulli?    [D'Onofrio] On one side, there are those who mistakenly  believe that they can carry on happily on their own. On the  other side, there are those who hope to bring Italy to make a  choice between two alternative government alignments. The  former want to go back to the past, we are looking forward to  the future -- a future that could begin as early as spring.  Martinazzoli's party is getting ready to rebake Occhetto's  stale bread, the choice being between the bitter bread of  communist Cossutta, and the tasteless bread of the "new"  People's Party.    [Guiglia] You have been joined by Mastella, [former DC  Secretary] De Mita's former spokesperson. What about renewal,  then?    [D'Onofrio] Mastella was never a secretary nor held a post  in  the old establishment. Furthermore, today he risks losing his  seat in parliament, as we all are. De Mita, on the contrary, is  now forced to act as his own spokesperson.    [Guiglia] Will you answer "yes" or "no" to [Fininvest  President] Berlusconi's appeal to moderates?    [D'Onofrio] I believe Berlusconi will enter into politics  only if the anti-PDS alignment does not take shape. In such an  event, he would do well to join in at full steam, thereby  invigorating the whole spectrum constituting the alternative to  Occhetto.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Discounting hits Japanese stores Earnings growth at Japan's leading retailers for the first six months of the fiscal year to August was moderate, in spite of the income tax cut in June and a hot summer which spurred sales of items such as summer clothing and air conditioners. The big supermarkets and department stores continued to be adversely effected by the 'discount boom', as Japanese consumers shunned expensive brand name products. The leading supermarkets expect further price competition in the second half. Sales per customer at the leading supermarkets fell by between 4 and 7 per cent from a year earlier. Seiyu said that its price index for August declined by 6.2 per cent from the same month last year. Even Daiei, which saw a sharp sales increase thanks to the merger of three supermarket chains in March, said that its low price campaigns boosted the number of shoppers by 11 per cent, but average sales per customer fell by 6 per cent. Daiei said that an extension of business hours, aimed at supporting sales, pushed up personnel expenses and other sales management costs by 44.9 per cent. The company will continue its low-pricing strategy in the second half to the fiscal year to February and expects sales to rise by 23.5 per cent to Y2,560bn (Dollars 26bn) and pre-tax profits to increase by 4.4 per cent to Y23bn. Ito-Yokado said that brisk summer sales due to the hot weather and longer business hours helped sluggish revenue during the previous few months. It blamed its meagre pre-tax profit increase on a 4 per cent fall in sales per customer and a decline in interest income. For the full year to February, the company expects sales to rise by 1.9 per cent to Y1,565bn and pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent to Y86.5bn. Jusco's pre-tax profits fell partly because of a rise in depreciation costs stemming from restructuring and the relocation of its headquarters. For the 12 months to February, the company expects a 2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y26.5bn on a 10.3 per cent rise in sales to Y1,170bn. Profits at Seiyu plunged due to cost increases from the launch of new stores. For the full year Seiyu expects a 4 per cent fall in profits to Y7.5bn while sales are projected to remain flat at Y1,048bn. Mitsukoshi, a leading department store with business links with Harrod's, returned to the black thanks to cost cutting. However, the company will continue to see the effects of lower pricing on its full year sales, and it is forecasting full year pre-tax profits of Y2.5bn on a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y768bn. Convenience stores, which have carved out a niche in the retailing market, posted firm sales and profits. However, the sector, which has been posting double-digit earnings growth in recent years, has also been hit by discounting, and increasing competition is likely to slow future earnings. Sales at Seven-Eleven Japan for the full year are forecast to rise by 8.3 per cent to Y212bn and pre-tax profits are expected to increase by 5.5 per cent to Y93bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                JAPANESE RETAILERS: 6 MONTHS TO AUG 31 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Sales      Change on      Pre-tax      Change on                      (Ybn)       year (%)    profit (Ybn)    year (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daiei               1,264.7       +25.0         11.2           +6.7 Ito-Yokado            759.3        +1.1         42.0           +0.8 Jusco                 545.6        +9.3         10.2          -12.9 Seiyu                 520.5        -1.7          3.1          -58.9 Seven-Eleven          108.4        +9.9         49.8           +7.8 FamilyMart            245.8       +10.5          9.4          +17.0 Mitsukoshi            379.9        -4.7          0.6              -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

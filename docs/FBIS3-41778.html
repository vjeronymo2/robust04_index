Sobolev] </F>   [Text] Cholera has been carried to us in Tajikistan from  neighboring Afghanistan, where an epidemic of this dangerous  disease has been raging for more than 2 months. As of today, 14  cases of an acute form of cholera and 2 carriers of the vibrio  have been recorded in the Pyandzh rayon near the border. As was  reported in the main sanitary-epidemiological administration of  the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry of Health, all possible  measures to localize the trouble are being taken. A medical team  consisting of specialists -- specialists in communicable  diseases, epidemiologists, and bacteriologists -- was  immediately created and began working, and three special  laboratories were set up.    The Pyandzh rayon was announced closed: The shipment of  agricultural products in and out of the rayon was banned, and it  was recommended that water from open sources not be used even  though they were disinfected. Measures were taken to transport  pure drinking water from wells to the population. Physicians are  taking a full system of antiepidemic measures. Persons suffering  from or suspected of suffering from cholera are actively being  sought and hospitalized. The entire population of the rayon is  being examined. But there is an acute shortage of medicines and  medical equipment.    Tajikistan's grave socioeconomic condition is now becoming  increasingly more complicated. In view of this fact, the  republic's Ministry of Health has turned to international  organizations -- the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and  Physicians Without Borders -- with a request for emergency aid.  Walter van Empelen, coordinator of the group Physicians Without  Borders, has already responded that the necessary antibiotics  and other means of fighting cholera will be sent to Tajikistan  from Brussels on Sunday 24 July.    In the specialists' opinion, there is still a threat that  cholera will be carried from Afghanistan into other southern  rayons of the Republic of Tajikistan, whose borders are  constantly being violated by mojahedin and members of the Tajik  opposition, in whose camps different infections are widespread.  In addition, these days the return of more than 6,000 Tajik  refugees through Termez and about 4,000 in the Nizhniy Pyandzh  rayon is anticipated. There is no guarantee that these people  who are to return to several southern rayons of their native  republic are not carriers of infection. Beyond this stands the  menacing threat of a cholera outbreak in other regions at any  distance.</p>

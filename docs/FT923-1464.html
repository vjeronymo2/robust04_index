			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK troop protection attacked THE British defence ministry yesterday came under fire from both government and opposition MPs over the amount of protection planned for British troops in the former Yugoslavia and their ability to respond to attack. The House of Commons defence committee - called exceptionally during the parliamentary recess - questioned Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, over the planned despatch of 1,800 UK troops to Bosnia, as well as the latest deployments in the Gulf. Mr Hamilton emphasised that the UK had 'a very short-term and limited objective' in escorting UN aid convoys in Bosnia. 'We do not wish to see this being enlarged into some sort of peace-making activity,' he said. One opposition MP described the UK effort as 'pretty half-hearted'. This was after Mr Hamilton repeatedly stated that the British forces would withdraw if convoys became 'seriously blocked' or suffered heavy casualties. Mr Winston Churchill, a Conservative MP, criticised the ministry for not providing armed helicopters or other air cover. Mr Hamilton said he did not expect the troops to come under air attack or find themselves in a position where helicopter gunships were needed. But he accepted that the troops' Warrior armoured vehicles would be vulnerable in the event of an artillery attack and would have 'serious difficulties' locating where fire was coming from. The aim was to secure passage for convoys by negotiation and not by military means. 'They are not in the business of fighting their way through,' Mr Hamilton insisted. He said Britain was 'quite happy' to work under UN rules of engagement, and denied that these precluded using superior firepower against an aggressor. Once the attacker was identified, troops would be entitled to 'fire back with anything they've got.' Major General Roger Wheeler, assistant chief of general staff, said UK troops would carry a card, as they do in Northern Ireland, spelling out the circumstances in which they might open fire.</p>

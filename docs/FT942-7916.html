			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Rome plans Ina selloff safeguards The Italian government is to take unprecedented steps to safeguard the rights of small shareholders when it privatises Ina, the state-owned insurance company, probably next month. The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, is this week expected to approve a very low ceiling on stakes held by individual shareholders, and an innovative new voting system for electing the first directors after privatisation. Late on Friday night, a cabinet meeting agreed proposals to sell off Ina before the end of June. To meet that deadline, parliament will have to approve the plans this week. In particular, the government will have to put pressure on the elected upper house, where it does not have a majority. The decision on exactly how much of Ina to sell will not be taken until nearer the launch date. However, the government is prepared to abandon control of the insurer. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, told journalists that 51 per cent of the company could be sold. When Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the state-controlled banks, were privatised earlier this year, a 3 per cent ceiling was set on individual stakes. But advocates of wider share ownership complained that the elected boards were still dominated by large corporate investors, many of them allies of the secretive Milan merchant bank, Mediobanca. The Ina ceiling on shareholdings could be as low as 0.5 per cent, backed up by a scheme which would reserve a number of seats on the board for directors elected by small shareholders. It is believed to be the first time such a system has been suggested. If successful it could be used later this year for the much more sensitive sell-off of Stet, the state telecommunications company. The government has agreed to repay L5,500bn (Dollars 3.45bn) of compulsory contributions which private Italian insurers were obliged to pay to Ina in its previous role as Italy's insurer of last resort. Ravenna magistrates are examining documents taken on Friday from Mediobanca, relating to discussions with the ill-fated Ferruzzi-Montedison group last year. The Guardia di Finanza, Italy's financial police, spent seven hours searching for documents, which may throw light on how much Mediobanca knew about the 'hole' in the 1992 accounts of its main industrial subsidiary, Montedison, which helped precipitate the collapse of Ferruzzi. Mediobanca co-ordinated the complex restructuring of the group.</p>

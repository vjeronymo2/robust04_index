			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Smoother passage for the cascade of wealth - Inheritance THE PRIME Minister's vision of wealth 'cascading down the generations' has found its Budget echo not in the widely predicted radical overhaul - or even abolition - of inheritance tax, but instead in proposals which are designed to smooth the transfer of ownership of family businesses and farms. Until now, the effect of IHT business relief has been to reduce the taxable value of shares in family businesses by either 30 per cent or 50 per cent, depending on the type of business and the number of shares held. Under the new rules, no tax at all will be payable on transfers of unincorporated businesses and shareholdings of more than 25 per cent in private companies and those dealt in on the Unlisted Securities Market. The same exemption will also be available on farm tenancies and owner-occupied farmland. In addition to taking these assets completely outside the tax net, the Chancellor is introducing a 50 per cent relief for sub-25 per cent interests in private and USM companies, controlling holdings in fully quoted companies and interests of landlords in let farmland. All these changes apply to tax charges arising on or after Budget day. This will also expunge liabilities which would otherwise have arisen on deaths from yesterday onwards in respect of transfers made in the past seven years. In spite of the increase in rates, the scope of business relief is not being extended, which means that shareholders in property and investment companies will continue to be excluded. For ageing family entrepreneurs, the new 100 per cent relief will do away with the current tax planning imperative to pass control to the next generation and then survive for at least seven years. For the USM, which has been stagnating, the proposals are likely to provide a shot in the arm. In particular, the 50 per cent relief for small USM stakes raises the possibility that USM stock picking will become a popular form of deathbed tax planning. The only general IHT change is that the threshold above which tax becomes payable is raised from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000. This is a 7.5 per cent increase compared with what would otherwise have been an automatic 4.5 per cent hike for inflation. Removing family businesses from the tax net is another body blow to the viability of IHT. The tax is now in a state of unstable equilibrium. Yet more concessions from a re-elected Tory government would seem to lead almost inexorably to the abolition of what is becoming a largely toothless tax. A Labour Chancellor would no doubt have very different ideas. David Cohen is a partner in the City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co.</p>

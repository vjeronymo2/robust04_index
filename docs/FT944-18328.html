			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind advance at Badgerline Badgerline, the Avon-based bus group, reported interim pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 2.56m to Pounds 5.39m, primarily as a result of maiden contributions from acquisitions in West Yorkshire and Staffordshire. Turnover, boosted by revenues from Rider and PMT Group, increased from Pounds 63.9m to Pounds 93.3m, but the group's core business showed a rise of 6 per cent in revenues and an 8 per cent improvement in operating profit to Pounds 5.46m (Pounds 5.05m). The interest charge was cut from Pounds 2.72m to Pounds 2.4m. Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said: 'The second half has started well, with the group continuing to improve its performance compared with last year. Our policy remains one of additional margin enhancements and the pursuit of further acquisitions.' He said acquisitions had performed in line with budget. The two companies achieved profits of Pounds 2.32m, with operating margins of 9.1 per cent, compared with the 8 per cent recorded from its existing bus business. Rider, which operates in Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and York, has operating margins of 9.5 per cent, against 17 per cent for Badgerline's City Line in Bristol. The group is rapidly increasing expenditure on new buses. It purchased 245 in the first half of the year, and will bring in a further 104 in the second half, and 450 a year over the next two years. Rider is taking on 170 new vehicles to help reduce high engineering costs from an ageing fleet, and to give it greater flexibility on routes, through the introduction of a broader range of vehicles. Badgerline was listed in November, and provided early disappointment by announcing that it was writing down the value of its Bath depot by Pounds 7.8m, after failing to get permission for its redevelopment into a retail centre. Mr Smallwood said yesterday that Safeway was planning to revise and resubmit plans for the development, which provide the possibility of a subsequent write-back of asset values. The company is to pay a 1.5p interim dividend, and has indicated that it will pay a 3p final. Earnings emerged at 3.6p (3.2p) or 3.5p (2.6p) fully diluted. COMMENT Badgerline has been the tortoise of one of the market's racier sectors, with depot write-downs being followed by a somewhat pedestrian operating performance. Its shares fell 6p to 119p, leaving it on a price-earnings ratio of 12.6 and yield of 4.7 per cent, based on forecasts of Pounds 16m for the year. However, it is negotiating further acquisitions and has greater efficiencies to generate from its Pounds 61m of recent purchases. It is in a growth sector, and at the current share price it looks undervalued.</p>

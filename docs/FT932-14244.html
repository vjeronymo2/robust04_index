			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: Gunter Wand and the BBCSO - Concert Friday's BBC Symphony Orchestra concert at the Festival Hall was a great occasion. The orchestra's recently-instituted policy of low-priced, unreserved tickets for its South Bank schedule had obviously contributed to it: every seat was occupied, and in a 'democratic' way that lent to this normally neutral environment an touch of Proms elation. But mainly, of course, it was the music-making that caused the air of festivity. Concert-going London, having at last realised that every one of Gunter Wand's appearances with this orchestra is precious, is determined to make the most of them. In 25 years of regular Festival Hall attendance I can recall few events characterised by so rapt a feeling of audience absorption in the music itself. Wand, in his early 80s, seems to represent a tradition of symphonic interpretation that gains ever more meaning and value as its true upholders diminish in number. In Wand performances, every note tells. As Friday's gloriously clear, balanced and truthful BBC accounts of the Schubert Eighth and Bruckner Ninth symphonies showed once again, those famously painstaking Wand rehearsals are never an end in themselves: they have as their purpose the sustenance of intelligent and intelligible re-creative musicianship. The union of exact dynamics and tempo choice, graceful phrase-shaping, evocative colouring and forwardness of rhythm made the Schubert a continuous revelation - not because there was anything in the least outlandish about it, but because Schubertian execution of this sort, alert to the sense and inner workings of the score, is always a wonderful surprise. The BBC's Bruckner symphonies under Wand have become celebrated. He does not direct the players toward craggy heights or searing depths of expression, toward squeezing out the last degrees of blissful sweetness or awesome thunder. The hammer-blows of the Scherzo were each placed for their proper weight and purpose - no more, but also no less. The phrasing of those angular melodic intervals at the start of the Adagio had not an ounce of egregious portentousness in it. Everything in the performance seemed directed toward a conclusion justly and honestly arrived at. In verbal description this may sound a temperate goal, a somewhat bland achievement; in the Festival Hall last Friday it proved thrilling. This pairing of Schubert's and Bruckner's unfinished symphonies has often been made in concert programmes. Rarely has each work sounded, in the best sense, so finished.

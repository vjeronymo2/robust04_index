			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> PLANNING HEAD QUITS, CITES FOE ON COUNCIL  </P> <P> David V. Hart, chairman of the Planning Commission, resigned Monday, citing  conflict with City Councilwoman Joanne Coontz.  </P> <P> Hart, who has served 19 years as a commissioner, submitted a letter of  resignation to Mayor Don E. Smith Monday evening which was presented at this  week's City Council meeting.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that Councilwoman Joanne Coontz has expressed  dissatisfaction to (Smith) about my service as a planning commissioner for the  City of Orange," Hart said in the two-paragraph letter.  </P> <P> Hart served on the Planning Commission from 1963 to 1968 and has served  continuously since 1976, including several years as chairman. He asked that his  resignation become effective immediately.  </P> <P> Coontz said Hart's resignation had been discussed for months but that his  reasons for stepping down came as a "complete surprise."  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Coontz said she had not talked substantively with Hart  about any development issue this year and was "shocked and surprised to be  singled out by Mr. Hart as the reason for his resignation."  </P> <P> Planning Commissioner Don Greek said he might also resign because of what he  called a "list of gripes (against Coontz) that go years back."  </P> <P> "What I am seriously considering is running for City Council," Greek said,  adding that he would wait to resign from the commission before announcing his  candidacy.  </P> <P> Coontz and Councilman William Steiner are up for reelection in November.  </P> <P> If Greek runs for a council seat, Hart said, he would be "very anxious and  willing" to manage the campaign.

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / North Korea 'violating' nuclear pact The International Atomic Energy Agency last night called on North Korea immediately to stop removing spent fuel rods from a reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, condemning its action as a 'serious violation' of an agreement on nuclear safeguards. The IAEA said it was reporting the violation to its board of governors and to the United Nations Security Council. An agency inspection team, currently in North Korea, provided the first official confirmation that the North Koreans had started removing spent fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor in defiance of the IAEA. The US and the IAEA have voiced fears that North Korea may extract plutonium from the spent fuel to produce a nuclear bomb. Washington has warned that extensive removal of the fuel rods would force it to ask the UN to apply economic sanctions against North Korea. Earlier yesterday President Clinton said it would be 'an error for North Korea to continue to thwart these inspections ..' On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang informed the IAEA it had started to refuel the reactor on May 12 - an operation which requires replacing old fuel rods - in spite of earlier requests by the agency not to undertake discharging the fuel without enabling agency inspectors to take appropriate safeguards measures. 'As of today, it still seems possible to implement the required safeguards measures,' the agency said. But to continue the discharge operation without these measures, would result in 'irreparable loss of the agency's ability to verify whether all nuclear material subject to safeguards in (North Korea) is in fact under safeguards and that no such material has been diverted,' it said. Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds from New York: The controversy presents difficult diplomatic problems for the UN Security Council. While the US has threatened tough action against North Korea, any measures proposed through the UN could be blocked by China, which has the right of veto as a permanent member of the Security Council. Japan, too, is reluctant to force the issue to a confrontation.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Principality BS climbs to Pounds 18.7m Principality, the first building society to publish its results for the year to end-December 1993, yesterday announced an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 17m to Pounds 18.7m. The society, the 24th largest in the UK, attributed much of the improvement to its continuing low level of bad debts, which was reflected in provisions of Pounds 1.5m for the third successive year. Total assets rose to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.12bn). Mr John Mitchell, chief executive, said that the policy of centralised decision-making on mortgage lending had given it a high-quality mortgage book, and the consequent low charge for bad and doubtful debts enabled it to offer competitive rates to savers and borrowers. After a year in which the sector met fierce competition for customers' savings, Principality's retail investment balances amounted to Pounds 942m at the end of the year, compared with Pounds 869m 12 months earlier. The number of mortgage arrears fell from 5 per cent of live accounts to 4.35 per cent last year. Peter Alan, the estate agent subsidiary acquired in 1987, made a pre-tax profit for the third consecutive year, passing Pounds 500,000 for the first time.</p>

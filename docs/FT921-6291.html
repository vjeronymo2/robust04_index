			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Sweden names SSAB as first candidate for sell-off SSAB, the steel group, is to be the first Swedish state company to be sold entirely into the private sector under the conservative government's privatisation programme. The government is expected to announce the sales of its controlling stake in SSAB next month. Its programme of planned privatisations covers 35 state-owned or partially-owned companies. The sale of the government's stake in SSAB - 47.8 per cent of the equity and 60.4 per cent share of voting rights - is expected in the early summer. SSAB's other main shareholders are Skandia, Wasa and SPP, all Swedish insurance companies. Many observers believe SSAB is a highly suitable candidate for early privatisation. The company went through radical restructuring before its introduction to the Stockholm bourse in 1989. In that year, it recorded profits of SKr1.5bn (Pounds 142m) followed by a SKr954m profit in 1990. The recession hit demand for steel across Europe, with a 15 per cent decline in Sweden. In spite of this and price-cutting, SSAB is one of the few European steel makers which made a profit - about SKr200m in 1991. Steel industry analysts do not rule out a foreign steel company buying the state's share in SSAB. One candidate may be British Steel which has been seeking to expand continental European operations to reduce its reliance on the UK market. Last November, British Steel signed an agreement with SSAB to form a joint company to produce electrical steels with the UK company taking 75 per cent. The other main European candidates would be Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned group, and Thyssen, the giant German steel and engineering combine. Usinor, however, is consolidating its position after a string of acquisitions, while Thyssen says its priority is to diversify from steel and engineering. Another candidate might be Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel producer. SSAB's value to other European steel producers might be limited. It is concentrated on some high value specialist steel markets, and offers limited opportunities to reap economies of scale through a merger. Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said other Swedish companies to be privatised soon were LKAB, the mining group, OK Petroleum and the Celsius industrial group which has a strong defence product portfolio.</p>

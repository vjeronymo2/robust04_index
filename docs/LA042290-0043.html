			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEATTLE SOUND: UNDERGROUND ROCK GETS A BOOST FROM SUB POP  </P> <P> The headline on Sub Pop Records' ads in the rockzines reads, "Hey Loser." And  when the owners of the small, Seattle-based company come to Los Angeles, they  walk the two miles from a budget motel to their attorney's office in Century  City. Why waste money on a cab or car rental?  </P> <P> Likewise, you wouldn't confuse Sub Pop's roster of recording artists with  anything found on major labels: a squadron of former Muzak employees,  lumberjacks and a 300-pound butcher from Idaho.  </P> <P> In a world where vinyl is obsolete, tiny Sub Pop -- whose offerings have been  described as everything from post-post-post-punk to neo-proto-heavy-metal --  specializes in 7-inch singles.  </P> <P> Where slick, 24-track, digital recording is standard, most Sub Pop releases are  recorded on an old eight-track machine.  </P> <P> Yet nearly every major record company in the country has been sniffing around  Sub Pop and its alternative-chart-topping acts, with an eye toward acquiring  the label and/or its talent. The pickings include Mudhoney, Nirvana, Tad, L7  and the Fluid. Sub Pop music rules college radio the way bands from Athens, Ga.  did five years ago.  </P> <P> The label slings hordes of guys around the country in Tradesman vans, bands who  flip their long hair on beer-soaked stages and loudly deconstruct '70s  stadium-rock cliches for the indie-record fan.  </P> <P> Sub Pop is the nexus between Guns N' Roses (who reconstruct '70s cliches) and  the abstruse pop-isms of R.E.M. The label's offerings have more or less  single-handedly brought aggressive rock back to college radio and made Seattle  the center for alternative music in the U.S., the way Factory Records made  Manchester the world capital of gloom in the late '70s or Prince made  Minneapolis the international headquarters for moody funk. A Seattle band --  any Seattle band -- can pack a club almost anywhere in Europe.  </P> <P> And at a time when white rock 'n' roll is as stale and directionless as it ever  was in the mid '70s, Sub Pop's acts make a glorious noise unto the bored:  throbbing, confrontational, guitar-based rock, bottom-heavy, fuzzed-out and  greasy, as grounded in Blue Cheer, the Sonics and the Stooges as it is in the  Zep.  </P> <P> This grunge factory has as distinctive a house sound as anything since Memphis'  legendary Stax, creating a regional identity strong enough to eclipse that of  other Seattle acts such as Heart or Sir Mix-a-Lot, who sell 10 times what any  Sub Pop band does. It issues consistently hard-rockin' product: art music for  people who instinctively hate art. You might even call Sub Pop's sound dumb art  music -- dumb art music that rocks.  </P> <P> "What I hate is a really pretentious attitude," Sub Pop co-owner Bruce Pavitt  said over a frosty ale during an interview at a West Hollywood biker bar.  (Pavitt and partner Jonathan Poneman insisted on meeting at the bar because  they had heard it had a lot of different kinds of beer.) "The 'We've got a  degree from art school and we're going to reinvent pop' sort of thing is what  killed rock 'n' roll."  </P> <P> "Our bands were all lumberjacks," Poneman said. "Or they painted bridges."  </P> <P> "I think there's a real difference, though, between -- well, there's dumb and  then there's really dumb," Pavitt said. "We don't do the really dumb.  </P> <P> "I think rock 'n' roll should be fun. Why bother to say 'Die Yuppie Scum' when  you can parody all the corporate mania that's been going on all these years?"  </P> <P> If the Sub Pop attitude sounds like something you'd enjoy, a randomly chosen  disc from the label is as sure a bet as a Def Jam record was to a rap fan in  '86 or a Sun single was to a rockabilly nut 30 years earlier.  </P> <P> Sub Pop began in 1980 as a fanzine called Subterranean Pop, a Pavitt-edited  spinoff of OP (later Option) covering U.S. independent music region by region.  It was also one of the first 'zines with a cassette-compilation format.  </P> <P> In '86, Pavitt released "Sub Pop 100," a vinyl compilation that featured Skinny  Puppy and Sonic Youth, among others. He hooked up a year later with Poneman,  who had been a deejay at the University of Washington radio station, hired  producer Jack Endino, and became a local label with a vengeance.  </P> <P> In its first few months, Sub Pop put out classic EPs by Soundgarden (now on  A&amp;M) and Green River, inventors, with the legendary Melvins, of the famous  riffy Seattle grunge sound (Green River later split into Mother Love Bone and  Mudhoney).  </P> <P> Next came a series of colored-vinyl singles from Seattle-area bands released in  severely limited editions, the sheer rarity of which made them irresistible to  record collectors. Then followed a spate of LPs, the all-Northwest "Sub Pop  200" compilation, and even singles from out-of-state artists.  </P> <P> "There's something Machiavellian about our business plan, because the whole  mystique of the label tends to grow proportionally to the records'  unavailability," Poneman said. "Of course, it could backfire -- we'd really  like to sell 100, 200, 300,000 copies of a Mudhoney record -- but in the  meantime, we're going to continue to do business the way we've been doing it."  (Mudhoney so far has sold 30,000 in the States, 60,000 in Europe, making it a  superstar in the underground indie scene.)  </P> <P> The intense demand for Sub Pop product allowed the label to do two things few  indies have yet tried: They ship their records on a C.O.D. basis to a few  independent stores, eliminating the traditional bane of the industry -- slow  payment and bankrupt distributors -- while strengthening their cash flow. And  the bulk of their singles go to a "singles club," a $35-per-year service that  nets subscribers a limited-edition 7-inch in the mail each month from bands  around the country.  </P> <P> This small-is-beautiful system, while limiting growth -- the chains, where by  far the majority of records are sold, don't deal on a C.O.D. basis -- allows  Sub Pop to thrive as a small business.  </P> <P> "When some labels put out records," Poneman said, "somebody runs off with their  money in Europe. When three distributors go out of business on the West Coast  in one month, which happened a couple of years ago, it zaps all their funds.  But whenever we ship a new record, we get a major influx of cash right off the  bat. . . . It's like, let's make some money.  </P> <P> "As a label, we've had a choice to make: pour all our eggs into one basket and  then watch that band go on to another label who will exploit what we did; or  limit our distribution, have stronger cash flow and pour the money we make back  into the band's career, helping them tour, make videos and other things indies  of our size can't even think of doing. Major labels, who have a big enough  capital base, can't be spontaneous, can't reflect the street."  </P> <P> Soundgarden, whose awesome 1987 "Screaming Life" EP is perhaps the  quintessential document of heavy Seattle grunge, was the first (and so far  only) band to leave the label, first to SST, for which they recorded the  Grammy-nominated "Ultramega OK" LP before being snapped up by powerhouse  A&amp;M.  </P> <P> "Bruce and Jonathan are the Don Kings of Seattle rock 'n' roll," Soundgarden  guitarist Kim Thayil said of the Sub Pop owners. "The scene was already there;  they just packaged it."  </P> <P> Pavitt and Poneman prefer to think of their label as a punk-rock Motown. "We  think that emphasis on singles, that drive toward classic songwriting is  vital," Poneman said. "Putting someone in a 48-track studio with a name  producer and the drum sound of the week isn't necessarily going to make great  rock 'n' roll."  </P> <P> "That's what the '60s punk bands were all about," Pavitt said. "Great anthems  that could potentially change your life, especially if you were 16 years old  and hated your parents.  </P> <P> "Music Machine's (1966 hit) 'Talk Talk' was like that. So is Mudhoney's 'Touch  Me, I'm Sick.' We're pretty assertive about letting bands know what we like.  But there's no Holland or Dozier or Holland lurking around here. Basically,  from the beginning a lot of our bands have hung out together, been produced by  the same guy, an ongoing musical dialogue in Seattle. We just happen to be  around to capture it. And the out-of-town bands are ones our other artists have  played with and raved about. I think it's important to run a label like a large  family."  </P> <P> But what about the hype?  </P> <P> "We use the same machinery as everybody else," Poneman said. "We made certain  investments to get the press happening -- hiring a brilliant publicist in  England; bouncing our rent check to get Mudhoney a van to go out on the road;  flying certain European journalists to Seattle -- that most indies wouldn't.  The payoff, ultimately, is that you get coverage. I'd like to perpetuate the  myth that there's a grass-roots explosion for Seattle grunge, but the truth is  that we've helped it happen."  </P> <P> Said Pavitt, "What would the Stones have been without the hype? Just a white  R&amp;B band with some good songs."  </P></p>

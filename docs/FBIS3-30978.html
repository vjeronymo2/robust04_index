			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate </F> Granic by unidentified announcer; announcer is in Zagreb studio,  Granic's location not given; from the "Slikom na Slku" program  -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Announcer] Finally, can I ask  for your comments on today's news carried by REUTERS, which  cites your letter to Butrus-Ghali -- and today's news conference  after the meeting with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  delegation -- in which Croatia offers [announcer appears to  quote] the withdrawal of troops from the border areas in Bosnia  and in return requests that the UN guarantees security to Croat  civilians -- in central Bosnia, of course.    [Granic] After my talks with [Bosnian] Prime Minister  [Haris]  Silajdzic, we made an evaluation and, with the agreement of the  president of the republic of course, I sent a letter to Mr.  Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general, in which I explained  that Croatia is proposing the control [by the UN] of all the  borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including those between Croatia  and Herzegovina, and also that we would -- from the border  areas, that means south of Buna, south of Mostar -- withdraw our  units and some elements of the Croatian Army from the left bank  [of the Neretva River]; these we have been calling volunteers  because they have been and are now -- although the international  comunity calls them elements of the Croatian Army. [I  explained] that we would withdraw them from the right [as heard]  bank -- but in the spirit of the fact that General [Ante] Roso  and General [Rasim] Delic [Croat and Muslim army commanders,  respectively] would meet -- and this was confirmed today -- on  18 February in Split in order to reach agreement on a  comprehensive cease-fire between Croatian and Muslim forces.    On the other hand, we sought from the United Nations the  complete protection of Croatian enclaves in central Bosnia.    [Announcer] So that sentence in the REUTERS news item, in  which it says -- and I quote -- volunteers as elements of the  regular Croatian Army would be withdrawn [fails to complete  sentence]. Who exactly?    [Granic] As regards the border areas, that is the Croatian  Army. And as regards the elements of the Croatian Army -- these  are volunteers [as heard].    [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr. Granic, for responding  to our call and being the guest on "Slikom na Slku" [Picture  Versus Picture] program.</p>

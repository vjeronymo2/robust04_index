In a statement on  Monday, it said the latest flashpoint in the region was  Buchanana near Ntambanana, about 30km east of Empangeni. The  statement said renewed violence started on January 9 when ANC  member Bheki Ndlovu was killed in an ambush. "Despite the fact  that the kwaZulu Police [KZP] were patrolling the area during  the same evening, attacks continued." Several homes had been  gutted by fire in a series of attacks since then, the ANC  claimed.    Two supporters were killed during Mr Ndlovu's funeral on  Saturday. They were identified by the ANC as Wiseman Cele and  Phakaniseni Hlela.    On Monday morning Thokozani Patrick Mlondo and Joshua  Mofokeng were shot dead by a group which opened fire before  burning several houses, the statement said.    The ANC demanded the South African Police and the defence  force immediately take over policing in the Ntambanana area. It  also called on the Goldstone Commission to investigate the  latest violence.    The KZP confirmed weekend incidents in the area but was  unable to supply details on Monday. Senior policemen in Ulundi  were unavailable late on Monday to comment on the ANC's claims.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IMPORT OF KILLER WHALE BY SEA WORLD OPPOSED; PROBE OF DEATH URGED  </P> <P> Federal officials reviewing a Sea World request for a permit to import a killer  whale from Brazil are looking into charges that a popular killer whale may have  died of starvation at the marine park last year, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Concerns about drastic weight loss suffered by Orky after he came to Sea World  in 1987 were voiced to the National Marine Fisheries Service in a March 8  letter from Monitor, a Washington, D.C.-based consortium of conservation and  animal welfare groups.  </P> <P> In the letter, Monitor official Craig van Note urged federal officials to  review the full necropsy report on Orky before issuing Sea World a permit to  import a female killer whale now at Acuarama, a marine park in Sao Paulo,  Brazil.  </P> <P> The report, which Sea World furnished to NMFS to defend its practices, listed  the official cause of death as "acute bronchopneumonia resulting from the  weakened state associated with chronic weight loss," and said veterinarians had  tried to save Orky by increasing his food intake and treating him with  antibiotics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost One-Third of Weight  </P> <P> Van Note cited other Sea World reports that Orky lost 4,400 pounds, or  one-third of his body weight, between his transfer to Sea World in February,  1987, from a marine park outside Los Angeles and his death in September, 1988.  </P> <P> "We are disturbed that a large, healthy animal, under constant supervision by  experienced personnel, could lose more than 4,000 pounds in such a  comparatively short time," he said.  </P> <P> "It has been suggested that food deprivation may be employed as a training  technique for the killer whales, and other marine mammals, at Sea World. . . .  We hope it will be possible to ascertain to what extent, if any, food  deprivation has been employed by personnel at the several Sea World  facilities."  </P> <P> In a March 22 letter to NMFS responding to Monitor's charges, the marine park  chain's zoological director Edward D. Asper said, "It is Sea World's policy not  to restrict the diet of our animals for training purposes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limited Discretion  </P> <P> "Under the supervision of our veterinary staff, trainers have limited  discretion in terms of the allocation of food as long as the animal meets its  dietary requirements," Asper added.  </P> <P> Ann Terbush, chief of the NMFS permit division, said Wednesday the agency is  looking into Monitor's charges and six other complaints about Sea World  practices raised after the application permit was published in February.  </P> <P> "It is our policy to look into any comments or concerns that are raised before  we make a final decision," Terbush said.  </P> <P> The review should be complete and the permit either approved or denied "within  a couple of weeks," Terbush said.  </P> <P> At the time of Orky's death, Sea World general curator Jim Antrim said the  28-year-old killer whale died "of an advanced geriatric condition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Injured a Trainer  </P> <P> Orky, considered the patriarch of Sea World's killer whale herd, gained  notoriety in November, 1987, for injuring a trainer during a performance.  </P> <P> Just three days before Orky's death on Sept. 26, 1988, a calf he sired, Baby  Shamu, was born during a park show before nearly 2,000 spectators in the San  Diego Shamu Stadium.  </P> <P> Dr. Bob Hofman, scientific program director for the National Marine Mammal  Commission, said Orky's weight loss "certainly is not inconsistent" with the  effects of old age.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Reasons for Weight Loss  </P> <P> "Weight loss can be caused by a whole host of things," including old age,  stress or immobility, Hofman said.  </P> <P> Hofman said Orky, acquired by Sea World in 1987 when it completed a hard-fought  purchase of Marineland, a Palos Verdes marine park, was thought to be the  oldest killer whale ever in captivity.  </P> <P> Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc said the application for a permit to import the  killer whale from the Sao Paulo park is the only such request Sea World has  submitted.  </P> <P> In 1983, Sea World was given a permit to capture killer whales in the Pacific  Northwest. Terbush termed that decision "very controversial" and said that,  following prolonged objections from environmentalists and Alaska state  officials, the permit was invalidated by federal court order in January, 1985.  </P></p>

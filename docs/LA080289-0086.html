			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDAL PRESENTED TO SOLDIERS;  </P> <P> CHINA RETOOLS HISTORY: AK-47 BADGE OF HONOR  </P> <P> A design seen widely here in recent days evokes powerful images: In the  background is Tian An Men -- central Beijing's Gate of Heavenly Peace -- and in  the foreground an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle.  </P> <P> Is this a symbol of resurgent protest, a grim reminder of the bloody night of  June 3-4, when martial law troops shot their way into the capital, killing  hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy protesters who sought to block  their path? Are authorities now hunting down whoever dared to create this  design?  </P> <P> No. Quite the opposite.  </P> <P> As authorities try to rewrite the history of what happened that June night, the  design of an AK-47 in front of Tian An Men has literally become a badge of  honor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presented to Soldiers  </P> <P> The design is on a new medal presented to the soldiers who now occupy Beijing.  It was issued under the direct authority of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and  bears characters in Deng's calligraphy: "Guardian of the capital." Over the  past few days, pictures of the badge have appeared in all the major media.  </P> <P> The new badge is one more tool in an intense propaganda campaign that has been  building for more than a month, reaching a new peak with Army Day celebrations  marking the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.  </P> <P> "During the brave struggle to quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion,  relations between the army and the people that are as close as the relation of  fish and water were fully displayed," declared an editorial Tuesday in the  official newspaper People's Daily.  </P> <P> "Even though they were facing cruel thugs, our soldiers, in order not to  accidentally injure onlookers, restrained themselves again and again," the  editorial continued. "Some soldiers, in order to avoid even greater bloodshed,  got beaten or even gave their lives. By their acts they have proven that the  People's Liberation Army is really a benevolent, just and civilized army."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newspaper Promotes Theme  </P> <P> A half page of photographs and drawings in the People's Daily promoted the same  theme, with cheerful soldiers greeting children, chatting with Beijing  residents or sprucing up the landscaping around Tian An Men.  </P> <P> In recent days, the television news has shown soldiers being entertained by  performers and receiving flowers from children or gifts of food from peasants.  An exhibition presenting the government's view of this spring's protests and  the events of early June opened Monday at the military museum.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, every major newspaper ran editorials praising the army.  </P> <P> "The guns of the People's Liberation Army point only at enemies at home and  abroad, and will never be directed at the people," declared the Economic Daily  in an editorial entitled, "Glory Belongs to the People's Soldiers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Had No Choice but to Fire'  </P> <P> "In suppressing the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army had no choice but  to open fire on the counterrevolutionary rioters," the editorial added. "The  army was carrying out its duties. In short, it was done to cherish and protect  the people."  </P> <P> The combination of force and propaganda has brought a surface calm to Beijing,  but the city is far from normal. Two months after the crackdown, young soldiers  still stand at intersections, bridges and outside embassy compounds with AK-47  semiautomatic assault rifles and shorter, black machine pistols. Some look  nervous, others hot and bored, while the lucky ones are in groups where they  can chat with each other.  </P> <P> Vehicular traffic, including bicycles, can pass by Tian An Men Square. But  anyone trying to walk past the square -- which was the center of last spring's  seven-week pro-democracy movement -- is still stopped by soldiers with the  ubiquitous AK-47. Only specially approved groups can enter the square to view  the monuments.  </P> <P> Late at night vehicles, including those of diplomats, are still stopped at  military roadblocks. Soldiers demand identification of passengers and often  check trunks for weapons or fugitives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residents Resentful  </P> <P> Chinese residents of Beijing, when they think it is safe to do so, still  privately express deep resentment of military control in their city. But the  show of military strength and the propaganda barrage have put effective limits  on public discourse by Chinese.  </P> <P> A large segment of Beijing's diplomatic community, however, managed to make a  quiet protest when diplomats from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia  and Western Europe boycotted a reception held at the Great Hall of the People  to honor the army.  </P> <P> Diplomats from many African, South American, Eastern Bloc and Asian nations  attended the event.  </P> <P> The Chinese press Tuesday made no mention of the boycott. But Defense Minister  Qin Jiwei, in a toast, declared:  </P> <P> "I wish to state solemnly here that the Chinese people and the People's  Liberation Army have never yielded to outside pressure, nor will they in the  future. We advise those who remain hostile to China to take a long view and not  to do anything that would again hurt the national feelings of the Chinese  people and harm their normal relations with China."  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Riot police oust Vladivostok's mayor The elected mayor of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok was forcibly removed from office by riot police yesterday after a raid on his office. The move, officially described as the culmination of an investigation into allegations of corruption, brings to the surface simmering disputes over reform policies in a city where the growth of a free economy has been more marked than in any other in Russia, but where the state factories which provide the bulk of employment fear collapse and where some of the highest votes for the ultra-nationalist and communist parties were cast at the parliamentary elections last December. Mr Victor Cherepkov, elected mayor last year, was removed from the mayoral building early yesterday by 50 riot police - though later reports say he was not imprisoned and a local television report showed him lying on a bed after 'suffering a heart attack'. The deputy mayor, Mr Vladimir Gilgenberg, was carried out of the building, according to the Tass news agency. Mr Cherepkov, a former submarine captain, has been charged with bribery, according to Mr Veniamin Chichayev, an aide to the regional prosecutor. Mr Cherepkov has denied the corruption charges and says political enemies have been trying to remove him before next Sunday's elections to the regional legislature. Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to President Boris Yeltsin, told Tass in Moscow that the mayor had barricaded himself in his office and surrounded himself by armed men. 'It seems his supporters were following the example of the White House rebels,' he said, referring to the battle around parliament last October. Vladivostok's stock market, the most active in Russia, has boomed in recent months - by trading shares in privatised companies. The city has led the country in privatising its enterprises but, in doing so, has appeared to trigger a reaction from the state plant directors who see their power base eroding and from workers who fear unemployment. Mr Cherepkov has been feuding for months with the Moscow-appointed governor of the Maritime Territory, Mr Yevgeny Nazdrazenko - who initiated the allegations of corruption. Mr Nazdrazenko yesterday appointed Mr Konstantin Tolstoshin, the unsuccessful candidate in last year's mayoral race, as acting mayor. Local businessmen and diplomats had viewed Mr Cherepkov as more reformist than Mr Nazdrazenko, a former factory director whose appointment the business community regarded as a set-back for market reforms in Vladivostok. Mr Nazdrazenko became governor of the Maritime Territory after Mr Boris Yeltsin ousted his predecessor, Mr Vladimir Kuznetsov. Mr Kuznetsov is a hero to local businessmen, who credit him with initiating the region's pioneering privatisation of large enterprises. But Mr Kuznetsov's advocacy of far-sweeping local autonomy put him at loggerheads with Mr Yeltsin, who sacked him and replaced him with the more loyal Mr Nazdrazenko. The dramatic attack on Mr Cherepkov appears to be a continuation of Mr Nazdrazenko's, and Mr Yeltsin's, efforts to consolidate their hold on one of Russia's most economically dynamic, but potentially separatist, regions. Vladivostok, the base for the Russian Pacific fleet, was a closed city until two years ago. Close to the Chinese border, its economy has been buoyed by trade with its huge neighbour.</p>

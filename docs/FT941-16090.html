			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Measures announced to prevent extra liabilities - British Rail Privatisation Measures to ensure that the privatisation of British Rail does not trigger extra liability for tax have been announced in the finance bill published yesterday. The aim is ensure that the reorganisation of the railways prompted by the Railways Act of last November is broadly tax neutral, the Inland Revenue said. The bill proposes measures in three areas: Companies which emerge from the break-up of British Rail will be able to inherit BR's entitlement to capital allowances and other tax reliefs. BR is being broken up into separate organisations which will own its track and signalling, three leasing companies which will own the rolling stock and a larger number of operating companies which are expected to bid for franchises to operate trains. Provisions in the Railways Act which would have otherwise been treated as 'schemes and arrangements', and attracted anti-avoidance legislation, will be exempted. Such arrangements allow companies to reduce chargeable gains or increase allowable losses or group relief to avoid tax. This will exempt provisions from section 30 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, from section 410 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988 and option arrangements from paragraph 5B of Schedule 8 of ICTA 1988. Vouchers permitting free or cheap travel for about 5,000 BR staff will continue to be exempted from tax for employees earning less than Pounds 8,500 and who continue to work in the rail industry.</p>

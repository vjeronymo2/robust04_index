			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey is going to introduce a new procedure  regulating seafaring in the Black Sea straits as of 1 July.  Authoritative international expert sources say these  regulations run counter to the principle of seafaring. They are  also reported to contradict the stipulations of the Convention  on Straits adopted in the Swiss town of Montreux in 1936.  Turkey's decision aroused concern among the parties to the  convention and particularly in the Black Sea countries, for  which the straits are the only water connection with the  Mediterranean Sea. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert  Chernyshev explains Russia's stand on the issue of the Black Sea  straits in an interview given to the Radio Moscow correspondent  Mikhail Barushev.    Turkey on more than one occasion has declared the  regulations  it is introducing do not run counter to the Montreux Convention,  but rather are aimed at increasing security of the seafaring in  the straits. We can hardly accept this point of view, says  Albert Chernyshev. It goes without saying that security of the  seafaring in this area is extremely important. We are also  aware of the necessity to upgrade the seafaring regulations in  the straits. And still we are harboring serious objections and  firstly because the decision to introduce new seafaring  regulations in the Black Sea straits has been taken by Turkey  unilaterally.    At the same time, stresses the high-ranking Russian  diplomat,  these straits dispose of an international status based on the  principles of free seafaring. Rules should be improved, but not  unilaterally. The interests of all parties concerned and  particularly those of the Black Sea region should also be taken  into account.    We have consulted all the parties to the Montreux  Convention,  and we have learned that all of them are generally sharing the  Russian stand, went on to say Albert Chernyshev. More, we have  expounded our viewpoint at the recent session of the committee  for a secure international navigation, that was held in London.  The participants at the session claimed the new Turkish  regulations ran counter to the principle of free seafaring.  They also adopted recommendations for Turkey to be accepted [as  heard] in order to comply with a regime appropriate to  international laws. We are going to raise the issue of  regulations in the Black Sea straits when foreign ministers of  the Black Sea countries forming an economic zone meet in Tbilisi  late this week. We shall consistently uphold the principle of  free seafaring in the Black Sea straits, concluded the Russian  deputy foreign minister, Albert Chernyshev.</p>

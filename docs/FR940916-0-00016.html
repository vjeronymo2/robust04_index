			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Revisions to Kentucky's Statutes With No Corresponding Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. KRS 350.010_Definition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At KRS 350.010(22), Kentucky is defining ``coal combustion by-products'' to mean fly ash, bottom ash, scrubber sludge, and waste from fluidized bed combustion, produced by the combustion of coal. Coal combustion by-products do not include boiler slag, or residues of refuse-derived fuels, such as municipal solid waste, tires, and solvents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no direct Federal counterpart for this definition. However, the Director finds the proposed definition at KRS 350.010(22) to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. KRS 350_Additions to Statute <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) At KRS 350(1), Kentucky is adding a provision allowing the State to issue permits authorizing the disposal of coal combustion by-products at surface coal mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) At KRS 350(2), Kentucky is restricting the application of the statute to the disposal of waste from burning clean oil or gas with coal, if the oil or gas is used only for startup or flame stabilization. The types of by-products excluded from application are those coal combustion by-products: (1) For which a special waste formal permit or a special waste permit-by-rule is required under KRS Chapter 224; (2) that have been mixed or otherwise co-managed with low volume waste or with materials that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics; (3) generated prior to the effective date of this Act, unless the applicant can demonstrate that these by-products have not been mixed or otherwise co-managed with low volume waste or with materials that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics, or (4) which are injected underground. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At KRS 350(3), Kentucky is requiring that an application to modify an existing permit to initially include disposal of coal combustion by-products be an application for a major revision or an amendment under KRS 350.070. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) At KRS 350(4), Kentucky is specifying that modifications for an existing permit that includes coal combustion by-product disposal may be made by application for a minor revision, where the application proposes disposal of the same by-products in the same location as approved in the existing permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) At KRS 350(5), Kentucky is specifying that modifications for an existing permit to increase the amount of coal combustion by-products to be received, to change the components of the by-products, or to change the generating facility may be made by application for a minor revision. If the proposed changes result in an increase of concentrations of heavy metals, or if public notice is deemed necessary, an application for a major revision will be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) At KRS 350(6), Kentucky is requiring that a permittee keep accurate records, to be available upon request, to the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet) showing the source and amount of each shipment of coal combustion by-products received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

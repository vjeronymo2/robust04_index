			<p>BFN     [Text] Freetown, April 2 (AFP) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone  killed six government soldiers in three attacks which saw them  make their furthest advance yet from their southeast  strongholds, military officials said here Saturday [2 April].    The troops were killed Friday in an ambush in Jembeh, 200  (130 miles) east of the capital, the officials said.    Two days earlier an United Revolutionary Front (RUF) rebel  group occupied nearby Massingbi before being forced to retreat  by government troops.    That incursion marked the furthest known advance by the  rebels since the insurgency was launched in May 1991 from their  presumed bases in the Kailahun and Pujehun regions 300  kilometres (180 miles) east and 210 kilometres (125 miles)  southeast of Freetown, the officials said.    Also Wednesday a separate RUF group tried to sabotage a  hydroelectric dam at Bo, 170 kilometres (1O5 miles) southeast of  the capital. The dam held, but the attackers torched several  houses and farms in the region.    The military junta in power since April 1992 declared "total  war" against the insurgents in January.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORLY THING TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE HEART AND SOUL  </P> <P> Just how does this one RV in question, turn the area into a park? It's also  amazing to me that these people can exhibit such concern about their  neighborhood and show so little compassion to their neighbor Linda Fisher. I  sympathize with Fisher in her fight for life and now her fight for a place to  call home! It's a shame that a $400,000 home means more to these neighbors than  the quality of an individual's life.  </P> <P> I admire her for her independence in trying to care for herself. Most  individuals are not that brave to endure the battles she's been fighting. Why  don't these "busy body" neighbors channel their energies toward a more  constructive neighborly role? Such as volunteering their time at a community  hospice or oncology unit. Then maybe they will acquire some respect for human  life.  </P> <P> I hope Tom Merrell, San Juan Capistrano's planning manager, reconsiders his  actions and allows Fisher to stay where she is. If anything, she is an example  of American courage and perseverance.  </P> <P> Let Fisher stay home!  </P> <P> MICHELE D. LEWIS  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P></p>

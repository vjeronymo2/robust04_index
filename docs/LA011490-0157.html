			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INFANT FORMULA FOR NEW BABY -- IDEAL GIFT?  </P> <P> It never ceases to amaze me that infant formula is still considered to be an  ideal gift for a new baby. I am referring to your article (Jan. 1) regarding  the New Year's baby born at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical  Center.  </P> <P> In light of all the research about breast milk being the far superior infant  food, I cannot believe that hospitals still insist on being free advertisements  for the formula companies! The money used to buy the New Year's baby four  weeks' worth of formula could have been much better spent on the services of a  lactation consultant for the new mother.  </P> <P> At least this type of gift would have proven the giver's true interest in the  well-being of that baby!  </P> <P> It is bad enough for the hospitals to give away free formula but is even worse  for the newspapers to announce this as if it were such a great gift. How  unfortunate that our culture continues to undermine the superb benefits that  human milk offers to both mother and baby.  </P> <P> KRISTA TIBERIO  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

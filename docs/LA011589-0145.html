			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SELF-PITYING PEACE  </P> <P> Assemblyman Steve Peace's flippant dismissal of his deplorable record during  the past Assembly term has to rank as one of the more egregious examples of  political hubris in recent memory ("Power Shift Aside, Steve Peace Isn't  Conceding Defeat," Dec. 27).  </P> <P> Calling the "effective" members of the Assembly "clowns," Peace has concluded  that it is no "big deal" that for more than two years he has neither authored  nor sponsored any successful legislation of any kind, let alone any benefiting  the district he was elected to represent.  </P> <P> Peace's self-pitying and cynical comments are unworthy of an elected  representative, and evince a lamentable lack of concern for his representative  responsibilities. What Mr. Peace apparently fails to realize is that, while he  has been consumed with attempting to advance his own personal political  ambitions, the needs and interests of his constituents, and those of his  district, suffer from an appalling neglect.  </P> <P> Problems such as Mexican sewage spillover, the steady deterioration of some of  the more blighted areas of the district and other pressing environmental  concerns have been left unattended and unaddressed.  </P> <P> Peace's blithe dismissal of the consequences of his ineffectiveness  demonstrates an insensitivity that only serves to reinforce the notion that his  conduct deserves the severest sanction.  </P> <P> Peace has admitted that, during the past two years, he has considered  "quitting" the Assembly. Given his overriding animus toward his colleagues, and  his indifference to his representative obligations, it is indeed remarkable  that the voters of the 80th District have not yet made the decision for him.  </P> <P> One hopes that in the next primary election, the voters will base their  decision both on Peace's meager record and his rhetoric.  </P> <P> DARREL J. VANDEVELD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

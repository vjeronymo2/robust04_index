			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (1): Landlords must manage to survive - Real estate seldom attracts company attention as powerfully as human resources or capital investment. But recession has provided an incentive for landlords, owner-occupiers, and tenants to manage property more efficiently PROPERTY management, traditionally one of the least glamorous corners of the property business, is gradually coming into its own. It owes its increased status to reasons ranging from greater promotion by the surveying industry, technological change, environmental standards, and the increased complexity of building maintenance. Its new-found prominence has been achieved against a backdrop of recession, which provides an important incentive for landlords, tenants and owner-occupiers to improve the efficiency of their property management. Landlords know they need to improve their management, to protect their rental income and retain tenants. 'Landlords are more than ever before using every legal means open to them to ensure that rents are paid on time,' says Clive Lewis, the chartered surveyors. Looking further ahead, landlords are concerned that oversupply in some markets will give tenants the upper hand. That could well lead to shorter leases with break options, as in the US; with the result that landlords will have to work much harder to retain their tenants. 'Poorly managed, expensive buildings will be blighted, and property managers will have to become much more pro-active, mirroring their American counterparts,' says Mr Tony Rinnick of Chesterton. With falling rents, service charges are becoming a higher percentage of total property overheads. Landlords are coming under pressure to contain service charges, which are as high as Pounds 6-Pounds 7 per sq ft in smaller shopping centres. There is even greater scope for tighter property management among owner-occupiers, who have an incentive to cut costs and extract value from their property holdings at a time of slow growth. At present, most UK companies give far less attention to property management than the value of their assets might suggest. Property assets, according to Central Statistical Office figures for 1989, account for about half of all fixed assets held by industrial and commercial companies. 'Real estate is a factor of production, like labour and capital, and yet is rarely accorded the same power and influence as human resources or capital investment . . . The head of property can often be six layers or more down from the chief executive,' said Stanhope, commenting on a report on corporate decisions commissioned from Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. 'Only on rare occasions does property receive explicit treatment in corporate business plans. More often than not, property is viewed as incidental, as an asset which requires little management, generates cost but has little or no value,' says Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, in a study of 100 of the UK largest companies published last month. It found that only 60 per cent of the largest UK companies have an estates management department. Property is nearly as likely to be handled by a personnel director as it is by a property director. This inattention is potentially damaging, in the view of Ms Virginia Gibson, of the department of land management and development at the University of Reading. 'Managers would not consider planning without understanding the implications for personnel and finance, yet property is often ignored or brought into the planning process at a very late stage. This leads to misuse of the resource and, occasionally, costly mistakes.' Companies' inefficient use of space is reflected in the 5 per cent of commercial floorspace they rent but do not use - which is equivalent to the entire office stock in a city such as Bristol. Only a third of the largest UK companies charge internal rents, and only 20 per cent have a corporate policy on space standards, says Debenham Tewson. Only one in five of the largest non-property companies have a comprehensive management information system, containing information on the cost and value associated with each building. Even among those companies with a comprehensive information system, only 40 per cent monitor potential alternative uses or planning considerations affecting each property. The problems encountered in dealing with property in the private sector are mirrored and often magnified in the public sector. The pressure to improve property management in the public sector has been accentuated by civil service relocations, contracting-out of services, and the relaxation of ties between government departments and the Property Services Agency, which has been split up and, partially, put up for sale. The possibilities of exploiting opportunities for capital gains have been eagerly explored by the public sector. British Rail has sold many valuable sites, often by railway stations for redevelopment; the National Health Service has successfully disposed of several of its large Victorian institutions. But recession has checked much of this activity. The difficulty of disposing of land is making it difficult for the NHS to address inefficiency in the use of hospital estates, highlighted by the introduction of some of the government's reforms. In both the private and public sectors, organisations are increasingly contracting-out their property management. Facilities management - otherwise known as contracted business services, or outsourcing, - is a fast growing sector of the economy as companies try to improve efficiency and cut costs without compromising on quality. The chief benefit of contracting-out property management is that it relieves companies of the burden of recruiting staff in a discipline in which it has no expertise, allowing it to concentrate on its core business. It can save money, because extra services need only be used when necessary, relieving companies of the need to employ additional staff and equipment to deal with peaks in demand. For the facility management company there may also be economies of scale. For example, Westminster council claims that contracting out its commercial property portfolio to private firms - to handle items such as sales, lease renewals, rent reviews and strategic advice - will result in savings of nearly 33 per cent, or Pounds 700,000, over five years. Property managers can do more than cut costs. In many instances, aggressive property management can extract hidden values from a portfolio through identifying and disposing of surplus property; exploiting 'marriage values' by combining the leasehold and freehold values of a site, and arranging sale-and-leaseback deals. None of these measures are straightforward at a time when the property market is mired in recession. Even the most straightforward measures, such as sub-letting surplus space, are difficult to achieve in areas where there is a glut of space on the market and limited demand. None the less, if property managers can deliver on even a fraction of their potential, they could change the perception of their industry for good.</p>

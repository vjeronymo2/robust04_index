			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Economic Viewpoint: G7 should look to Asia for new year hope There is a big advantage in ploughing through a survey of the world's main industrial countries such as the December Economic Outlook of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). For any tendency to attribute misfortunes to the peculiar shortcomings of one's own government is quickly remedied when it is seen that very similar misfortunes affect other countries with governments of a very different hue. Take the boom and bust cycle in the financial markets. It has actually been greater in Japan than in the UK, if equities are taken into account. Commercial property values have indeed fallen more in the UK than elsewhere, but the fall in house prices has been greatest in Scandinavian countries, eg Norway and Finland. In spite of all this interesting information, it is quite hard work to extract a real theme from the OECD report, which is in some ways a step backwards. For instance, the growth tables in the main text start in 1992 and go on into 1994, thus putting the main emphasis on crystal gazing. One has to extract from the statistical appendix the old standard tables which put the projections in the context of earlier developments; and even they do not go back far enough or indicate trends clearly. If one looks for oneself, there is no mystery about what has happened. Output in the Group of Seven 'summit' countries started to decelerate in the early 1990s, partly as a result of counterinflationary policies and partly as a result of the debt problems of individuals and companies. The end product has been a prolonged growth slowdown which the OECD expects to continue into 1993. The silver lining is that underlying inflation in G7 countries, which had already been reduced in the 1980s, is now declining further and is expected to fall to 2 1/2 per cent by 1994, the lowest for nearly 35 years. If achieved it should provide a platform for sustainable growth later. The recession is not as deep as popularly believed. The output shortfall compared with trend is less than it was in the last two recessions in five of the G7 countries. Only in the UK and Canada has it been substantially greater. And it is only in these two countries that it has turned out to be the longest post-war recession. On an international scale, we have so far seen only a growth slowdown and not a classical recession. By contrast, in both 1975 and 1982 the growth of real gross national product came to a complete halt in the G7 countries taken together. It is true that this time round the US and Canada experienced an absolute drop in output in 1991, as the UK did in both 1991 and 1992. But these were offset by other countries that did not begin their recession until rather later. Another way of looking at the matter is to track nominal gross domestic product, which is made up of real growth plus underlying inflation. This has decelerated from an excessive 8 per cent per annum in 1988 to about 4 1/2 per cent at present. It is expected to rise to only 5 1/2 per cent by 1994. Moreover, because of the expected drop in inflation, more of this expenditure increase will represent real growth. But at no stage in the recent past have the recorded figures shown anything like genuine depression. The OECD is rightly concerned that the relatively weak recovery it now sees in prospect will not be enough to prevent unemployment rising further. Exactly the same thing happened in the last cycle in the early 1980s when unemployment in the G7 group continued to rise during the first year of recovery by even more than the OECD expects it to do in 1993 and to a higher level. What obviously worries the OECD economists is not their central projections but the downside risks. All their 'alternative scenarios' involve lower growth. The first of these is 'sustained weakening in the US and Japanese private sectors'. The main effect here is expected to be reduced growth in these two countries with only modest spill-over. Developments since the projections were prepared suggest that the countries are not on a par. While the US seems at last to have embarked on a real recovery the outlook for Japan has become cloudy indeed. The other two scenarios show higher wages in Germany and slower than expected progress in reducing the German budget deficit. In each case the effect is deleterious to European as well as to German growth, mainly because it will delay the expected drop in German short-term interest rates. If all goes well, these are expected to fall from an average of 9 1/2 per cent in 1992 to below 8 per cent in 1993 and just above 6 per cent in 1994. The OECD looks at the case for fiscal stimulation for countries which still have either low budget deficits or low debt ratios. It is clearly not keen on stimulation even for these, and remarks that any such package should be 'both temporary and accompanied by a credible commitment to unwind it when the economy picks up'. There is also a lot of emphasis in the Outlook on improving the quality of existing public sector spending to obtain better value for money. But surely this is something which should be done in any case; there is some muddle here, as there was in the UK Autumn Statement, between public investment as a long-term supply side measure and as a component of demand. Reading as best one can among the qualifications and the OECD-speak, the basic view seems to be that while there is a modest recovery in prospect which should not be artificially boosted, there is also a downside risk of genuine depressionary forces. Of course governments should be prepared for the latter. But the OECD does not tell them how. Its main suggestion on monetary and exchange rate policy is 'to provide market participants with more systematic information about underlying trends in relative inflation performance in Germany and elsewhere'. The hope is that they would then realise that France and some other countries have 'out-performed Germany on the inflation front and are likely to continue doing so for some time', and thus allow these good performers to lower their interest rates without putting their exchange rates in jeopardy. It is no crime to argue with the markets in this way: the question is whether it would do much good. If one wants to cheer up, the place to look is at the new section of the Outlook dealing with the 'dynamic Asian economies', excluding Japan. Even in these countries output growth 'is subsiding to a pace likely to relieve inflationary pressures'. But in the case of the four 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - the slowdown is from an average of 7 1/2 per cent to 6 1/2 per cent, with an expected recovery to 7 per cent in the next couple of years. The star performer is China, where growth is estimated at 11 per cent. Even the Indian growth rate is put at 3 per cent, higher than any G7 member, and is expected to accelerate in 1993. If OECD analysts had reflected more on the Asian experience they would have been better able to draw a moral.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      HOW OECD SEES THE WORLD  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Growth of real GDP in per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    1987 share in                     total OECD      1990    1991    1992   1993  1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- US                    36.0           0.8    -1.2     1.8    2.4   3.1 Japan                 19.1           5.2     4.4     1.8    2.3   3.1 Germany                8.8           4.8     3.7     1.4    1.2   2.9 France                 7.0           2.2     1.2     1.9    1.6   2.8 Italy                  6.0           2.2     1.4     1.2    0.8   1.7 UK                     5.5           0.5    -2.2    -1.0    1.3   2.4 Canada                 3.3          -0.5    -1.7     1.3    3.2   4.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                 85.7           2.4     0.9     1.5    2.0   2.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation per cent (GDP deflator)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      1980-89                      average        1990    1991    1992   1993  1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- US                     4.7           4.3     4.0     2.7    2.3   1.9 Japan                  1.6           2.1     1.9     1.9    1.7   1.7 Germany                2.8           3.4     4.5     5.5    4.6   3.3 France                 6.6           3.1     2.8     3.2    2.6   2.1 Italy                 10.8           7.5     7.3     4.5    5.3   5.2 UK                     6.3           6.3     6.7     5.4    5.0   4.1 Canada                 5.2           3.3     2.7     1.0    2.2   2.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                  4.5           3.9     3.8     3.1    2.8   2.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------           MAJOR DECLINES IN ASSET PRICES FROM LAST PEAK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                           per cent decline since peak  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Japan        Tokyo Stock Exchange                             -60   Finland      Industrials                                      -55   Norway       Industrials                                      -25 Real Estate   US           Commercial property, north east                  -25   Japan        Residential land, six leading cities             -20   UK           House prices, first time buyers, south east;     -25                commercial property, London                      -45   Finland      House Prices                                     -25   Norway       House Prices                                     -30  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Over half swaps cases settled out of court MORE than half of all legal disputes between banks and UK local authorities over interest swap agreements are now believed to have been been settled, according to banks involved in the transactions. After a wave of unannounced, out-of-court settlements in recent months, some authorities are understood to have completely disentangled themselves from the mass of legal actions, which last summer stood at about 200. Other authorities and banks hope substantially to have resolved outstanding claims by the end of this year. Settlement of the actions would bring to an end the protracted and often heated dispute between banks and authorities over the swap agreements, under which banks stand to lose as much as Pounds 500m. A year ago, the House of Lords in the UK ruled that authorities were acting outside their powers in entering swap agreements and so could not make payments to banks under the agreements. However, banks have continued to push for restitution - the return of payments they had made under the agreements. These claims are believed to amount to 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the banks' losses. Two settlements announced earlier this week, involving Barclays and Midland, follow many more confidential settlements in recent months, bankers said. Midland, for instance, said it had settled many of its claims, and had only 11 outstanding. Citicorp, meanwhile, said it had settled more than three-quarters of claims. The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - the most active of the authorities in the swaps market - said it had already settled claims with 29 banks. According to banks involved in the settlements, local authorities are generally agreeing to repay principal amounts to banks, but are not paying the full amount of interest claimed on these amounts, which in some cases are substantial. The Barclays and Midland settlements bring to an end two cases which had been singled out by the High Court as test cases. Four others are due in the weeks ahead, involving Samuel Montagu, Citicorp, Chemical Bank and the National Bank of North Carolina. Opinions are divided among banks over whether this week's arrangements will prompt out-of-court settlements in these cases too, or whether they would increase pressure on authorities to go to court to get a firm legal ruling on which they could act. The outstanding cases will also determine the liabilities of authorities which entered swap agreements with each other - according to one banker, an even larger issue than their liabilities to banks.</p>

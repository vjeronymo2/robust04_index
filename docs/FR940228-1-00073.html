			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the Department of Education uses a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application form that addresses both institutional eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements (as found in 34 CFR part 600) and the standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of administrative capability and financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. In recent years, although institutions filed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single application form, they received separate notifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action from the Department: an institutional eligibility notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a certification letter. This created confusion because some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions misinterpreted the institutional eligibility notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also to be the notice informing the institution that it met the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for ``certification'' and that the institution was now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to participate in a Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to reduce confusion, the Secretary is now combining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these notices of ``institutional eligibility'' and ``certification'',  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing one ``Institutional Approval Notice'' to an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meets the institutional eligibility and certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The Institutional Approval Notice advises the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that it is an eligible institution, and is approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs listed in the Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and indicated in the institution's program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. The effective date of approval, which is specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Institutional Approval Notice, is the date that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs the institution's program participation agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current practice, an institution that wishes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in a Title IV, HEA program for the first time must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first apply to the Secretary for a certification that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution meets the standards for participation found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart B of these regulations. A currently participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must apply to the Secretary for a certification that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution continues to meet these standards under a number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the institution must apply for certification if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary requests the institution to apply. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves the right to require a participating institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply at any time if the Secretary is concerned about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's continued participation in a Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the Secretary exercises this authority only rarely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and generally when the Secretary receives reliable information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could affect the institution's eligibility under 34 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 or the institution's financial responsibility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability under subpart B of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if the Secretary receives information that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that does not grant degrees has received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization from its State and accrediting agency to award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degrees, the Secretary would require the institution to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 34 CFR part 600 to determine whether the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfies the definition for a different type of institution and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore might be eligible to apply to participate in HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs for which the institution earlier was not qualified. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same time, the Secretary requires the institution to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for recertification under this subpart. Similarly, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary receives reliable information that could affect whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution meets the factors of financial responsibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this subpart, the Secretary requires the institution to apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recertification. The Secretary does not intend to exercise this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority more frequently than under current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, a participating institution must apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification if the institution wishes to include in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation a branch campus (as that term would be defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34 CFR part 600) or another location that offers 100 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program. Adding a branch campus or additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location that offers 100 percent of an educational program can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a great effect on the ability of an institution to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers it is appropriate to scrutinize the effect of such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition. In particular, the Secretary believes it is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to examine whether the institution has the financial resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the administrative capability necessary to support such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Low demand pushes Wyko into the red WYKO, the distributor and manufacturer of bearings and power transmission components, ended what it called 'the most unrewarding and difficult year in the group's history' with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20,000. That compared with profits of Pounds 1.38m for the previous year to April 30. Losses per share were 0.5p, against earnings of 2.37p; a final dividend of 0.5p brings the total to 1p (2.8p). Wyko's downturn in fortunes has come late in the business cycle. It is now in the middle of a retrenchment programme of a type which has become familiar in Midlands industry. Last year the payroll was cut from 1,060 to 962; there will be a further fall this year. Both the distribution and manufacturing divisions contended with low demand, severe pressure on margins and an erratic pattern of trade which made - and still makes - business planning difficult. Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 57.4m, against Pounds 55.5m, reflecting a full contribution from EW Bearings, the distribution business, but disguising the disappearance of Pounds 5.13m of business on the disposal of Wyko Power Plant Gears in April 1992.</p>

The leaders of the new organization announced that their  motive for establishing this organization is their fear for [the  future of] Sudan, especially after talk began going around  concerning the secession of the south, in view of the failure to  deal with Sudan's vital issues concerning determining its  identity, building its society, and establishing foundations  that would include [all Sudanese] people in a single country and  promote the building of the country. Mr. Ahmad Ibrahim Durayj, a  Sudanese politician who was formerly the governor of the  province of Darfur, is head of the founding committee of the  Sudanese Federal Democratic Alliance, and he said, in a  statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, that his political group is  broaching political ideas and is not hostile to any political  party. He said that their political ideas are non-partisan and  are directed to all Sudanese, regardless of their political and  geographic affiliations and orientations and their religious  beliefs.    The press statement distributed by the new organization  pointed out that, after 38 years [of independence], Sudan is  suffering from an unprecedented decline and collapse of its  national institutions. He added: "The civil war continues to  take the lives of thousands of Sudanese citizens and to force  millions to flee their homes and villages, thus causing poverty  and famine, destroying the nation's infrastructure, blocking all  efforts for development, and leading to the collapse of the  economy."    The statement, signed by Mr. Durayj, criticized the present  regime in Khartoum, which he described as a "continuation, in  the extreme sense, of the political views of the sectarian  leadership of the country's two main parties." He said: "All  political opposition forces have failed to create a common  framework with our brethren from the south, and this has made it  even more likely that the nation will become fragmented."    The new alliance indicated that it is not a political party,  but rather a democratic political organization that has the goal  of gathering together all political and social forces as well as  individuals.    He said that he is committed to eliminating the current  regime in Sudan, "but does not wish to put in its place forces  that would attempt to carry out a program that would not differ  from that of the current regime."    The leaders of the new organization feel that the form of  government that has existed in Sudan since independence has been  a failure. They consider the federal form of government to be  the solution to the governmental crisis as well as the problems  of both the administrative center and the provinces. They also  stress, first and foremost, the need to establish the necessary  laws and programs for building a unified country, and they feel  that religion should not play a role in politics--in other  words, they favor the building of a secular state.</p>

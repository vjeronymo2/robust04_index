			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. FARRELL; MARINE COMMANDER, PIONEER AVIATOR  </P> <P> Retired Marine Maj. Gen. Walter Greatsinger Farrell, a pioneer naval aviator  who served in World Wars I and II, has died. He was 93.  </P> <P> Farrell died Thursday at San Diego Naval Hospital.  </P> <P> He was the oldest living naval aviator in the world and held two of the very  few licenses signed by Orville Wright, according to his son, Patrick, of  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Born in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 1897, the son of Gen. and Mrs. P.J.H. Farrell,  he joined the Army in 1916, but soon switched to the Marines.  </P> <P> "I didn't know anything about the Marines except they had a red stripe on their  pants and they wore a funny kind of hat," he recalled in 1988.  </P> <P> The young Marine lieutenant served in France during World War I, leading  replacement companies through combat training.  </P> <P> In 1921, he won his wings as a Navy pilot. Between the world wars, he served in  Haiti and Nicaragua, and briefly as assistant naval attache at the American  Embassy in London.  </P> <P> After reorganizing and training a wing group in San Diego at the outset of  World War II, Farrell went to Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands, earning a  Silver Star for "exceptional heroism" in action against the Japanese.  </P> <P> Promoted to brigadier general, he commanded the 3rd Marine Air Wing, and later  served in China.  </P> <P> Early in 1945, Farrell reported for duty at El Toro Marine Air Station in  Orange County as deputy commander of the 11th Naval District Air Bases.  </P> <P> He retired in 1946 as a major general, after 30 years of service. At that time,  he was commanding all Marine Corps air bases on the West Coast.  </P> <P> In addition to his son Patrick, Farrell is survived by another son, Thomas, of  Charlottesville, Va.; a daughter, Mary (Micki) of San Diego; a stepson,  Frederick Trapnell, of Los Altos, eight grandchildren and five great  grandchildren.  </P> <P> Services are scheduled Wednesday at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San  Diego.  </P></p>

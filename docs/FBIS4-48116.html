			<p>BFN     [Text] Allegations of friction and resignations among the  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] top structure following its poor  showing in the election were denied today by the party's deputy  president, Mr. Johnson Mlambo. (Arnold Sebetse) spoke to him in  Johannesburg.    [Begin recording, in English] [Mlambo] There is nobody  resigning from the top structure of the PAC, because rumors have  been concocted even around the president of the PAC, which have  no basis whatsoever. Even the question of our secretary general  has indicated to the leadership that, perhaps because of the  tasks that he will be handling as our representative in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] parliament, he ought to  be relieved of his tasks, and we have said no to that aspect.  [as heard]    [(Sebetse)] And finally, Mr. Mlambo, President Mandela has  made an offer to the PAC, a cabinet post. What is the PAC  response to that?    [Mlambo] Well, the constitution does not allow for that.  [end  recording]</p>

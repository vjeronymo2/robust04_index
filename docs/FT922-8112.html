			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Observer: Design change The arrival of Anthony Simonds-Gooding as the new chairman and chief executive of the Design and Art Directors' Association, better known as D&amp;AD, has caused a bit of a stir. Not only is it a bit of a comedown for the 54-year-old Simonds-Gooding, once considered a contender for the top job at Guinness, but it also comes after a long bout of grief for the UK's leading design and advertising award-making organisation. D&amp;AD has effectively been without a chief executive since the start of 1992. Some would argue that lack of effective administration started much earlier than that; in 1984 it was discovered that D&amp;AD had not filed accounts for nine years. Edward Booth-Clibborn, who had been executive chairman of D&amp;AD for yonks, was suspended in January and up until this week lawyers were wrangling over the wording of the statement concerning his final departure. D&amp;AD is a registered charity. But the board discovered all kinds of activities being conducted under its aegis which seemed to have little to do with the running of an annual awards dinner, D&amp;AD's main raison d'etre. At the very least, financial control seems to have gone haywire. Yesterday it was announced that Booth-Clibborn was leaving. In hiring Simonds-Gooding, a former Whitbread and Saatchi marketing whiz and ex-boss of British Satellite Broadcasting, the D&amp;AD seems to be taking a sledgehammer to the problem. But better late than never.</p>

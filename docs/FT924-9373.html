			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Amcoal holds dividend despite first-half reverse LOWER sales and an adverse tax adjustment contributed to a fall in first-half attributable earnings of 15 per cent at Amcoal, South Africa's largest coal group and the coal arm of the Anglo American Corporation. But the dividend was maintained at 150 cents a share, despite the fall in per-share earnings to 537 cents from 632 cents. Sales of coal and coke fell by 2 per cent to 20.74m tonnes from 21.2m tonnes. Export sales were 9 per cent higher at 5.16m tonnes compared with 4.74m tonnes, but sales in the domestic market were lower. Export profitability was lower as weaker dollar prices offset the benefits of increased volumes and a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, while colliery working costs were kept below the inflation rate. Operating profits fell by 6.6 per cent to R202.7m (Dollars 69.8m) from R217m, although turnover rose to R952.7m from R948.9m. Attributable earnings emerged at R135.2m compared with R159m. This resulted from lower interest and investment income - a function of higher capital expenditure and lower interest rates - and a fall in the favourable adjustment to the previous year's deferred tax benefits, arising from a lower rate of tax. Mr David Rankin, chairman, said Amcoal's operations were likely to remain at the same level in the second half despite the weak domestic economy. He said the combination of increased volumes and the rand/dollar exchange rate should ensure second-half earnings similar to those just reported.</p>

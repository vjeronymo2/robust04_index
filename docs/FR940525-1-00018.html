			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To recognize the risks related to such a participation certificate and the retained recourse, the Agencies propose to change their capital requirement for this arrangement. The requirement would equal the sum of the amount of risk-based capital required for the portion of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate not covered by the institution's recourse obligation and the risk-based capital required for the low-level recourse obligation retained on the underlying loans, limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans as if the loans were held as on-balance sheet assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if an institution swaps $1,000 of qualifying single-family mortgage loans for a Freddie Mac participation certificate and retains 1% recourse, the proposed capital requirement would equal the sum of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (1) $1,000 times (100% minus 1%) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  times 20% risk-weight times 8% = $15.84, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This 99% piece is the portion of the loan pool not covered by the institution's recourse obligation, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. For operational simplicity, 100% may be used to determine an institution's capital requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (2) $1,000 times 1% = $10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This sum, $25.84, is limited by the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if they were held by the institution. This limit is 4% of $1,000 or $40. Thus, since the sum, $25.84, is less than the limit, $40, the capital requirement is $25.84.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Reporting of Low-Level Recourse Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Banking Agencies are also proposing to recommend to the FFIEC that banks be permitted to report low-level recourse transactions as sales of assets (rather than financings) in the Call Report, if they establish and maintain a recourse liability account for the contractual maximum amount of the recourse obligation. (Otherwise, these transactions would continue to be reported as financings in the Call Report.) The recourse liability account could be established either by a charge to expense or to the allowance for loan and lease losses, as appropriate. The recourse liability account would not be part of the allowance for loan and lease losses and would therefore be excluded from the bank's capital base. Banks that fully reserve against their recourse exposure in this manner would not be assessed any risk-based capital for the transaction, which would be consistent with the current treatment of such transactions for thrifts. The accounting entries which permit the removal of the assets from a bank's balance sheet on the condition that the low-level risk exposures are either expensed or fully reserved for (either of which produces a change in the bank's equity capital position) result in an appropriately adjusted leverage capital ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Banking Agencies currently permit banks to report as sales in the Call Report certain residential and agricultural mortgage transfers with recourse that qualify as sales under GAAP. The FRB requires bank holding companies to report all asset sales with recourse in accordance with GAAP on the consolidated financial statement for bank holding companies (Form FR Y&hyph;9C). The OTS requires thrifts to report all transfers of receivables with recourse in accordance with GAAP on their TFRs. The Agencies are not proposing to change these existing regulatory reporting treatments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. GAAP Recourse Liability Account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously explained, under GAAP, when a transfer of receivables with recourse qualifies to be recognized as a sale, the seller must establish a recourse liability account at the date of sale that covers all probable credit losses under the recourse provision over the life of the receivables transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Question 2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Banking Agencies request comment on how the GAAP recourse liability account should be treated under the proposed low-level recourse rule for transfers of receivables with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call Report and FR Y&hyph;9C. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That is, when a banking organization transfers assets in such transactions, should the amount of capital required under the low-level recourse rule be adjusted to take account of the institution's GAAP recourse liability account?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS is not proposing to change its current policy, which permits a thrift to deduct the amount of its GAAP recourse liability account (1) from the contractual maximum amount of its recourse obligation in applying the low-level recourse rule, and (2) from the amount of loans sold with recourse in assessing the full effective risk-based capital requirement for all loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The two options are: (1) Not taking the GAAP recourse liability account into consideration at all; or (2) requiring risk-based capital equal to the amount of the banking organization's low-level recourse obligation minus the balance of its GAAP recourse liability account so that the recourse liability account plus required capital would equal the banking organization's contractual maximum exposure under the recourse obligation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The latter option would conform the Banking Agencies' treatment to that of the OTS in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The GAAP recourse liability account must be excluded from an institution's risk-based and leverage capital base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Banking Agencies' existing risk-based capital guidelines also do not indicate how the GAAP recourse liability account should be taken into account in general when determining the credit equivalent amounts of assets transferred with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C. The Banking Agencies expect to apply the GAAP recourse liability account treatment that they adopt for low-level recourse transactions that are reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C to all asset transfers with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C, and to clarify their risk-based capital guidelines accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Treatment of Direct Credit Substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agencies are proposing to extend the current risk-based capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse (including the proposed low-level recourse rule) to certain direct credit substitutes. As previously explained, the current risk-based capital assessment for a direct credit substitute may be dramatically lower than the assessment for a recourse provision that creates an identical exposure to risk. Based on the Agencies' conclusion that asset transfers with recourse should be assessed risk-based capital against the full amount of the assets enhanced <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (except in low-level recourse transactions), the Agencies are of the opinion that direct credit substitutes that present equivalent risk should be subject to an equivalent risk-based capital treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See earlier comparison to GAAP accounting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposal, the general treatment of direct credit substitutes would be to assess capital against the amount of the asset or pool of assets that is enhanced, rather than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. Like low-level recourse arrangements, direct credit substitutes that cover only losses below the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets would be assessed a dollar-for-dollar capital requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated in Section II(B), the Agencies are continuing to evaluate the need for a dollar-for-dollar capital requirement on low-level recourse transactions. Any modification to the proposed treatment of low level recourse transactions would also apply to low level direct credit substitutes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  those that cover losses below the full, effective risk-based capital charge for the total outstanding amount of the assets enhanced). See Section III for additional discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed treatment of direct credit substitutes would not affect the current treatment of purchased subordinated interests and financial standby letters of credit that absorb only the second dollars of losses from the assets enhanced. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agencies intend to determine the appropriate risk-based capital treatment of these second dollar loss direct credit substitutes as part of the development of the multi-level approaches discussed in Section III. In the event that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of one or more multi-level approaches, the Agencies would expect to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second dollar loss direct credit substitutes based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this proposal, and until the Agencies implement one or more multi-level approaches, a direct credit substitute absorbs the second dollars of losses from assets if there is prior credit enhancement that absorbs first dollars of losses from those assets. For OTS only, purchased subordinated interests whether in the first or second loss position will continue to be treated as recourse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The currently proposed change to the treatment of direct credit substitutes would primarily affect the following transactions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Loan servicing rights purchased by banking organizations if they embody a direct credit substitute,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

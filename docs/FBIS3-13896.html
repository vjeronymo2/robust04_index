Responding to a question at the  daily briefing in New Delhi today, the spokesman of the External  Affairs Ministry said Islamabad's action falls into the  continuing and regrettable pattern of taking negative actions  which are not conducive to good neighborly relations. He  pointed out that India has always tried to assist in creating a  climate in which the Pakistani Consulate can perform its  functions. Regarding accommodation, the spokesman said Pakistan  was not interested in certain locations offered by the  Maharashtra Government as was clarified by the chief minister  himself. He said Pakistanis themselves know the accommodation  problem in metropolitan cities and pointed out that India is  paying markets rates for its properties in Islamabad and Karachi.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Lloyds vows to fight on for Midland: Hongkong Bank given clear run after Heseltine decision to refer rival bid to MMC LLOYDS BANK said last night it would continue its fight to buy Midland Bank, its UK rival, in spite of the decision yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to refer the proposed bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Heseltine also said there was no reason for UK authorities to review Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's agreed Pounds 3.4bn takeover of Midland. This leaves Hongkong Bank with a clear field to pursue its bid. Lloyds said it was confident it could persuade the MMC that its bid was not against the public interest and that it would consider sympathetically making any undertakings to ensure this was the case. 'It's disappointing but not exactly surprising,' said Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive. He would be writing to Midland shareholders telling them that they lost nothing by ignoring Hongkong Bank's offer. 'I am advised that should the Hongkong Bank offer fail they (Hongkong Bank) have the ability to make a new offer after the MMC inquiry even if Lloyds is not cleared to bid (by the MMC),' Mr Pitman said. As widely predicted, Mr Heseltine said Lloyds' proposed bid raised competition issues in the UK market which deserved referral to the MMC. The MMC has been asked to produce its ruling by August 25. Only if the bid is cleared could Lloyds make a formal offer. Midland's shareholders therefore have to accept or reject Hongkong Bank's merger proposal before the MMC has ruled whether to allow Lloyds' considerably higher proposed bid. Some institutional investors yesterday expressed disappointment, saying they would have preferred to see either both bids referred or neither. One Scottish fund manager said: 'I'm going to be a holdout.' He said he believed Hongkong Bank would be forced to improve its bid before the offer expired on June 9. Mr Heseltine's decision was widely welcomed at Westminster where many Conservative MPs are afraid a successful Lloyds bid would cost jobs and reduce competition in retail banking. A Lloyds takeover could result in the loss of some 1,100 bank branches and more than 30,000 staff according to the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union. Under the Hongkong proposal, Midland would retain its management and identity and its network would stay intact. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, said Mr Heseltine's ruling meant his was the only firm offer for Midland. 'It is one which the Midland board has supported from the outset, which fully recognises the value of Midland and its strong UK franchises,' he said. The decision was also welcomed by Bifu, which interpreted Mr Heseltine's decision as support for its opposition to the Lloyds bid. Mr Heseltine said his reference did not pre-judge the issue of whether the merger was against the public interest. His decision is the latest blow to Lloyds' proposed Pounds 3.7bn bid. On Thursday. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner, said there was no need for a lengthy investigation into Hongkong Bank's merger proposal as the two banks competed in different sectors. In spite of the apparent setback, some institutional shareholders said that Lloyds, though bloodied by Mr Heseltine's decision, was not out of the fight. Shareholders are also aware that the Lloyds bid, if allowed by the MMC, would represent a rare opportunity to rationalise an industry where there is overcapacity. Such a move could raise the financial returns from the sector in the long term. Some Tory MPs remained worried that the Hongkong bid had been given an unfair advantage and that the two bidders were not on a level playing field. Lloyds's shares fell 3p to 427p, while Midland's share price rose 6p to 405p. Editorial comment, Page 6 Company news, Page 8 London stocks, Page 15 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Personal View: If it's in the newspaper, it ought to be true It is a saloon bar cliche that every newspaper article one reads on a subject one knows well is wrong in some important detail. Most such cliches are themselves inaccurate. Yet personal experience frequently confirms that newspapers are riddled with errors. Experience also confirms that it is a waste of time trying to correct errors in newspapers after the event, as the damage has been done and retrospective apologies are treated with suspicion or ignored. It is odd that this should be so, and it reveals a curious case of collective cognitive dissonance. People who know that what is written about them is wrong are willing to believe what they read about others. Most journalists are indifferent to these complaints. If the punters are put out, they reason, they must be on to something. Journalists are also aware that they can afford to be indifferent to public complaints about their competence. Few, if any, newspapers systematically monitor the accuracy and relevance of the output of their journalistic staff. They argue, like most professional groups, that it is impossible to capture the value of their effort in any quantitative way. Just as doctors wave their shrouds and teachers lock the door to their secret garden, so the Fourth Estate begins to talk loftily about the inestimable value of a probing free press, ready to take risks in pursuit of truth and justice. Well, up to a point, Lord Copper. Investigative journalism is fine and dandy, but if the facts are wrong and the 'analysis' baloney, it is not clear that the frontiers of human knowledge have been advanced very far. So, along with most professions, journalism is under pressure to raise standards. But most of this pressure is focused on taste or intrusiveness - peripheral matters, for the quality press at least. About 90 per cent of their activity is devoted to reporting the news in, supposedly, an accurate and informative way. What is needed is a system to monitor its effectiveness. Any such system needs to focus first on the individual, not the paper as a whole. Apart from leaders, most articles are written by an individual journalist with little amendment thereafter. This makes it a sensitive exercise. But journalists, with their passion for bylines, should not mind having their personal successes and shortcomings highlighted. The starting point should be an assessment of crude output. This is not simply to ensure that the individual is working. It is clear from other professions, such as hospital doctors, that accuracy may be influenced by the volume of work. Newspapers could easily monitor column inches per working journalist on a weekly basis. Thereafter, a first qualitative indicator might be the proportion of copy submitted that is published. A monthly league table would be useful, but this would not necessarily be a measure of quality: a journalist consistently producing sensational but erroneous material would score more highly than a conscientious analyser. A crude measure of accuracy might be the number of letters and corrections received in relation to the individual's pieces. But this is unlikely to be enough since many people regard correcting errors in newspapers as a waste of time or counter-productive. So the complaint count needs to be supplemented with robust data. Many public services do this by surveying their clients and asking for their views. Newspapers rarely do so, arguing that their indicator of client satisfaction is the number of newspapers sold. But even in the case of a quality newspaper, this may be a poor or even inversely correlated indicator of accuracy. The people who should be polled are the press officers of government departments, agencies and companies that supply the raw material on which the news is based. They are well placed to judge accuracy. Most would be fair-minded enough not to comment on opinion - which in any case should not be found in a news report. There is another element of the performance of working journalists that is hard to monitor: newsworthiness. Here, clients are less useful, as they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about stories which appear in advance of the intended time. Nonetheless, it should be possible to track the follow-up of journalists' stories over a period, to assess the extent to which they are breaking news or simply following the pack. Here the National Health Service can offer a guide. Progressive doctors operate a system of peer review in which small groups of colleagues select a case at random and discuss the way in which one of their number handled it, including the medical outcome. Journalism lends itself to this treatment. Journalists can easily identify the extent to which one of their colleagues has been ahead of the pack in a particular case. One might select, to take recent examples, the Citizen's Charter White Paper, or the Soviet coup, and check how many of the moves were correctly forecast by each political correspondent. Taking these ideas together, one can see the outline of a robust performance monitoring system for journalists. In a perfect world, the results would be publicly available. League tables of political or economic correspondents would be compulsive reading. Assembling them would give the Press Complaints Commission something to do. And they might even sell more newspapers. The author is controller of the Audit Commission.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued ahead of State of Union address Wall Street SHARE prices were becalmed in light trading yesterday, as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of today's important State of the Union address to Congress by President George Bush, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,240.61, having spent the day only a few points above Friday's finish. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.50 down at 414.98, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks lost 3.68 to 621.00. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 191m shares, while rises outscored falls by a narrow margin. After last week's declines, the market opened in a subdued mood yesterday. All eyes were fixed on the US president's State of the Union speech, scheduled for 8pm New York time this evening. Mr Bush is expected to unveil a package of tax cuts aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy. Although tax cuts should be generally positive for the stock markets, there is concern that any measures would lead to a widening in the budget deficit, which could prompt a sharp rise in bond yields. Diversified securities house Merrill Lynch shed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/8 in spite of record full-year earnings of Dollars 696m, achieved with the help of a Dollars 171m fourth-quarter profit. The record figures had been expected in the wake of buoyant securities markets in the final quarter, and the decline in the price yester-day was put down to profit-taking following the stock's strong performance over the past 52 weeks. LA Gear slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 1/2 after the company formally announced the retirement of Mr Robert Greenberg, its founder, from the posts of chairman and chief executive. The sports-shoe maker will unveil a new marketing campaign this week. Of its rivals, Nike eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 72 1/2 and Reebok International relinquished Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 30 1/2 . Chrysler enjoyed a rare gain, advancing Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 on the back of a reported upgrading from Shearson Lehman, the broking house. The remaining members of the Big Three car manufacturers also firmed, with General Motors adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 34 1/8 and Ford rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 . On the over-the-counter market, Hutchinson Technology climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 24 3/4 after reporting net income of 54 cents a share for the first fiscal quarter, well up on the 35 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago. Going the other way on the earnings front was Arkansas Freightways, which tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 on news of a fourth-quarter profit of 20 cents a share, down from the 33 cents earned a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks, after a firm opening, fell back to close with an easier bias on balance after moderate trading. A weak Canadian dollar, however, helped some resource-based issues to improve. The composite index was finally 2.2 off at 3,628.5, while declining issues outnumbered advances by 308 to 267. Volume decreased to 23.3m shares from Friday's 28m. The index was ahead almost 15 points in the first half-hour of trading, but quickly settled back and then traded in a narrow range for the rest of the day. Du Pont Canada 'A' dipped CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 41 1/4 . The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of CDollars 14.3m, or 46 cents a share, up from CDollars 10.3m, or 33 cents, a year earlier.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Letter: Soviets and emigration law Sir, Having recently returned from a British human rights mission to Moscow it is with regret that I read your report (May 7) of the consideration being given by the Soviet parliament to the latest draft of the emigration law. First promised in 1989, successive drafts of the emigration law have failed to comply with minimum standards of international law. Our own examination of the fourth draft found it to be seriously lacking and a cause of great concern. Under the conditions set by the British government for their attendance at a human rights conference in Moscow scheduled for September 1991, the Soviet Union is required to meet its commitments to freedom of emigration and freedom under the law. The adoption of the emigration law in its current state would satisfy neither these conditions nor the essential commitments. Sir Bernard Braine MP House of Commons London SW1A OAA</p>

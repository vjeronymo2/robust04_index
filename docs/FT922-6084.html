			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Ericsson in Dollars 42m mobile phone deal ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications company, announced yesterday it had signed a contract worth Dollars 42m (Pounds 23m) for the extension of the mobile telephone network in the Guangdong province of China with additional capacity for 55,000 subscribers, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. After signing the contract in Stockholm, Mr Lars Ramqvist, the company's president, urged the Swedish government to ease its current trade restrictions with China which were imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre nearly three years ago. The company itself has arranged the financing of the deal because Sweden's public aid credit body - Bits - has not been allowed to provide the kind of credits that were needed. Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, the Swedish trade minister, said yesterday that the government was considering whether to ease the existing restrictions but he could give no timetable of when they were likely to be abolished. The new deal for the Guangdong mobile telephone network will be implemented during the first quarter of next year, Ericsson said. The original installation began in 1988 and covers 95,000 subscribers.</p>

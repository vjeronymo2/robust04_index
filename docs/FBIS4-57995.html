			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Nicaraguan Finance Minister Emilio </F> Pereira with unidentified reporters at the Augusto Cesar Sandino  International Airport in Managua; from the "This Morning"  newscast; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] [Pereira] ...that Nicaraguan people have followed,  and this exposes the [words indistinct] country's stability.    [Reporter] What is your opinion on the results of the  Sandinist Special Congress?    [Pereira] It is important for the country's future  development to show political stability. This is why it is very  important [words indistinct] of the parties to show the rest of  the world that Nicaraguans have a (?common vision) of the  country and that we all want the same thing for this country.  The results concern us [words indistinct] because, basically,  one current imposed itself on another. In one way or another  pluralism [words indistinct) future development of democracy in  Nicaragua [words indistinct] is not clear with these results.  More than anything, the radical sector, which seized the key  positions, has had a marked influence.    [Words indistinct] the government's economic and social  policy. To a certain extent this [word indistinct] because the  economic and social policy followed by the government has been  aimed mainly at correcting mistakes of the past and dismantling  a number of things, such as controls on domestic commerce and  foreign trade, bank monopolies, and the concentration of  businesses in state hands [words indistinct] reverse many things  that the previous government had done.    Given that the previous government was headed by Daniel  Ortega, who now heads the Sandinist National Liberation Front  [FSLN], as determined by the Special Congress, he obviously  tends to oppose our actions because we are [word indistinct]  many things they did. I have, however, said publicly that  Daniel Ortega was going to face a very difficult situation.    If the FSLN does not change -- although he has this  opportunity and his party gave him this new responsibility -- in  the long term the FSLN might not survive. If the party changes  [words indistinct] direction of what the government has been  doing; that is, that savings are valuable, taxes are paid,  credits cannot be given away. An economy based on subsidies  [word indistinct] in Nicaragua or elsewhere in the world. We  must transfer productive resources from the public sector to the  private sector and reduce consumption to increase production  [words indistinct] there are simply no resources to meet all  that demand.    A responsible political leader must tell [passage  indistinct]. Thus, my opinion is that there is some concern  because the current that [words indistinct] needed to help  Nicaragua move forward [passage indistinct] there will be  contributions to this country if there is a change within the  FSLN. If it does not change there will be no progress [words  indistinct] for the good of Nicaragua.    [Reporter] Dr. Pereira, in his speech Daniel Ortega called  for three things: promoting a national movement to win the 1996  elections, defending revolutionary achievements, and confronting  the government's neoliberal policies.    [Pereira] I think that it is important that there exists in  this country the political desire to win the upcoming elections  to [words indistinct] of this country. The great [words  indistinct] of Nicaraguans is that the fate of this country has  been in the hands of extremists [words indistinct] if we  continue to leave the fate of this country in the hands of  extremists. The church itself, in its recent pastoral letter,  called on all citizens to participate in politics [words  indistinct] power fell in the hands of extremes in Somozist and  Sandinist times [words indistinct].    As for the neoliberal policy [words indistinct] we are  promoting a market economy. In the modern world, unfortunately,  the market economy model and the [word indistinct] is the model  that will create employment in a sustainable manner and will  reduce poverty [words indistinct] in these modern times would be  deceitful [passage indistinct].    As for the achievements of the FSLN, I think that [words  indistinct] among the poor, but for that to happen conditions  must be created to produce material goods and wealth. Many of  the great achievements of the Sandinist process [words  indistinct] based on Socialism. During their 10 years in office  that government spent more than it received in revenues. When a  government spends more than it receives, it makes society  poorer. It is not possible to [words indistinct] of the poor  when society was made poorer for consecutive years. Only when  the government spends less than it receives in revenues will it  be able to [word indistinct] society.    Thus, the way to combat any problem [words indistinct] that  there be austerity and savings, that the size of the public  sector be reduced, that the productive sector be programmed  differently, and above all, that there be contributions to the  attainment of political stability. In this country [words  indistinct] of those who burn tires and stage uprisings, is to  deceive the people.    I recently read a report on the situation in the rural  sector related to how the previous administration's economic  program caused a real disaster, specifically in the condition of  rural women. I am convinced that this is why they lost the  elections.    The entire population, and mostly women, are aware of the  unfortunate consequences that could come about when the country  is continuously subsidized, there is ceaseless paternalism, and  it is treated like a small child. We recently visited several  San Carlos communities, and it was quite refreshing to listen to  the people say that they were not interested in any type of  subsidies or handouts and that all they really wanted was an  opportunity to work. This can be accomplished through an  economic model such as the one we are currently promoting. This  is the same case throughout most of the rural sector and also as  it relates to women. These sectors are aware that the practice  of granting largess and subsidies does not lead [words  indistinct].    In concluding, I would like to say that I believe that,  regarding economic policy, the only thing we can learn from the  previous administration is exactly what we should not do.  Nevertheless, that does not solve the problems of the most  needy sectors; you are all aware of this. Regarding FSLN  economic policies, it is quite clear that there has been no  encouragement to attract investments, and this is not something  the government says. This has also been a major Sandinist  failure. On the social side, there has also been a lot of  cosmetics.    Therefore, looking at things objectively, I believe that  those of us who are involved in the dialogue are aware that  there is an opportunity for Daniel Ortega. If he simply starts  to promote a policy of sustainable growth based on [word  indistinct], then I believe that he can truly contribute. If he  changes his practice of promoting violence, aggression, and  confrontation, then he can definitely contribute. This will  also be the case if he makes promises based on concrete  arguments and not vague [words indistinct], then he can most  definitely contribute. If changes are made in the right  direction, he can obviously contribute enormously, and the  Nicaraguan people will be thankful.    Now, regarding the elections, my forecast is that they  definitely stand no chance of winning. The Nicaraguan people  still remember quite clearly. Obviously the FSLN still has a  long road to travel mostly to recover its identity, if not its  unity. However, this does not mean they do not possess an  identity. Identity entails having a clear economic program on  what can be done to contribute to the country's development. So  far, the only thing that has happened is that they have blocked  this country's development. We still have to see what they can  do to develop this country.</p>

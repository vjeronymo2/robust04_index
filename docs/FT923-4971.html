			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia waits for Dollars 35m mining credit THE WORLD Bank is to release a Dollars 35m credit to the Bolivian mining industry over the next two weeks according to Mr Jorge P. Quiroga, the Bolivian finance minister. A mission from the World Bank is in Bolivia to discuss recent changes within Comibol, the state mining corporation. These include the replacement of the corporation's president, Mr Alberto Ono Villegas by Dr Marcelo Perez Monasterios and the announcement of a radical redundancy programme. Negotiations are likely to continue into next week, according to Comibol officials. The World Bank has been withholding the credit, Dollars 22m of which was earmarked for the restructuring of Comibol, until the corporation speeded up the joint venture process and slimmed down its bureaucracy. As far as Comibol's long term prospects are concerned, Bolivian planning minister Mr Samuel Doria Medina says he believes the country's constitution will be changed within the next year to allow the corporation's full privatisation. However, a more immediate stumbling block to the release of the World Bank credit is the decision by Comibol this week to reject a joint venture deal with Minera Tiwanacu concerning the Bolivar mine. The deal was widely expected to be finalised by the end of this month. In rejecting the deal, Bolivian mining minister Mr Alvaro Rejas said Tiwanacu's plan to build a concentrate plant at nearby Poopo, rather than on the site of the Bolivar mine, was 'unsuitable'. Industry representative say, however, that the Tiwanacu deal was turned down because of parliamentary pressure on Comibol's board and discrepancies in Tiwanacu's bid. In addition, the original contract specifications sent out by Comibol were widely condemned as too imprecise. Tiwanacu is the third company to have attempted a joint venture deal for the Bolivar mine. New invitations to tender for the mine have been issued.</p>

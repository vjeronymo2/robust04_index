			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (6): Years of challenge  -What the property developers did AT the start of the 1980s, Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, invited the property industry to take part in 'the great experiment of rebuilding new towns in old cities'. A decade later, after some striking successes and equally notable failures, the experiment continues in a substantially modified form. The enterprise zones and urban development corporations that were set up in the 1980s, will, with the occasional exception, give way to a new set of initiatives reflecting the lessons of the last decade. 'We need to learn from the 1980s,' says Mr Victor Hausner, whose London-based consultancy is advising the government on urban renewal. The 1980s vision of urban regeneration was to transform the character of run-down areas, by harnessing the energy of the private sector. The local authorities were largely excluded from the process, as their complex planning regulations and sometimes hostile attitude to business were seen as obstructive during the 1970s. The architects of these proposals can claim that they overturned the scepticism and inertia that dogged inner city renewal during previous decades. Inner cities managed to attract many times as much investment from the private sector as from public funds. But the roles of the public and private sectors are now being reassessed. Following the worst property recession in living memory, it will be some years before the private sector again takes such a prominent role. The parlous financial state of many companies has forced them to put ambitious regeneration schemes in mothballs. Moreover, the government's policy of stimulating an area by tax breaks without any strategic planning in derelict areas has sometimes accentuated their problems, most notably in the London docklands which has become something of a graveyard for developers. The London docklands, which has gone from boom to bust in a spectacular fashion, is perhaps a special case. Other inner cities which always had a greater struggle to attract investment did not become victims of their own success and may now be less affected by the downturn. 'Recession hasn't dented our activity; we have weathered it very well,' says Ms Fiona Blackwell of Teesside Development Corporation. But a broader question which concerns all the development authorities set up by the government is whether the concept of using property development as a way of regenerating an area is a wise one. The government saw its mission as a matter of restoring the economic life of areas that had been drained by depopulation and the decline of manufacturing industry, 'The concept was to take a run-down area and transform its character so that it attracted people in where previously it had encouraged people out,' said Mr Heseltine. But the government's critics argue that it put too much emphasis on physical regeneration and too little on helping the communities who live in inner cities. 'It is a fundamentally flawed approach,' says Mr Bob Colenutt of the Docklands Consultative Committee which is about to publish a report on urban policy in the 1990s. 'The whole policy seems to be based on focusing public money on property-led flagship schemes, set against a background when public services like public transport and social housing are getting worse.' Mr Hausner, the department's adviser, recognises this criticism. He distinguishes between two aspects of urban policy: that concerning disadvantaged communities, such as training and education, and that concerning mainstream private sector regeneration. 'Those elements have to be linked more closely,' he says. Mr Hausner believes that the government is addressing this issue in its City Challenge scheme in which local authorities, acting with private developers, compete for extra funds from the government. This demonstrates, he says, that the government is no longer turning its back on the local authorities, whose input is central to the City Challenge. Moreover, the local authorities are taking an active approach to implementing their policy, often by recruiting executives to take care of their programmes. This is a step towards overcoming one of failings of the 1980s, which was weak implementation of policy, he says. The City Challenge proposals have been criticised as a 'game show' by the Labour party, which is concerned that it merely slices cash off existing urban and housing schemes and involves no new funds. Other critics such as Mr Nigel Smith of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyor, thinks that some of the proposals may be impractical as they lack sufficient property expertise. But the City Challenge scheme has probably been successful in laying the groundwork for a more successful partnership between the local authorities and the private sector than has been seen for two decades. According to Mr Ted Watts, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 'local authorities have taken on board the need not to take on everything themselves but to involve the private sector'. Beyond the City Challenge proposals, government policy on urban regeneration is not yet wholly defined. The new urban regeneration agency, the more interventionist philosophy of the Department of Trade and Industry and the increasing attention paid by the EC to urban centres will all shape policy during the 1990s. The private sector, now taking a largely back seat role, will play an increasing part as the property sector comes out of recession. Mr Nigel Smith of Drivers Jonas reports that in some parts of the country developers are still active, although in the commercial sector pre-lets and pre-sales are essential. He thinks there are grounds for optimism about the partnership between the public and private sector. Developers will be encouraged by the government's greater willingness to put money into infrastructure, to do more planning and to release land in more manageable lot sizes. 'There is more realism,' he says. Mr Hausner agrees that the more realistic approach adopted by the public sector augurs well for private sector developers. 'The situation is one of great potential if we learn lessons from the 1980s,' he says. 'There is a lot to play for.'</p>

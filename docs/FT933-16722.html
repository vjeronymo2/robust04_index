			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Government sells property concerns THE SALE of part of the Property Services Agency, which manages the government's property estate, was announced yesterday. The government has sold two of the agency's five building-management businesses to a joint venture between Amec, the contractor, and Pell Frischmann, an engineering and project-management consultancy. The sale figure was a net Pounds 11.4m over the next four years. The joint venture has bought the BM South East and BM South &amp; West businesses. The government has guaranteed work worth Pounds 400m during the next five years. The Department of the Environment said it would meet the cost of redundancies over the next five years, up to an agreed figure. Many of the 3,300 staff are expected to seek redundancy although Amec said it would seek to persuade the entire staff to transfer to the new company. The sale of the remaining three building-management businesses is expected within the next few weeks. Their sale will complete the privatisation of the Property Services Agency. The sell-off began last year with the sale of its project division to Tarmac, the construction and building materials group. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk, the property company which went into receivership in May, will be chairman of the joint venture.</p>

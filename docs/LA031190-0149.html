			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNLV CRUSHES PACIFIC, PREPARES FOR BIG SHOW  </P> <P> Mercifully, the preliminaries are nearing an end for Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> After laying waste to the University of the Pacific, 99-72, in front of 10,597  Saturday night in the Long Beach Arena, there is only one more.  </P> <P> The Rebels play Cal State Long Beach in the Big West Conference tournament  championship game today at 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Then it's on to the NCAA tournament, which should provide a more suitable stage  for the Rebels to strut their stuff.  </P> <P> Against Pacific, a team it had beaten by 40 points this season and had won its  first tournament game since 1986 on Friday, UNLV played with great indifference  at times.  </P> <P> The Rebels, third-ranked and now 27-5, showed flashes of the brilliance some  believe will carry them to the Final Four.  </P> <P> Their smothering man-to-man defense stifled Pacific (15-14).  </P> <P> UNLV struck with startling quickness, passing the ball inside to Larry Johnson  and David Butler for easy baskets. Pacific seemed defenseless to stop the pair.  </P> <P> Johnson had 20 points, making nine of 12 from the field. Butler had 15 and  Anderson Hunt had 19.  </P> <P> Stacey Augmon, who had 16 points, flew through the lane to slam home a miss by  Butler early in the game and was no less spectacular finishing off numerous  fast breaks.  </P> <P> But at other times, UNLV had trouble taking Pacific seriously. The Rebels' lack  of emotion was one reason the Tigers trailed just 44-33 at halftime.  </P></p>

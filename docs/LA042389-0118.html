			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Corporate watchdog Ralph Nader said in San Jose that the growing destruction of  Earth's protective ozone layer is tantamount to "silent violence" by high-tech  companies that continue to release ozone-attacking chemicals. Nader, speaking  on the eve of the international "Earth Day '89," cited a report by Citizens for  a Better Environment describing IBM's San Jose facility, which released 1.4  million pounds of a chlorofluorocarbon into the atmosphere in 1987, as the  world's worst offender.  </P></p>

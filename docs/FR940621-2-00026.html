Most commercial reactor fuel is enriched to about 4 to 5 percent uranium-235.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials is used to refer to a specific set of nuclear materials that may be utilized in making a nuclear explosive for a weapon. Weapons-usable fissile materials include uranium with uranium-235 isotopic content of 20 percent or more, plutonium of any isotopic composition, and other isotopes such as uranium-233, americium-241, and neptunium-237 which have been separated from spent nuclear fuel or irradiated targets. The term weapons-usable fissile materials does not include the fissile materials present in spent nuclear fuel or irradiated targets from reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Invitation to Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE invites comments on the scope of this PEIS from all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and local agencies and Indian tribes. DOE solicits comments regarding the scope of the PEIS analysis, suggestions on significant environmental issues, alternatives to be included in the PEIS, and other matters of content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure consideration of comments in preparing the draft PEIS, written comments must be postmarked by October 17, 1994. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable. Agencies, organizations, and the general public are invited to present oral comments pertinent to preparation of the PEIS at public scoping workshops. DOE will also accept written material at the workshops. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public scoping workshops to provide information and discuss and receive comments on the scope of the PEIS will be held during August and September 1994, both regionally and in the vicinity of the sites which may be affected by the proposed action. A national public scoping workshop will also be held in Washington, DC. DOE will announce the location, date and time for these public workshops in a subsequent Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and by other appropriate means as early as practicable. The Department will endeavor to provide 30 days notice prior to any applicable workshops. Advance registration to provide oral comments at these workshops will be facilitated using an ``800 number'' that will be provided in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. On-site registration to provide oral comments will be accommodated to the extent possible.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed in Washington, DC this 15th day of June 1994, for the United States Department of Energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Tara O'Toole,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environment, Safety and Health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15119 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

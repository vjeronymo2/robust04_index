A civil war of its three constitutive peoples -- Moslems,  Serbs and Croats -- has been raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina since  April 1992.    Clinton on Friday evening [14 January] told Russian  television that the U.S. supported Bosnian Moslems because it  supports the multi-national government of Bosnia-Herzegovina  which is recognized by the United Nations. Clinton, however,  immediately added that his country knew that the Bosnian  Government included mostly Moslem elements. The U.S. supports  the U.N. mission and wants the bloodshed of people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to end, the U.S. President said.    There are no more legally elected representatives of Bosnian  Serbs or Bosnian Croats in the authorities of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. They walked out of all legal organs because  Bosnian Moslems, violating the constitutionally established  equality of the three peoples, want to enforce their domination.    The Serbs were the first to leave the Bosnian leadership  because the Moslem-Croat authorities asked for the recognition  of the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina without their  approval, although the Constitution specifically said that major  decisions can be adopted only on the grounds of consensus among  the three peoples. Disagreeing with the insistence of Bosnian  Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic on a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina  in which his fellow Moslems and Islam would dominate, Bosnian  Serbs and Bosnian Croats have proclaimed their own state  communities -- the Serb republic and the Croatian republic of  Herzeg-Bosna, respectively.</p>

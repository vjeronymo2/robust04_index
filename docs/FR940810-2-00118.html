The Fund is a Maryland corporation registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified management investment company. G.R. Phelps is the investment adviser for the Fund. The Fund currently consists of six separate portfolios, (individually a ``Portfolio'' and collectively, the ``Portfolios''): The Money Market Portfolio, the Government Securities Portfolio, the Income Portfolio, the Total Return Portfolio, the Growth Portfolio, and the International Equity Portfolio. Each Portfolio has its own investment objective, or objectives, and policies. Presently, shares of the Fund are sold to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company (``CML'') to be credited, as appropriate, to its Panorama Separate Account, CML Variable Annuity Account A, CML Variable Annuity Account B, and CML Accumulation Annuity Account E. Each of these separate accounts established by CML funds benefits under variable annuity contracts issued by CML. Shares of the Fund are also sold to C.M. Life Insurance Company (``C.M. Life''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CML, to be credited to its Panorama Plus Separate Account to fund benefits under variable annuity contracts issued by C.M. Life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Shares of the Fund, may, in the future, be sold to other separate accounts established by CML or C.M. Life or to other issuers of variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. Specifically, the Fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of any interested insurance company, including insurance companies unaffiliated with CML, in order to fund variable annuity contracts, single premium variable life insurance contracts, scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, and/or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts (referred to collectively as ``variable contracts''). Such Participating Insurance Companies will establish their own Separate Accounts and will design their own variable contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Personal View: Europe must sharpen competitive edge Would the chief executive of a multinational company with Dollars 1bn to invest choose Europe as a location during the next decade? My experience is that many large companies are directing discretionary investment elsewhere. Why? Europe is an enormous market, but despite rises in gross domestic product per capita, Europe's ageing population and low birth rates point to slower growth in the future. Moreover, the World Competitiveness Report, compiled by the Imede business school in Switzerland, points out that a region's competitiveness is grounded in processes that turn assets into results. It concludes that Europe is not transforming ideas into better products, more quickly and more cheaply than other regions. Increasing trade deficits and unemployment are the result. At the same time, it costs more to produce in Europe today than anywhere else in the world. One factor is the high cost of labour and the inflexibility of rules and regulations affecting it. Another is the fact that energy, many raw materials and telecommunications cost more in Europe than in the US and Japan. All this suggests Europe has yet to confront its competitive disadvantages - or pursue its competitive advantages. Policymakers should focus their attention in four areas. First, giant strides have been made towards a genuine single market, but the job of freeing up business is far from complete. The Uruguay Round is important, but free trade is about more than the absence of tariffs - it requires the elimination of old mindsets that are still evident in Europe. Consider an example: improving efficiency in the workplace. Instead of a dialogue about how production processes can be streamlined, we have seen in Europe a long, unresolved debate about procedural mechanisms for consulting workers. In other regions, new work systems are being tested and adopted to make companies more aggressive, customer-orientated and productive. Second, European Union laws and regulations should be simplified to allow companies to organise themselves efficiently. One particular problem is the variety of national requirements in Europe which mean companies have to organise networks of local subsidiaries. The administrative costs of parallel national subsidiaries add cost but no value to the customer. In the US, a company can be incorporated in one state and operate in all 50. Third, policymakers should recognise that industrial restructuring is essential to long-term competitiveness. It can take several forms, including the shutting down of excess capacity or obsolete plants, modernising assets to make them globally competitive, and purchasing or selling businesses to focus a company's strengths. A year ago DuPont acquired ICI's nylon business and ICI acquired DuPont's acrylics business. Approval for that agreement was given by the European Commission in a timely way - more timely than the process required by the US Federal Trade Commission. We found officials of the European Commission to be enlightened, focused on economic and competitive realities, and quicker than US counterparts. European companies should see that as an advantage. While facing up to the need for restructuring, Europeans should also realise that eastern Europe is not a drag, it is an opportunity - a frontier. But standard project analysis is likely to preclude many companies from investing in eastern Europe because of risk and long-term payment concerns. Business and government will require leadership and determination to see eastern Europe as an opportunity rather than western Europe's special burden. Finally, it is important that Europe adopts a single currency. From the international perspective, this is essential for European integration and for creating a transparent market. Without a single market it is difficult to harmonise the terms under which we deal with our customers in different countries - who are, after all, competing in a single market. Years of patient and difficult effort to promote a level playing field have been undone overnight by recent devaluations. We are, for example, still feeling the effects of the devaluations of the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish currencies, as well as the floating of the Italian and British currencies - some of which took place nearly two years ago. I believe Europe can find the resolve needed to make progress on social, economic and political fronts. But the successful integration of the European market is not a foregone conclusion and it is not clear Europe has yet realised the change needed to become internationally competitive.

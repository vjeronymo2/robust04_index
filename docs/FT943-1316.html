			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates reach year's best level - Annuities Annuity rates are at their highest since the start of the year, having risen by an average of 16.5 per cent. This week, some life companies increased their rates against a background of rises in long-term gilt yields. These were 8.9 per cent on September 12 - the day the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, announced a half percentage point increase in base rates - and had risen to 9.25 per cent by September 20. As the table shows, Royal Life is looking very competitive, having raised all its annuity rates on September 20. Sun Life of Canada and Canada Life have also increased theirs. Since the start of September, annuity levels at Canada Life have increased by around 2 per cent, at Royal Life by around 4.5 per cent, and at Sun Life by around 2.4 per cent. These rates cover a male aged 60 on a particular set of benefits. The uncertainty of how long-term interest rates will perform and this week's fall in bonds are, however, beginning to affect the annuity market. And while annuity rates are quite high at the moment, most actuaries are expecting them to fall slightly as the year draws to a close. Thus, it is imperative for you to shop around for the annuity best suited to your needs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LATEST ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory purchase level annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 55              Annuity   Female age 50         Annuity                         (Pounds)                        (Pounds) Royal Life             10,358.55   Royal Life           9,445.24 Sun Life of Canada     10,210.73   Prudential           9,161.64 Prudential             10,123.56   Sun Life of Canada   9,155.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60              Annuity   Female age 60         Annuity                         (Pounds)                        (Pounds) Royal Life             11,211.59   Royal Life          10,417.17 Sun Life of Canada     11,079.25   Sun Life of Canada  10,100.94 Prudential             10,929.48   Prudential          10,058.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70              Annuity   Female age 70         Annuity                         (Pounds)                        (Pounds) RNPFN                  14,492.76   Royal Life          12,683.00 Royal Life             14,389.44   RNPFN               12,512.52 Canada Life            14,180.04   Canada Life         12,295.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint Life - 100% spouse's benefit Male 60/Female 57        Annuity   Male 65/Female 63     Annuity                         (Pounds)                        (Pounds) Royal Life              9,529.18   Royal Life          10,119.83 Sun Life of Canada      9,253.01   Sun Life of Canada   9,815.37 Prudential              9,234.12   Prudential           9,777.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance.

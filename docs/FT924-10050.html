			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Australia urges G7 to speed trade talks SOME 29 countries led by Australia yesterday urged leaders of the seven main industrialised countries to intervene to have the Uruguay Round trade talks wound up by the end of this year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The move, coinciding with further EC-US farm talks in Chicago yesterday, reflects the frustration of many smaller Gatt members at the failure of the two trading giants to settle their remaining differences. This has held up the 108-nation Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva since the end of last year. The statement, sent by Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, on behalf of the 29, urges the Group of Seven leaders to complete the round this year. 'Without an urgent solution to outstanding differences this deadline will not be met and a successful conclusion to the entire round will be put at risk,' the statement says. The signatories, including members of the Cairns group of farm exporters, the Nordic countries, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and South Korea, say the economic and trade interests at stake are not those of the G7 alone, 'but of the entire international community'.</p>

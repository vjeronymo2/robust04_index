Khazins; UDC 533.6.011]    [Abstract] This paper presents a numerical analysis of a  new effect of shock wave focusing which is caused by a thin  extended gas layer of lower density at the side wall of a  cylindrical tube when a wave is reflected from the flat end of  the tube. The gas layer is in front of the shock wave and normal  to the wave. It is shown in a model (using Euler equations and  an antidiffusion scheme) that the gas dynamic parameters in the  vicinity of the center of the end face increase by a factor of  5-10 (for strong shock waves) compared to the parameters  trailing a reflected stationary flat shock wave. The diffuse gas  layer may form naturally due to heating by heat fluxes from the  front of a strong shock wave, or may be formed artificially by  heating the surface. An isobar figure illustrates shock wave  configuation and currents behind the shock wave just after it is  reflected from the end of the tube. The increased pressure is a  local and short-lived effect, but it is strong. Large-scale  eddies are formed after the shock wave is reflected. The effect  must be experimentally verified.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Provocations by SOC -- </F> Three-Month Ultimatum"]    [Text] The Serbian Orthodox Church [SOC] is continuing with  provocations of the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Orthodox Church [MOC]. As it is known, the  SOC has given the MOC a "three-month deadline to return to the  canonic order, and if not, an appropriate church procedure would  be initiated."    Last Friday [10 June], the Macedonian authorities from the  border near Tabanovce, escorted the Vranje bishop of the SOC  Pahomie back to Serb territory, who was recently appointed  "administrator of the eparchies in Macedonia" by the SOC. His  intention was to submit the decision of the Holy Synod of the  SOC to the "Skopje and Macedonia metropolitan Mr. Mihail." He  also carried a request to the Macedonian border organs to enable  the interrupted entrance of the Serbian priests into Macedonia  and the uninterrupted execution of their mission and intention  -- holding religious services in Serbian language in the  Macedonian churches.    The decision of the Macedonian authorities not to allow  Pahomie to enter Macedonia, created an outburst in Serbia. The  media mainly operates with the arguments such as violation of  human rights, deprivation of rights, brutal use of force,  insulting priests who have come in a "mission of God," etc.    A representative of the MOC stated yesterday that the Holy  Synod of the MOC did not receive an official announcement from  the SOC regarding the arrival of the Vranje bishop Pahomie, nor  the message which was supposed to be sent to the Archbishop of  Macedonia and Ohrid Mr. Mihail.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-FED CHIEF TO FILL U.S. CAMPEAU JOB, PAPER SAYS  </P> <P> G. William Miller, who has been Treasury secretary and chairman of the Federal  Reserve Board, has tentatively agreed to take the helm of the U.S. retailing  operations of troubled Campeau Corp., a Canadian newspaper reported Saturday.  </P> <P> Neither Miller, currently a member of Toronto-based Campeau's board of  directors, nor other Campeau officials could be reached for comment on the  report by the Financial Post of Canada.  </P> <P> As reported Saturday, a source familiar with Campeau's plans said the company  was expecting to name, possibly as soon as today, a prominent figure with a  background in business, law and politics to become the new U.S. chairman.  </P> <P> Miller, who holds a law degree from UC Berkeley, was chairman of the Federal  Reserve in 1978-79 and Treasury secretary from 1979-81 in the Jimmy Carter  Administration. Before entering government, he was chief executive of the  Providence, R.I.-based conglomerate Textron Inc.  </P> <P> He currently runs a Washington consulting firm bearing his name.  </P> <P> Campeau last week announced plans to establish an independent U.S.  organization, headed by a new chairman, to operate its retailing divisions.  Those divisions include the Compton-based Ralphs supermarkets chain, along with  Campeau's debt-burdened Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores  divisions.  </P> <P> The autonomy plan was intended largely as a prelude to seeking bankruptcy court  protection for the Federated and Allied units, the source close to Campeau  said. Although they have no outlets in Southern California, Federated and  Allied make up the second-largest department store organization in the United  States.  </P> <P> According to the Financial Post, the Federated and Allied bankruptcy protection  filings would probably be made in Cincinnati, where the department store  operations are based. The anticipated filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal  Bankruptcy Code would give the department stores time to stay in business and  reorganize while protected from interference by creditors.  </P> <P> The department stores' problems stem from huge takeover debts related to  Campeau's acquisition of Allied for $3.5 billion in 1986 and its purchase of  Federated for $6.6 billion in 1988. Campeau's department stores include  Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche.  </P></p>

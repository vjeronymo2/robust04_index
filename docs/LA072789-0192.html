			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON WHEELS: CAR THEFT RANKING IS NOT TOO ALARMING  </P> <P> You say you're fed up with Orange County: the traffic, the high cost of  housing, the hectic pace? You're thinking Fresno might be nice. Maybe  Sacramento. Or even someplace in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Well here's at least one reason to stay put. Your car is much more likely to be  stolen in any of those counties than it is here. Twice as likely, in fact, in  San Diego County, which has the dubious distinction of ranking first in car  thefts among California's 58 counties.  </P> <P> According to statistics just compiled by the Tustin-based Western Insurance  Information Service, San Diego County had 1,645.19 car thefts per 100,000  residents in 1988 and the first part of 1989. Orange County, with 792.36  vehicle thefts per 100,000 residents, was ninth.  </P> <P> San Francisco County was second with 1,335.52 thefts per 100,000, followed by  Los Angeles County with 1,326.95, Sacramento County with 1,082.06 and Fresno  County with 907.73. Riverside County placed sixth with a rate of 849.82. In  seventh place was San Bernardino County, whose rate was 849.24. Alameda County  ranked eighth with a rate of 805.09, and San Joaquin County placed 10th with  684.77 thefts per 100,000 people.  </P> <P> Sierra County placed last with a goose egg -- not a single car reported stolen.  </P> <P> The median rate, according to WIIS spokeswoman Debbie Rosenzweig, was 287.67.  </P> <P> If you happen to drive a 1988 Hyundai Excel, you might want to look into life  in mountainous, remote Sierra County -- or at least stay out of San Diego  County. Those particular Hyundais are stolen more often than any other car in  California, according to Rosenzweig. In second through 10th place are various  models of Toyotas. And the 1987 Hyundai Excel came in 11th.  </P> <P> I have my own unscientific theory about why Orange County's car-theft rate is  so low compared to the state's other densely populated counties. We spend so  much time in our cars here that the thieves don't have a chance -- after all,  it's pretty difficult to steal a car that's stuck on a clogged freeway,  especially with the driver still in it.  </P> <P> But for those rare moments when we do leave our cars, car alarms can help foil  thieves.  </P> <P> Even the most sophisticated alarm can't make a car totally theft-proof, of  course. "But thieves tend to pick the cars that are easiest to break into,"  says Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's San Juan Capistrano  station.  </P> <P> Daily, who has a factory-installed alarm on his personal car, says there are  several types of alarms.  </P> <P> "There are motion detectors, which have a switch that is tripped when the car  shakes -- such as when someone hooks it up to tow it away," Daily says. More  sensitive motion detectors can also be attached to windows, sounding the alarm  if a thief jimmies or breaks the glass. Motion detectors can also be wired to  the engine compartment, he says.  </P> <P> Other alarms protect the ignition. "There's an ignition bypass, where you  ground the ignition with a switch and then hide the switch somewhere in the  car. That sets it up so that if you turn the switch on, the car can't be  started," Daily says.  </P> <P> Some alarms use a siren, while others simply set off the car's horn, Daily  says. Most will sound for a few minutes, then reset.  </P> <P> Another theft-prevention device makes no noise at all, but Daily says it's one  of the most effective. It's a J-shaped piece of metal that attaches to the  steering wheel, or in some cases to the wheel and brake pedal. Of course,  neither that locking device nor alarms linked to a car's ignition system can  keep a thief from ripping out your car's stereo.  </P> <P> Some radios in more expensive cars are electronically coded so that if they're  removed and installed in another car they won't work, Daily says. But if yours  isn't coded, you might want to try disguising your Blaupunkt or other expensive  system with a fake front to make it look like a cheap radio, he suggests.  </P> <P> Or try a pullout stereo system, suggests Jennifer Keesee, a sales associate at  Anaheim Electronics, which sells and installs both car alarms and stereos.  Keesee says most of her clients don't need a sales pitch because "either  they've just had their cars broken into or they're getting new cars and just  don't want to go through it."  </P> <P> Car alarms start at about $170, installed, and go up to $550, depending on the  type of alarm and the extra features, Keesee says. Some can be turned on and  off with remote-control devices; others are passive, controlled by the car's  ignition. If you're the forgetful type, Keesee says, you might want to get an  alarm with built-in passive arming, which automatically turns on the alarm  after a certain amount of time if you forget to do it.  </P> <P> If you do have an alarm, don't neglect to turn it on, even if the car is in  what you consider a safe place.  </P> <P> Keesee said it's not unusual for car thefts to occur in your own driveway.  </P> <P> "That happens all the time," Keesee says. "People come in and say, 'It was in  my driveway. I thought it was safe.' But it isn't."  </P> <P> Most insurance companies offer a discount to customers who install car alarms,  Rosenzweig says. "It's something the customer is doing to try to help protect  their vehicle, so they do take that into account."  </P> <P> Send your comments to Life on Wheels, Orange County Life, The Times, 1375  Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

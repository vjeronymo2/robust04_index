			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> CUOMO'S NOT AFRAID OF WILLIE HORTON;  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND THEIR FEARS DON'T GET SCORN FROM THIS GOVERNOR.  </P> <P> Mario Cuomo must have shuddered at the electoral punishment handed Michael  Dukakis in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Dukakis sat across the table from Cuomo in Albany and laid out  his optimistic plan to seek the presidency.  </P> <P> It was a no-lose proposition. If he did not make it to the White House, Dukakis  could always return to the job he and Cuomo both love, that of governing an  exciting, culturally diverse, Democratic state.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, Bay State citizens returned their verdict on Dukakis' fallback  career strategy. Democratic primary voters rejected every name on the ballot  even remotely connected with the lame-duck governor. They chose instead as  their candidate for governor Boston University President John Silber, a  maverick running against the Dukakis legacy.  </P> <P> This public execution of his fellow Democrat may cause the New York governor to  rethink the run for the presidency he is considering. It shouldn't. To  paraphrase a line from the 1988 campaign, I know Michael Dukakis, governor. I  covered Michael Dukakis, and you, Mario Cuomo, are no Michael Dukakis.  </P> <P> Not to put too fine a point on it, the departing governor of Massachusetts is  an elitist. He believes in government by the Best and the Brightest and counts  himself at the top of that category.  </P> <P> Such arrogance is a hard sell even in boom times. When the economy takes a deep  dip, as it has here in New England, people wonder what all the bragging was  about. They look at the smug fellow who marketed himself nationwide as the  "Massachusetts miracle" man and wonder if he misplaced his magic wand  somewhere.  </P> <P> Let's get this straight: It wasn't liberalism that killed Michael Dukakis. It  wasn't his belief in government, his compassion for the poor and elderly, or  his support for First Amendment liberties. It was the arrogance he displayed,  not just here at home but in his embarrassing run for the presidency.  </P> <P> Case in point: Willie Horton.  </P> <P> When Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, a Democrat, introduced the Massachusetts prison  "furlough" issue in the 1988 primary, Dukakis treated the question as an  impertinence. His wet-behind-the-ears rival obviously didn't understand how a  "modern criminal justice system" was run.  </P> <P> When George Bush picked up the attack, asking why anyone would let a murderer  like Willie Horton loose for the weekend, Michael Dukakis refused to admit  blame.  </P> <P> It got worse. Instead of saying that the people were right to worry about  killer-rapists like Horton, Dukakis smugly insinuated that the real menace was  the small-minded, possibly racist views of those who spent their time  hand-wringing over the Willie Horton case.  </P> <P> The arrogance was palpable: Here was this swell-educated guy from Harvard Law,  living in a nice, safe suburb telling the country's cabdrivers and night-shift  factory workers that he didn't really want to hear their feelings and fears.  </P> <P> Case No. 2: The "Pledge of Allegiance" issue.  </P> <P> Here, Dukakis displayed the same brand of contempt toward the voters. It's one  thing to defend the rights of teachers to resist leading their classes in the  pledge. It's another to ignore, as Dukakis did, the deeply felt passions of  those who disagree with his position.  </P> <P> Instead of trying to reach out to voters who believe in such rituals, Dukakis  and his people treated the issue as a crude appeal to the great unwashed. He  never accepted the fact that what he was being accused of was not treason but  disdain.  </P> <P> Should the Democratic governor of New York avoid a presidential run out of fear  for the same fate? I don't think so. Cuomo may have vulnerabilities in a  contest with George Bush, but they would not be the same as Dukakis'.  </P> <P> Would Mario Cuomo look down his nose at people worried about crime? Hardly. The  governor of New York keeps a baseball bat under his bed out of personal respect  for the same well-grounded fears.  </P> <P> Would Cuomo be vulnerable on the crime issue? Certainly. But the crime  statistics in New York are at the same flood-level as those in Washington and  elsewhere in George Bush's America.  </P> <P> Let's not forget, it was not the crime rate in Massachusetts that cost Michael  Dukakis in 1988. It was his condescending attitude toward those worried about  crime -- which he capped with an iceman's indifference when asked what he'd do  if someone raped and killed his wife.  </P> <P> I would not expect Mario Cuomo, who raised a family of daughters on the streets  of Queens, to give the same answer. Nor would I expect Mario Cuomo to respond  to an attack on his patriotism by thumbing through a law book. He'd more likely  reach for that bat he keeps under his bed.  </P></p>

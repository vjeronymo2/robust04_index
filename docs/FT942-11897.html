			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Progress in EU-Russia accord The European Commission yesterday raised hopes that agreement over a trade and co-operation accord between the European Union and Russia could be reached in time for signing at the Corfu summit next month. A Commission spokesman said 'excellent progress' had been made by Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner responsible for external economic relations, and Mr Alexander Shokin, the Russian deputy prime minister, who met earlier this week to discuss the two remaining obstacles to the accord - the rules governing the trade in uranium and access for European banks to the Russian banking sector. However, he cautioned that the accord still needed to be approved by member states. France, in particular, is keen to protect its uranium producers. Mr Shokin and Sir Leon agreed to work on an exchange of letters which could pave the way for a compromise.</p>

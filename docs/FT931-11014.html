			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan to announce Caspian Sea oil deals THE GOVERNMENT of Azerbaijan says it is about to announce a series of contracts to major foreign oil companies to explore and exploit reserves in the Caspian Sea. Proven and probable reserves are estimated at about 7bn barrels with further significant discoveries thought likely. These will be the first contracts with foreign companies signed by the former Soviet republic and are likely to establish the country as a significant oil producer within the decade. Mr Saleh Mammedov, the Azeri finance minister, said yesterday that the present production of between 10m and 11m tonnes should rise to 40m tonnes in 1996-97, with further rises thereafter. The Azeri government is looking to a sharp increase in oil output as the major means of reversing a disastrous industrial decline. At the same time, the construction of a pipeline to take the oil out of the country - the only existing line runs into Russia - will profoundly affect the economy and the politics of the entire region. The pipeline project being studied by the Azeri government with the oil majors working in the country comes down to a choice between running through the neighbouring countries of Iran, Georgia or Armenia. Paradoxically, even though Azerbaijan and Armenia are in a state of undeclared war over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, the last route is thought the most likely. This is because a pipeline through Armenia to Turkey could tap into an existing line from Iraq to the Mediterranean port of Iskanderon - unused at present because of sanctions against Iraq - with adequate loading facilities for supertankers. The Georgian route to a Black Sea port would result in a bottleneck of supertankers through the Bosphorus - while the Iranian route is thought politically sensitive. The first agreement between the Azeri State Oil Company and a foreign corporation is likely to be signed as early as Monday. This will be with the Turkish company, AD Petrosan, a subsidiary of the Attila Dogan construction corporation. This relatively small agreement gives the Turkish company 49 per cent of a joint venture to exploit proven and already-working reserves on land. The next deal is likely to be with the US Pennzoil Corporation which, in partnership with Ramco, the UK company, is thought likely to conclude an agreement to up-grade and increase present production in the off-shore Guneshli field from the present 130,000 barrels a day to a level estimated by Pennzoil at 230,000 b/d within the next four years. This deal is being pushed through because of the republic's desperate need to earn hard currency and to raise the low exploitation level of 50-55 per cent of proven reserves. Mr Sabir Bagirov, head of the State Oil Company, said he expected the Pennzoil deal to be signed within a week. The third deal is expected to be with a consortium led by BP, which is exploring reserves in the Turag field, where production is expected to rise to 30m tonnes a year when it comes on stream. BP, with Statoil of Norway, says the Turag field has proven reserves of at least 1bn barrels and claims it is the largest Caspian field yet discovered. The final project, the Amoco-led plan to develop the 2bn-barrel Azeri field, is the least certain of the projects. The Azeri government has postponed a decision because the US Congress has refused to allow humanitarian aid to be sent to Azerbaijan on human rights grounds. The issue is to be raised next week in Baku by Mr Greg Laughlin, a Democratic Congressman from Texas, who is coming to Azerbaijan for talks with the government on the oil contracts.</p>

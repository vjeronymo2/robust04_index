Li mentioned the issue first in the afternoon meeting with  Christopher, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry told a  press briefing. He quoted the premier as saying that hopes for a  non- nuclear Korean peninsula are higher for China than for the  United States and emphasized the international community should  not mobilize any ther?iplomacy with patience to solve the  problem.    Christopher, in response, rated Beijing's constructive role  in realizing the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons,  McCurry said.    The two countries noted with positiveness that the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection has resumed  in North Korea, said the spokesman.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin confirmed that  the North Korean nuclear issue came up at the Li-Christopher  meeting. He said the U.S. side registered concern at the  situation but the Chinese officials delivered their position  that the matter must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and  cooperation.</p>

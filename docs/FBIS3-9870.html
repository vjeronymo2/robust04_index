			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "hop": "The Importance of the Czech Republic in </F> Heroin Trade Is Growing"]    [Text] Prague--Czech policemen managed within a week to  seize 25 kg of pure heroin, which is almost 8 kg more than over  the entire past year. These figures, together with the  statistics of drugs seized in Western Europe, which the  smugglers evidently transported through the territory of the  Czech Republic (less than 750 kg in 1992, 997 kg last year),  testify to the steadily growing quantity of heroin in transit  and to the important status of the Czech Republic on the  so-called Balkan route. A total in excess of 8,000 kg of heroin  was seized in all European states last year, which is one-half  more than in 1988.    Two branches of this smuggling path go through the Czech  Republic. One leads from Istanbul, Turkey, through Sofia,  Belgrade, Budapest, and Prague to the Waldhaus border crossing.  The other branch passing through the Czech-German border begins  in Constanta, Romania. In both instances, the final destination  for the narcotics is Scandinavia and West Europe. According to  police sources, only a marginal part of the narcotics remains in  the Czech Republic. Because of the high price of heroin, its  users are recruited mostly from business circles. Jiri Richter,  director of the National Drug and Information Service, comments  on this: "Recently, the participation of the Czech citizens in  various crime organizations involved in drug smuggling has  grown. It is understandable: The Czech cleverness, longing for  money, and skills are rather expedient features for narcotics  trade."    One of the important sites for drug smuggling is the  [Prague-] Ruzyne airport. Drug couriers from Asia, Africa, and  South America come to Prague and then continue to Europe in cars  or by train. Because of the limited technical possibilities and  lack of legislation, the Prague airport is becoming a suitable  transfer point for smugglers.    Drug-crime specialists point out that the interest in the  Czech Republic on the part of dealers is not ceasing because  dirty money can be laundered here without many problems.  According to them, the individual gangs will attempt to  penetrate the highest political and social strata.</p>

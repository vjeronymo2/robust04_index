			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Philosopher on self-destruct THE PASSION OF MICHEL FOUCAULT by James Miller HarperCollins Pounds 18, 490 pages THE LIVES OF MICHEL FOUCAULT by David Macey Hutchinson Pounds 20, 600 pages CONTEMPORARY French philosophers used to be banned from the Cambridge University syllabus on the grounds that they were 'literary', therefore bogus and faintly unhygienic. The career of Michel Foucault, who died in 1984 having succeeded Jean-Paul Sartre as the arbiter of French intellectual haute couture, explains why. For Foucault used philosophy to take the cult of the self to the limit; it was the self-immolating programme of a tortured personality which left behind a strange corpus of studied exaggerations and baffling arguments. 'I do not say things because I think them,' he once explained. 'I say them rather with the aim of self-destruction, so that I will not have to think them any more.' Even allowing for his irony and the lack of context, the remark suggests that for Foucault philosophy was, after all, a form of defecation. Philosophy, like science, is conventionally supposed to be the study of universals. How, then, should a biographer treat the life of a thinker who says his life is part of his work and that his work is 'to become someone other'? David Macey, an English writer, has taken the traditional route and has produced a heavily-researched, conscientious narrative which will appeal, I guess, only to campus-bound Foucault-followers. The James Miller work is something else altogether. Miller, an American academic, has taken up the challenge of writing Foucault's life in terms the subject himself decreed - as a kind of artistic creation. But to say 'artistic creation' gives the wrong impression. Miller is not engaged on a cheerful, uplifting enterprise. From the first pages describing Foucault's death from Aids it is obvious that this is going to be the pathology of a homosexual, sado-masochist intellectual. No doubt the philosopher's disciples will howl at the desecration of their idol. But Foucault was an iconoclast and Miller is entitled to wield the hammer. He describes a brilliant but psychologically disturbed schoolboy from Poitiers who went through the claustrophobic regime of the Ecole Normale Superieure shunned by his fellows and burning with ambition. The suggestive traumas of Foucault's childhood, fictionally recounted by his lover Herve Guibert after the philosopher's death, could have been presented in evidence here. But Miller keeps them to the end, a token of his even-handedness. Foucault was obsessed with erotic pleasure which in his last years he indulged in the gay bath-houses of San Francisco. He praised suicide, regarded death as the final rapture and sado-masochism (the curious reader will learn from Miller all he ever wants to know about S/M) as a benign, ecstatic 'limit-experience' beyond the bounds of mere sex. There is something heroic as well as revolting about Foucault's extremism. He could be self-effacing, at least after he had achieved fashionable fame with Les Mots et les Choses in 1966, and witty about his uncomprehending audience. Anonymity was the best way of getting an intelligent reaction, he once said, and he called his best-seller 'the most tiresome book I ever wrote'. Yet there was a touch of the Herostratus about this philosopher who crawled round the temple of knowledge laying packets of gelignite against the pillars. Foucault's philosophical godfather was Kant, but his inspiration derived from de Sade, Nietszche and Heidegger. He was an extreme relativist who said madness and sexuality were modern inventions, that prisoners should be released, that rape was equivalent to a punch in the face, that morality was a form of terrorism. One critic compared his 1966 book to Mein Kampf. Others applauded his literary verve but denounced his economy with the facts. Chomsky, the American linguistics guru, described him as an alien from another planet: 'He struck me as completely amoral'. Yet his arguments have been influential. Germany's leading philosopher, Jurgen Habermas, was surprised to find how serious he was; 'I mean, he was a philosopher', he said after meeting him. As he grew older, the philosopher 'came out', in more senses than one. Miller's exegesis, so damaging to begin with, unveils a kinder, calmer, more impressive personality. Foucault turned to the early church Fathers and the ancient Greeks to extol asceticism even while plundering his own body for pleasure. He developed friendships and an almost Socratic benignity. Perhaps he was seeking redemption after all. Do we need people like Foucault? We probably do. He was a red hot poker plunged into the cool, complacent stream of our rationalist thought-system. Perhaps he will prove more important than that. But I doubt it. Miller's provocative, occasionally disgusting, and compelling portrait will be as much as most of us ever want or need to know about Michel Foucault. It may not be a perfect likeness. But then Foucault should be the last to complain.</p>

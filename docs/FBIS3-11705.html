			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday, Cienfuegos Province held its plenum  to summarize the workers parliament process in that province,  where it was stated that more than 100,000 workers participated  in the more than 2,700 workers parliaments held at different  work centers in Cienfuegos Province. Economic efficiency was  recognized as the essential road to Cuba's recovery.  Furthermore, the importance of solving the problems through  common effort and intelligence and through honoring the  principles of the revolution, was stressed.    Several presentations were made during the meeting on what  has been accomplished through the implementation of ideas  brought forth by workers. These demonstrate the point that we  must begin by becoming efficient in our own lives. [passage  omitted]    Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers  Federation [CTC], recognized that Cienfuegos has been very  responsive to the ideas presented in the parliaments and stated  that we do not have to freeze those ideas since new ideas could  arise which could be more fitting to our actual situation. Ross  went on to say that all possibilities have not been considered.  He congratulated Cienfuegos for its dynamism in responding to  the workers.    In his remarks at the plenum summarizing the workers  parliaments in Cienfuegos, Ross said that all the officials that  attended the parliaments should keep in touch and follow up on  those collectives, since we are just beginning the phase of  shaping those ideas presented. Pedro Ross stated that all  problems cannot be solved overnight, but that we must be active  and bold, as is the case in Cienfuegos, through the  implementation of ideas presented at the different workers  parliaments throughout the province.</p>

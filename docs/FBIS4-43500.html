			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Otmar Issing, member of the Bundesbank Board </F> of Directors and professor of economics, by Sabine Richter;  place and date not given: "Interest Rates Have Reached a  Reasonable Level"]    [Text] [Richter] After many small steps, the Bundesbank  has now decided on a surprisingly significant step with respect  to interest rates. Does this mean that the bank is conducting  economic policy?    [Issing] Monetary measures can, of course, influence the  economic situation. However, we are not directly responsible  for it. It is well-known that we have a medium-term concept and  have enough liquidity in relation to the current economic  situation. That is why there is no need for monetary policy to  be used to stimulate the economy.    [Richter] However, the economy and stock markets in Germany  and Europe could use a small boost from the interest rates.  Will the interest rates continue to fall?    [Issing] Our opinion is that the Bundesbank interest rates  have reached a level that is appropriate in the context of the  present economic situation and current problems.    [Richter] The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised key interest  rates once again. Will that block further decisions on the part  on the Bundesbank?    [Issing] One cannot talk about blocking. Our decisions are  generally based on the situation in Germany. The trend since  the interest rates were raised in the United States and  reductions in the interest rates were made in Germany shows that  the interdependence is not as great as it is regularly made out  to be.    [Richter] So, you are not concerned that the increase in  U.S. interest rates will weaken the German mark?    [Issing] Much has been said about the German mark becoming  weaker, but this has not in fact occurred. Confidence in the  stability of the currency in the medium term is something that a  central bank can and should supply. This kind of strategy also  makes it possible for a currency to weather critical situations.  We must remain cool and can be sure that, despite all the  difficulties -- we do not dispute that fact -- we are on the  right track.    [Richter] The money supply is growing much more rapidly than  it should. Do you think this is dangerous?    [Issing] The figures on the money supply do indeed give us  something to think about. We cannot be satisfied with the  inflation rate, which was 3 percent in May and has thus reached  the lowest level in years. In any event, the money supply  figures have been affected by special factors since the end of  last year.    [Richter] What sort of factors are they?    [Issing] For example, the lawmakers have included financial  funds with accumulated interest in the tax on interest rates.  This has led to a situation in which in December 1993 alone,  German investors sold funds worth 25 billion German marks [DM].  The increase in interest rates that has come out of the United  States and the higher degree of volatility in the financial  markets have increased a tendency among investors to achieve  higher liquidity.    [Richter] How long will it take for this excessive  accumulation of liquidity to be eliminated?    [Issing] It will not happen overnight. However, I think  that, from the point of view of time deposits, the growth in the  money supply will slow down over the new next few months.    [Richter] Does the M3 money supply measure still provide you  with reliable information for fiscal policy?    [Issing] The information that this indicator is furnishing  at the present time makes some people wonder whether money  supply definitions or the procedures for calculating the money  supply should not be changed. However, at the present time, the  growth in the M3 supply is not a problem that can be solved on a  technical level. Other definitions also show that there is more  than enough money. The problem is that excessive liquidity has  to be eliminated. However, this should not happen through  inflationary expenditure, but through long-term investment.    [Richter] In view of the public debt mountain and  expenditure on interest that amounts to 20 percent of the  budget, is there any room for maneuvering worth mentioning at  all?    [Issing] If other areas at the macroeconomic level cannot  contribute to stability, that will make things all the more  difficult for monetary policy. However, I think that a new way  of thinking has penetrated all areas. With the shock of German  unity, fiscal policy did indeed come to grips with limiting  expenditure far too late. Net new debt must be significantly  reduced and there is a broad consensus on that. In the case of  wage policy, there must be a clear improvement. This  automatically means that things will be easier in the case of  monetary policy, or, to be more exact, less difficult.    [Richter] How do you expect the economic situation to  develop?    [Issing] There will be a clear improvement, but I think the  present euphoria has gone too far. However, confidence also  contributes to overcoming the recession. There has been a  marked increase in foreign orders; the construction industry is  as robust as before; even the problem child engineering is  improving. There is a whole series of positive factors that  allow one to expect a further improvement.    [Richter] What about private consumption?    [Issing] It is the biggest risk in the case of economic  development. This year, after taxes, consumers will have less  in real terms than a year ago. The prospects for next year are  also not that rosy. Taxes and other deductions have reached a  record level and will also rise next year. That applies to both  private individuals and companies. This cannot be allowed to  get any worse. Nowhere has the economic growth rate that we need  been achieved with this level of taxation.    [Richter] Can one come to grips with unemployment with the  current concepts?    [Issing] The problems that we have accumulated in this  regard cannot be overcome with a one-shot wage freeze following  the substantial wage increase of the past few years. We have to  live for some time with this legacy. However, in conjunction  with a whole series of measures aimed at achieving more  flexibility, which has, for example, been the case with the wage  settlements in the chemical and metal industries, it is a first  step in the right direction.    [Richter] Despite strong resistance on your part, money  market funds are in fact going to be permitted in Germany. Why  has the Bundesbank given in?    [Issing] Following a substantial reduction in minimum  reserve levels, we estimate that there is a danger that such  funds will lead to the circumventing of our minimum reserves and  that they will be of much less significance than in the past.  We have, however, indicated our serious concern that the public  purse is financing state debt on a short-term basis. That  cannot and should not be the price for making Germany more  attractive as a financial center.    [Richter] Would it become that by permitting new financial  instruments?    [Issing] One should not believe in any wonders in this  respect. Germany as a financial center is not something that is  in itself desirable, but it should be attractive for German and  international investors and secure investment should be  possible. In particular, it should not make monetary policy more  difficult from our point of view.    [Richter] Is that something that has to be feared?    [Issing] Yes, in the sense that money market funds can  become substitutes for time deposits, for example, and they have  be to added to the M3 money supply. One would have to consider  whether investment in money market funds cannot be included in a  new money supply measure.    [Richter] What risks to our financial system are concealed  in the growing market for so-called derivative financial  products?    [Issing] At first sight, in view of the ludicrous sums  involved, derivatives financial products are ideally suited for  scaring people away. Very few people realize that the risk  potential in derivative financial products only accounts for a  fraction of public money. They are not something terribly  dangerous in themselves; what they are above all are instruments  for providing security against risks.    [Richter] But they have always played a very big part in  financial crises.    [Issing] There is not enough evidence for that with respect  to the past. The main danger with these instruments is that  people who cannot see or assume risks get involved with them.    [Richter] How fine is the dividing line between derivate  products business and monetary policy? Do they make the federal  bank's interest rate weapon ineffective?    [Issing] Until now, the relationship to monetary policy has  been weak. That is why there is no new message for monetary  policy from derivative products. However, if such products  really will be used as investment instruments in Germany to a  great extent, we will have to reconsider our monetary policy  course. In any event, we must become better acquainted with  this relationship and then draw the appropriate conclusions.  The appearance of new financial instruments has concrete  economic grounds. That is why it makes little sense to think in  terms of prohibitions.    [Richter] With respect to Europe, it is not only the Germans  who appear to be weary of Europe.    [Issing] The feeling of disillusionment is, of course, a  reaction to the sometimes excessive euphoria of the past. The  single market, Maastricht, the collapse of the Iron Curtain,  initially created the impression that one could start  immediately. Thus, "marry in haste, repent at leisure" can  naturally be applied to the ambitious plans for establishing  such close links between different nations.    [Richter] Is it not the case that integration seems to have  become more difficult from the viewpoint of a timeframe as well  as from that of the convergence criteria that have been adopted?    [Issing] The economic situation in Europe has changed. One  could not have reasonably believed that the growth years would  simply carry on without any problems. The convergence criteria  clearly set out the homework that each individual country still  has to carry out. That also applies to Germany. However, to  conclude that the "Europe venture" has failed as a result is  something that I consider just as premature as the previous  euphoria.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Hard choices ahead: European states need to be prepared to pay for military independence France and the US this week papered over their recent quarrels over the war in Bosnia, and dec-lared their united support for the UN peacekeeping operation. Yet everyone can see that this operation is nearing its end, because it cannot fulfil its peacekeeping function. Sooner or later the peacekeepers will be withdrawn, and the only question is whether they will have to fight their way out, or run, leaving their equipment ignominiously behind. When that withdrawal happens, the international community will need to take a cool review of the post-cold war euphoria which helped to expand the UN's peacekeeping operations beyond what could reasonably be accomplished. Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda testify to the inadequacy of the means available to inter-vene against war and bloodshed. The Europeans will also have to draw their own lessons, not because they have found themselves in the frontline of the peacekeeping operation, nor even because the Bosnian war is taking place in Europe, but because of the ramifications of the tragedy in the wider world. After diplomatic mediation failed to stop the war, Europe decided, rightly or wrongly, to go for humanitarian peacekeeping under UN authority. Self-righteous commentators and those with 20:20 hindsight think they should have acted differently. But these facile criticisms are irrelevant, compared with three serious facts. The first is the European countries' military weakness. They have had difficulty mustering their small forces in Bosnia; they could not operate conveniently there without a Nato headquarters and other alliance assets; and they may not be able to get out without US military and logistical help. The second fact is that the Europeans have conducted their policy towards the war in Bosnia in the teeth of open and repeated opposition from the US. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, many in the west asked whether Nato had a future, and if so, what future? Nato policymakers tried to answer the question by drafting long documents that purported to describe a new Nato 'strategy'. But this was just a bureaucratic device to conceal the real political question, which is much more uncomfortable: does the alliance have a future, and if so, what future? Nato is a valuable set of institutions, but what counts is agreement on political objectives. We do not yet have an answer to the political question. The US administration has tried to mend fences with the Europeans, on the grounds that the Atlantic alliance is more important than the war in Bosnia; but that was not the hierarchy of values which seemed to operate in practice when Washington decided to stop enforcing the UN embargo, against the wishes of the European peacekeepers. The third fact is that we have come to the end of the honeymoon between Russia and the west. In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, Moscow's top priority in foreign policy was co-operation, but that period is over. The Russians have angrily denounced US plans to expand Nato into eastern Europe. And while the US has been siding more openly with the Bosnian Moslems, the Russians have been siding more openly with the Serbs. Last week they reduced the pan-European security summit in Budapest to futility by blocking any resolution on the Bosnian war. Conversely, the violent rightward shift in the US's recent mid-term elections points to the likelihood that US foreign policy will become more unilateral, more hostile to Russia, and probably more impatient of the European allies. The implication of these three facts, is that the European countries will have to confront the hard choices between weakness and independence. As one Foreign Office official said: 'Europe cannot be independent of the Americans, because it cannot provide heavy air-lift or satellite intelligence.' The proposition is evidently absurd; what he meant was that European countries have so far been unwilling to pay for these things, or unite in such a way that paying for them became more cost-effective. They can, of course, continue to refuse to pay for them. The European Union has long been characterised as a 'civilian power', and the member states may prefer to keep it that way. Ostensibly, the Maastricht treaty commits them to develop a common foreign and security policy; but the procedures ensure that co-operation in this area is optional. The reason for this is that Maastricht was drafted in the first flush of post-cold war euphoria. The west had won, the cold war was over, and the Russians were friends. The old nation states in western Europe, such as Britain and France, thought they could cling to the trappings of national independence in foreign policy and defence, because there was no threat to security and no need to sacrifice any of the old vanities. The denouement of this phase of the Bosnian war should give pause to such complacency. Russia is unlikely to pose a military threat to western Europe in the near future; but it could easily become a disturber of the peace. The US and Europe share the most important values and interests; but there are now fewer compelling reasons to assume they will share the same policies. It will still be cheaper and easier to pretend that nothing has changed. All European governments will do their best to keep Nato in business and American forces in Europe; British traditionalists will continue to bray about the 'special relationship'. But the past cannot be brought back: Europe will have to choose.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday openly hinted  for the first time that a dissolution of Parliament end the  political crisis. [sentence as published]    He has previously rejected this as a solution.    He was speaking as growing pressure from democracy groups  for  political reform threatened to isolate him and his Democrat  Party from his former prodemocracy allies.    He has firmly refused to bow to the demands of hunger  striker  Chalat Worachat and his supporters to redraft the constitution.    "This Government has a term of four years. During this four  years, the House can be dissolved at any time and a censure  motion can also be submitted against the Government any time.    "Don't be worried. The Government will do what is best and  of most benefit to the public," Mr Chuan told 3,000 supporters  at the opening of the southern livestock market in Thung Song  district, Nakhon Si Thammarat.    Prominent academics and lecturers from 12 educational  institutions have, made a similar call.    Mr. Chuan, responding to questions, later insisted he still  had no plan to dissolve Parliament yet but conceded he had  pointed to the possibility to try to make people understand that  a dissolution and censure motion could occur in a parliamentary  system.    He said he was still confident the Government could reach an  understanding with all concerned on the problem.    Mr. Chuan, throughout a series of political conflicts often  within his own coalition, frequently stated he had no plan to  dissolve the Lower House.    In his speech yesterday, he insisted his administration was  leading the country toward greater democracy and a better  economy.    This was reflected in the form of an increase in exports and  a five-fold rise of investment in the provinces in the past year.    "The Government is confident the course in which it is  taking  the country is the best," Mr. Chuan said.    He thanked people for their show of support.    "Please feel confident that the Government is doing its  best.  Do not be concerned or be suspicious. We must do the best.  What will be will be."    He repeated his frequent line that his administration would  run the country honestly to prevent others from citing  corruption as an excuse to stage a coup.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut has proposed  amendment  of Article 211 of the charter to allow the setting up a  Constitution Drafting Council.    Mr. Chuan said the issue had been settled at the Wednesday's  meeting of the ruling parties.    He said all coalition partners agreed not to support or  sponsor a move to redraft the constitution because the  Government could not abandon principles to comply with demands  from only one man.    Gen Chawalit is due to visit Narathiwat today and will fly  back to Bangkok on the same aircraft as the premier.    Mr. Chuan said he might take the chance to discuss the idea  with Gen Chawalit.    About 500 people turned up at Mr. Chuan's home in Trang  yesterday to express their support for his stand against Mr  Chalat's demands.    He travelled from Trang to Nakhon Si Thammarat to preside  over a seminar on development strategies for the middle and  southern regions.    At least 22 signs with slogans supporting the premier were  dotted along a five-kilometre stretch of highway used by his  motorcade.    He stopped in Huai Yot district where about 300 supporters  welcomed him.    At the Thai Hotel in Nakhon Si Thammarat, the seminar venue,  1,000 people turned up with more than 100 posters and banners to  support Mr. Chuan.</p>

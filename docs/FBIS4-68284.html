			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chuprin under the "Reporting" rubric: </F> "PVO Reveals Secrets"; first paragraph is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  introduction]    [Text] The underground casemates of the Moscow Military  District's PVO [air defense] command center are reminiscent of a  skillfully wound wire. Endless stairways and secluded corners  unexpectedly terminate in enormous rooms, where pilot lights and  instruments flicker in mysterious darkness. Then there are more  stairways, passageways, and heavy, massive doors.    "Our command center began operating on 30 November 1981,"  said Lieutenant General P. Kuznetsov, chief of staff of the MO  [Moscow District] PVO. "It cost the government at that time 74  million rubles."    We headed for the combat control room - the holy of holies  of  the command center. The plotting boards, charts, and maps  illuminated in the darkness could at any time supply the  military personnel with literally all the data.    A monitor screen displayed a weather report pertaining to  military airfields. For example, it was shown that at Bologoye  there were a haze, calm, humidity of 95 percent, and visibility  of 300 meters. P. Kuznetsov gave the command for a report on the  air situation on the northern borders of Russia. There was an  immediate change in the size of the map, which showed in large  scale the Leningrad Oblast area, with two aircraft flying from  Scandinavia in that direction.    While we watched the moving electronic spots, an air defense  crew located somewhere near Vyborg had already taken up its  combat stations. But what was the story? The new instructions  forbid knocking down foreign air liners and sports craft that  violate Russia's air space. However, the brigade staff command  post operations officer has the authority to give the command to  destroy a military "pirate." He is not required to obtain  permission from the state's top persons to do this.    "Many people do not believe that in this economically  difficult time we are able to maintain a high state of combat  readiness," said Colonel General A. Kornukov, district  commander. "But that really is so. Eighty percent of our troops  received the good or excellent evaluation in last year's combat  preparation rating. In the concluding exercises, more than 100  aerial targets entered our zone at various altitudes and speeds,  and all were "destroyed." The men are provided with uniforms,  footwear, and food rations. Our military pilots--the only ones  in Russia--were able to put in 100 percent of the time called  for in the training programs. Ninety-five percent of the air  defense regiments are armed with the new S-300 missiles."    Indeed, the PVO troops cannot be said to be a stepchild of  the government. This is easily seen by looking at the Moscow  District. The staff command post in which we were located,  although the main one, is definitely not the only one in the  district. Under extreme conditions, any one of the five reserve  command posts can take on the function of troop command and  control.    It is true that, in the opinion of military specialists,  there is no chance whatsoever that the above situation will  obtain. The fortification secrets of underground structures are  such that the command post is reliably protected against all  types of weapons of mass destruction. Even in the case--God  forbid!--an enemy's nuclear bomb would score a direct hit on the  site, this would not harm a single hair on the heads of the  officers and generals as they perform the 24-hour watch. The  combat control room, automatic warning system computing  facility, and the communications center are capable of 10 days  more in automatic operation. The bunker's reinforced concrete  walls are filled with metal shells mounted on special cables and  shock absorbers. These constructions prevent soil displacement  even in case of a substantial explosion.    Military persons would not be surprised if told that it  would  not be a bad idea to have this kind of stronghold within the  population's civil defense system. You and I know that potatoes  for plant dining halls have long been stored in puny bomb  shelters. They are much cheaper for enterprise workers in the  fall than in spring when purchased in stores.    Well, the above is incidental to the story. What kind of  service are PVO men performing now, and which traditions are  they observing and promoting? The MO "lost" 100 large units last  year. However, this is in no way a tragedy. Troop reformation is  to continue, and it seems that it is impossible to ignore the  Suvorov instruction "skill, not numbers" by hiding behind thick  walls of a bastion.    Nonetheless, it cannot be said that hanging over the heads  of  district units and subunits is a mortal danger of mass  discharges into the reserves, something which is frequently  stated in newspapers. Rumors of elimination of the "defensive  rings" around Moscow are grossly exaggerated, according to the  military authorities.    The chief slogan used by Russian airborne troops is "no one  other than we." For missilemen, this is "who if not we." This is  how the PVO generals feel, referring to the military action  experience in Iraq, where the Americans' successful air  offensive was decisive in securing victory for them.    The Moscow District is capable of launching missiles against  500 targets at the same time. It would be foolish, even  criminal, to dissolve this kind of army branch, considering that  only a single cruise missile reaching its target would be  capable of inflicting upon the national economy a severe lesson.  Also, the MO is watching over 1.3 million square kilometers of  Russia, eight nuclear power stations, and about 140  installations considered to be special.    The above supertasks compel missilemen to keep their powder  dry. Formation of a professional army is still something for the  future. And filling the manpower needs by voluntary recruitment  only leaves much to be desired.    In a word, summer is drawing near, and with it the PVO men's  new evaluation launchings against practice targets. This is  something for which they are ready at all hours of the day and  night at Anino. But what about other missile and radar stations  distributed over an enormous area? One can only hope that only  training alerts will be sounded there.</p>

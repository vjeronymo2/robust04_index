At a meeting with parliamentary reporters, Kwasniewski also  said, regarding ratification of the Concordat, that when there  are just two options--yes or no--the SLD will vote against it.    The SLD leader also let it be known that Social Democracy  has  given up on the concept of the direct election of village elders  and town and city mayors in the forthcoming local government  elections.</p>

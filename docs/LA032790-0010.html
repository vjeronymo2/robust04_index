			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRAUTHAMMER  </P> <P> I wish to respond to Charles Krauthammer's column (Op-Ed Page, March 11):  </P> <P> Mr. Krauthammer, what kind of dream world are you living in? Your figures, I  presume, are supposed to make us "feel good," but they are framed only by  percentages of success revealed by the GNP and the metamorphosis of communism  to the so-called democratic electoral process which is bogged down in  tremendous complexity before international benefits can result. Meanwhile, our  deficit-laden economy sits heavily on the backs of the people of the United  States.  </P> <P> Our health has declined as has our educational system. Union busting by the  previous Administration and deregulation in every phase of business accompanied  by the lack of medical insurance, the stress and strain of husband and wife  employment necessitated by rising inflation, our roads and transportation  deteriorated, violence caused by economic and housing failures, military  wastefulness, questionable incursions into other countries, all place the  United States and the world in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Mr. Krauthammer, your peripheral thinking reminds me of the saying that "liars  figure but figures don't lie." It takes courage to see things as they really  are instead of twisting figures to make us "feel good." You do not recognize  the need to change our priorities so that you can get clear on the difference  between honest figures and what is hogwash!  </P> <P> HARRIET SCOTT  </P> <P> Coronado  </P></p>

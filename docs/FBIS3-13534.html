PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat met twice with the Israeli  team, headed by Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir. He  also met for five hours with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, but no  progress was reported. More from Jack Katzenell:    [Begin recording] Yasir 'Arafat had meetings yesterday with  the Israeli delegation, with the U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross,  and with the Russian envoy and the Norwegian mediator. All of  them tried to persuade the Palestinian leader to resume the  negotiations with Israel, but they failed.    According to reports from Tunis and Washington, the  differences between Ross and 'Arafat were mainly over the  wording of the UN Security Council resolution condemning the  Hebron massacre. 'Arafat was reported to have said he would not  resume the negotiations without achievements for the  Palestinians on the ground. 'Arafat's aide, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh,  told reporters the PLO is still looking for guarantees for the  security of the Palestinians. A foreign correspondent in Tunis  quoted one of the Israeli negotiators as saying: No concessions  on settlements; no concessions on settlers. The Israeli  negotiator was speaking immediately after having telephoned  Prime Minister Rabin between meetings with 'Arafat. Israel did  ban the Kakh and Kahana Hay organizations and took other steps  against the hard core of the Jewish extremists, but it rejected  the PLO's demands for the evacuation of some settlements and the  disarming of all the settlers.    Rabin left for the United States last night accompanied by  the cabinet secretary, Elyaqim Rubinstein; the director general  of the Prime Minister's Office, Shim'on Sheves; and the chief of  Military Intelligence, Major General Uri Sagi. Rabin had hoped  to meet the delegation at the airport as it returned from Tunis,  but he missed them; however, his adviser, Jacques Neriya, is  flying directly from Tunis to Washington.    Before leaving, Rabin told a reporter he is not disappointed  with the failure of the Tunis talks. He again described the  Hebron massacre as the crossing of a red line, and he  acknowledged that it would take some time for the Palestinians  to return to the negotiating table. He hinted that Israel was  willing to make concessions, but not if they contradicted the  Declaration of Principles.    Next month, Yasir 'Arafat is going to Moscow at the  invitation of President Yeltsin. The new activism of Russia in  Middle East diplomacy is causing concern in Israel because it is  no longer coordinated with the United States. In Jerusalem,  there is a suspicion that the PLO is trying to play off Russia  against the United States, as it did during the Cold War.  'Arafat may have gotten the idea that he can get more out of  the Russians than out of the Americans, and this could have  contributed to the failure of yesterday's talks. [end recording]</p>

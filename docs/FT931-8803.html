			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: A second Stiffelio - Opera The BBC relay of Verdi's Stiffelio from Covent Garden a couple of weeks ago will hopefully have won new friends for this important, neglected opera. On television the production's wide-screen views of life in the Protestant communities of Montana looked marvellous and the opera's concentration on the intimate issue of marital fidelity will have been brought home with extra force. In the theatre, the Royal Opera has shown that it works just as well. The censorship that was forced upon the opera in the 19th century - the plot concerns a Protestant minister and his adulterous wife, which would have been contentious enough, if the story did not also reach its climax at a church service depicted on stage - meant that Stiffelio was soon forgotten. There is no tradition of performance. Few singers have it in their repertoire today. For that reason it is worth noting that the Royal Opera fielded a second tenor in the all-important title-role on Monday. Following Jose Carreras as Stiffelio came Giorgio Lamberti for the last two performances of the run. Looking suitably grave, a man of the church respected and even revered, he caught well the studied outward control that is an integral part of Stiffelio the man. As the evening continued, however, it started to look as though this was as much a sign of his own nervousness as an intended feature of the character. It is always difficult to step into a role when everybody else in the cast is well rehearsed; doubly so, no doubt, when the opera is a rare one. But Lamberti sounded unsure of himself, husbanding his resources, lifting the voice up to notes, gingerly approaching climaxes which were asking for unfettered passion. Fortunately the power of the opera was only marginally diminished. The other singers, notably Catherine Malfitano in full, confident voice as the wife, had their roles well within their grasp. In the pit Edward Downes built up formidable dramatic tension, even if early Verdi ideally asks to burn on a shorter fuse. I note that Placido Domingo is due to take on Stiffelio in New York. The Royal Opera should consider a revival of this production for him, if it has not already done so. Final performance February 18 (Box Office 071-240 1066)</p>

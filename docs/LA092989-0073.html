			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITING SANCTIONS, PANAMA PLEADS WITH CREDITORS  </P> <P> Panama called on its international creditors Thursday to give it special help  because of economic sanctions by the United States.  </P> <P> Planning Minister Gustavo Gonzalez reported to the annual meeting of the  International Monetary Fund a sharp drop in his country's economic output  because of U.S. sanctions and a plunge in government revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sanctions Imposed  </P> <P> He said Panama's output of goods and services fell 16% last year, government  revenue fell 44.3%, exports dropped 11% and imports fell 35.5%. But Gonzalez  said he expects the economy to stabilize before the end of the year.  </P> <P> The economic sanctions were imposed last year as part of a campaign by the  United States to oust military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, under  indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discuss Debt  </P> <P> "The plans of Panama are to continue restructuring its economy under the  jeopardy of wanton, unjustifiable and groundless economic coercive measures,"  Gonzalez said in a speech to the IMF. He said an IMF mission is scheduled to  visit Panama in October to discuss economic policies. Panama also wants to  discuss a restructuring of its commercial bank debt.  </P></p>

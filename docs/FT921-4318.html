			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brown stresses community role - Constitutional Reform MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday highlighted the role that the community should play as a counterweight to the power of central government. In the first of a series of lectures organised by Charter 88, the constitutional reform movement, Mr Brown said Labour had a historic role in standing up for individual citizens against vested interests. 'A modern view of socialism must retrieve the broad idea of community from the narrow notion of the state and ensure that the community becomes a means by which individuals can realise their potential, not at the expense of individual liberty, but in advancing it,' he said. In a speech covering many areas of government accountability and devolution, Mr Brown emphasised that constitutional change was central rather than incidental to the UK's future. In an implicit attack on Scottish nationalism, he argued against a return to 19th-century ideas of an exclusive nation-state, and for 'the dream of home rule without the retreat into separation'. Acknowledging that individual rights could be entrenched through specific statutes - the approach favoured by Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary  -he raised the possibility of incorporating the European Convention of Human Rights into UK law. He said the debate on electoral reform must address the possible mechanisms as well as the ideals behind them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Chong Son-kyo] </F>   [Text] "These days Pyongyang residents of the middle school  age or older each carry an empty explosives satchel strapped  around their waist, in a show of their horrifying determination  to throw their bodies with the satchels filled with shells when  there is a call from the leader. In addition, copies of a war  map of South Korea with marked targets of initial attack in the  event of war have been distributed." So said a Chinese source  who recently visited North Korea.    Meanwhile, a Japanese source said, "These days a nightly  blackout from 2100 hours is in force in Pyongyang, even in  hotels for foreigners, turning the city into pitch darkness."    A Korean paper in the United States carries a similar  report:  "The foremost subject among taxi passengers in Seoul is, `What  would happen if war breaks out?' There is a growing tendency  among Korean residents in the United States to restrain their  trips to the homeland. That is why an increasing number of them  telephone their relatives in Korea more frequently."    Those are examples of the reports pouring in about the war  atmosphere in the North and South since North Korea issued a  threat to "turn South Korea into a sea of blood." The situation  as described by these reports is really dreadful. However,  interestingly enough, contrary to this reported atmosphere,  arguments that "the war atmosphere has been concocted by tacit  agreement between North Korea and the United States to pursue  their own interests" have mushroomed with some credibility.  According to this theory, the North Korean statement that it  will "not hesitate to go to war" is hollow, and the U.S.  "strategy of punishment" is closely linked to U.S. interests.    In a word, according to this theory, war cannot break out  now.    The formula tacitly agreed to by North Korea and the United  States is a win-and-win strategy. By this formula, both sides  will win. To be more specific, by creating tension on the  Korean Peninsula the United States seeks to sell Patriot  missiles and other follow-up weapons, and North Korea seeks to  settle the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the  United States.    North Korea has obstructed nuclear inspections, aborted the  proposed exchange of special envoys between North and South,  and used "the sea of blood" threat as a trump card at the  formal negotiating table--all this was part of a prearranged  strategy aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with the  United States and even extracting U.S. economic aid.    If North Korea really wanted war, it would not have openly  stated that it would "not hesitate to go to war." But it is a  fact that Kim Chong- il, who commands nuclear diplomacy at the  top, gained something from that threat. First, he has succeeded  in controlling the military by placing North Korea on a quasi  war-footing, thereby consolidating his power. Next, he has  given the North Korean people the impression that "Kim  Chong-il's outstanding judgment of the situation is producing  diplomatic benefits." In addition, by causing uneasiness among  the South Korean people, Kim Chong-il has gained the upper hand  in diplomatic-psychological warfare.    Said a Korean journalist in the United States atuned to the  North Korean situation: "North-South relations will get worse  in late April and early May, but I think that North-South  dialogue will be resumed in August or thereabouts as North  Korea is expected to show an unexpected foreign policy trump  card and make a sudden policy about-face."    That is the speculation about the possibility of  "establishing diplomatic relations and exchanging ambassadors  between North Korea and the United States in August." Various  indications supporting this speculation are actually surfacing.  Some of the Korean residents in the United States who recently  visited North Korea are establishing a "prearranged channel of  contact" with Kim Chong-il. A Korean newspaper in the United  States has come out with a "slogan in praise of Kim Chong-il"  on the basis of the judgment that "North Korea and the United  States will soon establish diplomatic relations in one way or  another."    As if substantiating speculation about the early  establishment of diplomatic relations, a high-ranking U.S.  official on 26 March hinted at the possibility of resuming  talks between the United States and North Korea. At a press  conference held in the United States, the senior U.S. official  who took part in the first and second rounds of U.S.-North  Korea talks made this point: "I cannot specify the date, but  the United States will soon resume talks with North Korea. U.N.  sanctions against North Korea are not a policy goal of the  United States at all. North Korea should accept the win-and-win  formula. North Korea has obstructed inspections in order to  squeeze more out of the bargain. But it was a failure."    The creation of mutually beneficial tension by the United  States and North Korea has something to do with Clinton's and  Kim Chong-il's current position. Currently, Clinton is beset by  Whitewater, which is no less troublesome than Nixon's Watergate.  Moreover, the only way to rescue the Patriot missile maker from  the verge of bankruptcy is to sell the missiles in the world  market. Some point out that the party pressuring the  manufacturer and Clinton is the Kennedy family, which has close  ties with Clinton.    On the other hand, Kim Chong-il wants to be in the  international limelight as "an able diplomat" by wresting  diplomatic recognition from the United States and arrogate the  credit to himself. North Korea has quietly moved to turn over  the remains of American soldiers to the U.S. side since last  year. In an unexpected show of generosity toward the United  States in humanitarian matters, North Korea has already returned  a considerable number of bodies.    Since the latter half of 1993, North Korea has exerted  efforts to open up to the outside world and promote economic  cooperation. It is worthy of note that North Korea recently  revised the joint venture law for the first time in 10 years  and that a move is afoot to enact a law related to foreign  investment.</p>

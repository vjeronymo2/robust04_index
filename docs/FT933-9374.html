			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Observer: Digit-all Self help and the elimination of red tape is something you come to expect from an organisation representing the best of British business. So visitors to the CBI's Centre Point headquarters should not be surprised to find that instead of having to spell out their name and company ever so slowly to the receptionist they are now required to punch in their details on a small keyboard at the front desk. The information is printed out onto a visitors' ticket which the receptionist folds into a plastic lapel badge. Observer passed the key-board test, of course, but is not so sure that those CBI members who are used to minions hitting the keys will take as kindly to the idea. After all, where is the personal service?</p>

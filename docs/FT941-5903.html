			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Trustee for mental patients criticised The government organisation responsible for administering assets of Pounds 780m for 30,000 people mentally incapable of looking after their own affairs is criticised in a report published today by the National Audit Office. The public expenditure watchdog says that the Public Trust Office, part of the Lord Chancellor's Department, is failing to monitor the receivers appointed to look after the finances of their patients. Very few visits are made to check that receivers are meeting patients' needs according to the report. The NAO says that this leaves the Public Trust Office with insufficient information to ensure that patients enjoy the quality of life they are entitled to. The Public Trust Office is responsible to the Court of Protection. Most patients have assets of less than Pounds 50,000, but some have more than Pounds 1m. Most have their finances managed by a receiver appointed by the court - 19,000 receivers are relatives or friends, with most of the rest solicitors, bank managers or local authorities. The NAO says that too little is done by the Public Trust Office to check the suitability of receivers. Patients were sometimes dissatisfied with the choice and many receivers were 'daunted by the complexity of the task facing them'. Monitoring of receivers needed greater attention, the NAO said. Financial accounts were often received late and there was a backlog of accounts to be reviewed. Looking After the Financial Affairs of People with Mental Incapacity. HMSO. Pounds 8.90.</p>

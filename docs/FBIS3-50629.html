A communique from the U.S. Embassy in Quito stated the  meeting held by Undersecretary of State Alexander Watson and  Foreign Minister Diego Paredes was requested by the Ecuadoran  minister and not by a summons from the Washington official.  Undersecretary Watson did not summon Foreign Minister Paredes,  said the diplomatic communique which sought to end a controversy  which, besides Paredes, involved President Sixto Duran-Ballen  and former president Leon Febres-Cordero.    After newspapers reported Paredes' visit to Washington on 22  and 23 December, Febres-Cordero said the objective of the visit  was to heed a summons by the U.S. State Department and that he  had firm evidence of the affair. The former president, who is  the current mayor of Guayaquil, said Paredes was warned that  U.S. aid could be suspended if a dictatorship was established in  Ecuador.    Paredes contradicted the former president and asked him to  present evidence to support his assertion and Duran-Ballen,  after confirming his foreign minister's statements, asserted the  whole affair was an idiocy produced by a sick mind.    Today Febres-Cordero complained about the adjectives and  said  Paredes' trip was suspicious, untimely, and inexplicable and  said Duran-Ballen does not know what happens around him,  including the field of foreign relations.    During an interview in Guayaquil, Duran-Ballen said: I rule  the country in accordance with the Constitution and do not need  to request permission from any country with regard to the  actions I must undertake within the country or in foreign  relations.    On Monday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy clarified the origin  of  the Paredes-Watson meeting which, according to the Ecuadoran  foreign minister's version, was requested by him to review  topics regarding bilateral relations.    According to former president Febres-Cordero's version,  during the meeting Paredes was reprimanded for a supposed  refusal of the Ecuadoran Government to execute the decisions  made by Congress, thus, establishing a dictatorship.</p>

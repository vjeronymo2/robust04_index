			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 22 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Riot police this  morning stormed a polling center that had been occupied by the  opposition in Jucuapa Municipality in the eastern department of  Usulutan. Opposition groups have accused the National  Republican Alliance (Arena) government of committing fraud in  Sunday's general elections.    Members and supporters of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front (FMLN), the Unity Movement, the National  Conciliation Party (PCN), and Christian Democratic Party (PDC)  yesterday occupied a school facility where ballot boxes were  being stored.    FMLN member Ricardo Samayoa said riot police broke down the  main entrance of the school while residents of Jucuapa, in the  northern part of Usulutan, surrounded the building to prevent  police from taking the ballot boxes to San Salvador. Samayoa  added that no one was injured or beaten in the incident. He  said members of the right-wing Arena party marked hundreds of  ballots before voting began two days ago in nationwide general  elections to elect a new president, mayors, and deputies.    "All of the political parties were able to confirm this. We  found several Arena members with several marked ballots before  the voting process began," he said.    The ballot boxes were being guarded by representatives of  opposition political parties demanding that the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] annul the elections in this  municipality in the eastern part of the country. They warned  that if the TSE does not annul the elections in Jucuapa, those  parties that took part in the elections in this region will  elect a municipal government by consensus. The TSE has not  issued a statement on this incident, which is unprecedented.    So far, the ruling Arena party has garnered 49.18 percent of  the votes counted up until Monday afternoon to elect the  president and vice president. The leftist coalition comprising  the FMLN former guerrilla organization, Democratic Convergence  (CD), and the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) has obtained  25.66 percent of the votes, while the PDC has obtained 15.94  percent. The TSE has announced the possibility of a 24 April  runoff in which the Arena and leftist coalition candidates will  compete for the presidency.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Industry fury at Bonn social levy LEADING industrial lobbies in the German private sector yesterday denounced government plans for a new social insurance surcharge on workers and employers. They flatly rejected plans for a DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn) statutory scheme to finance residential care for the chronically sick and elderly. They described the move as a direct threat to jobs, investment and to economic recovery. In an extraordinary joint appeal to the government, the leaders of the four principal employers' organisations called for the whole programme to be reconsidered, and postponed, at least until recovery is under way. In spite of their urgent call, however, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government appears to be determined to press ahead with the programme. The battle over the scheme has caused serious divisions within the coalition, with the minority Free Democrats, in particular, sharing many of the private sector's misgivings. Defenders of the plan in turn accused the private sector of 'scandalous' selfishness in ignoring the urgent needs of the ageing population in Germany. The insurance plan for residential care is seen by German industry as the last straw on the overwhelming burden of social costs imposed on employers. They fear that an initial surcharge of 1.7 per cent on incomes would rapidly rise to double figures, as the number of old people grows. Social insurance costs already amount to 37.4 per cent on top of basic wages, and all additional personnel costs for German employers add DM84 to every DM100 in their workers' pay packets, they say. Mr Klaus Murmann, leader of the German employers' federation (BDA), said the scheme was 'economically damaging and flawed in its basic conception. . . . The whole of German industry is united on this, as it has hardly ever been before.'</p>

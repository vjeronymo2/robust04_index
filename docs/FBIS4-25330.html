			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  today had a discussion at Zhongnanhai -- the government seat in  the capital -- to seek a wide swathe of opinions on education  matters.    Among the people he was consulting on a report he would make  to a national education working conference later this month were  leaders of China's eight non-communist parties.    Also taking part in the discussion were representatives of  the All-China Federation of Industry And commerce, and people  without party affiliations.    The national education working conference is the second such  meeting convened by the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee and the State Council since China started its policy  of reform and opening to the world in the late 1970s.    The meeting is considered to be very important for solving  problems in China's educational reform and development.    The people taking part in the discussion gave much advice  and  expressed their opinions on how to popularize the nine-year  compulsory education system, how to develop vocational education  and education for adults, and how to increase the input to  education.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Observer: Why Slater walked Was he pushed, or did he jump? Jim Slater, ex-chairman of the collapsed Slater Walker Securities, has penned his last column for the City pages of the financially-stretched Independent newspaper. It's not clear who terminated whom, but the 65-year-old Slater has no regrets. He is up to his eyes in his latest project - setting up a London equivalent of Value Line, the US money managers' crib-sheet. A monthly publication out of the Hemington Scott stable, it will analyse every quoted UK company and give all sorts of rankings. Slater is convinced that it will be a knock-out. But he may have to play around with the title - Really Essential Financial Statistics. It doesn't have quite the ring of a stock market best-seller.</p>

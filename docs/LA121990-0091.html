			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALSH GOES FROM TOWELS TO TOP SCORER  </P> <P> Derrick Walsh, leading scorer on the Dana Hills High School boys' basketball  team, has known tough times.  </P> <P> Walsh was cut from the freshman team. He was academically ineligible to compete  as a sophomore and he was the team's manager as a junior, picking up towels and  sweats and passing out water bottles.  </P> <P> All the while, he never gave up. He spent weekends on the courts at Main Beach  in Laguna Beach or the Laguna Niguel YMCA, playing the game he loves.  </P> <P> "I spent a lot of time practicing and hoping," Walsh said. "I knew I could  play, I just needed a chance."  </P> <P> This year, Walsh has finally gotten his chance. He's averaging 18 points and  has reached double figures in all six of Dana Hills' games. He was named to the  all-tournament team at the Santa Maria tournament.  </P> <P> "All the credit should go to him," said Tom Riach, Dana Hills assistant.  "Derrick has shown a lot of perseverance. He had the courage to never give up."  </P> <P> So how did someone who was cut as a freshman develop into the team's leading  scorer?  </P> <P> For openers, Walsh competed each weekend against some of the area's top college  and high players at Main Beach. The four-on-four half-court games leave a lot  to be desired in the area of fundamentals, but few who aren't street-tough  survive.  </P> <P> "They cheat, but it's good competition," Walsh said. "Nobody likes to lose down  there. They'll do just about anything to win. Playing there every weekend made  me a stronger player."  </P> <P> Then there were the recreation league games on Tuesday and Thursday nights at  the Laguna Niguel YMCA, where Walsh perfected his three-point shot and drives  to the basket.  </P> <P> "It was good competition, but you also pick up some bad habits," he said.  "There's a lot of hot-dogging that goes on and not a lot of emphasis on  fundamentals."  </P> <P> There also were the countless hours Walsh spent shooting at Marina Hills Park  near the apartment where he lives with his mother, Carmen.  </P> <P> "I played little games against myself . . . three-point shooting contests,  free-throw contests and tip drills," he said. "During the summer, I'd leave  home at 9 to go play and get home around 5. I'd play all day."  </P> <P> Finally, Walsh learned to become a team player attending summer camps conducted  by Laker stars Byron Scott and Magic Johnson. Walsh spent a week at Johnson's  camp at Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> But the humbling of Derrick Walsh came last season when he served as team  manager while sitting out a second season because of academic ineligibility.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be a part of the team, so I decided to become the student  manager," he said. "I was just happy to be around the team. My friends used to  make fun of me folding the towels, but I wanted to be part of the team."  </P> <P> Walsh attended every practice and worked on his jump shot when he wasn't icing  down a player's sore knee or elbow. All along, Walsh's teammates encouraged him  to keep trying.  </P> <P> "I thought being ineligible was unfair, but I never gave up," he said. "I  played every day. I love the competition, whether you're playing one-on-one or  four-on-four."  </P> <P> Walsh said he received As, Bs and one C on his last report card and hopes to  play college basketball next year.  </P> <P> "But even if I don't go on to play basketball in college," he said, "I'll still  find a game to play somewhere."  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe The stress which Siebe places on its cash flow is perhaps a response to those who regard its ability to maintain margins through the recession with suspicion. Had it simply relied on judicious use of acquisition provisions at Foxboro, the company would surely not have met its targets for reducing gearing. The fact though, that yesterday's interim figures provided further positive news on this score is no longer quite enough. Having taken the axe to Foxboro's costs, the time has come when the controls division should be seeing more benefit from operational gearing and volume-driven growth. There has been some recovery in the US, but that is offset by weakness in Europe. Some Pounds 10m of the Pounds 14m increase in pre-tax profits was accounted for by exchange rate changes, and margins in the controls division have fallen slightly. Siebe's claim that they would have increased without the new charge for retirement healthcare and the consolidation of two small acquisitions is scant consolation. That would still have left them below the 16.3 per cent earned in 1992-93, while the retirement charge will recur. Siebe is thus not yet able to deliver strong organic growth. This may owe more to economic circumstance than to any management shortcomings. But it suggests further reliance on acquisitions which would also help explain Siebe's interest in conserving cash. The market seems to have factored in the implications for earnings quality. A prospective multiple of around 18 times puts Siebe on a lower rating than other cyclical stocks such as those in building materials.</p>

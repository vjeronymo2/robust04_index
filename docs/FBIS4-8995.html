			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [LIDOVE NOVINY report: "The President's Denial"] </F>   [Text] Prague--President Vaclav Havel asked LIDOVE NOVINY  to publish the following statement:    It seems that the CTK reporter who provided information on  the most recent "Conversations from Lany" did not listen to me  at all. Otherwise, he could not have said that I supported the  deputies' compromising draft for the election system to the  senate, which had the large districts composed of three smaller  ones. Most of the papers took on this information and came to  various conclusions. I did not support such a proposal, and I  cannot support it because I do not understand what the  difference is between 81 electoral districts and 81 electoral  districts associated into 27 larger ones. On the contrary, I  said that I believed another draft to be more reasonable--that  is, the one about which I had been informed by the deputies and  that involves 27 electoral districts in which triple elections  would be held on the basis of three independent lists of  candidates. This would be a majority system, which would be  different from the subsequent one in that three mandates would  be won simultaneously in triple elections.    I am aware that those are details that are uninteresting for  many readers. However, because I like order and precision, I  have decided to react.</p>

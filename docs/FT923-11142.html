			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Portsmouth Harbour project EDMUND NUTTALL has secured a contract worth about Pounds 3m to build a quay wall at the Albert Johnson Quay in Portsmouth. The client is Portsmouth City Council, whose engineers have designed the works and will supervise the contract. The latest project will consist of deepening the Albert Johnson Quay dockside and strengthening the quay to accommodate larger general cargo and reefer vessels. Although overall duration of the contract is 40 weeks, 100 metres of new working quay has to be completed and operational by mid-December. Not only does the project involve dredging for the new approach channel and berth, but also the construction of about 200 metres of quay wall in front of the existing quay. This will comprise steel sheet piles, raking steel bearing piles and a reinforced concrete anchor beam to support a reinforced concrete relieving slab on to which crane beams will be constructed for dockside luffing cranes to travel. Further works include the construction of foundations and associated services for a cold storage shed behind the quay for soft fruit storage.</p>

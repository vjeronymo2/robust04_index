			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Further loss for Abbey Panels ABBEY PANELS Investments, an engineer supplying the motor, aerospace and defence industries, saw its shares fall 25p to 233p as it reported further losses and said there was little sign of improvement in the near future. The company reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 993,000 (Pounds 1.18m) for the six months to March 31 on sales of Pounds 6.66m (Pounds 5.51m). Deficit per share came to 48.4p (49.8p). It had suffered significant cuts by large customers and had recently made 60 employees redundant at a cost of about Pounds 150,000. The directors said that costs were being cut to the bone and all opportunities were being aggressively pursued, but it would be some time before Abbey returned to profit.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS HIT THE ROAD LOOKING FOR BERTH IN CCAA TOURNEY  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team faces a road trip this  weekend that could determine whether it will win a berth in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. post-season tournament.  </P> <P> The Toros (5-5 in conference play and 9-14 overall) play at first-place  Bakersfield (8-2, 20-3) tonight at 7:30.  </P> <P> Then they visit Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (5-5, 15-8) on Saturday night at 8:05.  </P> <P> Bakersfield is ranked No. 14 in the country. Cal Poly and Dominguez Hills are  among four teams tied for third place in the CCAA, behind Bakersfield and UC  Riverside (7-3, 17-6).  </P> <P> Only four teams will advance to the conference tournament. A victory at San  Luis Obispo would give the Toros a tie-breaker advantage because they defeated  the Mustangs, 58-56, earlier in the season. Also tied for third are Cal State  Los Angeles (5-5, 12-11), defeated twice this year by the Toros, and Cal State  Northridge (5-5, 10-13), which beat Dominguez Hills twice.  </P> <P> In women's play, the Lady Toros (3-6, 11-12) can keep their slim post-season  hopes alive with a victory Saturday night at San Luis Obispo (4-4, 10-12). Game  time is 5:45.  </P></p>

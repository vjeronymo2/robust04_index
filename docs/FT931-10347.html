			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Profit-related pay schemes increase THE NUMBER of profit-related pay schemes jumped by more than a quarter in the final three months of last year, according to figures released yesterday by the Inland Revenue. The number of schemes increased by 27 per cent from 3,268 to 4,149 by the end of December. Over the same period, the number of employees participating in registered schemes rose by 24 per cent from 780,600 to 973,000. The sharp rise comes after a long period of stability in the figures. However, the rise had been anticipated as anecdotal evidence had pointed to a substantial increase in inquiries about the schemes to accountants in the past few months. The new figures follow changes in the 1991 Budget which significantly increased the tax-free profit payments allowed under approved schemes. These are now possible up to either 20 per cent of pay or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower. It may also reflect the fact that companies can use the schemes as a highly tax-efficient way to increase benefits to their employees at a time when profits are stagnating. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'These figures are very good news and strongly indicate that many employers are seeing the benefit of involving their employees in the running of the business.' Profit-related pay schemes were first introduced in 1988, and the formula by which each one increases employee pay has to be approved by the Revenue. Officials clamped down late last year on the abuse of some of these formulas.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Arts: Bruce Springsteen Rock in London this summer offers visits from almost the all the People's Favourites, from Genesis to Michael Jackson, and there is no more wholehearted Man of the People than Springsteen. Wembley Arena rose as a single body to hail his appearance. It is easy to sniff at Springsteen, dismiss his music as unsophisticated and its subject matter as irredeemably small-town American. Those persistent topics, that raking over the ashes of dead romances, the importance of family and home, always suffused with an aching patriotism and more than a hint of revivalist religious fervour seem so quintessentially American that one first all doubts their potency beyond its borders, fails to see the universality behind the songs. It's the sincerity that does it, I'm sure. There is something heartwarming about him, a direct honesty in the performance which disarms even the most persistent cynicism. When Springsteen asks if anyone out there has ever lost their faith in love and receives back a roar of confirmation, the reflex grab for the sick bag is temporarily stayed; something hints that the man means it, that he is offering himself as a prize example of how to win through, to take all that life can throw at you and come through on the other side wiser and eventually happier. For several years it seemed as if the happily ensconced Springsteen - wife, two children - had settled for that connubial bliss and the occasional unheralded appearance in other people's low-profile gigs. But a brace of albums earlier this year kickstarted a world tour, complete with new band and a rebirth of the Springsteen fervour. Those fans who spent the entire Wembley concert on their feet, arms outstretched, mouthing every word of every song, and interspersing them with the ritual calls of 'B-r-o-o-o-c-e]', must have doubted that their time would ever come again. He is still a magnetic performer. The audience, starved of its hero for so long, was going to cheer him to the echo anyway, but the energy he expended and the intensity he created were prodigious. There is only one survivor from the E-Street Band in the new line-up and the sound seems crisper, more tailored than before; its neat lines and clean rhythms counterpoint Springsteen's rasping guitar. Of course the latest songs do trawl familiar territory. The old material has been recycled and sorted, retaining enough to satisfy the faithful. But it does not jar against the new, for they rely still on straightforward harmonic skeletons and clean-cut structures; the framework has to be robust enough to take the emotional freight that Springsteen loads upon it. It misfired very occasionally. The inevitable 'Born in the USA', second in the running order, was dutiful rather than electric (and surely too slow), and even that was immediately countered with storming versions of 'Local Hero' and 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'. Afterwards he scarcely missed a trick, nor an opportunity to deliver a wise homily to the audience. The ingredients in his special brew of hard rock, soul and gospel, were constantly refreshed and mixed anew, and the fans knew they had seen the rebirth of their hero. Wembley Arena. Further concerts July 9, 10, 12 and 13</p>

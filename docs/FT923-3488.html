			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: A tentative step towards a 'perfect marriage' - BBL is regarded as a vehicle for combining banking and insurance services It is probably stretching a point to compare the likely bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank, with the fight for Societe Generale de Belgique in the late 1980s. For one thing, Internationale Nederlanden Groep has built its 10 per cent stake in BBL under a regulatory regime which was strengthened considerably following the shock 1988 bid for La Generale by Mr Carlo De Benedetti. For another, the Dutch banking and insurance company, which yesterday indicated it was considering a formal bid, appears to have the backing of most of BBL's senior management. But the BBL affair does have some of the same volatile elements as the La Generale battle: a foreign bidder, the possibility of fierce opposition and an entrepreneurial figure who holds most of the keys to the outcome. In the La Generale bid the entrepreneur was Mr De Benedetti, an outsider, and, eventually, a loser. But in the case of BBL, it is one of Belgium's most powerful insiders: Mr Albert Frere, chairman and managing director of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the holding company which controls some 24 per cent of BBL. GBL and Mr Frere's influence cannot be overestimated. For example, thanks to a long-standing shareholder agreement, the holding company could actually thwart ING's offer before it has been launched - by buying the 6.72 per cent stake ING has been offered by Unipar of Italy. GBL is unlikely to exercise its right to buy, because if it did, the Belgian regulatory authorities would certainly force a bid for the rest of the bank. If anything, Mr Frere wants to reduce his stake. But GBL is not necessarily going to cave in to the Dutch. Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, GBL's deputy chairman and a BBL director, said yesterday the price - which values the group at BFr63bn (Dollars 2.16bn) - seemed unsatisfactory. GBL will reserve judgment on the bid until ING has had a closer look at the bank and launched a formal offer. That could take until the middle of next month, allowing time for other shareholders to put together alternative proposals. One possibility, which Mr Frere is thought to favour, is a link with Credit Communal, the credit institution jointly owned by all the municipalities and provinces of Belgium. However, if BBL's management continues to back an ING offer, such a deal would be difficult to justify. ING's announcement yesterday was based partly on the recommendation of the Banking Commission, Belgium's takeover authority, that a bid should be launched. But the Commission yesterday denied its advice was based on last month's landmark court ruling which helped establish the definition of 'control' in Belgian takeovers. In spite of the Commission's recommendation, ING has imposed several conditions on the bid. It wants to audit the BBL accounts - against the wishes of directors appointed by GBL, Royale Belge and Winterthur, the Swiss insurer - and will not go ahead with a full bid unless it can win more than 51 per cent of the bank. The Dutch group may have gone further than before in stating its intentions and seems to have a better chance of acquiring the bank than any other shareholder. For its part, ING regards BBL as the perfect vehicle to introduce 'bancassurance' - the combining of banking and insurance services in one company - into the Belgian market. With its 975 branches, BBL is seen as an attractive outlet for selling traditional insurance products to banking clients, mirroring what ING is trying to do in the Netherlands. Abroad, BBL is an interesting partner for ING because of its presence in Africa, a legacy of Belgium's colonial past. ING's subsidiary NMB Bank, which this week was renamed ING Bank, has built up a strong reputation in emerging markets and in trading in third-world debt. Yet until now ING has proceeded cautiously, fearful of political sensitivities in Belgium about one of the country's premier financial institutions falling into the hands of a Dutch concern from north of the border. ING was quick to say yesterday that if the takeover goes ahead, BBL will retain its identity and corporate culture while participating in the development of the Dutch group's overall strategy. The bancassurance concept was the driving force behind the creation of ING in early 1991, when Nationale-Nederlanden, the biggest Dutch insurer, merged with NMB Postbank, the Netherlands' third-largest bank, to create a broad financial services group. ING's intention has been to expand in Europe, and it has never disguised its interest in BBL. Nevertheless, news of the deal was met with some scepticism on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, where ING's shares fell to close at Fl 1.80 at Fl 42.2.</p>

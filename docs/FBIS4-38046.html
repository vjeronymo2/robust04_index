			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Avil Kumar Sharma: "Pakistan and the F-16 </F> Bombers"]    [Text] The recent US proposal to hand over the second lot  of 38 F-16 bombers to Pakistan without Islamabad first putting a  lid on her nuclear programs and accepting the international  security measures adds a new chapter in U.S. policy on the  nuclear non-proliferation treaty [NPT] in South Asia. Whereas  the U.S. attitude towards India is manifested by a variety of  pressures and proposed sanctions that are consistent, her  attitude towards Pakistan is fickle and often full of  contradictions. The latest U.S. enticement of Pakistan, whose  nuclear weapons program was chiefly nurtured by the feigned  indifference and inactivity of the U.S., is its move to suppress  and cover its despair in NPT matters by pressuring her protege.    During the cold-war, the U.S. indifference to Pakistan's  nuclear arms program was only a mask. This enabled arms to be  supplied continually to Afghan rebels in their uprising against  the USSR- supported government of Najibollah. This was also the  reason why despite the controversial information received  through CIA sources, the U.S. President continued to issue  "clean-chits" on Pakistan's nuclear program.    But the end of the cold-war signified a decline in the  importance of Pakistan for the U.S. The result being that the  White House at the end of October 1990, expressed its inability  to issue such chits. Consequently, all the military aid given  to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment provisions were  stopped. But contrary to even U.S. expectations, Pakistan  managed to meet all its defense needs in the last four years.    It appears that Pakistan is not likely to be trapped by this  U.S. enticement as she has her own problems. Even if Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto wants to, she cannot accept the U.S.  proposal as Pakistan's nuclear program is in the hands of the  military, with opposition leader Nawaz Sharif giving it a  political color. Prime Minister Bhutto perhaps would not like  to shatter the dreams of her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who  launched the nuclear program under any external pressure by  suspending it.    According to a report published in Washington, the U.S.  would  like to entice India together with Pakistan, to nab the former  in her policy trap. If India agrees to sign the nuclear NPT and  accepts the measures for international security proposed by the  U.S., the latter might extend her the following benefits.    (1) First, the U.S. could take the initiative by resuming to  supply fuel for the Tarapur Power Plant. It may be recalled  that after India's peaceful nuclear testing in Pokharan in 1974,  the U.S stopped supplying fuel for the plant in 1980-81 under  its policy of coercion and regulation of nuclear  nonproliferation. But, due to the (?determined) policy of  Indira Gandhi and her followers, and France as its alternative  supplier of Uranium U-235, India not only successfully ran the  plant, it also did not compromise on its nuclear policy.    (2) Also, an assurance could be given to soft peddle Super  301 measures. The U.S. has all along been threatening India  together with Japan and Brazil with imposing economic and trade  sanctions for their prohibitive business behavior under Super  301 rules. Any U.S. decision in this regard would prove  extremely important for India in her current weakened economy  because one-fifth of its total exports are consumed in the U.S.    (3) With the liberalization of U.S. rules on computer  imports, it may become possible for India to start exporting her  latest computers. After a recent liberalization, the U.S.  Department of Commerce allowed India to export computers of the  level of 500 MTOPAS. If the U.S. wants, it can raise this level  to 1000 MTOPAS, the limit it prescribes for other countries.  India's present quota is only 125 MTOPAS.    (4) Another concession is providing complete help to  Hindustan Aeronautics in manufacturing light bombers. The  cessation of aid from the U.S. firm, Marin Marietta, to Indian  scientists in design-development for advanced flight-control  systems could prove to be a great headache. But any ban on  General Electric engines by the U.S. could ground the whole  program till the Kaveri engine, which is still being produced by  the Gas Turbine Research Organization, is ready.    How far would these U.S. enticements to India like the F-16  bombers to Pakistan, serve U.S. economic interests? The basic  idea of resuming the supply of uranium and helping in the  manufacture of light bombers is to make India dependent on the  U.S. On the other hand, the supplies of the most modern  computers is also guided by demand. Computer technology is a  monopoly of the U.S. and Japan. The aim of the relaxation of the  U.S.-Japan computer monopoly is to remove hurdles in its  competition with Japan, which as a result the U.S. electronics  industry has so far suffered losses of $30 billion. India's  increased use of computers and the huge size of its market could  help compensate the U.S. favorably for this loss.    Like India and Pakistan, another victim of the  economic-interest-spurred by U.S. NPT policy is North Korea. By  blowing out of proportion North Korea's nuclear capability, the  U.S., on one hand, has been able to make its active role in  nuclear nonproliferation felt. On the other hand, by creating a  atmosphere of fear in South Korea, it has activated a market for  its weapons new and old. The recent supply of Patriot missiles  bear testimony to this assertion. Unhappy with the U.S.  decision to resume supplying F-16 bombers to Pakistan, the  Republican Senator from South Dakota and the author of the  Pressler Law, Gary Pressler, has perhaps rightly commented:  "Instead of adopting a responsible policy on NPT in South Asia,  the Clinton Administration appears to be conducting only the  sale of the military arms and junk brought out from the Pentagon  garage." Whether it is to restore the F-16 jets to Pakistan at  the cost of Pakistan's nuclear program or frightening the South  Koreans by magnifying the nuclear capability of North Korea and  thus ensuring the sale of her missiles to South Korea, the only  aim of U.S. policy is to use the NPT to enhance regional  imbalances, and as a cover to fan the demand for traditional  arms that has been dying after the end of the cold war. To the  U.S. this appears to be the only way to save its arms industry,  which has now fallen on bad times. To achieve this, the U.S.  can go to the extent of using the nuclear nonproliferation as a  weapon and it into cold storage in case it fails.    The Clinton Administration has not made a final decision on  Pakistan's F-16 jets. However, the views of the Assistant State  Secretary Robin Raphel in the context of the ineffectiveness of  the Pressler Amendment for achieving the NPT aims indicate that  the U.S. might restore its supply without any conditions, and  this should cause no surprise.    If the U.S. is really worried about the increasing number of  countries with nuclear capability, why does it not forgo its  business ruses and attempt to set a treaty that is acceptable to  all? Such a treaty should not only provide guarantees for  nonnuclear countries by prohibiting the use of force by nuclear  states, it should also provide for an early and systematic  destruction of their nuclear arsenals.</p>

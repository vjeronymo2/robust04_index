			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television In the late 1970s Tony Garnett, producer of Up The Junction and Cathy Come Home caused a furore when he produced Law And Order. Here was a (short) drama series which suggested that all was not perhaps quite as it should be with our law enforcement. Some policemen, it implied, might be a bit, er, bent. Mary Whitehouse and others produced a mass knee-jerk response of outraged indignation. How sweetly naive it all seems today after such widespread revelations of police corruption, and so many appalling cases of the wrong people being prosecuted (and persecuted) and imprisoned. High time for a series which looks at the way in which our police are allowed to investigate their own, ahem, shortcomings. Judging by the opening episode, Between The Lines (9.30 BBC1) has the authenticity of The Bill (not surprising since John Wilsher who wrote it previously did 30 episodes of that ITV series), the gritty bureaucratic detail of such modern police series as Waterfront and a bit, though for some viewers perhaps too little, of the wham-bam action we used to get in The Sweeney. This looks like being the best police series for a long time.</p>

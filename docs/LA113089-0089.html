			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA CAGER OUT FOR REPAIRS TO SHOOTING HAND  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount basketball team will go into this weekend's Gator Bowl  Tournament at Jacksonville, Fla., with one of its top guns, in the words of its  coach, being retooled.  </P> <P> Senior guard Jeff Fryer broke the fourth metacarpal in his right -- shooting --  hand (a bone near the thumb, not his ring finger as earlier reported), but  things could be worse.  </P> <P> It is hoped Fryer will be back in uniform before Oklahoma comes to town  Christmas week, and for a change Coach Paul Westhead has enough depth at guard  to consider several lineup variations.  </P> <P> Fryer led the nation in three-pointers while averaging 22.9 points as a junior  and is scoring 24.5 after two games this season. His hand was injured in  Saturday's 145-102 victory over Nevada Reno, with Fryer scoring 26 points and  four three-pointers. Westhead said, though, that Fryer's hard-nosed intangibles  may be missed more than his scoring.  </P> <P> "I told (the team) at practice somebody's going to have to take the shots, and  everybody smiled," Westhead said. "Then I added, 'And get the steals and the  dives and the hustle.' "  </P> <P> Luckily, Fryer has bounced back from previous injuries faster than expected. He  will miss this weekend's two tournament games and a Dec. 7 contest at U.S.  International. Depending on medical clearance, he could be back in uniform in  time to play a Dec. 16 exhibition against Athletes in Action. The Lions' Dec. 9  game against UC Santa Barbara is improbable, but not impossible.  </P> <P> "There's no exact timetable," Westhead said. "I know this -- whenever the  doctor says he can play, he'll be ready. He's not one of these guys who needs a  week to get back after he's given the OK. He's always been a quick healer,  physically and emotionally. He came back from the doctor's yesterday (Monday)  with a cast and ran around the outside of practice the whole time we were on  the floor. You hate to lose a guy like that."  </P> <P> Westhead, who was injured as a senior at St. Joseph's University, seemed to  feel worse for Fryer personally than for the loss to the team. "It's really a  shame. He's playing very, very well at this moment," Westhead said. "It's  doubly tough when you're a senior. Every day of practice, every game is  important to him -- and to us. It's something I really have empathy for. On the  plus side, hopefully it'll only be a two-week problem, not one of those  debilitating things that lingers for the whole year."  </P> <P> In Fryer's absence, Westhead has the option of starting junior Tom Peabody at  forward and shifting Bo Kimble back to guard or starting sophomore Terrell  Lowery in Fryer's place.  </P></p>

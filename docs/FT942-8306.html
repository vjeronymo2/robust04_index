			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (8): Islands in the sun - and ice / Offshore centres Tax havens, offshore centres, areas of low tax. Whatever the label, the times are getting tougher for the growing number of jurisdictions trying to lure corporations and high wealth individuals around the world. As small island economies around the world struggle to generate business and diversify from tourism or primary industry, they have sought the help of consultants to promote their attractions. The big accountancy firms have been well in evidence: Price Waterhouse advising Gibraltar, KPMG Peat Marwick helping Malta and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, for example. An unseemly struggle has developed between many centres, with glossy marketing brochures and international conferences on the rise. The Isle of Man is competing against the Channel Islands, and even the more sedate Jersey and Guernsey are at each other's throats, hiring public relations firms and holding presentations in London, Paris and other leading cities to gather potential business. Mr Patrick Way, an expert on offshore centres who is soon to be admitted to the tax bar, says: 'I do think it's fair to say that in the last 15 years there has been a shift with offshore centres becoming much more like companies trying to go out and get business. People travel much more easily now and are picking and choosing where to go.' Meanwhile, there has been an explosion in the number of centres and enormous flux in the range of tactics the centres have used in efforts to attract new business: introducing new products, amending tax legislation, diluting corporate disclosure and registration requirements. 'You can count the number of havens in three digits now,' says Mr Ian McDade of Price Waterhouse. 'It's become a pretty crowded market and very competitive.' Caroline Doggart, author of a regular survey of tax havens,* says that Campione, on the border of Switzerland and Italy, was the first tax haven when both nations abdicated their fiscal responsibility for the region. One of the most recent, designed to exploit existing tax treaties, is Labuan off Malaysia, while a reef, between Tonga and Fiji, has been mooted as the world's first underwater retreat] In between come a vast array of locations, generally in relatively tropical climes: Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands, and so on. There are also the colder environs: the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Falklands, Norway's Svalbard Islands and Ascension. Others are landlocked: such as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, or even Albania. However, Doggart also highlights less likely low tax areas, not least the UK, which remains a very attractive low-tax centre for non-residents, and the US compared with many European countries. Mr Roger White of KPMG Peat Marwick, says he draws 'a sharp distinction' between the less reputable centres and those such as the Channel Islands or Hong Kong with economies in their own right and a developed, sophisticated, responsible approach. He believes this two tier split will accentuate in the future. The problem is that the islands have become increasingly aggressive at a time when the demand is slowing down as a result of recession in many parts of the world. Mr John Fairley, partner in charge of the international tax group at Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'Clearly there is a greater need at the moment to get your cash back home.' Equally, he highlights a tightening up in the global network of tax treaties, increased cooperation by fiscal authorities around the world, and the growing use of controlled foreign corporation legislation to clamp down on companies using tax havens. In 1981, a report by Richard Gordon, special counsel to the US Internal Revenue Service, led to calls in the US legislature for a ban on flights to some of the more questionable offshore jurisdictions. In practice, the action taken by the US may have been less visible but it has proved at least as powerful, with the Internal Revenue Service taking an increasingly aggressive line on revising or simply tearing up existing tax treaties. One of the most significant such examples is the US-Dutch double taxation treaty. Initially drafted in 1948, it was one of the oldest in the industrialised world. It was the primary reason why the Netherlands appears consistently each year as the largest foreign investor in the US after Japan and Britain. Most such investment was in reality coming from other places, such as Hong Kong, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America, which had no treaty of their own with the US. This route saved them at least 20 per cent in taxes. The changes mean it has almost dried up. Reluctantly the Dutch agreed revised terms with the US last year under threat of otherwise losing the continuation of any agreement. Now the US has focused on other double tax agreements, including those with Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The risk among offshore centres is that rising competition will cause a flight from quality in regulation and disclosure. However, Ms Doggart suggests that the greater risk is that attempts by consultants to recommend changes in line with the more successful centres will simply lead to a lack of differentiation. She adds that, ironically, more business is coming to those centres - such as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man - which have toughened up their regulation, improving inspections and limiting entry. Ms Doggart is less concerned about the moral issues that may be involved in those seeking to place assets or base operations in offshore centres. 'I don't think morality comes into it, except when talking about drugs or money laundering,' she says. 'As long as there's not universal tax harmonisation, there will be havens.' * Caroline Doggart.

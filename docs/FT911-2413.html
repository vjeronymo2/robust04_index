			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Car makers are warned on security MR KENNETH BAKER, home secretary, told car manufacturers yesterday to improve vehicle security or face legislation. He told car makers to do more about the 'unacceptably high level' of car crime which, if unchecked, would lead to pressure for statutory action. Representatives of Citroen, Ford, Jaguar, Nissan, Peugeot Talbot, Renault, Rover, Vauxhall and Volvo were asked to report back to the Home Office in three months. Thefts from and of vehicles account for a quarter of all recorded crimes in England and Wales.</p>

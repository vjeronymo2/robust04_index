			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Juggernaut veers out of fast lane: Japan's auto industry is ill-prepared for such tough times Japanese carmakers are on the rack and the screws are still being tightened. After decades of virtually unbroken growth, vehicle production and sales in Japan are falling for an unprecedented third year in succession. While their US and European rivals are only too used to the cycles of feast and famine in world auto markets, the Japanese companies are having to learn to cope for the first time with a prolonged recession, and they are ill-prepared. During the overheated years of the bubble economy at the end of the 1980s, the Japanese over-indulged with an excess of new models and features. Ironically, the masters of lean production have put on weight, and they are learning that a forced diet is neither easy nor painless. Tomorrow Japan officially opens the doors of the biennial Tokyo motor show. Behind the scenes, the mood has changed significantly from the self-confident celebrations of 1991 and 1989, when the formidable array of new concept and production cars unveiled by Japanese producers threatened to engulf rivals from the US and Europe, prompting one visitor to call the 1989 show 'Apocalypse, Wow]'. Most of Japan's 11 vehicle makers are currently operating at a loss or, at best, around break-even in their car and commercial vehicle operations, says Mr Koji Endo, a leading automotive analyst at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, in Tokyo. The only producers that are still avoiding the spreading stain of red ink are Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki. Honda is spared only by the strength of its motorcycle and parts businesses - its car operations are also in loss, he says. Even Toyota, by far the strongest Japanese carmaker, is expected to fall into an operating loss for the first time in its history, in the six months to December, although its strong financial earnings will probably protect it from a net loss. Japan, the apparently unstoppable juggernaut of the world auto industry, has been forced off the road. For three decades Japanese production rose, from fewer than 500,000 vehicles in 1960 to 13.5m in 1990. The industry has survived previous world recessions with barely a blip. If the protected domestic market weakened, the heat was turned up in export markets. But this time, Japanese vehicle makers are facing a challenge of a different order. The length of the downturn in the domestic market is without equal. The old remedy of exporting their way out of trouble is not available, with many foreign markets also weak or deep in recession. Their competitiveness abroad has been battered by a savage appreciation in the value of the yen - of about 20 per cent against the US dollar this year alone. The era of cheap finance raised on Japan's stock and bond markets in the 1980s, which fuelled earlier growth, is past, but profit and loss accounts are now sagging under the hangover of depreciation from over-ambitious capital investments decided in the bubble economy years. The industry is suffering from serious overcapacity and a growing surplus of labour. It is staring at the unpalatable task of closing plants and shedding jobs. 'The Japanese automotive industry will go through a very painful period of restructuring,' says Mr Yoshikazu Kawana, an executive managing director of Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker and one of the world's top five, which is now facing its second successive year of heavy losses. 'We have always lived in a time of growth,' he explains. 'Now we are having to build a business structure without depending on an expansion in volume, without depending on growth. This concept has not been thought of in the past by Japanese industry.' Japanese carmakers apparently can see no end to the current decline. 'For the last three years market forecasters have been saying it would get better in six months,' says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, chief executive of Honda. But new car sales fell by 13 per cent in the past two years, and domestic registrations dropped a further 5.8 per cent, year-on-year, in the first nine months of 1993. There is little help to be gained from foreign markets - apart from in south-east Asia - in the face of the twin barriers of recession and trade conflicts. Vehicle export volumes have been in steady decline since 1985 - a trend that had been anticipated, as Japanese vehicle makers built up a firm foreign production base, with output abroad jumping from 600,000 vehicles in 1986 to almost 1.9m in 1992. In the second half of the 1980s the drop in exports was more than offset by the surge in domestic demand, but the Japanese motor industry miscalculated. The home market was not expected to go into free fall, and now the export safety valve is closed off. Europe has seen new car sales fall 16 per cent in the first nine months this year, and the European Community has forced a drastic cut in Japanese shipments to the EC under the present system of 'voluntary' monitoring of Japanese direct vehicle exports. In North America demand may be emerging in fragile fashion from recession, but unlike in previous decades there are no easy pickings. The US domestic industry is rejuvenated. After a string of heavy losses, the big three producers, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, earned net profits of Dollars 2.3bn in the second quarter of this year alone. The appreciation of the yen is forcing Japanese car producers to raise prices much more rapidly than their US rivals, undermining their competitiveness. They are losing market share - from 25.7 per cent of the US car and light truck market in 1991 to 23.3 per cent in the first nine months this year. Symbolically, at the end of 1992, the Ford Taurus displaced the Honda Accord as best-selling car in the US. The task of adjusting to the appreciation of the yen is not new, but the industry has been taken by surprise at the rapidity of the rise this year. Toyota calculates that its profits fall by close to Y10bn (Pounds 62.5m) for every Y1 rise against the US dollar. 'The problem is not the level of the yen appreciation but the speed,' says Mr Terukazu Inoue, Toyota managing director for product planning. Nissan faces one of the most serious restructuring challenges. It is suffering heavy losses and high overcapacity in Japan, just as it is in the process of moving further tranches of production abroad. Mr Kawana of Nissan says, however, that all producers will have to take the same actions sooner or later to reduce costs, lengthen model life cycles, lower employment, and close some plants. Other steps would involve: use of more common components in different model ranges. At Honda 60 per cent (by value) of the components of one of its most recent new models, the Domani, are taken from other existing ranges; reducing the number of different model variants. At Nissan one model was offered with 87 different varieties of steering wheel alone. It only needs 10, says Mr Kawana; increasing co-operation between vehicle makers. Loss-making Isuzu has abandoned making saloon cars. Instead, in Japan it will purchase cars from Honda for sale under its own badge. In return Honda is buying four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles from Isuzu for sale under the Honda badge. Nissan and Mazda are swapping some light commercial vehicles. Many of today's problems stem from the Japanese motor industry's original belief in its own propaganda about its lean production and development systems. 'We tried to meet too many customer needs, we started developing too many models in too small volumes,' says Mr Kawana. 'Now we must eliminate waste in the product development process and slim down.' Nissan calculates that it has an overcapacity of 400,000-500,000 vehicles a year in Japan. It announced that it would be forced to close one of its most famous plants, Zama near Tokyo, in 1995. Closures were previously unheard of. 'The auto industry had always enjoyed growth,' says Mr Kawana. 'To realise the industry had come to such a turning point was a shock . . . That was just the start.' In three years from 1993 to 1995 Nissan is cutting its workforce in Japan by 5,000 to 48,000. Honda is also cutting 10 per cent of its assembly line workers over five years; it has halved output on one assembly line; similar action could follow on a second; and it is transferring surplus car workers to its healthier motorcycle operations. Companies are carrying surplus labour because of Japan's system - until now  -of life-time employment. 'It is becoming an obstacle hindering the slimming down (of the industry). This is becoming a crisis now,' says Mr Kawana. If the currency problems persist, Honda will have to shift more production abroad in the long term, admits Mr Kawamoto of Honda, 'but we also have to secure employment here. It is a sensitive matter . . . The situation is still unpredictable, but we must prepare. In the longer term we have to reduce production in Japan. We are losing our power to sell from Japan.' Established management approaches are being overturned. The need to cut costs has forced the setting of 'simple, clear, speedy targets', says Mr Kawamoto. 'We are having to do this from the top down. It is very different from the traditional bottom-up Japanese systems.' Japanese carmakers are working feverishly towards meeting the targets they have set themselves. Their rivals in America and Europe, which have suffered the onslaught from Japan for so long, will gloat at their peril over Japan's present woes. Japanese carmakers' underlying productivity has still not been matched elsewhere, and the machine should emerge leaner and fitter from the present trials. It is making the task of restructuring the European motor industry even more awesome.  -------------------------------------------------              INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY    Pre-tax profits (year-on-year percent change  -------------------------------------------------               Component    Vehicle               suppliers    makers       Dealers  ------------------------------------------------- Number of companies        20           11         1,700  ------------------------------------------------- 1990-91          +3          -34           -37 1991-92         +26          -48           -43 1992-93          +1          -35           -30 1993-94         -28          -63           -25 forecast  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association  -------------------------------------------------</p>

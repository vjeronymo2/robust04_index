			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox set to reform raw sugar market THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) is expected to announce on Tuesday major changes to its raw sugar market. The present raw sugar contract might even be closed, to be replaced by one designed to prove more attractive to the London sugar trade. The Fox raw sugar market has suffered a dramatic slide in volumes over the past couple of years. Fox has tackled the problem, including experimenting with screen trading, but to no avail. Last month volume fell to just 1,399 lots compared with 4,384 lots in March last year. In January 1991, when raw sugar was switched to screen trading in a bid to boost volumes, the contract traded 120,176 lots. By December of that year volume had dwindled to 24,157 lots and in January 1992 the contract was taken off the screen and put back on the floor. By then, however, London traders were losing interest. The relatively young New York market, which attracts a lot of speculative money, has usurped London's role as sugar's international price setter. Some critics have blamed London's decline on the failed experiment in screen trading. Others point to a decision to make Cuban sugar deliverable in London, which ruled out US market players. Yesterday Fox said that Cuban sugar would no longer be deliverable. However, the fall in volumes has taken place against a background of changes in the underlying physical market over the past decade. The London raw contract was designed with British Commonwealth producers in mind. But now much more sugar comes out of the Far East and Latin America. At the same time the number of big traders in London has declined. Fox will keep its screen-traded white sugar contract, which is in competition with a similar contract on France's Matif. Last month Fox white sugar turnover totalled 38,395 lots, compared with 23,633 lots in March 1992. London's International Petroleum Exchange has reported a 37 per cent increase in volumes for the 1992-93 financial year to 11.9m contracts. Mr Peter Wildblood, chief executive, said yesterday that monthly volumes had exceeded 1m lots for the past six months and 'conservative commentators are confident that this trend will continue.'</p>

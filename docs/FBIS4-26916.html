			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Dongfeng] </F>   [Text] June 27, Jerusalem (XINHUA) -- The supreme court  commission's report on inquiry into the Hebron massacre has  drawn mixed reactions, with right-wing groups laughing and  left-wing movements dismayed over the too much leniency toward  Jewish settlers.    Almost with no exception, politicians on the left Sunday [26  Jun] decried the fact that the commission did not blame or  penalize the West Bank Jewish settlers.    The Meretz Party's Knesset (Israeli Parliament) faction  chairman Ran Cohen expressed "deep disappointment in view of the  commission's leniency toward the extremist settlers." "The  fact that they continue to do as they please in Hebron attests  to the failure of this commission," he said.    Another Meretz member of Knesset (MK) Dedi Zucker charged  that the commission only dealt with the massacre itself and not  with the conditions of occupation. It should have reached  conclusions about the occupation and the settlers, he said.    Mk Abdul Wahab Darawshe from the Democratic Arab Party  complained that the commission "was too easy on the settlers,  who are the villains here." He said the commission should  recommend disarming all the settlers immediately.    The commission released its report Sunday, stating that the  massacre on February 25 was "premeditated and carried out alone"  by Kiryat Arba settler Baruch Goldstein. Goldstein opened fire  and killed some 30 Muslim worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque  inside the Machpela cave of Hebron.    The report criticized the security forces who should have  been present inside the cave for failing to be there at the time  when the massacre occurred.    To upgrade security around the cave, the commission  recommended in the report a ban on Jewish settlers and soldiers  to enter the site with weapons.    It also recommended that security around and in the cave be  provided with special guard units.    Obviously, the opposition Likud Party and the National  Religious Party (NRP), which both advocate expanding settlement  in the occupied territories, were pleased Sunday with the  report's dealing with the settlers.    Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu said he was pleased that the  commission cleared the Jewish settlers of the responsibility for  the massacre "after they have been so maligned and vilified."    The NRP said that the report "totally removes the basis for  the unruly incitement against the settlers as a group who were  unjustly accused of being guilty collectively for an  individual's crime."    Jewish settlement leaders Sunday gave a partial sigh of  relief over the report. They were satisfied that blame was not  placed on the whole settlement community and that the commission  did not recommend restricting Jewish worship in the Machpela  cave.    Zvi Katsover, head of the Kiryat Arba local council, said  the  report was "much less harsh" than he expected, and said "a  weight has been taken off our shoulders."    Meanwhile, Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe said he accepted the  report's conclusion that Goldstein acted alone, but said he was  upset that the report did not mention the atmosphere in which  Goldstein committed his crime.    "The harassment by settlers continued for months or years  before, creating the atmosphere in which Goldstein committed his  crime," he said.    Peace groups in Israel, which expressed disappointment over  the report, have already renewed their calls for the removal of  Jewish settlements from Hebron. Among the 80,000 residents in  Hebron, 450 are Jewish settlers.    Nevertheless, the Israeli cabinet Sunday night accepted the  report's conclusions and recommendations.    Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has  pledged  to fully implement the recommendations.</p>

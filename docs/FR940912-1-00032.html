			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SOCMI is normally represented as a system of production stages that produce a wide range of organic chemicals from a set of 11 basic chemicals. The basic set of 11 chemicals is generated by refineries, natural gas plants, and coal tar distillation plants. Organic chemicals are produced at a wide range of facilities, from large facilities manufacturing a few chemicals in large volumes, to smaller facilities manufacturing many different finished chemicals in smaller volumes. Each of the production stages or ``process units'' may include any of several VOC emission sources, one of which is collection and treatment of wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three alternatives were considered for defining the affected facility in the NSPS. One option considered was to use a variation of the definition of source used in the HON, which is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the set of emission points in the organic HAP-emitting processes used to produce synthetic organic chemicals that are in a contiguous area under common control.'' Under this option of broadly defining the source for the NSPS, the affected facility would include all process units and associated process unit wastewater streams located at a plant with SOCMI process units. A second option considered was the narrow definition used in the NSPS for refinery wastewater (40 CFR part 60, subpart QQQ), which was ``(1) individual drain systems, (2) oil-water separators, and (3) aggregate facilities, which are defined as all process drains connected to the first common downstream junction box down to the receiving oil-water separator.'' The third and final option considered was ``each individual SOCMI process unit'' where each SOCMI process unit is defined as the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts that use or produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the chemicals listed in the NSPS applicability section. (A process unit can be operated independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The broader first option has been used previously by the EPA in an existing NESHAP (i.e., the HON) as the source definition for existing SOCMI facilities. (Note: Under the HON's new source provisions, new SOCMI process units are subject to the rule requirements under a more narrow source definition when specified conditions are met.) In that regulation, the definition was purposely chosen to be broad to include all emission points at any given site under the regulation. As stated earlier, a broad definition under an NSPS has a different effect. If an entire site is designated as the affected facility for an NSPS, existing sources only become subject to the NSPS if the entire site is modified or reconstructed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the second option, each piece of equipment in the wastewater collection and treatment system would be considered a unique or individual affected facility. This definition, which has a precedent in the refinery wastewater NSPS, is much narrower and more restrictive than the first option. In general, the narrower the definition of source, the more likely it is that changes to existing facilities will be deemed ``new sources'' under the Act. This definition would result in numerous sources within each SOCMI process unit, as well as numerous sources within the wastewater collection and treatment system, being classified as affected facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third option, that of considering each process unit as an affected facility, also has recent precedent. The standards for process wastewater components of the proposed pulp and paper rule (58 FR 66077, December 17, 1993) are structured such that the process unit is the affected facility, and controls are required for wastewater streams generated by these units. This approach is also consistent with the one taken in the HON for regulation of new SOCMI process units. Defining the affected facility on a process unit basis avoids the problems associated with having multiple individual collection and treatment system equipment components classified as affected facilities, and it also provides a definition sufficiently narrow in scope so as not to preclude the possibility that existing sources will become subject to the NSPS through the modification and reconstruction provisions. Most importantly, defining an affected facility as a process unit reflects industry construction practices. Almost all new construction, reconstruction, and modification in the SOCMI is carried out by process unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

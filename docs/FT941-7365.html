			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Commons committee members ask for Pergau letters Members of the Commons foreign affairs committee are asking the government to release two confidential letters which outline why Mr John Major gave the final approval for a Pounds 234m package of government aid for the Pergau Dam, James Blitz writes. The letters, written by Sir Charles Powell, a former adviser both to Mr Major and Baroness Thatcher, could shed light on why the government continued with the aid project in spite of vehement objections from Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration. The letters came to light in a memorandum written to Sir Timothy in spring 1991 by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd said he had 'considered carefully' Sir Tim's arguments but had concluded that 'we should support the project'. Another document, a protocol signed in March 1988 by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, expressly links the provision of aid to the Malaysian government with a projected arms deal. Malaysia received more money under the British government's Aid and Trade provision scheme last year than any other country except China, the Foreign Office revealed yesterday. In a parliamentary answer, the Foreign Office said Malaysia received Pounds 17.798m in 1992-93.</p>

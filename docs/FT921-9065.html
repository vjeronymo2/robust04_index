			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commission fends off attacks on spending plans THE European Commission yesterday defended its proposal to increase EC spending by a third by 1997 as 'balanced and coherent', and suggested a special summit in April to approve the plan, if the British election was over by then. These confident claims from the Commission contrasted with the reaction from most member states, particularly the biggest actual or potential net contributors to the EC budget. German diplomats in Brussels noted that Bonn's finances were now under greater pressure than in 1988 when it agreed to shoulder the lion's share of the current EC five-year financing plan. Britain and France, the other two net contributors, would see their contributions rise - by around Ecu1bn (Pounds 710m) for Britain, say UK officials. Italy, hitherto a net beneficiary from the EC, is set for 'a bitter awakening', according to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, one of Italy's EC commissioners. Mr John Major,the UK prime minister, yesterday added to criticism of the proposed increases, saying there was already scope for raising further money under existing arrangements. The prime minister told parliament: 'There is already scope for significantly increased expenditure within the existing 'own resources' ceiling.' The fate of the Commission plan to increase spending from Ecu66.6bn to Ecu87.5bn over the next five years will become clearer when EC foreign ministers discuss it on March 2. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, wants the Portuguese presidency of the EC to call a special 'budget' summit in April. Lisbon has baulked at this, reckoning so early a summit would fail. Commission officials do not privately contest this prediction, but say EC leaders need a first stab at the problem to achieve final success at the Lisbon summit in June. In place of the periodic rows over how much to give the Community, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, yesterday suggested an EC tax, whose receipts would go automatically to Brussels. But no state backed this idea when the Commission raised it last year. Current EC spending is skewed towards agriculture, while revenue is drawn disproportionately from countries where consumption is high in relation to wealth. Britain, with a relatively small farm sector but high consumption (as measured by its value added tax base), is doubly hit. Its net contribution would be Ecu5bn this year (more than half Germany's) were it not for its rebate, negotiated in 1984 and reconfirmed in 1988. This rebate, which returns to London two-thirds of the difference between most of the UK's EC payments and receipts, brings the UK net contribution down to Ecu3bn in 1992.</p>

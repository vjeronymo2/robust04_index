			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2025, these savings are calculated to be 17.0 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 2,739,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 1.47 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 1,450 million tons, or 1.44 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 2.4 years for the representative class and no more than 5.3 years for any class. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $30 for the representative class. Additionally, the standard is expected to increase both the short- and long-run prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 15.5 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> h. Television Sets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range of standard levels for color television sets. Table 4&hyph;17 presents the efficiency levels that have been selected for analysis. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis. For level 3, the annual energy use in kWh per year can be expressed as E=20.5+6.1D, where D equals the screen size in inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,i1,s200,10,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 4&hyph;17._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Standard Levels Analyzed for Television Sets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [Annual energy use] <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Product class  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Standard levels_KWH/YR  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Baseline  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 21  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 22  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 23 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 19~ <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;/20 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; color TV sets  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 205  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 184  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 171  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 138.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by reducing standby power usage to 2 watts; level 2 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing standby power to 2 watts and by reducing the white and black screen power each by 6 watts; level 3 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing the standby power to two watts, white screen power to 73 watts and black screen power to 41 watts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2.

Standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s25,7 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 4&hyph;18._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Payback Periods of Design Options for Television Sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [In years] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Standard level  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Payback period <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.1 2  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.2 3  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Significance of Energy Savings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new television sets under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996 <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> 2030, the following energy savings would result for each:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> Level 1_0.52 Quad Level 2_1.28 Quads Level 3_3.13 Quads <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Economic Justification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $2.15; to meet levels 2 and 3 the manufacturers' cost increases are $3.65 and $10.25, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.4. At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases are $3.76, $6.39 and $19.37 for standard levels 1 <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> 3, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $1.81, standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.95 and standard level 3 by $5.71. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for television sets show that the prototypical manufacturer has a negative return on equity of 1.9 percent in the absence of standards and that standards cause slight but further reductions in both short- and long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to produce negative short-run return on equitys of 2.0 percent, 2.0 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. Long-run return on equitys are projected to be negative 1.9 percent, 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>
